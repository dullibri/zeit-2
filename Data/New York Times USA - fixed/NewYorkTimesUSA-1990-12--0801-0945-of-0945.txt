HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Amid the Slump in Housing, A Rally in Builders' Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Housing starts are at their lowest levels since 1982, and home builders are suffering, with bankruptcies expected among the weakest of them. There is talk of a real estate bust that in magnitude will rival the post-World War II boom.
But, in the face of that stream of bad news, the stock prices of home builders are rising sharply. In the last month, an index of shares of home building companies has climbed 28 percent. Many investors, it would appear, do not believe the gloomiest of the forecasts. 
 The rise in prices has an obvious explanation. Interest rates are coming down, as the Federal Reserve tries to end the recession that most economists say began some time this year. Lower interest rates traditionally presage a revival both in building and in buying, but housing starts have lagged and the general consensus is that they will continue to do so, as prices fall and scared banks hold off from making mortgage loans.
"Quarterly earnings will be awful," said Barbara Allen, the housing analyst at Kidder, Peabody, referring to profits for both the current quarter and for the first three months of 1991. She added that some privately held builders were likely to be forced into bankruptcy.
But she said that by spring, home buying is likely to rise, and the stock prices of the leading public companies will take off. She is recommending every home builder she follows.
The prices of most housing stocks bottomed at the end of October, but did not start to rally rapidly until a month later. The upturn has been led by some of the largest home builders, especially those with solid balance sheets.
Such companies are the ones most likely to benefit from an increase in demand simply because they still have access to the banks and can get credit to step up building, Ms. Allen said in an interview yesterday.
"The money may not be available to most of their competitors," she said, noting that the decline in credit availability began in the second quarter of this year for most builders, as regulators put pressure on banks to mark down problem loans and improve the quality of new loans.
Even with the fall in construction, Ms. Allen said, most major builders will show profits for the current quarter, although the earnings will be sharply below those of a year ago.
The Lennar Corporation, a major builder in Florida, has been the star performer since Oct. 29, when an index of home building stocks bottomed at 48 percent of its level at the start of 1990. Lennar shares are up 75 percent since then, although the price fell 37.5 cents, to $16.375, yesterday.
Florida's housing market has suffered as the recession in the Northeast makes it more difficult for people there to sell homes and buy new ones in Florida. But Ms. Allen noted that Lennar has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with debt making up only 29 percent of capital at the end of the third quarter.
Lennar, like almost every other builder, continues to sell well below book value, which is almost $27 a share in Lennar's case. The bearish case has held that book values will come down as home builders are forced to write down the values of unsold houses and, most importantly, the value of real estate awaiting development. But share buyers evidently have decided that risk is worth taking.
The index, which includes 10 home builder stocks and is weighted by market capitalization, is up 41 percent since Oct. 29, but is still off 31 percent since the end of last year.
The second-best market performer has been the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, the largest builder of houses in California, which slipped 12.5 cents, to $9.25, yesterday but has risen 64 percent since the index bottomed. Other stellar performers over the period, both up more than 50 percent, are the Ryland Group and the Centex Corporation.
In the 1981-82 recession, Ms. Allen noted, the best time to buy housing stocks was just as the trend in housing construction, measured on a year-over-year basis, turned up. Such a turn may have occurred in November, when housing starts were reported at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13 million units. That was 16 percent below the level of the previous November, but it was up from October's rate of 1.03 million, which was off 27 percent from a year earlier.
The rapid rise of the stocks recently would seem to indicate a belief on the part of buyers that this recession will not be that different from previous ones and that the Federal Reserve's efforts to force down interest rates will succeed in reviving the economy before too much damage is done. And the buying is a bet that the speculation in land and housing prices did not drive prices so high that the pain from the drop in prices has only just begun.

HEADLINE: Couples Honor Commitment With Gifts to Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Several weeks after their engagement party, Michelle Flacks and Steven Rosenbaum sent $57 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "We don't need much to live on," the two wrote. "We've already got each other."
The couple, who live in the Bronx, said they had received such lovely gifts that they "had to share their good fortune with others whose need is so much greater." In their letter to the fund, they wrote that they hoped their gift would start a long tradition of giving to charity. 
 For many couples beginning life together -- as well as for those who have celebrated their golden anniversaries -- a contribution to the Neediest Cases honors the commitment that a husband and wife have to each other by sharing with those who are less fortunate.
The 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases began last month. The proceeds are distributed to seven charities to aid the sick and the poor. All of the campaign's overhead costs are paid by The New York Times.
 
'An Important Symbol'
 Among the more than 4,500 organizations and people who have donated to the fund this year are dozens who see it as the perfect wedding or anniversary present. In several interviews, donors said that a gift to charity, which expresses the ability to think of others, is an ideal symbol of the love that two married people hold for one another.
Lisa Limpel-Sander, 31 years old, and her husband Elliot, 34, of Forest Hills, Queens, decided to donate to the Neediest several months after he proposed to her over hot chocolate in a lodge in upstate New York. The first gift that the couple received -- a check for $75 -- was passed along to the fund.
"The gift came out of the blue from a close friend, and it was an important symbol for us," Mrs. Limpel-Sander said in a telephone interview yesterday. "We wanted to infuse the tone of our marriage with the spirit of giving."
Both of the Sanders work in New York City -- she as a lawyer and he as a deputy commissioner for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. They are well aware of the city's problems with poverty. They said their engagement had made them feel more strongly about giving something back to the city in which they were raised.
"When you love somebody, you learn about focusing outward," Mrs. Limpel-Sander said. "It is a natural extension of that love to want to express the feeling beyond your husband or wife, but also to friends and to the community."
 
'Give Something Back'
 Another donor, Leslie Van Orsdel Eddy, 30, said her recent gift of $50 was an extension of her wedding vows. She and her husband, John, 31, were married in Greenwich, Conn., in May, and she said they had chosen readings from the Bible that talked about concern for others -- not "mushy stuff" about love.
"We felt that the marriage was not just about us," she said. And in the letter attached to their gift, the couple wrote: "Life has given us so much -- we'd like to give something back, however small. In this, our first year of marriage, we're trying to establish life patterns of service to others."
Not all of the presents honoring marriage were from newlyweds.
Dorothy Anger sent $100 to honor the 50th anniversary of her parents, Henry and Shirley Goldberg of Merrick, L.I.
"They have been blessed with so much throughout their married life -- both materially and spiritually," Ms. Anger, 48, wrote. "I would like to think that this gift in some way will allow them to share those riches with someone of less fortune."
Ms. Anger said she had personally given to the Neediest Cases for decades but that this year she was inspired by the love between her father, 91, and her mother, 81.
"This gift represents the fullness in their life and the hope that it can be passed along to someone else," she said.

HEADLINE: Start of Recession at Issue

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The National Bureau of Economic Research said today that it would probably identify a month between June and September 1990 as the beginning of a recession.
The private research organization is used by the Government as the official arbiter of dates for peaks and troughs in the business cycle. 
 The bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee conferred in a conference telephone call on Friday, after several of the committee's members suggested that a recession had already begun.
One committee member, Geoffrey Moore, director of international business cycle research at Columbia University, had said he believed a recession started in June.
But another committee member, Victor Zarnowitz, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Chicago, said in an interview that opinion was divided among the seven committee members as to when a recession had begun.
Based on third-quarter gross national product statistics, Mr. Zarnowitz said, a recession did not appear to have started in the third quarter. But monthly economic data pointed to a downturn beginning then, he said. Annualized G.N.P. growth registered 1.4 percent last quarter.
Mr. Zarnowitz said committee members agreed that in all likelihood, a recession had begun, but they were not absolutely sure. The dating committee is unlikely to confer again before the release of fourth-quarter G.N.P. data on Jan. 25, he said.
The bureau defines a recession as "a recurring period of decline in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year and marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
SHIP WITH IRAQ AID IS SEIZED OFF OMAN

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 26

 BODY:
An Iraqi cargo ship carrying more than 50 self-described pacifists and tons of food bound for Iraq was seized in the Arabian Sea early this morning after crew members tried to grab the weapons of a boarding party made up of American and Australian sailors, Defense Department officials said.
The incident near the Omani island of Masira appeared to be the most serious to result from the international blockade imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
 A group, the Arab Women's Union, organized the trip more than a month ago, saying its aim was to deliver milk and medicine to Iraqi children suffering as a result of the embargo.
Pentagon officials said the American sailors had to use stun grenades, which emit smoke and a loud blast, to restore order on the 11,300-ton Iraqi vessel, the Ibn Khaldoon.
 
Crewmembers Lunge for Arms
 The Pentagon said no one was seriously hurt in the scuffle, although the ship's captain had initially asserted that a Swedish woman asserted that she had suffered a heart attack and that two Iraqi women traveling on the ship said they had miscarriages as a result of the incident.
American officials said a Navy doctor boarded the Iraqi vessel this morning and determined that the Swede suffered from a chronic heart problem and did not require emergency care and found no evidence that the two Iraqi women had miscarried or were otherwise seriously hurt.
At a news conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, a Pentagon spokesman, Lieut. Col. Gregg Pepin, said the ship, which had a crew of 42, stopped only after shots were fired across its bow.
When a boarding party landed on the ship by helicopter and moved toward the pilothouse, several unarmed members of the ship's crew lunged for the weapons carried by American sailors, Colonel Pepin said.
 
Medical Supplies Found
 One of the American or Australian sailors then fired his gun into the air as a warning, while comrades threw the stun grenades to restore order, according to the account.
Pentagon officials said the ship was found to be carrying tons of rice, milk, sugar and cooking oil, all of which are prohibited for export to Iraq under the United Nations embargo. It also carried what one Pentagon official described as "a relatively small amount of medical supplies" for Iraq. Medical supplies are exempted from the United Nations sanctions.
After the boarding, the ship's master agreed to unload his cargo at the port of his choice outside Iraq, a Navy spokesman said.
The passenger list was not available, and it was not clear whether all of the 250 passengers reported to be aboard the Ibn Khaldoon were associated with the Arab Women's Union.

HEADLINE: Prices for Oil Climb Above $27 as Threat of War Grows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices posted their biggest gains in three weeks yesterday, rising above $27 a barrel on increasing fears of war in the Middle East.
Contracts for home heating oil, unleaded gasoline and natural gas also rose sharply in subdued New York Mercantile Exchange trading after a four-day Christmas weekend. 
 Crude oil for February delivery rose $1.30, to $27.22 a barrel. It was the biggest single-day gain since a $1.51-a-barrel jump on Dec. 4.
 
Off in 3 Previous Sessions
 Oil market strategists said increasing tension between the United States and Iraq since the market closed last Friday, after three straight daily declines, helped to lift prices.
"I think the market is starting to reinternalize the fact that war seems very, very likely at this point," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said yesterday that the American Army would be defeated in any war because it does not have "right on its side."
In an interview on Mexican television, Mr. Hussein also said he would not allow the United States to set a date for talks. The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
The Navy said that American sailors, backed up by sailors from other nations enforcing a United Nations trade embargo, fired warning shots yesterday when crew members and passengers on an Iraqi cargo ship tried "to hold the boarding party members back and grab their weapons." Traders said other American and British reports also increased the prospects for war.
"All those things underscore what people are fearing: They're not moving any closer to any resolution by Jan 15," said Randall K. Rothenberg, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds.
The market discounted the importance of an Israeli newspaper report -- later denied by the State Department -- that a date for talks had been set.
The oil market opened sharply higher, following the gains in trading in London on Monday after Mr. Hussein threatened to attack Israel first if Iraq were a target.
Volume yesterday was light, however, with less than half the usual number of crude oil contracts changing hands, traders said. Contracts for delivery in later months rose.
 
Oil Products Also Advance
 Traders last week sold contracts to hedge against sudden changes in the gulf situation over the holiday weekend. In addition, traders said a belief that diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis might bear fruit had depressed crude oil prices in recent weeks.
If war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, oil prices are expected to rise sharply because of anticipated limited supplies from the region.
Technical factors and cold weather around the country pushed up home heating oil futures prices.

HEADLINE: A Big, Sprawly Bank Shapes Up

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Earlier this month, Marvin Davis, the oilman turned stock speculator, wrote to the management of First Interstate Bancorp. Demanding that the company shape up or put itself up for sale, he said First Interstate's shareholders were distressed with the company's "deteriorating financial condition and results of operations over the past few months."
The only problem with Mr. Davis's message was its timing. First Interstate still has a host of problems, and its depressed stock price may yet attract an unwanted takeover bid. But rather than deteriorating in recent months as many other banks have, the company has shown signs of a turnaround under its new chairman, Edward M. Carson. 
 By shrinking First Interstate from $59 billion in assets to $53 billion, raising money in a stock offering earlier this year and retaining earnings, First Interstate has substantially improved its capital position. Its level of bad loans and real estate on which it has foreclosed is declining although still high. The company stopped borrowing money in the form of commercial paper and has instead raised more in the form of stable deposits. And unlike last year, the company has been profitable every quarter this year, thanks in part to the absence of any huge write-downs from problem loans.
"We see a slow but steady pattern of improvement developing," said Thaddeus Paluszek, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. "We are not saying the company is totally out of the woods. But dealing with the problems will in my opinion be manageable, and we are not expecting more of the kinds of huge loan-loss provisions that have battered earnings and shattered investor confidence."
Mr. Carson, 61 years old, who has spent his entire career with First Interstate, succeeded Joseph J. Pinola as head of the company on June 1. Mr. Pinola built First Interstate into the nation's 10th-largest bank holding company through acquisitions in the West and Southwest, including an ill-timed push into Texas in 1988 that has plagued it ever since.
The company Mr. Pinola built has the tremendous advantage of having more than 1,000 retail branches spread through 14 states, giving First Interstate the ability to raise vast sums at relatively low cost in the form of consumer deposits.
But its network of banks has also been hobbled by inefficiencies, with many of the bank subsidiaries having little more in common with their counterparts in other states than the First Interstate name. And geographic sprawl has proved more a curse than a blessing for the company in recent years; while its fortunes have not been tied to the economy of any one state, they have suffered from problems in Texas and Arizona and are now threatened by a downturn in California.
Mr. Pinola began the process of mopping up the mistakes and transforming First Interstate, as industry executives put it, from a company of banks into a banking company. But it is Mr. Carson who must prove the company can live up to its potential.
 
Moves in Recent Months
 In recent months, Mr. Carson has started or accelerated moves to cut First Interstate's costs, trim the company's size, root out and deal with bad loans, force the bank subsidiaries to work more closely with each other and build capital, which is the financial buffer against losses.
After losing $124.5 million last year, primarily because of huge reserves it was forced to set aside to account for troubled loans in Texas and Arizona, First Interstate has been steadily profitable this year, with net income of $377.7 million through the first three quarters.
The level of capital -- tangible common equity as a percentage of assets -- rose to 3.89 percent in the third quarter, from 2.45 percent in the fourth quarter last year. And nonperforming assets -- loans not being repaid and foreclosed real estate -- fell to $1.88 billion in the third quarter, from $2.21 billion a year earlier.
Even so, earnings are still being held down by the level of problem loans and foreclosed real estate. The company calculates that the $1.9 billion of bad loans and real estate on its books costs it $700 million a year in administrative and carrying costs and forgone interest income.
First Interstate's share price, which had been sliding for a year, plummeted this summer along with other bank stocks, reflecting worries about the national economy and weakening real estate markets, but it has since recovered. [It closed Wednesday at $25.125, down 25 cents but up from its low several months ago of $15.625. That increase is larger than the gains of most other major bank stocks since the summer.]
Mr. Carson has won a degree of grudging praise from First Interstate's largest institutional shareholders, many of whom have grown hostile to the Los Angeles-based company over the years as repeated promises of improvement were followed by further shocks like last year's big loan-loss provisions.
"Carson seems to be doing a pretty good job under the circumstances," said John B. Neff, who manages the Windsor Fund, a major holder of First Interstate shares.
The question, analysts say, is whether Mr. Carson can improve First Interstate's bottom line and stock price sufficiently and fast enough to avoid a revolt among the company's largest shareholders that would lead to a sale of the company. The company's biggest holders include Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged-buyout firm, which owns just under 10 percent, and Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, the Wall Street investment house, which owns just over 10 percent.
So far those institutions have been patient. But as Donald K. Crowley, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., put it, the heavy concentration of stock in the hands of a few owners is "gasoline spilled around waiting for a match." Analysts said the letter from Mr. Davis, who has not disclosed his stake in the company, was clearly an attempt -- so far unsuccessful -- to muster support from other big holders for a sale of the company.
 
Question of Time
 "I see a proactive effort on the part of Carson and the people around him to work down existing problems and deal with any new ones up front," Mr. Crowley said. "The real issue is whether they will be given enough time. There are a lot of discontented shareholders around who have held that stock for a long time."
In recent years there has been widespread speculation that one of the other major California banking companies -- the Security Pacific Corporation, Wells Fargo & Company and even the BankAmerica Corporation, which Mr. Pinola tried and failed to acquire four years ago -- might be interested in an acquisition of all or part of First Interstate. But Mr. Carson probably has a little breathing room because the other big banks are preoccupied with their own problems as the economy slows, real estate markets crumble and regulators get tougher.
"Now is not a very good time to break up First Interstate," Mr. Neff said.
 
The Immediate Wild Card
 The immediate wild card in the company's future is the California economy, and specifically the ability of homeowners and commercial and residential real estate developers to weather a downturn. Mr. Carson has been warning since this summer that First Interstate's loan troubles would grow if the situation deteriorated substantially in California, which is by far the company's biggest market.
"But we don't see a major hit like Arizona," Mr. Carson said, referring to the big write-down on loans in that state last year. "We think all of our credit problems are manageable."
In an interview at the company's headquarters here, Mr. Carson did not rule out being interested in a merger offer, although he said one was unlikely in the current environment. For now, he said, "We need to sort out those things that are truly making us money and those that are not, to sort out those work procedures that might have worked in another era but that today are inefficient."
 
Effort to Improve Efficiency
 Because the company's bank subsidiaries are all separately chartered and must adhere to different state laws and regulatory requirements, the network will never operate as efficiently as if it were a single bank. But Mr. Carson has been pushing harder to eliminate duplication of management and back-office functions and to encourage heads of subsidiaries to take more responsibility for the performance of the entire corporation.
One example is the company's data-processing operations. First Interstate previously operated nine data-processing centers, each with its own computers, operating systems, budgets and staffs. The company is now paring the number to two, hoping to save $40 million annually.
Mr. Carson has also eliminated some layers of corporate management and pushed more responsibility to executives in subsidiaries. The banks in Montana and Idaho now report to the bank in Washington State rather than to corporate headquarters. The First Interstate bank in Oklahoma reports to the bank in Texas.
At the same time, Mr. Carson has made the chief executives of the six largest banks in the system members of a corporate management committee, with their compensation tied both to the performance of their banks and to that of the company as a whole.

HEADLINE: Pacific Telesis Quits Real Estate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Pacific Telesis Group announced yesterday that it was leaving the real estate business and would take a $60 million after-tax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to offset expected losses on property sales.
The decision is the latest recognition of losses by a regional Bell company that diversified into industries very different from the provision of local telephone service, only to find that its new investments were far more vulnerable to an economic slowdown. 
 "What it shows is they ought to stay at home, ringing up the revenues from local telephone service," said Jack B. Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber.
 
Plan to Invest Proceeds
 Pacific Telesis will sell its entire $475 million portfolio of office buildings and industrial sites over the next several years and invest the proceeds in telecommunications services, particularly wireless telephone businesses overseas, Gerald A. Beatty, a company spokesman, said. The company had said in March that it would not invest any more money in real estate and would begin reducing its holdings gradually.
Mr. Beatty said Pacific Telesis now believed it could earn better returns in telecommunications than in real estate.
The BellSouth Corporation disclosed on Dec. 7 that it had taken a $30 million loss on the sale of its computer-leasing business. The Bell Atlantic Corporation announced on Oct. 26 that it would take a onetime charge of $40 million to reflect the shrinking market value of its non-telephone financial services, which include equipment leasing and lending to other companies and real estate projects.
U S West Inc. said earlier this year that it would seek to sell its $1.4 billion real estate portfolio within five to seven years. Poor returns on investment and volatility in the real estate market prompted the decision, Sharon K. Price, a company spokeswoman, said.
Although no charges against earnings have been taken, the weakening economy is now making it hard to sell the properties, she said, so that it may take more than seven years to sell them all.
"It looks like we'll be in the landlord business for a while," Ms. Price added.
 
Structure Has Changed
 A few Wall Street analysts, notably those at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, have been warning that the local telephone business is much more vulnerable to setbacks now than in previous economic downturns. The structure of the telephone industry has changed, and the seven regional Bell companies, which were created by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, have invested in a variety of industries that offer potentially higher returns than traditional local phone service, but are also more risky.
More local phone concerns, like the New York Telephone Company, are charging customers by the call or by the minute of calling, instead of charging a fixed rate for unlimited calling. Some analysts warn that while very few consumers disconnected their phones to save money during previous recessions to save money, they may forgo some local calls in the next economic downturn to trim their phone bills.
A third of the regional Bell companies' revenues now consists of fees from long-distance carriers for carrying calls from customers' homes and businesses to the nearest long-distance switching center. The number of long-distance calls has historically been more sensitive than the number of local calls to the health of the nation's economy, so that these revenues may grow very slowly in a downturn.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise Slightly in Sluggish Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks moved slightly higher in the wake of stronger bond prices and lower interest rates yesterday, as traders ignored the biggest gain in oil prices in three weeks.
In the stock market, activity picked up a little but remained sluggish because many buyers and sellers were taking a long holiday. Program trading continued light. 
 Food, drug and utility stocks were strong, while technology stocks were mixed.
Oil shares advanced strongly after George F. Friesen, oil analyst for the Deutsche Bank Capital Group in New York, was quoted as forecasting that fourth-quarter profits at Chevron, British Petroleum, Phillips Petroleum, Texaco and Unocal would "more than double."
Asked why Texaco was so strong -- it had jumped 2 1/4 at one point during the day -- Constantine Fliakos, oil analyst for Merrill Lynch, said he thought the profit forecast was "very conservative."
Blue-chip stocks, as represented by the Dow Jones industrial average, advanced 15.84 points, to 2,637.13. But in the broader market only 774 stocks were ahead and 639 declined. Smaller stocks, as represented by the Nasdaq composite index, slipped slightly, by 0.01, to 372.40.
 
Volume at 78.73 Million Shares
 Post-holiday trading rose to a weak 78.73 million shares, from 57.2 million the day before Christmas, when trading ended two hours early for the first time since 1975.
Thirty-six stocks fell to new lows, while 11 rose to new highs.
Three of the 10 most-active Big Board stocks yesterday were oil shares, with Exxon climbing 1/2, to 51 3/4, and Texaco rising 1 3/4, to 60 1/2. Mesa Limited Partnership fell 1/8, to 2 5/8, a little more than a week after Seagull Energy called off a $350 million deal to buy natural gas properties when it failed to get financing.
Chevron rose 2, to 73 1/4, partly after Pennzoil, which already owns 9 percent, said the Internal Revenue Service had extended its tax deadline to buy more until May 31. Pennzoil, which rose 1 3/8, to 65, is using the proceeds from its 1988 lawsuit against Texaco to buy the stock.
British Petroleum advanced 1, to 76 5/8; Phillips 5/8, to 26 7/8, and Unocal 3/8, to 27 3/8.
ARCO rose 1 7/8, to 124 3/8; Mobil 1 1/8, to 58 1/4; Burlington Resources 1, to 38 1/8, and Oryx Energy 7/8, to 36 1/2.
With oil prices down from their levels during the fall, despite yesterday's increase, transportation stocks edged a little higher, with UAL rising 2, to 115, although it had jumped to 117 earlier in the day. UAL said it had not announced anything and knew of nothing to account for the gain.
Tiffany slid 4 3/8, to 37 1/4, after reporting an 8 percent holiday sales gain. David Williamson of Advest cut his earnings estimate, saying Wall Street had expected a 15 percent rise.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that one lone selling wave late in the session cut the Dow blue chips a little more than 2 points.
Except for a brief drop in the first hour, the Dow rose briskly for most of the day, with bargain hunters pushing the market ahead more than it might if trading activity were heavier. By 2:47 P.M., and for the next 16 minutes, program selling helped move the market lower.

HEADLINE: Korean Entrepreneurs Find Their Dream Is Tarnishing

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Amid glistening greens and pyramids of produce in the small store in Flushing, Queens, that he hoped would insure his family's prosperity, Sun Yong Back assesses a future that has suddenly dimmed. The odds seem as long as his workdays.
As New York City's economy turned anemic, he says, his sales have dropped by more than 30 percent. Taxes are rising. He missed last month's rent. Mr. Back is holding on, but his time, if not his resolve, seems limited. 
 In the last decade, Koreans like Mr. Back opened stores of every description in virtually every city neighborhood, includingsome forsaken by other merchants, becoming emblems of a new immigrant entrepreneurialism.
But now, business leaders and shopkeepers say, the Korean commercial empire in New York is faltering, and Mr. Back and others talk about moving to the suburbs or to California or even back home. The business leaders say the slump is made worse by sometimes unsympathetic landlords, insensitive politicians, high taxes and oppressive regulations, but the troubles are also at least partly a consequence of Koreans' past success, since their aggressive expansion in the 1980's has in many places pitted one Korean merchant against another.
As they branched out from fruit andvegetable stands to fish stores, dry cleaners, liquor stores, nail salons and a dozen other kinds of businesses, the number of Korean-owned stores is thought to have reached a peak of about 10,000 three years ago. There are no authoritative statistics, but B. J. Sa, secretary general of the Korean Association of New York, estimated that there are perhaps 7,500 Korean-owned stores in the city now, although some put it higher.
"The Korean-American community here is now in trouble," said Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York, which has an office around the corner from Mr. Back's store in Flushing.
All types of businesses seem to be slumping, from delis to clothing stores to stationery shops. Mr. Kim said he expected that 100 of the 1,300 Korean fruit and vegetable markets now in the city would not survive the winter. The rate at which stores are being sold between Koreans has risen to 20 percent a year, another sign of instability, Mr. Kim said. The figure might be higher still, but many stores are losing money and are not easily sold.
In response to problems in New York, Koreans are moving into the suburbs. Philip K. Y. Young, an economics professor at Pace University in Westchester County who studied Korean greengrocers in the early 1980's, said they already own many dry cleaning stores in the county and have also opened produce markets. On a recent trip to Los Angeles, Mr. Kim met many ex-New Yorkers.
Thousands of Korean merchants are doubtless still succeeding, but the difficulties that many of them are now enduring, especially given the Koreans' devotion to their stores, is a measure of the distress that some of the almost 200,000 small businesses in the city are suffering. "They're the universal standard for all small business," said Steven L. Null of the Coalition for Fair Business Rents. "There's nobody immune."
 As they opened more and more stores in the city, Koreans roiled tensions among black and Hispanic customers who sometimes found them curt or resented their apparent success.
"We don't like people praising us," says Mr. Kim, who calls the merchants' prosperous image a "mainstream myth" that obscures their exhausting workdays and, now, the struggle of many to stay in business.
To Korean greengrocers, the turn of fortunes must seem perplexing. What is a bread-and-butter business if not fruits and vegetables?
Mr. Back learned the trade working in a market in the Bronx. He opened his own store in Queens three years ago, replacing a Chinese restaurant. At first, he said, sales were robust at $3,000 a day and his store was profitable. Now he has fallen behind on the $9,000 monthly rent and faces extra late charges.
"I read in the Korean newspapers that next spring will be much better," he said, without much hope. "But I don't think so."
In a pinch, a small labor-intensive business like a fruit-and-vegetable stand has only one real option: reduce labor costs. Mr. Back said he had trimmed two people from his payroll. But that has meant even more work for him. He said he now puts in 14 or 15 hours a day, six and a half days a week, taking only Monday afternoons off.
This is not the kind of new life he hoped for seven years ago, when he left Korea. His father owned buildings there, he said, but liked America, and so the family sold its holdings at a loss and moved.
"We had enough money in Korea," Mr. Back said. "Not here."
 
Start-Up Loans
 Many Koreans, even those with high levels of education or professional training, are drawn to small businesses because of limited English. Often, they obtain start-up money from revolving credit associations formed by compatriots. They share business information and advice but, Professor Young said, have "no qualms about opening up a store across the street from each other."
Mr. Back does not think competition has much to do with his predicament, but just half a block down Roosevelt Avenue is the Sung Hoon Fruit and Vegetable Market.
A few blocks away on Main Street -- too far to be yet another competitor -- Ike Shin watches over his market from a small perch in the back. As business slowed, he, too, reduced his staff. Now he sleeps at the store on many nights and has little time with his wife and children, who live out on Long Island.
Mr. Shin said he owned a garment factory in Korea but sold it to follow his family to America. He was lonely in Korea, he said.
He used the proceeds from the sale to start the store in Flushing. It now appears to be a losing gamble. He thinks about returning home, but Korea has prospered since he left and the standard of living and prices have soared. "My country developed faster than I thought," he said.
His friends in Korea are all rich now, he went on. "If we go back, I would be a beggar," he said.
 
Criticism of Dinkins
 Mr. Back also thinks about leaving New York. He favors Korea or California, which his wife prefers. But, he adds, "I don't have the money."
So Mr. Shin and Mr. Back are both trapped by the stores that were supposed to provide them with a better life but are now adrift in the business doldrums.
The city's economic downturn is bad enough, but some Koreans feel Mayor David N. Dinkins also let them down. At a City Hall rally in September, thousands of Koreans booed the new Mayor, who they believe has been ineffective in ending the bitter boycott of two Korean stores on Church Street in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
The protest began in January after a Haitian-American customer said she had been assaulted by an employee of one of the stores. The store owners said the customer had refused to pay for groceries.
Mr. Kim said Mr. Dinkins had also failed to honor a pledge to push for a bill that would provide for binding arbitration of lease renewals. He said 170 Koreans had lost leases -- and businesses they built -- in a recent six-month period.
On top of that is the burden that New York City imposes on small stores through an average of 14 different taxes and a variety of sidewalk regulations that are hard for some merchants to understand.
"The sanitation men are 'kings of the street," said Mr. Kim, who recently persuaded city officials to forgive about $1.5 million in fines for 150 merchants, but still knows of one store in Brighton Beach that was cited for 270 violations in just 11 months.
But now the city's weak economy is the major problem, and it does not seem likely to improve soon. The downturn is even affecting what may be the fanciest Korean market in New York, at Park Avenue at 75th Street.
Business at the store, which opened six years ago over the objections of some neighborhood residents, is down by 20 percent to 25 percent, said the owner, Kyu Sung Choi.
"Everybody worries about next year," he said. "Everyone is crying now -- everyone."

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Use Slowed By Weather

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Winter, or the lack of it, is sending a chill through the natural gas market. And after a string of mild winters in the Northeast, slack demand is starting to erode gas prices and squeeze drillers and pipeline operators.
It was not supposed to be this way. The invasion of Kuwait made oil, gas's big competitor, double in price, and was a reminder that a growing fraction of the nation's oil is imported, while nearly all gas comes from the United States and Canada. And geologists say that unlike oil, large quantities of natural gas almost certainly await discovery in North America. 
 For residential consumers, the effect has been stable or declining prices. At Brooklyn Union Gas, the fuel charge, which represents about half the customer's total bill from the gas utility, is down 5 percent this year from last, for an annual saving of about $20 for a typical single-family house. Public Service Electric and Gas, the largest utility in New Jersey, is now refunding $80 million to its customers because the price of gas was lower last winter than expected.
The warm weather has also contributed to a drop in wholesale heating oil prices, though it is difficult to determine how much of the drop is a result of lower demand and how much to the decline in crude oil prices. The drop is oil prices came about because of higher world production and a decline in war anxiety since October.
According to the most recent report by the Energy Department, wholesale heating oil prices in the region from Washington to New York had fallen to 90.4 cents a gallon on Dec. 3 from 103.2 cents on Oct. 1. Last year at this time, the price was just over 60 cents, though the intense cold in December and early January later pushed those prices up to about $1.10.
Yesterday, crude oil futures prices posted the biggest gains in three weeks, rising $1.30, to $27.22 a barrel, on renewed fear this week of war in the Middle East. [Page D2.]
 
January Prices Slide
 Weather has been the biggest factor holding down gas demand, and with it, price. With last winter a mild one and with a warm start to the current heating season, New York is close to having the warmest year since the Government began keeping records 121 years ago. Heating requirements so far this heating season have been 22 percent lower than normal. And the rest of the Northeast, where a huge population usually faces a cold winter, has also been mild.
The weather has changed the psychology of the buyers, the producers say, keeping prices down. In a move that the Energy Department earlier this week called "dramatic," the price of natural gas for delivery in January -- usually the peak month -- slipped lower than the December price in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February gas, now the spot month, closed yesterday at $1.999 for a thousand cubic feet, up 3.7 cents.
With gas sales in 1990 down 2.1 percent from 1989 and prices flat or down slightly, executives in the business are slouching into a wait-until-next-year mode.
But some experts see no wintry cold at the end of the tunnel. There have been so many warm winters over the last few years that as Paul R. Ferretti, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Company, put it, "What's abnormally warm is now the norm."
The natural gas industry was also expected to benefit from amendments to the Clean Air Act, which put a penalty on both oil and coal.
The Clean Air Act will eventually help. To meet progressively stricter deadlines in 1995 and 2000, some utilities will switch from coal to gas, because gas does not emit sulfur dioxide. Some utilities will probably modify coal furnaces to burn coal and gas in a mixture that cuts pollution sharply. And the tailpipe provisions of the new law may finally help gas crack into the transportation market, probably with buses, delivery trucks and other fleet vehicles.
 
Hurt by Weaker Economy
 But the gulf crisis has been no help to gas. Some analysts think it may have even hurt.
C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. has predicted a 1 percent shrinkage in the gross national product because of a recession brought on in part by the oil-price run-up. Its natural gas analyst, Paul J. Milbauer, said the Persian Gulf crisis would be a negative for gas. He said demand will rise to 18.4 trillion cubic feet in 1991, up from 18.1 trillion cubic feet this year. But the 18.4 trillion figure would have been higher in a stronger economy; the reason for the rise is the expectation of normal weather in 1991.
In addition, some analysts think that the price of oil will collapse when the gulf crisis ends because so many users have been building up inventories. If that happens, it could crush the price of gas.
According to Barbara Shook, associate editor of Natural Gas Intelligence, a weekly newsletter, "A bunch of independent producers were secretly wearing 'I Love Saddam' T-shirts until they realized that natural gas prices weren't going to go up along with oil."
Mr. Ferretti said, "When oil prices shot up because of the situation in Kuwait, the gas industry was not in a position to benefit." Any consuming company that could switch its fuel from oil to gas had done so long ago, he said.
But the period that led up to the Iraqi invasion was one of surplus oil production. George Baker, a natural gas analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the surplus had helped hold natural gas prices down. Another factor was the warm spring that left storage fields full of natural gas in late spring when they are normally depleted.
The industry had hoped that in January a thousand cubic feet, roughly a million B.T.U.'s, would fetch $3. Prices had been very strong in October. On the New York Mercantile Exchange at the beginning of this month, contracts for delivery in January traded at $2.45. But by last Friday, they had fallen to $2.05. And the Energy Department said on Monday that while January prices are usually the highest of the year, this year they will be about $1.70 for a thousand cubic feet, down from $1.96 in December. B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units, are often used in comparing the cost of gas, oil and electricity.
 
Pipeline Limitations
 Gas prices are far more seasonal than those for oil, but what the industry needs is sustained cold weather, not a concentrated dose of cold that raises fuel requirements briefly. In a recent study, Sanford C. Bernstein & Company found that because of pipeline limitations, January consumption has been flat for the last 10 years at about 2.3 trillion cubic feet.
Industry leaders say that events will turn the world in their direction. In a year-end statement, Michael Baly 3d, president of the American Gas Association, pointed out that several big pipeline projects were approved this year and several others were approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including the Iroquois line, which will bring gas from the Trans Canada Pipe Line to the New York City area.
A quarter-million homes converted to natural gas heat this year, mostly from oil, and the rate will rise to 300,000 homes next year, he said, nearly double the rate of recent years. The gas share of home heating has reached 62 percent, from 58 percent four years ago, Mr. Baly added.
And technical refinements will make gas-powered air-conditioners popular. These will be promoted, experts say, by combined electric-and-gas utilities whose electric systems are stretched to the limit by summer demand for cooling, while their gas systems sit idle.
In addition, analysts expect gas to capture the lion's share of the fuel market for new electric generating stations.

HEADLINE: Census Bureau Places Population at 249.6 Million

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
After one of the most disputed head counts ever, the Census Bureau today put the population of the United States at 249,632,692, an increase of more than 23 million people, or 10.2 percent, over the official 1980 total.
The increase reflects almost a million overseas Federal workers, including military personnel and their dependents, who were included in the 1990 total under a new law. When they are eliminated from the count, as they were in 1980, the 1990 population comes to 248.7 million. The 1980 figure was 226.5 million. 
 While the Constitution requires that a population figure for each state be reported to the President by the end of the year for apportioning the number of representatives from each state, the Commerce Department can still decide that the count was so flawed it should be adjusted by a statistically based formula. The department, the Census Bureau's parent agency, has said that it will determine by July 15 whether to do so.
 
Power and People Shift
 The total released today is the bureau's calculation of the population as of April 1, 1990, and confirms the continuing movement of people and political power to the West and South.
The total was 3.8 million higher than the preliminary total released in August, a result both of normal census operations, which had not been completed when the early figures came out, and of recanvassing in localities where officials complained.
The changes since the preliminary figures did not alter the expected apportionment of Congressional seats. From these counts, it appears that 19 seats will shift among the states next year, with California, Texas and Florida among the eight states to gain. Thirteen states, all but three of them in the Northeast and Midwest, will lose representation. New York, which is expected to lose three seats, would be the biggest loser. [Page B6.]
The preliminary figures, which did not include 922,819 Government workers and dependents then overseas, put the population at 245.8 million; the doublechecking since then raised every state's total, particularly those with large urban populations.
Experts say that if there is a statistical adjustment of the count, one or two states among the expected losers might find their losses reduced, or even eliminated.
 
Boom-and-Bust Decade
 Today's population figures reflected both the boom-and-bust decade in energy-producing states like Texas, Louisiana and Wyoming and the renewed loss of population in rural areas, which had experienced a small comeback in the 1970's. All four of the states losing population over the decade were either rural or energy producers or both: West Virginia, which lost 148,000, (7.6 percent of its population) Iowa, which lost 126,000 people, (4.3 percent), Wyoming, which lost 14,000 (2.9 percent), and North Dakota, which lost not quite 12,000 people (1.7 percent).
The 1990 law pertaining to Americans overseas requires that people posted abroad be included in determining each state's population, and thus its Congressional representation. Because the figures announced today embodied the bureau's calculation of the population as of last April 1, the military buildup spurred by the Persian Gulf crisis had no effect on the numbers.
The sharp increase in Hispanic and Asian immigrantion over the past decade was reflected in the dramatic population gains of the states where many of these immigrant have settled. California, home to many of the Asian immigrants and a large proportion of Hispanic people, gained 6.1 million people, for a total of 29.8 million. Texas, the destination of many Mexican and Central American immigrants, gained 2.8 million people, for a total of 17 million. Florida, where South American and Caribbean immigrants tend to cluster, gained 3.2 million, to 13 million.
The figures released today drew immediate protests from officials in New York City and New York State, who predicted that the undercount in 1990 would exceed the undercount of a decade ago, when the bureau estimated that it missed about 3.2 million people. Their comments made it clear that they would continue their legal efforts to force the Commerce Department to adjust its population totals.
Officials of the Commerce Department said today that it would be premature to assess the accuracy of its figures until the evaluation of a post- census survey is completed. "It'll be early summer before we know enough to intelligently answer your question," said Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs.
 
Looking Back to October
 The chairman of the Census Bureau's Congressional Oversight Subcommittee and a spokesman for the Democrats in state legislatures around the country -- the arenas where the reapportionment battles will be fought -- were quick to point out that as recently as October the Census Bureau's Population Division had issued a report estimating the total resident population at 253.4 million, an estimate which, if correct, would mean that the bureau's counting had missed about five million people.
Over the years, demographers and other experts have used estimates to guide their work between censuses, but they have placed more faith in the actual once-a-decade head counts.
Because of the stakes involved, no census has been free of dispute. But the political pressure has increased in recent decades as more and more Federal legislation tied aid to the states and cities to population.
"What was obvious to every American in 1990 is true: the population of the United States has become much more difficult to count," said Representative Thomas C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat who heads the House Census and Population Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. "It is a larger, more diverse and more mobile population than it has ever been. This figure may indicate that time-honored techniques are simply not sufficient."
"At this point it's fair to say that the real question is not whether we've counted everyone," Mr. Sawyer added. "We know that the nation has never counted everybody. The real question is how close has the Census Bureau come to the truth, and can they come closer?"
 
Lawsuit Is Pending
 New York State, as well as New York City and several other major municipalities, have sued in an attempt to force the Commerce Department to use statistical sampling techniques adjusting the final population totals to reflect the presumed undercount. Historically, undercounts have affected members of minorities and inner-city residents most severely. Organizations representing black and Hispanic people have joined the suit as plaintiffs.
"When large segments of our resident are left out of the political process, democracy is devalued for all of us," New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said in a statement released shortly after the census figures were made public. Urban officials around the country have contended in recent years that census undercounts have cheated them of both political power and millions of dollars in Federal aid that is distributed on the basis of population.
"This underscores the need for a correction," said Peter Zimroth, the New York attorney representing New York City in its lawsuit. "We're in the range of a five-million undercount. That kind of undercount is really unacceptable in a democracy that depends on the accuracy of these figures to allocate legislative power and billions of dollars."
 
'Full, Fair and Efficient'
 Mr. Darby, in a press conference at the Commerce Department, said, "I believe that we have seen here a full, fair and efficient census." Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, commenting on widespread local protests on the release of the preliminary totals in August, said, "Virtually every large city will find that its numbers have gone up."
Over all, the population count, including the overseas personnel, was about 1.1 percent greater than the preliminary figure of 245.8 million. But some states, like New York, saw a more pronounced increase between the preliminary figure and the final total. New York gained more than 400,000 people, or 2.4 percent. One Census bureau official said most of the gain between the August figures and those released today came in urban centers like New York City.
The only figures released today were the state-by-state totals needed to apportion Congressional representation. Population figures for some minority groups on a state-by-state basis should be available next spring. Other figures derived from the census, including the number of "unmarried partners," the figures obtained from the count of homeless people on the streets and in shelters, will not be available until late 1991 at the earliest.
Under terms of an agreement reached 18 months ago, the Commerce Department must decide by July 15 whether or not any undercount in the 1990 census will be corrected by statistical techniques to insure that urban areas and minority groups are fairly represented in the final figure.
Despite New York's protests, however, it was clear that many officials were relieved to find that, as the preliminary figures indicated, the state seems about to lose three Congressional seats, not four as some had feared. Among the other states apparently losing representation were Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio, each standing to lose two seats. The three losers outside the Northern and Midwestern industrial regions were Kentucky, Louisiana and Montana.

HEADLINE: A Red Flag for New York's Bridges

 BODY:
Bridge engineers call them "red flags": structural deficiencies that can threaten public safety. Since July, state and city inspectors have identified 416 red flags on New York City bridges, raising serious questions about Mayor David Dinkins's plan to cut preventive maintenance and rebuilding.
There's no denying the city's gloomy fiscal outlook. And the case for bridges always seems less compelling than the case for pressing social needs. But that's part of the problem; bridges have no constituency. Many past mayors ignored them and the city has paid a fearful price. 
 Two years ago, New York closed the Williamsburg Bridge. That prodded City Hall into an ambitious 10-year plan to rehabilitate all structurally deficient bridges by the year 2000. Now, it turns out, the problem is worse than it seemed: all the water, salt, dirt and debris that's been collecting for so long has accelerated corrosion. The city now rates 56 percent of its bridges deficient, compared with 42 percent in the past.
Though more energetic city inspections mean fewer hazards will go undetected, near-disasters have become all too common. Earlier this month, for example, city engineers had to close three lanes of the Williamsburg Bridge; in one lane, steel girders supporting the floor beams beneath the roadway were about to collapse from corrosion. The bridge was reopened after all-night repairs, but the episode was a timely reminder of the fragile state of the city's bridges, especially its overtaxed East River crossings.
Lucius Riccio, New York City's Transportation Commissioner, freely acknowledges the terrible condition of the city's bridges, but says the situation hasn't reached "a crisis point." His confidence is puzzling; many experts in and out of government strongly disagree with him. Mr. Riccio's own Deputy Commissioner for bridges, David Steinberger, says that even without the additional cuts City Hall is now considering, his repair crews can't keep pace with the rising number of red flags.
Even in these hard economic times, it's difficult to justify scrimping on vital, inexpensive preventive maintenance like painting and salt removal. Cutting back on the rebuilding program would be no less hazardous. Today's neglect will carry a far higher price tag tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Restore Unemployment Insurance That Works

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While "Unemployment Insurance Aiding Fewer Workers" (front page, Dec. 2) exposes the inadequacy of the unemployment insurance system in meeting the needs of the growing numbers of jobless Americans, you omit some important points.
While an average of 48 percent of the unemployed collected benefits in 1982, the figure fell to 39 percent in 1983, 37 percent in 1984 and now hovers around 33 percent, according to the Department of Labor. In 1975, the average was 69 percent.
You note stricter eligibility requirements, along with a changed work force, as major causes for the 35 percent decline in the numbers using the unemployment insurance system, but you omit another obvious cause: long-term unemployment, coupled with fewer weeks of benefits available. The drastic reduction in the number of benefit weeks from a high of 65 weeks (not 52, as you state) in 1975-77 to 26 weeks has rendered the unemployment insurance safety net increasingly irrelevant to millions of jobless Americans. More than two million workers exhausted all benefits last year; almost 200,000 in New York alone. Though these workers are counted as unemployed, they do not receive benefits.
Your assumption that sentiment against higher taxes could automatically lead to calls for further limits on unemployment benefits also ignores the basic point that wage-earning taxpayers do not pay for the unemployment insurance system. Funded by a tax on employers, unemployment insurance is considered by wage earners as an indispensable benefit and not a tax. If anything, unemployment insurance has lagged far behind other taxation. As the taxable wage base for Social Security has risen over the years from $3,000 to more than $54,000, the Federal wage base for unemployment insurance taxes has only gone from $3,000 to $7,000.
This is now the fourth recession we have had in just 15 years. The fundamental issue is society's ability to provide decent-paying, secure jobs for all able to work. But the immediate question is whether or not we can afford not to protect the jobless; the issue is priorities, not just finances.

HEADLINE: Restore Unemployment Insurance That Works;
March of Folly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Unemployment Insurance Aiding Fewer Workers," you report (front page, Dec. 2). It is not, however, as you state, "because of the reluctance to raise the taxes" that the Federal unemployment insurance program, "meant to ease the pain of recession," is much less effective than it used to be. It was the elimination of the uniform Federal tax and the substitution of the right of states to set the level of the tax they imposed on businesses that started this debacle.
The states largely substituted a regressive tax on business, easing the burden on larger employers, transferring costs to smaller companies. In addition to the regressive taxes, the ceilings on taxable wages bear little relation to the benefits paid to a company's laid-off workers.
In Pennsylvania the maximum annual taxable wage is $8,000. Consider two industries suffering layoffs, garment and steel. The garment workers making $160 a week could have drawn $82 a week in unemployment insurance in 1990. The steelworkers earning $550 a week would be entitled to $181. The employers of both would contribute to the fund on the first $8,000 of wages, and their experience-rated tax percents could be the same, even though their employees received vastly different benefits.
This regressiveness and disproportion came about because the unemployment system was delegated to the states. The low level of benefits, about 35 percent of what workers were earning at their last jobs, and the limited duration of benefits also result from relegation to the states.
In other countries, a uniform national unemployment insurance system recognizes that the national economy has an impact on employment levels, with states having little influence. Benefits in most developed economies (except South Africa) are set at 60 percent or more of previous earnings, and durations of benefits are longer. Also, in other countries there is an employment system focusing on training, education, counseling and relocation, with unemployment assistance truly an adjunct to re-employment.
This interstate competition system has encouraged a bidding war. "Businesses argue," you state, "and many politicians agree, that a lower unemployment insurance tax improves the business climate of a state and makes it more attractive to companies that might wish to come there." When smaller businesses argue thus, they are being seduced by a class argument; their economic self-interest would be better served by a more equitable system -- shifting the tax burden to larger and less competitive enterprises better able to pay.
When politicians agree, they are misdiagnosing the problem and prescribing the wrong cure; if they seek job creation, they should ease the burden on smaller enterprises, which create jobs while larger ones are shedding employees.
One of the many reasons unemployment insurance is aiding fewer workers is that more workers are discouraged -- by employers, because most states have tightened eligibility requirements and because many unemployment compensation bureaucracies are employer-sympathetic and user-unfriendly. In most states it is not illegal for an employer announcing a layoff to threaten those who apply for benefits during temporary layoffs with not being recalled. Because of funds cuts many offices are understaffed, lines are long and counseling (benefit rights and vocation guidance) is nonexistent.
The Keynesian counter-cycle concept underlying the 1935 legislation -- collect taxes when times are good, pay benefits to sustain purchasing power during downturns -- is undermined by the present system. As soon as the funds build up a substantial balance, business presses for givebacks. Reserves built during periods of full employment, such as World War II, were given back to employers through refunds and credits. That benefit funds are in shaky financial condition is not an accident; it is inherent in a system that fails to treat the money as a true trust fund.
In 1985, the Pennsylvania fund faced a fiscal crisis. As part of a tripartite deal, business and labor agreed with government that they would come up with a solution: 60 percent of the deficit reduction would come from business and 40 percent from labor. When the A.F.L.-C.I.O. proposed, instead of the conventional business-political solution of cutting benefits and eligibility, to generate its share through a one-tenth of 1 percent of payroll tax, the business community balked. They did not want any worker contribution (routine in other countries) that would encourage the idea that unemployment benefits were a normative right. They pay for the system and thereby exercise decisive influence over it.
Representative Thomas J. Downey is right to say, "It's a classic economic march of folly." It may be too late to correct the situation for this recession; it's not too late to revise this nonfunctional unemployment compensation system for layoff victims and a society ill served by the present system.

HEADLINE: Census Bureau Places Population at 249.6 Million

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
After one of the most disputed head counts ever, the Census Bureau today put the population of the United States at 249,632,692, an increase of more than 23 million people, or 10.2 percent, over the official 1980 total.

When they are eliminated from the count, as they were in 1980, the 1990 population comes to 248.7 million. The 1980 figure was 226.5 million.

The changes since the preliminary figures did not alter the expected apportionment of Congressional seats. From these counts, it appears that 19 seats will shift among the states next year, with California, Texas and Florida among the eight states to gain. Thirteen states, all but three of them in the Northeast and Midwest, will lose representation. New York, which is expected to lose three seats, would be the biggest loser. [Page B6.]
The preliminary figures, which did not include 922,819 Government workers and dependents then overseas, put the population at 245.8 million; the doublechecking since then raised every state's total, particularly those with large urban populations.
Experts say that if there is a statistical adjustment of the count, one or two states among the expected losers might find their losses reduced, or even eliminated.
 
Boom-and-Bust Decade
 Today's population figures reflected both the boom-and-bust decade in energy-producing states like Texas, Louisiana and Wyoming and the renewed loss of population in rural areas, which had experienced a small comeback in the 1970's. All four of the states losing population over the decade were either rural or energy producers or both: West Virginia, which lost 148,000, (7.6 percent of its population) Iowa, which lost 126,000 people, (4.3 percent), Wyoming, which lost 14,000 (2.9 percent), and North Dakota, which lost not quite 12,000 people (1.7 percent).
The 1990 law pertaining to Americans overseas requires that people posted abroad be included in determining each state's population, and thus its Congressional representation. Because the figures announced today embodied the bureau's calculation of the population as of last April 1, the military buildup spurred by the Persian Gulf crisis had no effect on the numbers.
The sharp increase in Hispanic and Asian immigrantion over the past decade was reflected in the dramatic population gains of the states where many of these immigrant have settled. California, home to many of the Asian immigrants and a large proportion of Hispanic people, gained 6.1 million people, for a total of 29.8 million. Texas, the destination of many Mexican and Central American immigrants, gained 2.8 million people, for a total of 17 million. Florida, where South American and Caribbean immigrants tend to cluster, gained 3.2 million, to 13 million.
The figures released today drew immediate protests from officials in New York City and New York State, who predicted that the undercount in 1990 would exceed the undercount of a decade ago, when the bureau estimated that it missed about 3.2 million people. Their comments made it clear that they would continue their legal efforts to force the Commerce Department to adjust its population totals.
Officials of the Commerce Department said today that it would be premature to assess the accuracy of its figures until the evaluation of a post- census survey is completed. "It'll be early summer before we know enough to intelligently answer your question," said Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs.
 
Looking Back to October
 The chairman of the Census Bureau's Congressional Oversight Subcommittee and a spokesman for the Democrats in state legislatures around the country -- the arenas where the reapportionment battles will be fought -- were quick to point out that as recently as October the Census Bureau's Population Division had issued a report estimating the total resident population at 253.4 million, an estimate which, if correct, would mean that the bureau's counting had missed about five million people.
Over the years, demographers and other experts have used estimates to guide their work between censuses, but they have placed more faith in the actual once-a-decade head counts.
Because of the stakes involved, no census has been free of dispute. But the political pressure has increased in recent decades as more and more Federal legislation tied aid to the states and cities to population.
"What was obvious to every American in 1990 is true: the population of the United States has become much more difficult to count," said Representative Thomas C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat who heads the House Census and Population Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. "It is a larger, more diverse and more mobile population than it has ever been. This figure may indicate that time-honored techniques are simply not sufficient."
"At this point it's fair to say that the real question is not whether we've counted everyone," Mr. Sawyer added. "We know that the nation has never counted everybody. The real question is how close has the Census Bureau come to the truth, and can they come closer?"
 
Lawsuit Is Pending
 New York State, as well as New York City and several other major municipalities, have sued in an attempt to force the Commerce Department to use statistical sampling techniques adjusting the final population totals to reflect the presumed undercount. Historically, undercounts have affected members of minorities and inner-city residents most severely. Organizations representing black and Hispanic people have joined the suit as plaintiffs.
"When large segments of our resident are left out of the political process, democracy is devalued for all of us," New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said in a statement released shortly after the census figures were made public. Urban officials around the country have contended in recent years that census undercounts have cheated them of both political power and millions of dollars in Federal aid that is distributed on the basis of population.
"This underscores the need for a correction," said Peter Zimroth, the New York attorney representing New York City in its lawsuit. "We're in the range of a five-million undercount. That kind of undercount is really unacceptable in a democracy that depends on the accuracy of these figures to allocate legislative power and billions of dollars."
 
'Full, Fair and Efficient'
 Mr. Darby, in a press conference at the Commerce Department, said, "I believe that we have seen here a full, fair and efficient census." Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, commenting on widespread local protests on the release of the preliminary totals in August, said, "Virtually every large city will find that its numbers have gone up."
Over all, the population count, including the overseas personnel, was about 1.1 percent greater than the preliminary figure of 245.8 million. But some states, like New York, saw a more pronounced increase between the preliminary figure and the final total. New York gained more than 400,000 people, or 2.4 percent. One Census bureau official said most of the gain between the August figures and those released today came in urban centers like New York City.
The only figures released today were the state-by-state totals needed to apportion Congressional representation. Population figures for some minority groups on a state-by-state basis should be available next spring. Other figures derived from the census, including the number of "unmarried partners," the figures obtained from the count of homeless people on the streets and in shelters, will not be available until late 1991 at the earliest.
Under terms of an agreement reached 18 months ago, the Commerce Department must decide by July 15 whether or not any undercount in the 1990 census will be corrected by statistical techniques to insure that urban areas and minority groups are fairly represented in the final figure.
Despite New York's protests, however, it was clear that many officials were relieved to find that, as the preliminary figures indicated, the state seems about to lose three Congressional seats, not four as some had feared. Among the other states apparently losing representation were Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio, each standing to lose two seats. The three losers outside the Northern and Midwestern industrial regions were Kentucky, Louisiana and Montana.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 1990, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Two articles yesterday about the 1990 census incorrectly described a provision of the Constitution, and one of them incorrectly described a proposed corrective survey in some copies. The Constitution requires only that a census be taken every 10 years. Federal law stipulates that the count be given to the President by the end of the year. The corrective survey would involve 150,000 households, not individuals.
A map accompanying the article gave incorrect figures in some copies for the percent changes in each state's population between 1980 and 1990. A corrected map appears on page A16.

HEADLINE: U.N. Choice: A Signal of a Bigger Role for Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 26

 BODY:
With understandable pride, Government officials are commenting these days that the recent selection of a Japanese woman as the new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees sends a signal that Tokyo is ready for a leadership role in a vexing global problem.
But for Sadako Ogata, who takes office as High Commissioner on Jan. 1, an equally important message should be read at home: that Japan's record of contributing funds to the refugee problem, and to international humanitarian causes generally, has been inadequate. 
 "I think it would be pretty good if Japan, in becoming an economic power, becomes a humanitarian power as well," Mrs. Ogata said in an interview. "I'm sure we can do more, and we have to do more. Our record is better than it used to be, but it should be much, much more."
Mrs. Ogata, dean of foreign studies at Sophia University in Tokyo, will be the highest ranking Japanese at an international agency at a time when Japan has clamored for a role commensurate with its growing status as financier of international activities.
 
15 Million Refugees
 The agency in charge of 15 million refugees is in a financial crisis, which could worsen if war breaks out in the Middle East or chaos grows in the Soviet Union. Agency officials have made it clear that they expect Japan to do more to help.
Japan is second only to the United States in contributing to the agency's $500 million annual budget, but the ranking is deceptive. In fact, Japan's contribution has been steady at $55 million to $60 million a year, despite the yen's being worth twice as many dollars as five years ago.
That means that in terms of the Japanese budget, appropriations for refugees have gone down sharply, not up. Critics assert that Japan's lagging efforts on refugees are a mirror of its failure elsewhere to provide aid to developing countries or to aid the global environmental problems.
Although Japan is the No. 1 foreign assistance donor in terms of dollars, it achieved that status because of the high yen and because the United States has cut back. On a per capita basis, Japan is well behind many European countries as an aid donor.
 
Indochinese Resettlement
 Nor has Japan moved dramatically on refugee problems beyond giving money. Under pressure to do more, the Government agreed in 1985 to permit the resettlement of 10,000 Indochinese refugees in Japan, but so far only 7,000 have been resettled.
Mrs. Ogata said she felt there was room for more immigrants and refugees to resettle but admitted that the Japanese themselves were wary.
"Change takes a long time in Japan," she said. "I think you should always look at Japan in a medium-term perspective -- at least 5 or 10 years. Japan moves slowly, but if you take a longer time span, it moves an awful lot."
Mrs. Ogata was among many Japanese intellectuals critical of Prime Minster Toshiki Kaifu's handling of the national response to the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Kaifu promised $4 billion, but was unable to win legislative approval to send personnel to the region.
 
Long a Male Bastion
 There are many ways in which Mrs. Ogata's appointment is unusual, not least because only a tiny number of women have risen to prominence in Japan. What seemed like a possibility of gains in politics last year fizzled out when very few women ended up running or being elected to office this year.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also long been a male bastion. Mrs. Ogata, who is 63 years old, is the granddaughter and daughter of a diplomat, but she freely acknowledges that when she was deciding on a career, it was virtually impossible for a woman to join the foreign service.
Instead, Mrs. Ogata went into teaching. After graduating from the University of the Sacred Heart in Tokyo, a Catholic institution, she got her Ph.D. in political science from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's from Georgetown in Washington.
Mrs. Ogata speaks in crisp unaccented English, a product of five childhood years in the 1930's in San Francisco and Portland. She and her husband, Shijuro Ogata, a highly respected economist, are familiar spokesmen on Japanese issues for diplomats, journalists and Government officials.
 
Outside the Foreign Ministry
 In fact, Mr. Ogata, now the deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, has himself been frequently mentioned as a possible director general of the International Monetary Fund, should the fund ever abandon its tradition of choosing only a European.
To many Japanese, it is significant that the Foreign Ministry had to turn to someone outside its own precincts to nominate for the United Nations post. Japanese are not known as big volunteers at the United Nations. Only nine of the refugee agency's 364 professionals are Japanese.
Japanese diplomats are said to feel that even a short stint at the United Nations could derail their careers. Few Japanese also know English well enough to feel comfortable at international agencies, and there is little training in Japan for jobs relating to the developing world.
But Mrs. Ogata feels that Japanese are discouraged from working at international agencies because the senior positions have been reserved for Americans and Europeans. "Japan is a latecomer at the U.N.," she said. "It's not easy for countries to give up the top jobs."

Would Giuliani Have Done A Better Job?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Had just 50,000 New York City voters changed their minds in 1989, Rudolph W. Giuliani would be finishing his first year as mayor. Would his election have made any difference? Given the dimensions of the city's budget gap, can any mayor make a difference?
"I guess I'd be working for sure today had I won," said Mr. Giuliani, who was working between holidays yesterday but at his midtown Manhattan law office, not at City Hall (where Mayor David N. Dinkins held several meetings, though his only scheduled public appearance was a midday courtesy call by two Good Samaritans from Brooklyn). 
 Predictably, Mr. Giuliani, for one, says he would have made a difference, and for the better. The second question is more complicated, particularly when mayoral discretion is so confined by fiscal impeatives.
After promising to be the city's toughest mayor on crime, Mr. Dinkins postponed hiring more police officers -- a decision that was applauded at the time as fiscally prudent but that would haunt him during a summer when crime surged almost as much as crime coverage in the media. Later, he was able to claim credit for adding only about $60 million -- mostly for drug treatment and preventive services for children -- to the city's $29 billion budget.
Mr. Dinkins succeeded as a candidate, though barely. His performance as a mayor has been more problematic.
Mr. Giuliani, who was Mr. Dinkins's Republican rival, is hardly a disinterested observer. But his views seem to echo the sentiments of those New Yorkers -- including some who voted for Mr. Dinkins -- who believe that their doubts about the Mayor have already been vindicated by his first-year record.
"Another person would have helped the city through this situation more effectively," Mr. Giuliani said. "A lot of what the city is missing is leadership and a sense of direction."
Any mayor would have faced constants like crime and fiscal constraints. A second set of obstacles, Mr. Giuliani said, was created by Mr. Dinkins himself. "There is no consistent vision or sense of where the city is going," Mr. Giuliani said. "It is not as if they're saying we're cutting the budget to create a better economy in one or two years. We're cutting the budget to respond to immediate crises."
He drew a stark, if strained, comparison between Mr. Dinkins and Winston Churchill during the Battle of Britain. "There was not much Churchill could do to stop the bombs from falling," he said, "but he talked about making sacrifices for the future. He didn't just say that things were worse in Czechoslovakia."
In part, Mr. Dinkins's problem has been one of tone. Billie Holiday may croon the same tunes on both, but the clarity is greater on the compact disc player that the Mayor's wife, Joyce, gave him as a Christmas gift than on the cassette player in his City Hall office.
His problem, at times, has also been one of content, which Mr. Dinkins hopes to clarify in his State of the City speech next month. Mr. Giuliani described the Mayor's early decision to delay police hiring as "a terrible mistake" -- a political gesture that had negligible impact on the budget but an immediate effect on the police force.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Giuliani said he was surprised that Mr. Dinkins had been "considerably weaker than I thought he would be," particularly in negotiating with municipal unions and in dealing with Albany legislators -- jobs for which the Mayor's political ties might have been an advantage.
Similarly, Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Dinkins's promise of racial harmony, as the city's first black mayor, had been largely unfulfilled (although the subdued reaction by blacks to the shooting of an unarmed black woman by a police officer responding to a family disturbance in the Bronx last month might be attributed, in part, to a presumption among blacks that Mr. Dinkins would not countenance a cover-up). The Mayor's tentative response earlier this year to the black boycott of a Brooklyn market owned by Korean immigrants, Mr. Giuliani said, demonstrated a failure to rise above racial politics.
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said, as he entered the Third Avenue office building where he works, a police officer lamented to him, "You should've won." Two days before, Mr. Giuliani recalled, another Dinkins detractor approached him and said, "Don't you feel fortunate that you have a political future and he doesn't?"
Futures can be even more volatile in politics than in petroleum, which is why, despite the challenges, few politicians are so self-effacing as to either eschew the chance to impose their imprint on an office or accept the notion that it makes no difference who is mayor.
"I would've preferred to win," Mr. Giuliani said.

HEADLINE: More Rate Cuts Are Urged

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress said today that the economy needed stimulus from lower interest rates, not from temporary tax cuts or Government spending programs that would worsen the budget deficit.
"The appropriate policy response to weakness in the economy is a more stimulative monetary policy," said Representative Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, in his annual economic report. 
 The Federal Reserve has already pushed down interest rates, cutting the discount rate by half a point, to 6 1/2 percent, and pushing down the Federal funds rate four times since July. But Mr. Hamilton said these actions were just a beginning.
"Temporory tax cuts can be quicker, but temporary tax cuts have a way of becoming permanent, and the budget deficit is already too large," his report stated.
Mr. Hamilton said the long-term health of the economy required further reductions in the budget deficit to promote savings. The report said cuts of about $80 billion in the 1995 fiscal year are needed to restore the savings rate to the level seen in the 1960's and 1970's. It made no specific proposals on how the cuts might be achieved.
The report also said that unemployment benefits should be extended in times of high joblessness.

HEADLINE: Crotone Journal;
New U.S. Base: City Boon or NATO Boondoggle?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CROTONE, Italy

 BODY:
Nothing would please him more, Francesco Sottile said, than to have Fiat plunk down a huge plant and start churning out cars in this outpost on the arch of the Italian boot. It would be great if Olivetti were to produce computers here.
But Mr. Sottile, a realist as well as president of Crotone's Small Industries Association, recognizes that none of that is about to happen. 
 And when you must deal with a 30 percent unemployment rate among local youths and with household incomes that are half the national average, when you face a serious drug problem and a hungry local Mafia, you sometimes settle for what you can.
So Mr. Sottile, like other Crotone business owners, is delighted that ground-breaking has finally begun five miles outside town on a NATO air base that will spread across 3,500 acres of scrubby farmland overlooking the Ionian Sea. It is to become home for 72 American F-16 fighter jets that are supposed to leave Torrejon, Spain, outside Madrid, by mid-1992.
 
A 1988 Agreement
 The businessmen do not think of it as merely another military installation. Rather, they see an economic opportunity staring at them that was unimaginable until Italy agreed in early 1988, as part of its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to accept planes that Spain no longer wants.
"We're not expecting this base to take care of all our problems," Mr. Sottile said. "But we think it can solve some of them."
While that is a widely shared view in this weathered Calabrian city of 65,000, it is far from universal. "They're fooling themselves if they think that there will be a shower of dollars, that this will produce miracles," said Mayor Giancarlo Sitra, a Communist.
If the air base is such an economic blessing, the skeptics ask, why was Spain glad to let it go?
The planned transfer here of the United States Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing has provoked disputes that stretch all the way to Washington, where critics insist that with the cold war over, a built-from-scratch $800 million base is no longer needed.
 
Grumbling in Congress
 Some members of Congress dismiss it as a NATO boondoggle, and ask why they should help an isolated region of Italy when dozens of military installations are being shut down in the United States. The House of Representatives showed its displeasure last summer by blocking all Crotone funds for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, although it could not prevent the start of construction with previously authorized money.
But NATO foreign ministers insist that even though the base will not be ready for at least five years, forcing the F-16's to scramble for temporary locations after 1992, it remains vital to protect the alliance's southern flank. The Persian Gulf crisis underlines the need, they say, and they recently reaffirmed their commitment in Brussels. Washington is to pay 28 percent of the costs -- roughly $225 million, assuming present estimates hold -- while the other 15 NATO members cover the rest.
To Mr. Sottile, price tags and geopolitical debates are best left to politicians and generals.
What he sees is an instant community of 10,000 -- military men and women and their families -- that will mean an estimated 1,000 on-base jobs for Italian civilians. It will mean new opportunities for local restaurants, hotels, shops and repairmen. The base has already been a boon to 74 farmers who had their property expropriated for the first phase of construction, each receiving as much as $14,000 an acre, three times what the land is believed to be worth.
 
City Has Two Plants
 Such payments have helped fuel Congressional complaints that the installation amounts to a bailout for Crotone. This city, with a chemical plant and metal-processing factory, is more industrialized than most places in largely rural Calabria. Nevertheless, it has hardly escaped the economic stagnation and ingrained resentments that plague much of Italy's tumbledown south.
Here, Rome is widely regarded as simply the latest colonizer in a long string that began 27 centuries ago with the ancient Greeks. Perhaps, the business leaders say, a NATO air base might force the central Government to take notice by building needed highways and rail links, if only to avoid giving the foreigners a bad impression.
Doubters abound, however.
Pacifists and political activists, mostly from the left, have held protest demonstrations, denouncing the base as unnecessary and provocative to Italy's neighbors in northern Africa and the Middle East. Some worry that the presence of fighter planes able to carry nuclear weapons could expose them to a military attack. Others offer a catalogue of concerns: environmental pollution, possible damage to archeological ruins and potential cultural clashes with the Americans, not to mention age-old worries that a military base may mean prostitutes and an even bigger drug problem than now.
Regardless of political persuasion, everyone here is waiting to see how long it take before the 'Ndrangheta, the Calabrian version of the Mafia, gets its hands on construction contracts.
 
Prosecutor Watches Companies
 So far, the major work has been undertaken by outside companies, but subcontracts worth a total of $5.5 million have gone to two Crotone companies. Elio Costa, the public prosecutor, says he is keeping an eye on both, although he will not disclose what, if anything, he suspects.
At heart, the decisive question for most Crotonese is the economic potential, and Mayor Sitra argues that the base will hurt rather than help. "We feel that this is seen by Rome as an alternative to industrial development," he said.
But business leaders are betting differently. Mr. Sottile, for one, has no doubts that sooner or later Congress will provide the funds to complete the job.
"In the end," he said, partly in jest but also part seriously, "the Americans wind up paying everything."

HEADLINE: Hard Days For Liquor Merchants

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 27

 BODY:
For sellers of wine, beer and spirits, the last two weeks of the year are normally hectic but profitable. This year, merchants are just plain harried.
Facing a special one-time tax on all inventory on Dec. 31, some retailers and wholesalers are scrambling to reduce stock, while others are loading up in anticipation of huge price increases coming from producers in January. And all are watching the economy with a wary eye. 
 "If you notice retailers with their hair falling out, it's because they've been pulling it," said Gordon Mott, editor of Market Watch, a trade magazine. "They're confused."
 
Excise Tax to Rise
 As part of the agreement this fall between Congress and the Bush Administration, the Government is raising the Federal excise tax: on wine from 3 cents a bottle, to 21; on a bottle of 80-proof spirits from $1.98, to $2.14, and on beer from 16 cents a six-pack, to 32.
These increases go into effect Jan. 1, and are expected to generate $8.8 billion over the next five years. But the agreement also calls for a one-time tax expected to generate $300 million.
The timing of the new tax adds to liquor store woes. Because Christmas and New Year's Eves are the two busiest days of the year, inventories are kept high. Many stores close altogether or work shortened hours New Year's Day, but not this year, when they will have to count and reprice every bottle in stock.
 
'A Big Pain in the Neck'
 "It is going to be a big pain in the neck," said Chip Cassidy, wine buyer for Crown Wine Merchants, a chain with 21 stores based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Employees will have to spend all New Year's Day counting more than 100,000 bottles in some stores. Still, he continued, the tax is more a nuisance than a catastrophe. "Everybody can moan and groan and complain, but six months from now we're going to still be in business," he added.
Some retailers have gone all out to greet the New Year with low inventories and, hence, avoid much of the tax. But many suppliers have announced large price increases for January and offered substantial discounts in December, creating an incentive to stock up, especially since the tax is not due until June. In addition, prices will increase by even more than the amount of the tax because producers, wholesalers and retailers will each apply their standard markup to the higher costs.
Among retailers "there seem to be two contradictory philosophies that have an almost equal number of adherents," said Paul Gillette, publisher of The Wine Investor, an industry newsletter.
Complicating matters, "many suppliers have seized the opportunity of the tax to put on price increases of their own, which they were planning to do anyway," Mr. Gillette added. He continued, "The reasoning apparently is, one, if you put it on at the same time, people are prepared and likely to accept it and blame the tax, and two, suppliers can induce wholesalers and retailers to stock up at the old price."
 
Top Brands Plan Price Increase
 Producers increasing prices include big brewers like the Anheuser-Busch Companies and the Stroh Brewery Company, leading liquor brands and wine makers, particularly premium French and Italian producers. Some increases reflect the dollar's weakness against foreign currencies, and some are the result of price rises that had been deferred because producers feared compounding the trend toward lower alcohol consumption.
"Instead of $2-a-case increases, you're looking at a lot of $10 increases, so nobody's looking to lower inventory," said John Sander Block, vice president of Southern Wine and Spirits in Miami, the nation's largest wholesaler. "If they have the cash flow available, they'll buy merchandise."
But the general economic malaise has many retailers wary of building stock, particularly in spirits. While alcoholic beverages are often thought to be recession-proof, retailers in areas where the downturn hit early, like the Northeast, report significantly lower sales in 1990. Those in more buoyant areas are still not inclined to load up.
 
Slow January Sales Expected
 "Because January, February and March are the absolute slowest months of the year, it doesn't make sense for us to load up on inventory," said David Wilce, manager of Pacific Wine and Spirits in Los Gatos, Calif.
While Pacific had record one-day sales on Christmas Eve, "with the economy headed the way it is, January could be the all-time worst," he said.
One factor that could further weaken first-quarter sales is a "tax rush" in December brought on by the impending excise tax increase and price rises. Customers who buy heavily now may not buy more for some time. But retailers and wholesalers say there has not been a large trend toward such buying, except perhaps at discount club stores, which always do a high volume in case sales.
Here, too, timing is a factor. These latest increases "have come out in a period when the consumer usually has pretty good stocks of wine and spirits because of gift giving," said Michael Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann Inc., the Manhattan retailer. Tax increases have little impact on premium wine and spirits sales, he continued, adding, "You don't see tax rushes on Chateau Lafite."

HEADLINE: Seoul's Leader Shuffles Cabinet In a Housecleaning for Elections

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 27

 BODY:
President Roh Tae Woo named a new Prime Minister and shuffled his Cabinet today in an effort to polish his party's image before a series of elections starting next year.
The appointment of the new Prime Minister and nine new Cabinet ministers indicates little substantive change in policy, either domestic or foreign. 
The authorities also announced today the arrests of more than 50 people as part of a continuing crackdown on anti-Government activity.
Some opposition and dissident groups assert that the arrests are part of a plan to suppress dissent as the Democratic Liberal Party of Mr. Roh approaches its first local elections in 30 years.
 
Talks With North a Priority
 The new Prime Minister, Ro Jai Bong, immediately issued a statement calling for law and order and said the conservative Government would make further talks with North Korea a priority.
"The priorities will be on establishing social discipline as well as law and order, progress in inter-Korea dialogue and multilateral diplomacy," said Mr. Ro, a former presidential aide.
Kim Dae Jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, said he was disappointed at the Cabinet changes. He said they made the Government more conservative and rightist.
President Roh is midway in a five-year term that ends in 1992. He has made dramatic progress in foreign relations by expanding Seoul's ties with Communist and former Communist nations. But support for domestic policies is at an all-time low as he prepares for next year's local elections, which are expected to be held in the first half of the year.
Three national elections, including those for Parliament and a new President, will be held in the next two years.
 
Job's Significance Grows
 The largely ceremonial post of Prime Minister has become increasingly significant because the holder acts as chief delegate to high-level talks on easing tensions with Communist North Korea, the fourth round of which is scheduled for February.
In a move seen to reflect changing relations with the North, Choi Ho Joong was moved from Foreign Minister to Unification Minister and will serve as Deputy Prime Minister. He was instrumental in helping Seoul forge dramatic new relations with former Communist allies of North Korea. The Government hopes its actions will force the North from its isolation and lead to eventual unification.
The new Foreign Minister is Lee Sang Ok, a career diplomat now posted in Geneva as chief of mission to international agencies.
Lee Bong Suh, an American-educated economist, was named Trade and Industry Minister.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Thin Trading; Gold Prices Are Also Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in extremely thin trading yesterday.
Gold prices also declined broadly. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 30 cents a troy ounce to settle at $385.30. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $384.40, up 20 cents an ounce. 
 A Government report showing that United States durable goods orders fell a steeper-than-expected 10.5 percent in November had some impact on trading, participants said. Analysts had been expecting a decline of about 2.2 percent, and the much larger drop fueled concerns that the United States economy was weakening significantly.
 European markets, which had closed for the Christmas holidays, reopened yesterday to find traders mostly selling the dollar.
Domestic trading was extremely light. "We had about an hour's worth of trading after the durable goods numbers, and that was it for the whole day," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
Despite the weakness of the durable goods report, it was "not enough to make people reopen their books and dump dollars before the New Year," said Michael Malpede, an analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. He noted that a good portion of the decline reflected auto-plant shutdowns rather than declines in a variety of industries.
The German mark was helped by the confirmation of Gennadi I. Yanayev as Soviet vice president. He was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's choice for the newly created office, and the approval offered an air of stability to the politically torn Soviet Union. Against the German currency, the dollar weakened in New York to 1.5255 marks, from 1.5348 late Wednesday.
"The focus was on U.S. economic fundamentals, the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf crisis," Mr. Malpede said. "The dollar has been bouncing off that triad, with no clear direction in trading."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.65 yen, up 0.40 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted higher at 136.75 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 136.40 yen, up from 136.10 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8870, compared with $1.8740 late Monday. In New York, it cost $1.8895 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.8815.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.3040 Swiss francs, down from 1.3082; 5.1935 French francs, down from 5.2080; 1,151.75 Italian lire, down from 1,155.00, and 1.1616 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1595.
Gold was quoted at a late bid price of $382.25 a troy ounce in London, down from $383 bid an ounce late Monday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Veil of Corporate Secrecy Is Lifted Somewhat in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Foreign investment experts active in the Japanese stock market have long said that following rumors could be more important than serious research, since companies disclose so little solid information.
"It has always been part of the fun of this market that even if you started a rumor, nobody could disprove it," said Robert G. Zielinski, an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities and co-author of a recent book, "Unequal Equities," that is critical of the Tokyo market for consistently benefiting companies at the expense of their shareholders. "You could never calculate the real net worth of any company." 
 In the last few weeks, the Finance Ministry has quietly instituted several measures that may start to change that. Giving investors a rational basis for selecting stocks, as the measures are intended to do, has been taken for granted on Wall Street for decades, but is a potentially historic shift here.
The most recent change, announced on Tuesday, will force companies and banks to report the gains or losses on their portfolios of securities, as well as futures and options holdings. They will have to provide the current market value of their holdings at the end of the fiscal year, March 31.
Those portfolios have been a crucial means by which companies, banks and other financial institutions conceal hidden reserves of cash -- or, as in the last year of falling share prices, mounting losses. For instance, Mr. Zielinski estimates that as a group the major Japanese banks have lost about $15 billion on their bond holdings.
"We'll finally really know which banks are good at trading and which are not," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia.
In addition, the ministry has enacted a rule to force affiliated companies, members of secretive corporate families known as keiretsu, to disclose more about transactions within the group. And earlier this month a new rule took effect that obliges investors to report holdings of 5 percent or more in a company, a measure similar to the 13D disclosure rule in the United States.
 This last rule has already caused several sensations: T. Boone Pickens, the Texas financier, was forced to disclose that he got the money to acquire a major stake in Koito, a maker of auto parts, from a well-known Japanese raider, and several other companies discovered that some of their biggest shareholders were investment groups controlled by organized crime families, or yakuza.
By themselves, none of the rule changes will radically alter the view that only a small number of Japanese insiders have access to accurate data on corporations' real financial status. But they are regarded as representing a trend that, most foreigners hope, will gain momentum.
"This is a new step forward, and an important one, but not the last," said a Finance Ministry official involved in instituting the measures.
These changes follow last year's tightening of the laws against insider trading. In the long run, however, the changes in the disclosure rules may have a greater impact for the simple reason that few expect the insider trading rules to be rigorously enforced against everyone: manipulation and insider trading are widely seen as too important to political fund-raising to be halted.
The perception that Japan's stock market serves a special function in politics was heightened by the Recruit scandal last year, in which the Prime Minister then, Noboru Takeshita, and a large portion of his Cabinet were disgraced for having accepted low-priced shares in a company about to go public, and a more recent case in which a former Cabinet minister, Toshiyuki Inamura, was indicted on tax evasion charges because the authorities said he had not reported profits earned from trading on inside information.
Although banks and other companies have at times objected to greater disclosure, they have muted their protests now because many of Japan's larger corporations want to gain access to foreign capital markets with stricter standards.
When the Mitsubishi Bank decided to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange last year, for example, it issued a very un-Japanese disclosure document with data never made available to Japanese investors.
The latest rule change, requiring listed companies to disclose the value of their securities portfolios, is to be phased in. That could provide banks in particular with a crucial advantage.
As of March 31, they must report the market value of their holdings of stocks, bonds that are convertible into stock and bonds that come with warrants or options to buy stock later at a preset price. But companies do not have to report their considerably larger holdings of regular bonds, including Government bonds, until March 31, 1992. That gives them an extra year for the markets to recover before having to report how badly they have been battered by this year's slide. Nor are updated reports on their large land holdings required.
All the same, the veil is being lifted slightly in what is expected to be an irreversible process. "It will make this market efficient, but a little more boring," said a nostalgic Mr. Zielinski.

HEADLINE: Pacific Telesis Decides to Quit Real Estate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Pacific Telesis Group announced on Wednesday that it was leaving the real estate business and would take a $60 million after-tax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to offset expected losses on property sales.
The decision is the latest recognition of losses by a regional Bell company that diversified into industries very different from the provision of local telephone service, only to find that its new investments were far more vulnerable to an economic slowdown. 
 "What it shows is they ought to stay at home, ringing up the revenues from local telephone service," said Jack B. Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber.
 
Plan to Invest Proceeds

 Pacific Telesis will sell its entire $475 million portfolio of office buildings and industrial sites over the next several years and invest the proceeds in telecommunications services, particularly wireless telephone businesses overseas, Gerald A. Beatty, a company spokesman, said. The company had said in March that it would not invest any more money in real estate and would begin reducing its holdings gradually.
Mr. Beatty said Pacific Telesis now believed it could earn better returns in telecommunications than in real estate.
The BellSouth Corporation disclosed on Dec. 7 that it had taken a $30 million loss on the sale of its computer-leasing business. The Bell Atlantic Corporation announced on Oct. 26 that it would take a onetime charge of $40 million to reflect the shrinking market value of its non-telephone financial services, which include equipment leasing and lending to other companies and real estate projects.
U S West Inc. said earlier this year that it would seek to sell its $1.4 billion real estate portfolio within five to seven years. Poor returns on investment and volatility in the real estate market prompted the decision, Sharon K. Price, a company spokeswoman, said.
Although no charges against earnings have been taken, the weakening economy is now making it hard to sell the properties, she said, so that it may take more than seven years to sell them all.
"It looks like we'll be in the landlord business for a while," Ms. Price added.
A few Wall Street analysts, notably those at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, have been warning that the local telephone business is much more vulnerable to setbacks now than in previous economic downturns. The structure of the telephone industry has changed, and the seven regional Bell companies, which were created by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, have invested in a variety of industries that offer potentially higher returns than traditional local phone service, but are also more risky.
More local phone concerns, like the New York Telephone Company, are charging customers by the call or by the minute of calling, instead of charging a fixed rate for unlimited calling. Some analysts warn that while very few consumers disconnected their phones during previous recessions to save money, they may forgo some local calls in the next economic downturn to trim their phone bills.
A third of the regional Bell companies' revenues now consists of fees from long-distance carriers for carrying calls from customers' homes and businesses to the nearest long-distance switching center. The number of long-distance calls has historically been more sensitive than the number of local calls to the health of the nation's economy, so that these revenues may grow very slowly in a downturn.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: The Talk of Bahrain;
In an Island Playground in the Gulf, The G.I.'s Let Down Their Guard

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain

 BODY:
At first glance, it could be Kansas.
The lobby of the Regency Inter-Continental is filled with young American servicemen and a few Britons in blue jeans or running shorts and Reeboks. Given their crew cuts, tans and telltale tatoos, they could only be soldiers. 
 About half the rooms at this and the four other luxury hotels on this relatively relaxed and tolerant island in the austere and unforgiving Persian Gulf are now occupied by soldiers, some living here on "T.D.Y.," temporary duty, or in from the Saudi desert on "R n R."
Bahrain, the smallest and poorest of the gulf states, is accustomed to being host to the alcohol deprived. Saudis have been coming here in droves ever since 1986 when a causeway costing more than $1 billion opened, linking the Saudi mainland with this island of 500,000, of whom 165,000 are foreign.
"We'd like to make Bahrain the Florida of the gulf," said Tarek al-Moayyad, Bahrain's Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism. Judging from the scene in Bahrain, he is succeeding.
Even before the crisis, Saudis came to Bahrain for the Islamic weekend, Thursday and Friday, to enjoy the island's beaches, its bars and the Philippine women who bump and grind their way through ear-shattering electrified rock music.
Now the Saudis have largely been replaced by Western soldiers. American officials declined to discuss how much money was being spent on housing soldiers in luxury hotels, where room rates for business travelers start at more than $150 a night. The United States worked out a package deal for the military at a huge discount, they said, and military personnel have been filling not only the five-star hotels, but every other hotel on the island, as well as some newly pitched tents.
Just how many military men and women are here is also a secret. They number in the thousands, but many are on the 65 ships that make up the two aircraft carrier battle groups here, some of which are anchored offshore.
Though there has been no official announcement, more than 8,000 service men and women, mostly American marines, are camped out at a Bahraini base at the southern end of the island, Bahraini officials say.
In the first weeks after the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait in August, Bahrain, traumatized by the invasion, turned away most journalists. But now both the military and civilians are welcome here, and it is the American military that is reluctant to talk.
Public affairs spokesmen for the Navy, which has had a command post here since 1949, said they were too busy to provide a briefing. But one spokesman said at an informal briefing over beer at a local bar that there would soon be 5 aircraft carrier battle groups in this "area of responsibility" -- that is, more than 120 American ships.
Navy ships enforcing the embargo against Iraq had intercepted more than 5,500 ships by mid-December, boarded more than 500 of them and diverted about 24.
Most of the troops seem well behaved. But incidents do occur. There were two drunken brawls in two nights at the Inter-Continental disco recently.
So the American Embassy has decided to begin an International Courtesy Patrol, or in normal parlance, shore patrols, consisting of three servicemen -- one British, one American, one Bahraini -- all in civilian clothes. The Americans and British hope these patrols will soon add a touch of decorum to the more than 20 hotel bars and discos that are filled each night to capacity.
 
A Welcome for Kuwaitis
 Bahrain is not only playing host to the military. Since the crisis began, some 10,000 Kuwaitis have found shelter here. With little fanfare, the Government turned over some 200 housing units just built for Bahrainis in Hamad Town, a spiffy new compound of 5,000 white duplex houses with red shutters, only a 10-minute drive from Manama.
Soon after arriving, groups of families put up tents outside their new temporary housing in which they could hold their diwaniyas, or majlises, informal assemblies on weekends and in the evenings that are a mainstay of Kuwaiti social and political life. Their new houses are sparsely furnished, but the tents have all the comforts of home -- incense burners, thermoses of tea and coffee, endless supplies of Marlboro cigarettes, cassette recorders and Persian carpets.
In one tent just off Road 1423 of Hamad Town, Jaber al Mari, 35 years old, mused about his country's plight and his own future. "We tried to fight the Iraqis, but there were too many," said the former soldier, who lived before the invasion in Mina Abdullah Fehaheel, near the Iraqi border. "We weren't ready."
Unlike many of his countrymen, he and his eight children had no villa in Cannes or house in London to which they could flee. So they came here, and are now living in free Bahraini housing with a stipend provided by the Kuwaiti government in exile.
"The Bahrainis have been very kind to us," he said. "They've given us what we needed, thanks to Sheik Issa," he added, referring to Bahrain's ruler, Emir Issa bin Sulman al-Khalifa. "It's almost like home."
But Mr. al-Mari will not be here long. He said he was leaving his family here soon to join several thousand Kuwaiti soldiers who have been training at Hafer al-Bater, near the Saudi border. "I want to fight with the Americans this time," he said, ruefully. "This time we will fight, not lose."
 
A Lift for the Economy
 Bahrainis do not seem to mind their new guests. Quite the contrary. They have provided a degree of assurance and a lift to the economy of this trading and banking center, which was badly hit by capital flight immediately after the Iraqi invasion.
Bahrain has benefited from price increases for what is still its largest source of income -- 40,000 barrels a day of oil and the refining of some 250,000 barrels a day, mostly for Saudi Arabia. Some capital has returned to the more than 70 banks here in the gulf's only offshore financial capital, which had record assets of some $73 billion in March.
Bahraini and Western officials here said there were no military targets to speak of on this island. But nerves are still frayed, since Bahrain is only 30 minutes across the gulf from the giant Saudi air base at Dhahran.
But Mr. al-Moayyad insists, and Western diplomats adamantly agree, most Bahrainis support the large Western presence here. Islamic Shiites, who make up about 70 percent of the population and have close ties to Iran, have taken a "see, we told you so" attitude.
Things were politically difficult for many of them during the Iran-Iraq war, so they enjoy reminding officials that Bahrain was among Iraq's most ardent supporters. And Sunni Muslims, who include the ruling family, see the soldiers as protection for their interests and position.
There are few public demands for greater democratization and accountability, as there are in some parts of the gulf.
"At the moment, our main concern is security and defense," Mr. al-Moayyad said. "The man in the street right now would rather have security than democracy, and given the way things are, can you blame him?"

Looking Ahead, Guided by the Past

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT'S ahead in the New Year? The crystal ball (clouded as usual) turns up these items:
The Bush Administration is backing an overhaul of the banking laws, written during the Depression, to permit American banks to compete aggressively all over the country and against giant international competitors. The commercial banks would be allowed to move into investment banking, securities dealing, life insurance and other areas. They might even begin to play the dominant role in guiding big nonfinancial corporations, as they did in the 19th century. 
 Would this be a good thing for the economy?
David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services, said: "America abolished universal banking in the 1930's on the grounds that it represented a dangerous concentration of financial power and encouraged underwriting abuses. But as a result of the current banking crisis and the public dissatisfaction with Wall Street's stewardship of the corporate sector during the 1980's, the Congress may have to rethink the economic role of the banks."
The proposed changes in banking legislation, Mr. Hale suggests, raise some fundamental issues:
Would a bank-based form of capitalism encourage American business to take longer perspectives than the stock market brand of capitalism?
With the wider diffusion of information today, could universal banks dominate American finance in the 21st century as they did in the 19th century?
And could we achieve the long-term investment horizons provided by the bank-dominated form of capitalism, present today in Germany and Japan, without losing the flexibility and entrepreneurship of a form of capitalism driven by a stock market?
Mr. Hale's answer is to let the two forms of capitalism coexist in the United States by lowering the barriers between banking and commerce while creating fiscal incentives for American businessesto use more equity and less debt. And he foresees a wave of bank mergers in 1991 to head off failures.
How long will the recession last?
Geoffrey H. Moore, director of Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, concludes that the current recession began in June. Since the eight preceding postwar recessions lasted 6 to 16 months, the odds are that if it is an exceptionally long recession, it will end in the final quarter of 1991, and if it is an average one, it does not have more than another quarter to run.
But William H. Tehan of the brokerage firm P. R. Herzig & Company, contends that the economy is not in a typical recession at all. "Recession is the wrong description," he said. "The present situation, with its attendant financial deterioration, bears no resemblance to recession." The United States, he maintains, is in "a liquidity squeeze induced by a historically high level of debt combined with a sharp contraction in credit demand." And he argues that this is "an entirely different situation not seen in the U.S. since the early 1930's."
Another worrisome parallel with the 1930's is thestrain on open trading relations and the threat of protectionism that followed the collapse of the Uruguay Round of trade talks earlier this month.
Richard McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who played a part in the trade talks, said that before they ended, the talks actually accomplished two important things. First, they advanced the political education of the American team on how not to negotiate: not by laying down ultimatums, as on agriculture. And they also showed the European Community what is at stake: the preservation of an open world trading system and the health of every country's economy.
The dangers of a return to Smoot-Hawley protectionism and retaliation are so clear that the stalled negotiations are likely to be revived in 1991.
Soaring oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait knocked investors for a loop. Will their spirits recover in the new year?
Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston, said: "The animal spirits of the economy are unraveling more dramatically than thought, given the factual consequences of the third oil shock. Even if oil prices were to have remained at $35 per barrel, the net drag on U.S. G.N.P. growth, measured by the higher oil import bill, would have been around half a percentage point, once OPEC's imports from the U.S. picked up. That would be serious but insufficient to cause a steep recession. Furthermore, oil prices did not stay up, implying an even smaller negative."
But oil shows no signs of losing its power to fire the imagination, and the anxiety, of investors. A leading petroleum economist, M. A. Adelman, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers "the comments of some brighter people than myself" to make the point:
Edgar Faure: "Whatever concerns oil is at once adorned with romance. No other raw material so engages the imagination, and inspires so many fine phrases."
And Dr. Samuel Johnson: "The mind which has feasted on a luxurious diet of fiction has small taste for the insipidity of truth."'
If the oil market is putting its money where its intelligence is, the odds are against a gulf war.

HEADLINE: At the Bar

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
A teary-eyed, bleary-eyed actress stands in a yuppie kitchen, like the ones in "War of the Roses" or "Fatal Attraction." The distraught woman stares forlornly out the window, runs her fingers through her hair, fidgets with a phone line.
"My husband and I can't even talk to each other!" she laments. "I'm not willing to lose the children or my home! I have so many questions. I have no answers!" 
 Then there is the calm of a man's voice. "A Maryland attorney is standing by to assist you," he purrs in fluent disk-jockese. "Privately. Confidentially. The Legal Help Line till 10 P.M. Only three dollars a minute, first minute free."
Cut back to the woman, now tranquilly lifting the window shade and letting the sun shine in. If the commercial had a classical score, it would now consist of the post-thunderstorm scene from the "William Tell Overture." "I understand my options," the woman says. "Things are looking brighter. I'm starting to see things in a whole new light."
 The tale is only one of three half-minute melodramas that have grown familiar to Maryland cable viewers this month from Annapolis to Havre de Grace. In the second, a woman is fighting with her landlord but cannot afford a lawyer. In the third, a businessman in whose angry hands a telephone receiver could become a lethal weapon curses his perpetually unavailable lawyer. "I've left messages for two days!" he splutters. "I can't wait any longer!" They, too, are rescued by the Legal Help Line.
The line is the brainchild of David Sellman, a 34-year-old practitioner in Baltimore. He is among several lawyers now colonizing the demimonde of the 900 number, that telephonic red light district dominated by purveyors of dates, confessions, and fantasies. Slowly but inexorably, the rapidly growing 1-900 directory lists 4LAW alongside GALS, HOT, HUNK and LIPS.
Already, dial-a-lawyer services are available in California, Texas, Illinois, Georgia and Oklahoma. Then there is Mr. Sellman, who hopes to be to cheapo legal services what Kirk & Kaye were to televisions in "Avalon," the film by his fellow Baltimorean Barry Levinson.
"Although there are a tremendous number of lawyers out there, there are a lot of people who don't have access to one," Mr. Sellman said. "The majority of the population can't afford $150 an hour. And most legal problems can be resolved in relatively short order."
If the quest to perfect dial-a-lawyer services were the space race, Mr. Sellman might be Alan Shepard. But Michael Cane of Huntington Beach, Calif., would be Yuri Gagarin.
That is, while the Baltimore operation is still in its suborbital stages, Tele-Lawyer, Mr. Cane's pioneering enterprise, has begun circling the globe. In California, Hawaii and Alaska already, with Illinois and perhaps New York to follow, people are saying what the faithful Bernstein shouts in the classic Orson Welles movie: "Mr. Kane! Mr. Kane!"
This Mr. Cane, 36, had his epiphany in early 1989, while on sabbatical from the University of Hawaii Law School. While traveling one day to a weed abatement hearing, he was struck by how often he was stopped for curbside legal advice. Everyone had legal problems, he figured; why not create a telephone service offering answers?
Over the next nine months, he set up his operation. It includes an advanced computer system, one with a data base in domestic relations, criminal law, wills and other garden variety areas of concern, as well as an electronic check for conflicts of interest. That complete, he found lawyers to field the calls.
"I advertised a job with no stress, without the gripes, the bitching, the litigation and the tension," he recalled. "They stand in line for this kind of job."
Mr. Cane charges $3 a minute, and the calibrations get even finer than that: if the caller uses A.T.&T., for instance, he is charged five cents a second. Together, Mr. Cane and his lawyers are handling 50 to 80 calls a day, and have yet even to face their first malpractice suit. Indeed, to him the market is, as the economists say, infinitely elastic: Many people cannot afford lawyers, he says, and those who can cannot find them.
"Attorneys have forgotten about service," he said. "They don't call back their clients and when they do, they treat them like idiots."
The new service has not been welcome. When another California company tried to penetrate Oklahoma this month, the State Bar Association started an investigation into possible unauthorized practice of law. But the establishment bar has mostly been quiescent -- perhaps, Mr. Sellman speculated, because it is still napping.
"They've not recoiled because it hasn't come out and hit them yet," he said. "The potential of this thing is tremendous."

Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
 A plunge in new orders for durable goods during November helped to push up prices of Treasury securities yesterday, as interest rates fell.
The 10.5 percent drop in new orders was at least twice as large as most analysts had forecast. The reported decline accentuated problems currently being experienced in the nation's manufacturing sector. 
 "Everybody was looking for a drop in durables, but not the widespread and steep decline that we got," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
The numbers "created the attitude among market participants that the economy was weaker than expected," he said.
 
30-Year Bonds Increase

 The benchmark 30-year bonds rose nearly a half-point and the yield fell to 8.23 percent, compared with 8.28 percent late Wednesday.
The surprising durable goods report was the focal point of the session, but traders and analysts said that action by the Federal Reserve Board to soothe tattered nerves in short-term money markets was also important.
In addition, market participants said that demand at the final auction of new four-year notes was about as expected.
At the auction, where $8.5 billion worth of securities were sold, bids on the notes produced an average yield of 7.66 percent, down sharply from the 8.53 percent average yield at the last four-year note auction on Sept. 26.
As previously announced, beginning in January the Treasury will replace the four-year note sales with monthly auctions of five-year notes.
In other developments, early yesterday the Federal Reserve Board moved to calm participants in short-term money markets by adding what analysts said were significant amounts of reserves to the banking system.
The move came a day after rates on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market had traded sharply higher for all of Wednesday, reaching a record 100 percent late in the session.
Analysts said the big move in the funds rate was attributed in part to the fact that Wednesday marked the end of a two-week reporting period for the nation's banks, a time when they must report reserve positions to the Fed.
Demand for overnight money is often heavy at such times. In addition, those pressures were compounded by year-end funding needs.
"Year-end funding pressures are nothing new," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "But the intensity with which those pressures have hit this year underscores the nervousness that people are feeling about lending money right now."
 
Fed's Addition of Reserves

 Even with the Fed's addition of reserves yesterday, the funds rate never fell back to the 7 percent level that most analysts see as the Fed's target for the rate. During the day funds traded in a wide range of 10 percent to 7 1/4 percent.
"Even though it didn't have an enormous influence, the Fed's move calmed the market somewhat," Mr. Sullivan said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered in late trading at a price of 105 5/8, up 15/32, to yield 8.23 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent ten-year notes were offered at 102 7/8, up 9/32, to yield 8.07 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.23 percent.
 
 Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
 In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.47 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.57 percent.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was exceptionally slow, dealers reported.
Prices of most investment-grade bonds rose 1/4 point to 1/2 point. Prices of widely quoted municipal bonds rose by about 1/8 point.
Because of the Christmas holiday, the Federal Reserve Board will not release its weekly money supply numbers until today.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: 3 Youths Seized In 75 Robberies In Last 2 Weeks

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A third teen-ager was arrested yesterday and charged with being part of a gang that investigators believe held up at least 75 people at gunpoint in Queens and Nassau County in the last two weeks, the police said.
Two other suspects were captured on Wednesday night after a wild chase and shootout on the Belt Parkway. Investigators said last night that they were searching for two other men they believe took part in the robbery spree, which they said was the most holdups committed by a single gang in Queens in recent memory. 
 "They seemed to accelerate as they went along, doing more and more each time they went out," said Inspector Charles Prestia, commanding officer of the Central Robbery Unit.
Since Dec. 13, when the police first noticed a string of similar robberies in Queens, five teen-agers are believed to have stolen at least 15 cars and cruised throughout Queens and western Nassau County in search of Christmas shoppers loading presents into the trunks of cars, Inspector Prestia said.
Working in pairs or in fours, the gang robbed all the victims at gunpoint on streets or parking lots between 7 and 11 P.M., the police said. They usually began robbing people in northern Queens and worked their way south to the Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park neighborhoods, where most of them live, investigators said.
 
Items Recovered
 The police say they believe that the gang held up at least 75 people before they were caught, taking packages, purses, wallets, jewelry and coats. In two-thirds of the robberies, the victims were hit over the head with a pistol before the robbers spoke a word, Inspector Prestia said. In three cases, the victims were shot without warning before they were robbed. Two of those shot were hospitalized. None suffered life-threatening wounds.
The police did not release the names of the victims yesterday because investigators had not yet conducted lineups to see if the victims could identify the youths. At least 60 victims were brought to the 109th Precinct Station house in Queens last night for the lineups.
Inspector Prestia said the gang switched to a new tactic as Christmas neared. They feigned accidents by bumping into the rear of victims' cars and then robbed the victims when they got out to inspect the damage to their cars, he said.
The two suspects arrested Wednesday night were captured while driving a gray Ford Taurus that had been stolen at gunpoint from a retired police officer earlier that afternoon.
 
Dozens of Police Vehicles
 Two detectives spotted the Taurus outside a Burger King on Rockaway Boulevard and South Conduit Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, about 8 P.M. After a fifteen-minute chase on the Van Wyck and Belt Parkways, the two suspects were penned in by dozens of police vehicles a half-mile from the Lefferts Boulevard exit on the Van Wyck.
The driver of the stolen car was identified as Harold Marshall, 18 years old, of 133-14 Linden oulevard in Richmond Hill, Queens, investigators said. Mr. Marshall, who is unemployed and does not attend high school, was arrested on attempted murder charges in April 1989 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn in a case that is still pending, the police said.
The passenger in the car, Michael Wells, 17, of 133-08 132d Street in Richmond Hill, also was arrested in August in South Jamaica, Queens, on an armed robbery charge.
Items said to have been stolen in 11 robberies earlier Wednesday evening -- handbags, a leather coat, money and gold chains -- were found inside the Taurus, the police said.
The police yesterday afternoon arrested a third youth, Norris Thomas, 17, in a car outside his mother's home at 790 Eldert Lane in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Items from at least 13 robberies was found in the car's truck, the police said.
Mr. Thomas's parents said he had been arrested several times on robbery and burglary charges in the past, had served seven months in prison on one conviction and had dropped out of school. His father, also Norris Thomas, said he had bought his son a set of turntables for Christmas so that he could start a business mixing rap music tapes.
"He's been trying to stay out of trouble," Mr. Thomas said. "He's been doing good. We give him enough money so that he doesn't have to go out and rob people to get it."

HEADLINE: AIDS in Women Rising, but Many Ignore the Threat

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
After two years of marriage and three children, a 21-year-old woman in the Bronx learned six months ago that she carries the AIDS virus. Her 40-year-old husband is a prime suspect in the infection, but so is her first boyfriend, the only two sexual partners she said she has had.
To this day, as she copes with the stunning discovery and feelings of guilt and anger over the poor health of her 17-month-old son, who was born infected, the woman still does not know whom to blame. Her former boyfriend can't be found, and her husband refuses to be tested. 
 "You hear about AIDS on the radio or on TV and you don't pay attention," she said, explaining why she had never given condoms a thought."All I heard," she said, pulling up two wisps of her long black hair and rolling her eyes upward to illustrate her state of mind when she fell in love, "was little birds carrying me."
The story of this woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be disclosed, is a familiar one in New York and other cities, where the disease is concentrated largely in poor minority communities. But eventhough reported AIDS cases among women are growing faster than among men, many women still do not perceive themselves as vulnerable. Even when they do, those who treat and counsel women say, factors like traditional sex roles and economic hardship make it difficult for many to change the practices that put them at risk.
The use of condoms, which offer protection for the sexually active, is not in many cases the woman's prerogative, these professionals say. They note that many women, in their role as nurturers, tend to think last of their own health.
Even more daunting, how do you convince a woman who is married, or in a long-term monogamous relationship, that she, too, could be at risk? In large cities like New York, which has the largest number of AIDS cases in the country, geography itself is arisk factor for any woman, AIDS experts say.
"I can engage in high-risk behavior in the Dakotas with very little likelihood of acquiring AIDS," said Dr. Howard Minkoff, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and also obstetrics director at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn. "If I practice the same behavior in the South Bronx, my chances of acquiring the disease increase tremendously."
Infected mothers often have infected children. Officials at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimate that nearly 6,000 women with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, gave birth last year in the nation. About a third of the newborns whose mother carry the virus become in fected themselves. In some areas of New York City, as many as 2 percent of all infants were born of infected mothers between November 1987 and September 1990, the New York State Department of Health has found.
Because of the misperception of risk, many women find out they are infected only when their infected child becomes ill. Advocates like Act-Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, blame the Centers for Disease Control in part for this, because it does not include in its list of AIDS-defining illnesses the symptoms often seen in infected women -- for example, pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the fallopian tubes or the uterus.
Many doctors, in turn, fail to associate gynecological disorders like this with the HIV virus, critics argue, depriving many women of early diagnosis and treatment and of benefits for people disabled by the virus, like Social Security disability payments.
 
Most Victims From Poor Areas
 Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledges that research on AIDS in women has been limited, although he says it is receiving increased attention. One problem, he notes, is that most women with AIDS come, as most drug addicts do, from poor, minority areas with inadequate health care.
But whether for lack of early recognition or access to treatment, studies show that women with AIDS do not survive nearly as long after diagnosis as men do.
Federal and city officials say reported AIDS cases are growing faster among women than among men. And for women, cases attributed to intercourse with infected men are rising faster than those stemming from the sharing of needles during drug use.
In New York City, where AIDS has become the leading cause of death in women 25 to 34 years old, reported cases in women rose 36 percent in the last 12 months, compared with 28 percent for men, said Dr. Polly Thomas, director of AIDS and HIV surveillance for the city's Health Department.
 
Heterosexual AIDS Threat
 From 1988 to 1989, officials at the Centers for Disease Control say, the number of AIDS cases in women nationwide increased 29 percent, compared with 18 percent in men. Women account for 4,142, or 14 percent, of all adult cases in New York City and 10 percent, or 15,133 cases, nationwide.
Although the overwhelming majority of AIDS cases in New York City women involve intravenous drug use rather than sex with infected men (61 percent versus 25 percent), female cases attributed to heterosexual sex rose by 39 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 37 percent for those from drug use, Dr. Thomas said.
The same trend is seen nationwide, said Ruth L. Berkelman, chief of the HIV and AIDS surveillance branch at the Centers for Disease Control. She said heterosexual AIDS cases in women rose 34 percent, compared with 19 percent for drug-use cases.
New York City Health Department figures show that 46 percent of AIDS cases among women under the age of 24 in the city stemmed from sex with an infected man, double the rate found among women who are over 25.
Health professionals say that as a group, adolescents face a high risk of infection because they are more likely to have more than one sex partner, usually someone older.
 
Warnings Often Dismissed
 Many women, AIDS prevention workers said, dismiss safe sex warnings because they link risk to "groups" rather than individual behavior. Some women, for instance, mistakenly believe that if they quit intravenous drugs, they are no longer at risk, overlooking sexual transmission.
The New York State Department of Health projects that in 1995 there will be more new AIDS cases among women who are sex partners of intravenous drug users than among homosexual and bisexual men, the group first hit by the epidemic.
"I knew you could get it from being an intravenous drug user, and I wasn't, and I wasn't sleeping with a homosexual," recalled Tina B., a 21-year-old Bronx woman who was infected by a man she lived with for two years and who now attends an AIDS program for adolescents. "I knew how it was transmitted, but I didn't think he had it or that I'd get it."
In recent interviews, infected women cited other factors for not using condoms or asking questions about a partner's sexual history or submitting to the test for the HIV virus before pregnancy.
 
Feeling of Invulnerability
 For some, particularly teen-agers, there is a feeling of invulnerability to the disease. For others, the risk is too intangible and the disease seems too distant, particularly if they are more preoccupied with finding a place to live or putting food on the table.
And as with many men, some women simply refuse to deal with the responsibility.
A 28-year-old Brooklyn woman who is awaiting the results of her HIV test said: "He informed me. I was aware. We were using condoms, but I didn't like them. I figure if God is going to take me, He's going to take me anyway."
But many other women know the risk and want protection, yet are not able to negotiate or demand measures against infection, AIDS prevention workers say. Many women depend on men for economic support and fear jeopardizing the relationship by insisting that their partners use a condom or be tested for the AIDS virus.
Because of these complexities, outreach organizations like Life Force in Brooklyn are happy to raise the issue for discussion at least, so women can start thinking about HIV infection and make informed choices. Life Force, some of whose members are women infected with the AIDS virus, goes into beauty shops, housing project lobbies, health clinics and out on the streets to reach women. Its representatives, armed with literature, dispense practical advice.
 
Overcoming Opposition
 The group tells mothers to think of their children and what would happen to them if the mother got sick. They tell women where to go for help if they are battered, need shelter or a drug program. They share ways to get resistant partners to use condoms.
"I personally tell women to lie to their husband and tell them they have a vaginal infection," said Iris de la Cruz, a 37-year-old former drug addict and the sexual partner of an intravenous drug user. She was diagnosed as having AIDS three years ago.
Ravinia Hayes-Cozier, director of AIDS education for the New York City Department of Health said that "the kind of attention that needs to be given has not been given to women and AIDS" but that her office was preparing to focus more on the problem. She stressed that putting out prevention messages was not enough. Educating women about the AIDS risk must deal with everything from acquainting them with a condom to teaching them how to bring up the subject with a partner, she said.
"If we're going to have an impact, we have to treat the relationship," she said, adding that women were "going to get resistance."
 
Love and Anger
 In the Bronx, the 21-year-old mother who recently learned of her infection with the AIDS virus has yet to convince her 40-year-old husband to be tested for the virus. She strongly suspects him, and their relationship now alternates between love and anger, the kind that one day led her to throw her wedding band out of an apartment window.
"When I heard HIV, I said, 'My kid doesn't have that -- I know I don't have it,' " she said in tears, recalling the moment when she received the results of the baby's test. "And then I thought of my husband. He's the one that's had a lot of relationships."
But she also desperately needs him, she said, to take care of her other children, a 2 1/2-year-old daughter and a 17-month-old boy, if she becomes ill. Both have tested negative for the virus.
Her other 17-month-old boy, the infected twin, has been hospitalized three times with pneumonia and other ailments, although the mother remains in good health. The mother hopes to live to see her baby through the disease.
"My son is my main thing right now," she said.

HEADLINE: LBJ Stations Up for Sale

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 27

 BODY:
 The family of former President Lyndon B. Johnson has put the KLBJ radio stations on the market, a company executive said today.
John Barr, executive vice president of the LBJ Company, said the family had retained the Ted Hepburn Company to consider offers for the AM and FM stations in Austin. He said their value had been placed at $13.5 million. 
 The Johnson family has owned the business for more than 40 years. The family tried to sell it in 1987 for $27.5 million, but the deal fell through when the Chase Group, a New York-based investment company, did not meet the deadline to complete the sale.
Bill Jamar, whose Jamar & Associates handled the 1987 sales attempt, said it would be hard to get $13.5 million in today's economic climate.
But Mr. Barr said: "The stations are basically making money. They always have."

HEADLINE: Dow Declines by 11.63 After a Fire Delay

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks sagged yesterday in a session shortened by a transformer fire that delayed trading until 11 A.M., or an hour and a half after the normal opening.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.63 points, to 2,625.50. In the broader market, 892 stocks fell while only 598 advanced. Activity in the truncated session rose to 102.9 million shares from 78.7 million the day before. 
 A Fire Department spokesman said 100 to 200 workers in an office building at 55 Water Street were evacuated between 2:30 and 3 A.M. after the explosion of a Con Ed transformer enclosure outside the building sent flames eight stories high, broke windows on three floors and filled parts of the 54-story tower with acrid smoke. The building houses computer operations shared by the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and regional exchanges throughout the country.
Officials of the exchanges said that after inspecting the site for health hazards, the city's Environmental Protection Department permitted workers to go into the building at 10 A.M.
Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman, said newly released data on big-ticket durable goods orders for November were "significantly below expectations," helping to push bond prices higher and, for a time, lifting stock prices. He said that except for holding volume down, the fire had "not much effect on prices."
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said two selling waves in the afternoon had knocked 16 points off the Dow.
"Stocks sold off because of a lack of interest," Mr. Hill remarked. "People just don't want to do anything at the end of the year, facing the uncertainty in the Middle East."
He noted that oil and financial stocks were strong Wednesday but gave back some of their gains yesterday.
Crude oil, which rose $1.30 a barrel on Wednesday for its biggest gain in three weeks, fell 21 cents yesterday, to $27.01.
Occidental Petroleum fell 5/8, to 19; ARCO 1 1/2, to 122 7/8; Phillips Petroleum3/8, to 26 1/2; Chevron 5/8, to 72 5/8, and Columbia Gas 7/8, to 46 1/2. Chemical Bank fell 1/4, to 11 1/8; Chase Manhattan 1/2, to 10 1/8, and General Electric 1/8, to 57 1/4. Bankers Trust New York slid 2, to 42 1/8, and J. P. Morgan 2, to 44.
In yet another sign of Wall Street nervousness over weak sales or earnings, Tiffany lost 2 1/4, to 35, on top of a 4 3/8 decline a day earlier after it reported holiday sales gains that Wall Street found disappointing. It was the ninth-most-active Big Board stock and the only one of the 10 to move as much as a point.
UAL, which rose 2 on Wednesday with no news to account for it, fell 2, to 113 yesterday. It was the only significant move among the Dow transportation stocks.
Digital Equipment fell 1 5/8, to 56 1/4, in what seemed like profit taking. Other technology stocks were mixed, with I.B.M. up 1/8, to 113 5/8, and Motorola down 1, to 52 1/4.
Ralston Purina, which had been lagging behind other food stocks over concern about its growth, rose 1 1/4, to 101. John M. McMillin, food analyst at Prudential-Bache, said early this month that growth prospects would improve with lower grain costs and declining interest rates.

HEADLINE: Big Gain in Nursing Students Lifts Hopes Amid a Shortage

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Nursing school enrollment rose sharply this year, according to a new study, raising hopes that the four-year-old nursing shortage may be easing.
Preliminary results from the study, by the National League for Nursing, found that about 230,000 students were enrolled in registered nurse programs this fall, a 14 percent increase over last year's enrollment of 201,458. The highest enrollment in the past 20 years was 250,000 students in 1983. 
 While the current shortage still has many hospitals scrambling to find enough qualified nurses, experts in the field say they expect it to ease gradually over the next few years.
 
'Beginning to Subside'
 "I think the nursing shortage is beginning to subside, not just because of rising enrollments, but because of increased sensitivity to the idea that nurses are a scarce resource, and should not be used to fill in for orderlies, bookkeepers and dietitians," said Peri Rosenfeld, of the National League for Nursing, a nonprofit research and advocacy group based in New York. "Hospitals are rethinking what nurses should do, and freeing them from other tasks to do real nursing."
She and others said the revamping of nursing jobs, plus rising salaries and an improving image of the nursing profession, had combined to make nursing a more attractive career.
At the University of Texas nursing school in San Antonio, there have been far more applicants than the school could handle for the last few terms.
"We admit about 90 full-time students and 15 part-time students twice a year, and for the fall term, we had 121 students on our waiting list," said Barbara Lust, the associate dean of student affairs. "And we've probably got 70 on the waiting list for the spring term. Back in 1985, we admitted everybody who was eligible and still had a few spaces."
With the economic downturn limiting job opportunities in other fields, experts say, nursing school is likely to become an even more popular option.
There is a consensus among nursing educators and students that the image of nursing is improving because of television shows like "China Beach" and other favorable representations and because of the increasing responsibilities that nurses bear.
"My grandparents' initial reaction was, 'Why do you want to change bedpans for the rest of your life?' and when I first told my friends, they said I should be a lawyer or a doctor, but that attitude is changing," said Valerie Rotter, a 20-year-old junior at Rutgers University College of Nursing. "In my class, we're a pretty smart bunch of people. Nurses are a whole new breed these days, with our own theorists and our own set of diagnoses. It's a lot more than bedpans, or waiting to hear the doctors' point of view."
 
More Older Students
 Nursing schools, where programs can last two, three or four years, are also attracting a new and older breed of students, the National League of Nursing says. The average age of new nurses is now 31, as against 24 or 25 in the early 1980's. More than half are married, Ms. Rosenfeld said, and about half of the married ones have children.
"We're seeing many more older, second-career women, many of them with young children at home, who see that nursing can be a challenging and flexible job for moms," said Ms. Rosenfeld. "What we're not seeing is much growth in the number of men who become nurses."
Men have long made up less that 5 percent of registered nurses. While a few universities, like the one in San Antonio, have more than 10 percent male students, most see little growth in the number of men in the field.
Ken Dion, 29, who is in his last year of a four-year nursing program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, was a paramedic for several years before enrolling.
"I enjoyed being a paramedic, but I saw nursing as a way to expand and refine my skills, and give me more latitude," he said. "I talk to men my age, and I tell them when I get out of school, I can travel all over the world. There are all kinds of opportunities for me."
 
Continued Demand Is Seen
 Indeed, just as nursing school enrollment was dipping below 185,000 in 1987 and 1988, the demand for nurses in non-hospital jobs soared. Thousands of nurses left low-paid, stressful hospital jobs for work with insurance companies, health maintenance organizations or home care agencies that offered better hours and less demanding work at comparable pay.
As a result, many hospitals faced a sudden shortage of nurses, in some cases so serious that beds in some units had to be closed, and others were staffed largely with nurses hired by the day, or those newly recruited from overseas.
"There are certain kinds of shifts, and certain kinds of nurses, and certain inner-city hospitals where the shortage is still very acute," said Judith Huntington, director of governmental affairs at the American Nurses Association in Washington. "It's excellent that enrollment is rising. But with an aging society, the demand for nurses is going to continue to grow, well beyond the year 2000."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated that the health care industry would create 350,000 new jobs for registered nurses by the year 2000.
"It's great that enrollment is up, but that's not enough," said Connie Curran, a private consultant on nursing who lives in Chicago. "For one thing, for every 10 people who enroll, only five graduate, and of those five another doesn't pass the qualifying exams. And also, even a good new supply of nurses doesn't solve the real issue of creating a work environment that will keep people."
While nursing shortages have generally been cyclical, there was serious concern that the sharp drop in the number of students enrolled in nursing programs in the mid-1980's signaled a more basic professional reordering, because of more opportunities for women in higher-paying fields.
As a result, hospitals wooing nurses raised salaries substantially, from a national average of $14,000 for starting nurses in 1980 to $25,000 now. Many began offering sign-up bonuses, tuition and housing credits and other incentives. In some large cities, experienced nurses can now earn more than $60,000.
"I've wanted to be a nurse ever since I was eight," said Kami Zartman, 21, who will graduate from Ohio State University's nursing school in June. "It's a really hard, professional fulfilling job, and I think we are goin to have to do better at getting that image across, especially in high schools."

HEADLINE: War Effect On Energy Minimized

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials contend that if war erupted in the Persian Gulf, it would pose few disruptions to energy supplies, even though the region holds two-thirds of the world's oil.
Government and industry planners say the risk of damage to oilfields there is only minimal. They say that even some loss of output from Saudi Arabia could be sustained with little effect on consumers or the world economy.
By drawing upon strategic and commercial stockpiles and buying oil already aboard tankers and awaiting customers, these analysts say, it should be possible to avoid any oil shortage, as well as to keep prices from rising, as they did after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. 

 
Adequate Protection
 "I am confident that the superb military force we have in the gulf is more than adequate to protect Saudi and United Arab Emirate oilfields from Iraqi military attack," Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a former admiral, said earlier this month upon returning from a trip to the Middle East. "While there may be a temporary, even anticipated, reduction of activity in the fields adjacent to the Kuwaiti border to assess the situation, this should have virtually no effect on the availability of supplies to the market."
Nevertheless, Mr. Watkins said the markets would probably not behave rationally -- that is, share the official view that there would be no shortage if war broke out. He said he would promptly recommend, therefore, that President Bush begin to sell oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, now holding about 590 million barrels, if war broke out.
 
Keeping Prices Down
 This drawdown, at an eventual maximum rate of 3.5 million barrels a day and in coordination with other consuming countries, would presumably keep prices in check, Mr. Watkins and other Government planners maintain.
Industry and other private analysts, although perhaps less sanguine about prices, do not generally dispute the Government's optimistic assessment about oil's availability in the event of a military showdown with Saddam Hussein.
"An oilfield is not something that's easily blown up," said Marshall W. Nichols, executive director of the National Petroleum Council, an industry group that advises the Government. The council was asked by Secretary Watkins in October to make an assessment of supply and demand through mid-1991, including "an analysis of the factors that can affect those estimates," presumably war would be among them.
Mr. Nichols said this week that while there could be "fear of damage," which might hamper transport -- for example, the inability of tankers to obtain insurance -- he remained confident that world inventories would prove adequate.
 
Reliable Reserves
 He said the nation's strategic oil reserve, which was tested during the fall, could safely be relied upon to move oil into the market promptly -- within two weeks being the department's stated goal. Some military analysts predict a war with Iraq would be won in as little as five days.
His only nagging concern, Mr. Nichols said, was the ease with which foreign tankers could receive waivers to the law that now restricts oil cargoes between American ports to American ships.
Vito Stagliano, a senior Energy Department policy analyst, said in an interview that while some production in northeastern Saudi Arabia would be at risk in war, the worst that could realistically happen would be the loss of two million barrels a day, barely one-quarter of that country's current, much-expanded production level.
 
Estimate of Supplies
 Mr. Stagliano estimated worldwide strategic oil supplies controlled directly or indirectly by governments at one billion barrels and commercial stocks at 80 million to 100 million barrels above minimum operating levels. In addition, he said, producing countries' ships in the Mideast and Western Europe are carrying 50 million barrels.
Since it takes a month or more for tankers to reach the United States from the Persian Gulf, it would take that long for any supply shortage to be felt, assuming the oil was not bid away from the buyers in transit.
Analysts stress that oil is a world-traded commodity, the biggest by far, and that the most important factor in any assessment is how much is reaching the total market, not how much a particular country may get from one or another source.
Mr. Stagliano held it to be "not rationally feasible to imagine" world production losses as high as 3.5 million barrels a day, the amount planners figure could be readily provided for six months from Government-controlled stocks. As much as 4 million barrels a day could be provided for a shorter period, planners say.
Iraq and Kuwait were producing 4.3 million barrels a day when their oil was embargoed. This has now been fully offset by a surge of production from other countries. More than half the additional oil during the fourth quarter came from Saudi Arabia.
 
Consumption Is Falling
 With inventories high, and American oil consumption already down 5 percent without much effect yet from recession, Administration officials say their contingency plans do not include forcing consumers to use less oil.
Higher prices would achieve much of whatever conservation became necessary, Mr. Stagliano said, adding that "we would not have any major intrusive action" by the Government, like prohibiting gasoline sales on Sundays or instructing wholesalers where to send supplies.
Nor are planners making much effort to cut deals for special emergency supplies with producers outside the Persian Gulf -- most are near maximum production anyway. Such moves are viewed as shifting supplies within a system in which oil is to be shared among members of the International Energy Agency, a unit of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, rather than adding to total supplies.
This view is held despite Government acknowledgment last week that in partly lifting a boycott of Iranian oil, it was adding slightly to the nation's supply options.
For all its confidence about availability of oil, the Administration is not at all certain it can avoid another price spike should war break out. Thus, the jawboning by Secretary Watkins:
"I would hope players in the oil market would keep their hats on if hostilities develop," he said in his address to the Council on Foreign Relations. "Is calm, common sense and perspective in order then? Yes. But, should we expect the market to behave in such a rational manner? Probably not. And isn't this exactly why we have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?"

HEADLINE: Cold Devastates California Crops; Fruit Prices Across Nation to Rise

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 27

 BODY:
California's worst winter cold in more than half a century has devastated the state's $8 billion fruit and vegetable industry, and agriculture officials said today that fruit prices around the country would rise as a result.
Farmers called on officials to declare parts of the state a disaster area after a prolonged and widespread freeze that brought record low temperatures to many places. More freezing temperatures are forecast for this weekend and are expected to kill some of the surviving crops. 
 "I don't think there is any question that the prices will go up and in some cases have already gone up," said Robert C. Fox, chief deputy director of the State Department of Food and Agriculture. California produces 26 percent of the nation's orange crop and 75 percent of the oranges that are eaten.
Much of the state's citrus crop has been ruined, and farmers said the cold had killed many of the trees. The damage has extended to strawberries, avocados, carrots, lettuce, artichokes, broccoli, cauliflower and celery. Agriculture officials said prices were also likely to increase for other fruit, like apples, that would be in demand as substitutes.
The state's flower crop also suffered, and people working on floats for the Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena said they were using substitute decorations.
In Riverside, Ron Hamilton, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Office for Agriculture, said temperatures in the San Joaquin Valley, where most citrus crops are grown, were the coldest since 1913. He said the current cold wave, affecting broad areas of the state, was comparable to the freeze of 1937, which produced statewide crop damage.
The low temperatures were caused by an enormous blast of Arctic air that descended over the state last week before heading eastward and bringing record low temperatures to dozens of cities in Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, the Dakotas and Nebraska.
As the temperature fell to below freezing over the weekend, bringing light snow to parts of the state where it is virtually unheard of, farmers worked desperately and mostly in vain to protect their crops from the chill.
"The farmers are in shock; you can hear it in their voices," said Barbara Buck, a spokesman for the Western Growers Association, a farmers' trade association. "There was really nothing they could do. The Arctic storm came. They tried to stop it with the smudge pots and wind machines and watering the trees, and there is even some sort of polymer like an anti-frost protection, but all this technology didn't work."
Mike Stuart, a senior vice president of the growers association, said that even with advanced warning of this weekend's cold there is little that can be done to prevent crop damage because of the severity of the freeze.
Wholesale prices increased immediately, and supermarkets reported that they were beginning to raise their prices for fruits and vegetables.
 
Delayed Effect Nationally
 Jan DeLyser, executive vice president of the Fresh Produce Council, a trade association based in Los Angeles, said the retail price increases would take effect nationally after several days or even weeks.
She said the wholesale price of a box of navel oranges at California produce markets rose from about $12 last weekend to about $22 today.
Frank Limacher, an agriculture economist with the state agriculture department, said the retail price of oranges had also begun to rise and that there were reports of 100 percent increases at some markets.
Claire Peters, a spokesman for Sunkist Growers Inc., in Sherman Oaks, said: "There will be citrus fruit in the stores, but the cost will be higher. Our guess is that prices could conceivably double."
 
Herald of Price Increases
 As one herald of increases, the New York Cotton Exchange reported that the price of concentrated orange juice for delivery in March had risen about 15 percent over the last 10 days, to about $1.19 a pound. Ms. Peters said it would take 10 more days to determine the full extent of damage to oranges, lemons, grapefruit and tangerines.
With damage to fruits and vegetables expected to rise into the hundreds of millions of dollars, growers were asking Gov. George Deukmejian for disaster relief. County agriculture commissioners are assessing the damage and reporting to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Ms. Buck said.
Declaration of a local disaster would be the first step toward asking for Federal disaster relief. The relief would offer some compensation to farmers who lose major portions of their crop and see little benefit from the increased prices.
Bob Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, which represents 83,000 farmers, said 80 percent of the state's navel oranges were still on the trees when the frost hit and that most were destroyed. But he added that some of the frozen oranges could be processed for juice.
 
Crop Value Put at $438 Million
 California is the leading producer of navel oranges and is second, after Florida, in overall production of oranges. Ms. Buck said the navel orange crop was valued at $458 million in 1988.
"Many of the buds for next year's crop have been damaged," she said. "The farmers have not only lost this year's crop and next year's, but tree limbs have split and they have lost their trees."
Mr. Krauter said the Valencia orange crop, which is not harvested until March, is still golf-ball sized on the trees and could be devastated by the drop in temperatures that is forecast for this weekend.
He said as much as 15 percent of the state's avocado crop, which is valued at $200 million, has been damaged, forcing a rise in prices that are already steep. California produces 85 percent of the nation's avocados.
"Artichokes are also hit hard," Ms. Buck said. "They are lying on their side." The state's crop is worth $38 million.
Other winter vegetables, including celery, broccoli and cauliflower, are hardier but have also been affected. Delays in harvesting caused by the freeze will cause price increases, Mr. Krauter said.
 
Temperatures in the Low 20's
 The record cold, coming after a summer of record heat, was part of a cold wave that has gripped the Rocky Mountains and the American West.
Beginning on the winter solstice last Friday, an Arctic weather mass moved across California, sending temperatures to the low 20's and the teens in the northern and central parts of the state.
A rare snowfall was reported in a number of communities in central California, the state's primary agricultural area, including Sacramento, Monterey, Fresno and Bakersfield.
Light snow also fell along the coast of Southern California from the Palos Verdes peninsula to San Clemente, and temperatures dropped to near freezing in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Start Random Testing of Milk For Residues of Agricultural Drugs

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
In response to persistent criticism from Congress and consumer groups about veterinary drug residues in milk, the Food and Drug Administration said today that starting early next year it would begin the first national program for regular random testing of milk.
The aim of the new program will be to detect antibiotics and sulfa drugs. The agency said that it had chosen 250 of the largest milk processing plants around the country and that beginning as early as February, it would randomly draw samples each week from milk tanker trucks arriving at five of the plants from dairy farms. 
 The move was welcomed by the dairy industry but was denounced as insufficient by a leading consumer group and a frequent critic of the Federal agency, Representative Ted Weiss, Democrat of Manhattan.
 
Regulation of Drugs
 Dr. Gerald B. Guest, director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said the Government was most concerned about milk containing trace levels of eight types of sulfa drugs and three types of tetracycline, all of which are widely used by dairy farmers to fight bacterial infections of the lungs and udders in their animals.
These drugs are legal for use in dairy animals. But the Government bars all except one of them from being present in a cow's system when it is giving milk. The only exception is sulfadimethoxine, whose concentrations in milk are limited by Federal regulation.
The drugs, at least one of which, sulfamethazine, has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals when administered in large doses, have been widely detected in earlier spot surveys of milk conducted by states and the Food and Drug Administration.
Besides fearing a risk of cancer, health experts have also expressed concern that residues of antibiotics in milk and meat could cause bacteria to develop immunity to the drugs and reduce their effectiveness in treating illness in humans.
Until now, the burden of testing milk for safety has fallen on the states and the dairy industry itself. "We are supplementing what the states already do to test milk," Dr. Guest said in a telephone interview today. "The states look primarily for penicillin and penicillin-like drugs. We're going to use new detection methods to look for other drugs, because they aren't being routinely looked for and they have the potential for being widely used."
The drug agency said that it believed the American milk supply was safe but that a nationwide monitoring program would deter farmers from using the drugs illegally. A similar program, using the most advanced drug-residue detection system on the market, was begun in 1988 in Idaho. The proportion of milk samples in which illegally used drugs are detected there has since declined to almost zero from more than 5 percent, an official of the Idaho Department of Agriculture said.
A spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation in Alexandria, Va., one of the dairy industry's principal trade groups, said farmers supported the new national milk testing program.
 
Plan Called Inadequate
 But Mr. Weiss, who heads a House Government Operations subcommittee that has spent years investigating the F.D.A. program for regulating the $2.7 billion animal drug industry, said the new project was an insignificant attempt to quell public anxiety about the safety of milk.
"Testing five milk samples per week means that each processing location in F.D.A.'s program will be visited only once a year," a statement issued by Mr. Weiss said. "F.D.A.'s attempt to describe this as a nationwide program is ludicrous. To even call it a modest proposal is a wild exaggeration."
When told of Mr. Weiss's comments, Dr. Guest said: "It is modest. We don't quarrel with that. It's all we can do with the resources we have for this program. But we think we can get good coverage because of the randomness, and it will be a deterrent. Where the drug is found, we can go back to the farm and take action."
The issue for consumers is whether drinking milk containing trace levels of sulfamethazine and the 10 other compounds is dangerous. Dr. Martin Terry, a toxicologist with the Animal Health Institute, a Virginia-based trade group for the veterinary drug industry, noted today that sulfa drugs and tetracycline were commonly used in human medicine at far higher concentrations to treat urinary tract ailments and other infections, without causing harmful side effects.
"If you're a mother of three, you've probably used tetracycline to treat infections," Dr. Terry said. "Does it make sense to worry about it? There are better uses for our resources."
 
Listing as Carcinogen
 But technical experts with several consumer groups noted that the agency had identified sulfamethazine as a carcinogen and that there was some evidence that sulfa drugs and tetracycline as a whole can cause allergic reactions in some milk drinkers. "The point is, Why deliberately introduce any carcinogen into the food supply?" asked Lisa Lefferts, staff scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group that, like Mr. Weiss, characterized the new program as insufficient.
Sulfamethazine, an anti-bacterial compound, is perhaps the most widely used of the 11 drugs that the Federal agency will look for in milk next year. Because it is inexpensive and effective against an array of infections, sulfamethazine made it possible to improve the economic efficiency of producing milk by confining large numbers of infection-prone animals in one place.
But since 1980 the F.D.A. has considered sulfamethazine to be a carcinogen. Based on new studies linking large quantities of the drug to cancers in rats and mice, the F.D.A. announced in November 1989 that it was taking action to ban the sale or use of sulfamethazine in agriculture. Dr. Guest said today that final action against the drug could occur next year.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
GULF G.I.'S TO GET GERM WAR SHOTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Acting on C.I.A. warnings that Iraq has developed biological weapons, the Pentagon is planning to begin vaccinating American troops in the Persian Gulf, military officials said today.
A Defense Department spokesman refused to comment on the plans today. But senior Administration officials said the Pentagon had recommended starting the inoculation program. 
 The Pentagon plan is part of a broad effort to improve defenses against biological weapons, including the use of masks and protective garments.
 
Chemical Weapons Used
 Iraq has used chemical weapons against Kurds in its own country and against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. But President Saddam Hussein has repeatedly denied that his nation has biological weapons.
In September, William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, said that "Iraq has a sizable stockpile of chemical and biological weapons." Government officials said Mr. Webster was reacting to intelligence reports that Iraq will be able to deliver significant quantities of biological agents on the battlefield by early next year.
Administration officials describe the vaccination plan as a precaution in light of these intelligence findings and deny that they are trying to stir new alarm about Iraq's military abilities. Washington officials have been worried that the vaccination effort could disturb the Saudis, other members of the anti-Iraq coalition and some American troops. This is because the United States does not have enough vaccine to inoculate all American troops, let alone all friendly troops and Saudi citizens.
It is unclear how many troops will actually be vaccinated under the program, but officials said the Pentagon plans to first inoculate those Americans who are most likely to be threatened by biological weapons.
Biological weapons, unlike chemical weapons, are based on living agents like viruses and bacteria. They can be used to spread diseases like typhoid, cholera and anthrax.
Vaccines for the biological agents considered most likely to be employed by Iraq would be produced in much the same way as the smallpox vaccines administered worldwide, using weakened or dead bacteria to stimulate the production of antibodies by human immune systems.
 
Effort to Expand Supply
 An Administration official said that the Pentagon plans to begin the inoculations "in a matter of weeks" and that an effort is being made to rapidly expand the production of vaccines so that more Americans can be inoculated.
But the official declined to say exactly how many would initially be inoculated, when the United States would have enough vaccine to protect all of its troops, what specific vaccines are being developed or where they are being manufactured.
Even though supplies of vaccines are limited, Administration officials defended the Pentagon plan, saying it is better to vaccinate some troops than not to vaccinate any. And they said that those who are not vaccinated can be given some protection by masks and special protective clothing. They also said that some of the vaccine is being reserved for use after a possible biological weapons attack as an antidote, and that antibiotics are also available.
 
Control Is Difficult
 Some officials say Iraq might be unwilling to use biological weapons because it is difficult for an attacker to control the biological agents and prevent them from infecting his own troops. Also, the United States has said that it would unleash devastating retaliation if Iraq employed chemical or biological weapons.
The Pentagon's plans were disclosed as President Bush vowed again not to compromise with President Hussein.
"There is not going to be a compromise with this man, because it's the wrong signal to send to people around the world who are together" against Iraq, Mr. Bush told reporters on the White House lawn.
Mr. Bush also asserted that he was "very comfortable" with the combat readiness of American forces despite the public statement by Lieut. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, deputy commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, that American forces in the region may not be fully combat-ready until mid-February, comments that echoed the private views of other Army and Marine Corps officials.
White House officials have been concerned that the commanders' assessments of the readiness of their units would undercut the Bush Administration's efforts to coerce Mr. Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait. Mr. Bush appeared to reflect such concern in his comments today.
"I've said all I want to say about readiness," Mr. Bush said. "I think it would be very useful if from the President and others there were fewer comments about readiness."
Several news organizations reported this week that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had informed Mr. Bush that General Waller's comments reflected the dominant view within the American military about the combat readiness of the expanding American force in the gulf.
Asked about these press reports, Mr. Bush said: "I'm not going to tell you what they said, but I'm going to tell you, don't believe these reports you're reading. It's under control. Don't be misled by these rabbit trails running through the snow out there."
But other Administration officials, who asked not be identified, indicated that they found the main thrust of the press reports to be accurate. And some military officials say that General Waller's assessment roughly paralleled their own thinking on the question of combat readiness.
As Mr. Bush defended his Persian Gulf policy, more than 100 Democratic members of the House of Representatives urged the President today to put off any military action against Iraq as long as economic sanctions are maintianing pressure on Mr. Hussein.
"We believe that the initiation of offensive military action by the United States unwisely risks massive loss of life," said a letter sent to Mr. Bush by Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, and 109 other House members.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
Questions of Rhetoric, Empty and Otherwise

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
"Rhetorical Image," at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, is an exhibition paved with good intentions but remarkably devoid of visually complex, fully realized works of art. This doesn't make it a failed show, but it does create, at many points, a medicinal, good-for-you zealousness that is tiring.
In keeping with today's trend toward political subjects, the works on view tackle important social problems, from economic inequity to political oppression. (In the show's catalogue, the artists don't just make artworks; they execute "interventions" in the social fabric.) 
 Good intentions are equally prominent in the structure of the show itself. Organized by Milena Kalinovska, an independent curator, this exhibition of the work of 20 artists is narrowly focused on Conceptual art, the art of wall texts, photographs and projected slide images. Even so, it has an almost admirable breadth. It samples several generations of Conceptual and related art from all over the world, including artists from not only the United States, Canada and Western Europe, but also Japan, Brazil, Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. One of its main achievements is to bring together artists from both sides of the recently raised Iron Curtain. Thus it invites the viewer to appreciate both the continuing flexibility of Conceptual art and the way artists in different parts of the world have adapted it to the problems of their own cultures.
The show's theme is rhetoric. In the catalogue, Ms. Kalinovska cites the word's traditional definition as "the art of using language effectively and with passion to communicate ideas -- political, metaphysical or moral -- which could influence and persuade others." But she also acknowledges that the word's current rating is quite low, as in "empty rhetoric." Her mission is to examine the way artists use good rhetoric against the bad kind, reviving this maligned "art of persuasion" to expose the empty rhetoric handed down by governments and politicians, newscasters and advertisers around the world.
Certain artists seek to reveal the machinations of political rhetoric by mimicking it. Tomislav Gotovac, a Yugoslav Conceptual artist, has documented his life with the kind of idealizing photographs that are usually ordered up by the heads of totalitarian states. Braco Dimitrijevic, another Yugoslav artist now living in London, takes photographs of the faces of anonymous passers-by, enlarges them to a size usually reserved for political rallies and hangs them on public buildings. The suggestion that the symbolic authority of such images is more a case of size and presentation than actual identity is neatly made.
Some work exudes real visual sharpness and originality in its battle against rhetoric. Krzysztof Wodiczko, a Polish-born artist who lives in New York City, projects images on government buildings, museums and monuments, criticizing what might be called architectural rhetoric with a combination of wit, efficiency and eerie visual power. In recent years, Mr. Wodiczko's projections have momentarily affixed huge guns to the gun turret-like form of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, and nuclear missiles to the arch at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn. The slide-show retrospective of his efforts is one of the exhibition's most convincing visual moments.
Cildo Meireles is a Brazilian artist whose work seems even more genuinely interventionist. Since the early 1970's, Mr. Meireles has printed political slogans on paper money and Coke bottles and put them back in circulation. He is credited with helping to stir up the political opposition that led to his country's return to democracy in 1985.
Working more consistently within a museum context, Lothar Baumgarten and Lawrence Weiner both deploy words in large type across walls in elegant and provocative ways. Mr. Weiner combines one of his characteristically open-ended phrases (in this case "pushed out in front of each other") with the more dramatic term "to the barricades" in German; thus he cryptically conjures scenes of proud defiance, and even more specifically last year's opening of the Berlin wall. In "Semaphore," Mr. Baumgarten simply contrasts the names of American railroad companies, states and cities with the names of American Indian tribes; the frequent overlaps between these words tell a story of stolen names, stolen lands and cultures destroyed.
The show is also strong where it illuminates the political concerns of artists not widely known for them, especially in the case of Jiri Kolar. A Czechoslovak artist known in the United States primarily for sweetly benign collages and assemblages, Mr. Kolar is represented here by "Diary 1968," a series of quietly denunciatory collages made in response to the Soviet occupation of Prague that year.
But too often the art on view skims the surface, treating complex issues with either glib simplicity or frustrating opacity. Rose Finn-Kelcey, an English artist, comments on art's monetary allure by creating a replica of van Gogh's "Sunflowers" in a combination of Japanese, American and British coins. A visual one-liner that combines cleverness and trompe l'oeil accuracy, it's great to look at for about three seconds. At the other extreme, it's hard to decipher Dennis Adams's "Translation." It consists of two big, illuminated images of a statement about peace, printed in English and Japanese, that seem to be part of a war memorial in Hiroshima.
And at many points the show could stand a little more rhetoric -- or any other device, for that matter -- used "effectively and with passion." Judith Barry's "First and Third" consists of several short videotaped monologues about racism, poverty and terrorism, but the actors telling the stories are not very convincing. The projection screen, an open door of a jumbled storage room in the museum, is a sophomoric allusion to the difficulty of lives lived at the edges of society.
In contrast, the incessant counting of Tatsuo Miyajima's illuminated digital numbers seem to fight rhetoric with effective understatement, although the political import is unclear. The catalogue suggests they are measuring time and money and are thus subtle symbols of the fin de siecle.
Sometimes the show's main point seems to be that difficult times like these, afflicted with myriad political, social and economic problems, demand difficult, visually dull and even unintelligible art. As if aware of this paradox, Ms. Kalinovska and her colleagues conclude the show with a "resource room," a kind of walk-in catalogue that includes statements and documentation of additional work by the artists in the show, catalogues of other exhibitions of their work and even cards so that viewers can write down their responses to "Rhetorical Image." It is good to have the artists step out from behind their work and talk about their intentions, but this room also gives the exhibition a smug, self-congratulatory end.
The actual catalogue is better. Granted, its main essay, written by Nena Dimitrijevic, sticks close to an orthodox Conceptual-political reading of postwar art, connecting the work in this show to a very short list of politically involved artists. But in other ways this exceptionally well-designed publication bends over backward to avoid being polemical or "rhetorical" -- even questioning the very possibility of making politically effective art.
It includes a wonderful string of 55 interconnected aphorisms about the relationship between art and reality by the late Swiss philosopher and playwright Friedrich Durrenmatt, originally published in 1977 and translated into English for the first time. And it is peppered with notable quotes from all kinds of writers (Voltaire, Karl Marx, W. H. Auden). Their words "intervene" at random throughout the catalogue's texts, arguing the relative merits of art for art's sake and art for the sake of society in ways that often suggest that the two are not so easily separated. In this way, the catalogue delivers a message only hinted at in the show itself, that there is no single correct way to make art, political or otherwise.
 
"Rhetorical Image" remains at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, through Feb. 3.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Handle With Care

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
This is a news alert, and warning, for the American press and members of Congress.
The Chinese Communists plan to announce the release of many political prisoners who were rounded up after the springtime revolution of 1989. They have been kept without charge or trial. About 2,000 may be freed. The announcement is scheduled for the first months of 1991. 
 The freedom of even one political prisoner is good news. So why the "warning" about Communist China's still-undisclosed plans to allow many freedom fighters out of their cells?
These are the answers:
1. The most important prisoners -- the "ringleaders" -- will get heavy sentences. Nobody will know how many remain incarcerated. In China the public is never told how many are arrested, where they are or how many have been executed.
2. The cruel and cynical Marxist-Leninist criminal code will remain in force. It makes a crime out of any action, comment or written word that the Government decides is against its interests. The "trial" system makes a guilty verdict automatic. Even an attempt at defense is taken as an anti-Government insult and can lead to heavier sentence.
3. The massive police apparatus will remain in force. Crackdown and arrest of dissidents will continue -- with the newly freed a special target.
And finally, the reason for Americans, particularly, to beware:
4. The plan for release of some prisoners while keeping the best and the bravest incarcerated is carefully aimed at strengthening the power of Communist China's leaders through more American trade and credits.
Most of the Western sanctions imposed on China in horror at the 1989 massacres have disappeared. On Dec. 5 of this year, page A14 of The Times carried a story from Beijing about how the Communists obliterate the very memory of political prisoners. The same day on page A13 was a story reporting that the World Bank had approved $114.3 million in loans to Beijing, the first "non-humanitarian" loans since the 1989 massacres.
Still, the men who rule behind Beijing's guarded compound walls fear one possible economic weapon against their power. They fear Congress may lift their immensely valuable tariff privileges in the U.S. -- most-favored-nation status.
This is a gift prolonged every year by the Bush Administration. With these low tariffs, Communist China has been helped to flood the American market with dumped goods, piling up billions. Selling goods at low "cost" is not difficult for China, considering how much of its manufacture is turned out by labor that "costs" only a lump of bread and a bowl of thin gruel a day. Slave prison labor is an economic tool written into the very law and economic planning of the state.
Congress has voted against most-favored status for China. But so far it has failed to muster the twothirds vote to block the President.
But the Bush Administration may realize it will be more difficult to keep giving tariff gifts to China. Recently it wisely sent Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, to China. He is a tested fighter for human freedoms and is not the kind of man to spare the truth about any country.
The majority of Congress will fight again this year to stop buttressing Beijing by tariff privileges. Beijing and Washington both know the vote is certain to be influenced by whether U.S. media present the prisoners' release as a Communist turnaround or an effort to paint over the truth about the gulag that is China.
Congress should demand a series of specific steps before extending the tariff breaks, which allow Beijing to subsidize corrupt or miserably inefficient Government enterprises. Chinese freedom fighters plead for them: unconditional release of all political prisoners. Free emigration. Lifting the de facto martial law in Beijing and Tibet. Ending harassment of Chinese students in the U.S. and religious worshipers in China. Ending forced labor. A taste of freedom in the press and universities.
We cannot force China's Communists to take these steps so frightening to despots. But we can refuse to subsidize their economy until they do.
In Beijing, Communist officials hug the thought that the Persian Gulf crisis has shifted American public attention from human rights in China. Congress and the press have the chance to show they are wrong. So does every American who cares as much today about those youngsters at Tiananmen Square as the day they were shot down.

HEADLINE: The Census Isn't Over

 BODY:
The Census Bureau, no longer trumpeting "the best census ever," has released a set of "final" figures. They describe a nation of about 250 million people whose center of gravity is shifting from the East and Middle West to the South and West. In this broad scope the figures are no doubt correct. But those numbers are anything but final and may not be as accurate as America needs and can have.
Pursuant to a court order in a lawsuit brought by New York and other large cities, the bureau's state-by-state tally will bear an important notation, a caution light for states preparing for the decade's legislative reapportionments. It says the figures "are subject to possible correction for undercount or overcount," and says the Commerce Department will decide by July whether to correct them. 
 That's because for many decades the census has undercounted large cities, where people suspicious of authority evade the enumerators and the enumerators avoid hard counting in hostile neighborhoods. In 1980 the undercount of young black males living in urban pockets was five times the undercount rate for the population as a whole. That's more than an actuarial nicety; it skews the distribution of political power in the form of legislative seats and potentially billions in economic benefits distributed in accordance with populations.
New York City, part of a state that may lose three House seats, has been joined by other urban centers like Los Angeles and Miami, whose states are the biggest gainers in Congress, to protest the undercount. Their lawsuit has wrung from the Commerce Department an agreement to "consider" adjustments based on selective recanvassing and statistical techniques.
It's a highly technical decision that will have major political consequences. Commerce has expressed doubt that the undercount is either serious or easily corrected. The Administration's hostility seems to have a partisan as well as technical dimension, since an adjustment might benefit big cities and therefore Democrats. A Federal judge gave Commerce the burden of showing that its decision is reasonable and understandable.
The Administration's stance is not reassuring. The bureau's announcement repeatedly speaks of the figures as though they were final. Its claim to a "best ever" census was made laughable by the widespread lack of public cooperation, a woeful budget and the alarming amount of pure guesswork by enumerators in many neighborhoods. Commerce can justly claim credit for hard work under adverse conditions, but its pride in a "full, fair and efficient" census is not yet secure.

Praying for Gulf Peace
Top officials of the National Council of Churches, who recently returned from the Middle East, have called for a day of prayer and fasting on Sunday, Jan. 6, in an effort to avert a war over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. 
 The church leaders, representing 40 major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations in the United States, returned from their visit to the region Dec. 21 and declared, "We believe the resort to massive violence to resolve the gulf crisis would be politically and morally indefensible."
"War will not liberate Kuwait, it will destroy it," they continued in a statement that appeared to be a rebuttal of the Bush Administration's policy in the Persian Gulf. "War will not save us from weapons of mass destruction, it will unleash them. War will not establish regional stability, it will inflame the entire Middle East."
The Rev. J. Martin Bailey, press officer for the National Council, said the fast had been declared because it was "important for church people to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in the gulf and recognize that they must themselves participate in the development of alternatives."
The decision to call the fast was made a few days after the church delegation's return, but the idea was clearly present a few days before Christmas, when the council declared: "At this moment, the resolution of the gulf crisis will take a miracle. But in this season we are reminded that the Middle East is the cradle of miracles. The miracle must be acted and prayed into being."
 
Old Fast, New Meaning
An Orthodox Jewish group has also linked recent world events with fasting. Rather than declaring its own fast, the Rabbinical Council of America called on those observing an ancient fast to give it a modern dimension by using it as an occasion to protest the United Nations' resolutions condemning Israel for actions in the occupied territories.
The fast, the Tenth of Tevet, was observed on Thursday and traditionally commemorates the siege of Jerusalem 2,600 years ago by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylonia.
Rabbi Marc D. Angel, the president of the council, urged that special Psalms and prayers be added to the fast "to help Israel at this time of crisis when Jerusalem is once again being besieged."
He continued, "The United Nations, known for its blatant anti-Israel and anti-Semitic pronouncements, has virtually laid political siege to Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the people of Israel."
 
New Aristide Book
About a year ago, Orbis Books, the publishing arm of the Maryknoll Fathers, decided to publish the writings and sermons of a little-known Roman Catholic priest from Haiti who devoted his life to working with the poor.
Last week that priest, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was elected the President of Haiti. "We had no idea that anything like this was remotely possible," said Robert Ellsberg, the editor-in-chief of Orbis Books. "We're now trying to catch up."
Only 2,000 paperback copies of Father Aristide's book were printed when it came off the presses in November. Another, larger printing is planned.
The book, "In the Parish of the Poor: Writings from Haiti," was edited and translated by Amy Wilentz.
Mr. Ellsberg said one of the major purposes of Orbis had been "to amplify the voices of third-world Christians," -- especially liberation theologians like the Rev. Leonardo Boff, the Rev. Gustavo Gutierrez and Father Aristide -- who believe that a primary duty of the church must be to promote social and economic justice.
 
Presbyterians' Rebuttal
An article in the December issue of the Reader's Digest charged that the leadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) was "out of step" with its congregations because, according to the writer, it had been embracing religious and political liberalism. Now the article has brought an eight-page response from the denomination's leadership.
The article, written by John S. Tompkins, an elder of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, said, "The people in the pews" were "fed up" with the liberal tendencies. Among these tendencies, he said, were the elimination of hymns deemed militaristic or sexist, challenges to United States military policies and various instances of substituting "social, economic and political action for the real business of religion."
The response, which was sent to all 11,505 Presbyterian congregations, was prepared by the denomination's Stated Clerk, the Rev. James Andrews, and the executive director of the denomination's General Assembly, the Rev. David Stoner. The executives argued that the leadership has a mandate from its membership to speak out on social and political issues and adds that the congregations have been consulted in the process. The response was prepared, the executives wrote, to rebut the article's "statement and interpretation of facts" and "to clarify those facts and dispute that interpretation."

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators In 5th Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Government's main set of indicators used to predict the economy fell for the fifth straight month in November, a 1.2 percent drop that suggested no early end to a deepening contraction that now lacks only formal designation as the nation's ninth postwar recession.
"The November indicators leave no doubt that a serious and lengthy recession is under way," said William K. MacReynolds, director of forecasting for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The only remaining questions are just how far the economy will plummet and how long it will stay there." 
 A recession would mark the end of the longest peacetime expansion in the nation's history and one that if it had continued until October 1991 would have matched the record 1961-69 expansion that embraced much of the Vietnam War.
 
Most Severe Since 1981
 The latest fall in the index of leading indicators, constructed by the Commerce Department from data collected by various Government and private-sector bodies, made the five-month drop the lengthiest period of uninterrupted decline since 1984 and the most severe since late 1981, when the most recent recession still had 10 months to run. In that year, five of the six months from June through November had sizable declines, with those in September and October both exceeding any in the current series.
Eight of the 11 components of the index fell during the month, while the other three components, paced by higher stock prices, made positive contributions.
Two companion gauges, the coincident index designed to reflect current movements in the economy, and the lagging index that tends to confirm it after an interval, also fell in November. The coincident index declined 1.1 percent, its fifth straight fall, and the lagging index dropped by eight-tenths of 1 percent after a three-tenths of 1 percent decline in October.
 
 Preceded by Three Declines
 Traditionally, a string of three straight declines in the leading index is regarded as pointing toward a recession and, indeed, recessions in recent decades have generally been preceded by three monthly declines.
But the three-decline rule has on several occasions also signaled recessions that never occurred. For example, the four-month stretch from October 1987, the month stock prices crashed, through January 1988 was not followed by a business downturn. Likewise, no recession followed the six straight declines reported between May and October of 1984.
The current decline, however, is twice as severe as the drop during the first five months of the 1984 streak -- 4.4 percent compared with 2.2 percent. And the decline registered over the first four months is slightly more severe than that in the 1987 period.
Economists warn not only about false, or misleading, signals but also about assuming a close correlation between the magnitude of declines in the index and the amount by which the economy may subsequently decline. The index is designed specifically to anticipate turning points in the economy -- that is, direction rather than momentum.
Two privately constructed forecasting indexes also moved down for November, their compilers reported today. Safian Investment Research of White Plains said its Composite Forecasting Index fell 1 percent, its sixth straight decline. A subindex that excludes stock market and monetary data fell 1.7 percent, its 20th decline in the last 22 months.
The Jesup, Josephthal & Company Macro-Economic Index, which first flashed a recession signal in August 1989 for early 1990, fell to minus 118 from 112 in October, a moderation in its rate of fall.
 
 Milder Recession Seen
 "My interpretation of the more modest -118 reading currently is that the recession of 1990-91 is likely to be milder and over by the end of the first or second quarter of next year," said Jesup's chief economist, David B. Bostian Jr. The consensus among private analysts now is for a recession to last through mid-1991. But Mr. Bostian also believes the downturn actually began in late 1989 or early this year instead of in the third or fourth quarters of this year, as most economists believe.
The components with a negative effect on the Government's index, ranked by their impact, were a decline in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, lower prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, a decline in factory order backlogs, falling contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, a rise in average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance, a reduction in the length of the average workweek and declines in the money supply and in building permits.
 
 Deliveries and Expectations
 Components with a positive impact on the index, besides higher stock prices, were slower deliveries by corporate suppliers and a slight increase in the University of Michigan's barometer of consumer expectations.
October's decline, initially put at 1.2 percent, was revised to 1.3 percent, the Commerce Department also reported. The declines in the previous three months were eight-tenths of 1 percent in September, 1.2 percent in August and one-tenth in July.
The ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index, which is considered an alternative predictor of the economy's direction, fell slightly in November, the third straight decline.
The leading index now stands at 139.7, which is 3.4 percent below the November 1989 reading of 144.6.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Slip as Books Are Closed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A spurt of selling pushed down prices of Treasury securities yesterday, as dealers made final bookkeeping preparations for the end of 1990.
The decline came even though the economic data released yesterday were generally favorable for the fixed-income market. The numbers included a report that the Government's index of leading economic indicators fell by 1.2 percent in November, the fifth straight month that the forecasting gauge has shown a decline. 
 "The numbers were pretty good for the market, but they were met with a little bit of selling," one government bond trader said. "Dealers are getting ready for year-end, because with settlement on Monday this is the last day you can do it."
 
 Unexpected Strength
 One report that may have unsettled some market participants showed that initial unemployment claims fell for the second straight week in the period ended Dec. 15. Most credit market analysts have been anticipating that the December employment report, which is scheduled next Friday, will show additional weakness in non-farm payroll employment. The fact that initial claims have dropped for two consecutive weeks suggests that perhaps the employment data will not be as weak as most analysts expect.
"The jobless claims numbers were a surprise, since most people were looking for the numbers to be flat to up a bit," said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. "But there is no indication here that the economy is doing any better. There is a widespread perception that the December data will look bad. I think that view will be validated by the numbers."
Trading was thin yesterday, as it was all week. Early in the session the Public Securities Association, an industry group, recommended that activity in the government securities market end at 3 P.M., to give traders in New York, which was hit by a fairly heavy snowstorm on Thursday night, time to make their way home.
 
 Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 31/32, down 21/32, to yield 8.29 percent, up from 8.23 percent late Thursday, but little changed from a yield of 8.27 percent a week ago.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 17/ 32, down 11/32, to yield 8.12 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.23 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
By late in the session, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.42 percent, down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bills were offered at 6.53 percent, down 4 basis points. And one-year bill rates were offered at 6.48 percent, down 2 basis points.
Year-end pressures continued to buffet the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market yesterday, although not so badly as earlier in the week.
Yesterday the funds rate moved in a wide range of 9 percent to 6.50 percent, a level that is below the 7 percent rate that most analysts see as the Federal Reserve Board's target.
In other developments, the Fed reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 17.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Down in Slow Day On Bearish Economic News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply on world currency markets yesterday, with extremely thin trading accentuating the downward move.
Currency traders received more negative news about the United States economy in a Commerce Department report showing that the index of leading economic indicators fell 1.2 percent in November, its fifth consecutive monthly decline. Normally three straight monthly declines indicate that a recession is imminent. On Thursday the Government reported a sharp drop in durable-goods orders for November. 
 The leading indicators figure "was much below expectations," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, a New York consulting firm. As the economy weakens, pressure builds on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. But lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they erode the value of fixed-income investments like bonds.
The dollar began declining in Asian trading and continued to fall when dealings shifted to Europe as investors took profits.
Shortly before the United States market opened, "the dollar fell hard across the board" and was unable to stage a convincing recovery, Mr. Chandler said.
The sharp decline came despite a political backdrop that would appear to support the currency. Tensions in the Persian Gulf as well as political strife in the Soviet Union might encourage investors to seek a haven in the dollar.
Mr. Chandler maintained that the currency would trade still lower if not for these political developments. "The full dimensions of the current economic contraction aren't being fully appreciated by the market," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 136.05 yen, from 136.65 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it traded at 135.05 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 134.90 yen, down from 136.40 yen on Thursday.
In London, the pound rose to $1.9220, from $1.8870 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9282 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.8895.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4935 German marks, down from 1.5255; 1.2745 Swiss francs, down from 1.3040; 5.0810 French francs, down from 5.1935; 1,126.50 Italian lire, down from 1,151.75, and 1.1601 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1616.

HEADLINE: Mourning Soviet Reform

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 28

 BODY:
If the First Congress of People's Deputies, a year and a half ago, was a baptism of infant democracy and an exorcism of Stalinist demons, the fourth Congress, which ended on Thursday night, was a wake.
 With desperate noise and little cheer, it marked not only the passing of this year of sunken spirits, but in the minds of many participants, the end of the period of great advances. 
 "The Congress reflected the trends that have been developing in the society around us, the sunset of democratization and the onset of conservative forces," said Aleksei M. Yemelyanov, a professor of agricultural economics and an opposition deputy.
 
Gorbachev More Isolated
 President Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged from the Congress more isolated than ever from the innovators who helped him remap Soviet society, and dependent on traditional institutions of power -- the Communist Party, the military-industrial complex, the K.G.B. -- for his chosen priority of the moment, which is order.
He seems to have run into the limits of what he started. Trying to unleash the creative energy of a suppressed society, he set loose forces that threaten the union.
Trying to break the paralysis of fear, he now finds himself afraid of the consequences. The word he used repeatedly on the closing day was "razval" -- breakdown, disintegration, collapse.
 
Press Corps Is Worked
 People argue whether Mr. Gorbachev has reached his own personal limit, or is accommodating the hard-liners panicked by the mess of democracy; whether this is a temporary cooling-off period or the beginning of a more drastic retrenchment.
Mr. Gorbachev's spin controllers, who now adroitly work the press corps in the Kremlin lobbies, proclaimed the Congress a victory because the Soviet leader got most of what he wanted: a reorganized Government, his choice as Vice President, and a rousing endorsement of the general idea that the Soviet Union should continue to exist.
He won these victories because the Congress as a whole was not very assertive, and had no consensus of its own about how to confront the problems of economic decline and clashing sovereignties. He won because he catered to the Communist Party bloc, the military officers and military-industrialists and other hard-liners who make up a majority in the hall.
 
Two Ballots and a Tantrum
 Even so, as American pols say, he won ugly.
It took him two ballots and a temper tantrum to win approval of his undistinguished vice presidential choice, a lifelong apparatchik named Gennadi I. Yanayev, whom he plucked from the Communist Party Politburo after two candidates of stature had publicly spurned the post.
The Congress refused to give him the one element of his proposed government reorganization that actually conferred upon him a conspicuous new power -- a presidential Supreme State Inspectorate that was to police compliance with orders from Moscow.
What he won was a streamlining of the Government that theoretically makes it easier for him to call Cabinet members and other obstructive bureaucrats to account. This is useful for political infighting, but it is hard to see how it helps resolve the great power struggle going on outside the Cabinet, between Moscow and its rambunctious republics.
As the Congress ended, the Russian Republic calmly announced that it would not pay its usual share of the federal budget. This was a challenge as real as the Boston Tea Party, and nothing in Mr. Gorbachev's ostensible new powers equipped him to solve it.
 
Original Team Breaks Up
 This was the Congress that witnessed the breakup of Mr. Gorbachev's original team, the strong and independent thinkers who helped shape the reforms.
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Foreign Minister who helped win his President the Nobel Peace Prize, quit his post, saying he could not stand to watch the country lurch toward dictatorship -- although the hard line on domestic affairs seems to have no effect on the improvement in Soviet relations with the United States.
The Shevardnadze resignation remains such a sore point that the broadcasting authorities today canceled tonight's post-Congress edition of the irreverent, late-night weekly show "Vzglyad," or "View," which was to be devoted to Mr. Shevardnadze. The program has been a periodic target of censorship by broadcasting officials sensitive to Kremlin moods.
"People like Shevardnadze would never have turned away from Gorbachev unless they felt they weren't needed any more," Mr. Yemelyanov said.
Three other key figures lost their places in the inner circle, at least for now, when the Congress abolished the Presidential Council. They are Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a co-architect of perestroika; Vadim V. Bakatin, who battled the Communist Party for control of the Interior Ministry, and Stanislav S. Shatalin, the economist who almost persuaded Mr. Gorbachev to try a 500-day demolition of Communism.
Some of them may be recycled into the new team, but Mr. Gorbachev's first recruit for that team did not inspire hope among the campaigners for reform. Judging by his public record and the word of his colleagues, Mr. Yanayev, the new Vice President, is an honest, loyal, unimaginative man, an obedient lieutenant to tend the fortress but not a companion for new frontiers.
 
Dependent on Old Guard
 The appointment seemed to confirm that Mr. Gorbachev is more than ever dependent on the institutions of old power, and reinforced the impression that the period of reform has passed and that the period of law and order has arrived.
Mr. Gorbachev's isolation from the people in the insurgent opposition and his mistrust of their ambitions have grown steadily over the last year.
The self-styled democrats have long ago grown disenchanted with Mr. Gorbachev, and are in their own funk, frustrated by their inability to govern as the economy collapses and the old guard resists.
At the Congress, there was no sign left of any bond between Mr. Gorbachev and these intellectuals who made up his original cheerleading squad.
"I think he is a man with only one friend -- Lukyanov," said Vitaly A. Korotich, editor of the popular weekly magazine Ogonyok. Anatoly I. Lukyanov is the Gorbachev protege who was chairman of the Congress.
 
Media Stars From the Right
 The new media stars of the Congress came from the far right -- the two army colonels whose badgering helped drive Mr. Shevardnadze from the Government, and the striking blond party functionary who called for Mr. Gorbachev's impeachment.
The signals to the outside world were chilling: First the departure of Mr. Shevardnadze, a champion of partnership with the West even on such tricky issues as the Persian Gulf, then the platform given to the K.G.B. chief, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, whose anti-Western tirade seemed intended to spook foreign investors.

HEADLINE: Developers End A Legal Tussle On Skyscraper

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Americas Tower, a skyscraping distress signal in mid-Manhattan that has been frozen for more than a year while its developers battled one another, may finally be completed as a result of a settlement reached yesterday.
The 48-story office building, which covers the block of the Avenue of the Americas between 45th and 46th Streets, was about three-quarters finished last December when the developers, unable to get more construction financing, began fighting in court over who should control the project's destiny. 
 Since then, the highly visible tower -- partially clad in rose-colored granite, partially exposed as a hulking steel skeleton -- has been a kind of three-dimensional symbol of the end of the 1980's building boom.
The legal struggle pitted Joseph E. and Ralph Bernstein of New York, through their NYL Development Corporation, against the giant Kumagai Gumi construction concern of Tokyo, through its subsidiary, K.G. Land New York Corporation.
 
Bankruptcy Proceedings
 When the project began in 1988, K.G. Land paid for the initial work, with the understanding that a construction lender would be found to complete the job. With no such financing on the horizon last year and facing some $28 million in unpaid bills, K.G. Land sought to declare the project bankrupt, a step that the Bernsteins contested.
Although bankruptcy proceedings were dropped in August, the Bernsteins and K.G. Land continued to quarrel before an arbitration panel over the terms of their partnership agreement and how to dispose of the project.
Yesterday, they announced that they had concluded the arbitration and that they "anticipate construction can be resumed within the next few weeks."
However, it remains unclear under whose auspices that would happen.
As a result of the settlement, the Bernsteins have acquired a controlling interest in the development partnership. But K.G. Land has an option to buy the building, which it could exercise as soon as next Friday. The option runs for a month.
Americas Tower has 1 million square feet of space, almost as much as the Chrysler Building. In their joint announcement, the partners said that Swanke Hayden Connell would remain as architects and that KM/Turner Construction Company would remain as construction manager. Few other details of the settlement were made available yesterday by either side.
It is also unclear what prospects the project would face in the current real-estate market, where huge blocks of newly constructed space in mid-Manhattan are going begging for tenants. Americas Tower has no tenant.
The Bernsteins gained nationwide notoriety for their role as real-estate managers for Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former President of the Philippines, and his wife, Imelda.
Last week, the Bernsteins, the Philippine Government and a business associate of Adnan Khashoggi said that they had settled their five-year-old ownership dispute over the Crown Building, at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, which was once owned by the Marcoses. But the mortgage holder was not part of this settlement, so the final outcome is impossible to predict.

HEADLINE: Hotels Woo Cabbies to Win Their Riders

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Last week, in celebration of its grand opening, the Rihga Royal Hotel held a special reception for a group of dignitaries as a way to build favorable word of mouth. Invitations went out. The pastry chef started baking. And by 9 A.M. on the appointed day, the V.I.P.'s began arriving in a yellow blaze of taxicabs. One by one, they jumped out to munch on the free cookies and coffee, darted back into the cabs -- and sped off in search of their next fares.
With the local economy weakening and competition keen, the Rihga is one of a growing number of retail businesses courting New York's cabdrivers. These businesses are betting that they can reach the customer in the back of the taxi by wooing the driver in front. 
 By the end of its giveaway last week, the Rihga on West 54th Street had served up 4,000 cups of coffee -- enough for roughly one-tenth of all the licensed yellow cab drivers in New York City. Earlier this year, another luxury hotel,the Mark, spent about $4,000 to treat some 2,000 drivers to a continental breakfast of fresh-squeezed orange juice and just-baked muffins as a way to publicize its recent makeover.
No fewer than six hotels and a nightclub have offered similar hospitality in recent months. They hope drivers will learn where the businesses are located, drop by occasionally for fares and maybe even send clients their way.
"It builds a general awareness, and the more awareness you have in a market as competitive as this, the better off you'll be," said Larry Weiss, an executive with the Embassy Suites Hotel in Times Square. He feels that the $2,200 of coffeeand clipboards distributed in its October opening were worthwhile even if no referrals result.
"Very rarely do you get someone who hops in a cab and needs a hotel room," he said. "Where it helps more is for the person who gets in the cab at the airport and wants to be taken to the Embassy Suites Hotel. It wouldn't sit well if the cabdriver hasn't heard of it. There's a comfort level that exists if the cabbie knows where it is right away."
 
Boosting Morale
 For drivers, the special attention has been an antidote to complaints that many of them do not know their way around town or have an uncanny way of finding the longest distance between two points.
Even when the promotions are modest, cabbies enjoy being singled out for their valuable contacts. "It's a great idea for the drivers to be able to come here and relax for awhile," Ruberto Munoz said in front of the Rihga. Judging from the tro phies on his dashboard, he was helping himself to cookies and a souvenir mug for at least the second time that week.
And as long as the programs' thrust is to educate drivers about new destinations and improve morale, and not necessarily to induce drivers to plug products or services in violation of city regulations, taxi officials take a benign view toward the giveaways."It's a form of marketing," said Jack S. Lusk, the chairman of the Taxi & Limousine Commission, the government group that monitors the city's $600 million cab industry.
Other cities have experimented with the idea. The National Museum of American Art in Washington, for instance, wanted more attention in a city that already has a number of attractions. So it treated 500 cabbies to lunch in September on its front steps, at the suggestion of a board member who remembered that the gimmick worked when Pan American World Airways wanted to promote its new shuttle service from La Guardia Airport in 1986.
 
Free Air Fresheners
 In an added flourish, the museum's lunch guests received complimentary air fresheners for their cars, shaped like the museum's famous bucking-bronco sculpture, as a reminder of who sponsored the event. Attendance is up, and the museum expects to host a similar to-do for the city's hotel concierges in January.
Nordstrom Inc., the Seattle-based retailer, also borrowed the concept, which had been used successfully in 1988 by the operator of a San Francisco mall it occupies, when it opened a new store in Arlington, Va., late last year. About 500 cabbies showed up to claim the free box lunches.
But nowhere has the trend blossomed quite like it has in New York, a city whose 11,787 yellow cabs are vital to its daily rhythm. Cabs and car services make up nearly one out of every five trips taken on public transportation, according to Mr. Lusk.
 
'Just Ridiculous'
 Most of the promotions have been confined to the coffee, danish and souvenir variety. Some businesses, however, go further. Lawrence Goldberg, a taxi drivers union official, said that the Loews Howard Johnson in midtown had recently proposed giving cab drivers $5 for every person they brought to the hotel without a reservation.
"We didn't want to get involved," said Mr. Goldberg, the secretary-treasurer of Local 3036 of the Taxi Drivers & Allied Workers Union. The union refused to notify its members of the proposed offer, and the hotel says it is now studying alternatives.
"It was just ridiculous," Mr. Goldberg said. "Even if a driver were to get the $5, it would cost him $10 in down time and quite frankly, drivers could have gotten in trouble for it."
 
Getting the Word Out
 Strictly speaking, plugging businesses can cost taxi drivers their licenses if passengers complain. Rule 219 of the taxi drivers' rulebook states that "a driver shall not sell, advertise or recommend any service or merchandise without prior written commission approval." The rule, regulators explain, exists to protect passengers who may not appreciate a hard sell.
But even the regulators say they are apt to look the other way if a driver simply responds to a passenger's inquiry. The Commission also uses its newsletters to help "get the word out," as Mr. Lusk put it, about those promotions that it believes will keep drivers abreast of new destinations and boost esteem.
Rebecca Bowser, a spokeswoman for the commission, held out as a model the promotion that A & S Plaza ran last year to mark its Manhattan debut.
Besides giving out some 5,000 cups of coffee to cabbies who were passing by, the mall's developer also honored five drivers for distinguished service, although not too many of their colleagues attended the speeches. Finding 11,787 parking spaces around Herald Square in midday is no cinch.

HEADLINE: Ex-Follower of Ho Chi Minh Scolds Vietnam in Broadcasts

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
A longtime Vietnamese Communist who personally accepted the surrender of Saigon in 1975 has shown up in the West and, surprisingly, has begun broadcasting statements over the BBC calling on his compatriots to abandon the rigid Marxist-Leninist economic system, political repression and enmity with the United States and other adversaries.
The Vietnamese, Col. Bui Tin, a deputy editor of the party daily Nhan Dan, said in a telephone interview from Paris today that he had decided to take advantage of a stay in France to beam his appeals back to his country over the BBC because he would not have been allowed to publish or broadcast them at home. 
 Besides, he said, more Vietnamese -- three million of them -- listen to the BBC's Vietnamese-language service every day than to Radio Hanoi.
 
Returning Could Be Dangerous
 "I want to go back," said Colonel Tin, who arrived in France in September. But he acknowledged that returning to Vietnam could be dangerous for him, and he would not say exactly when he would try. "Prison is possible, and my wife and children have already been interrogated by the police."
Colonel Tin, a disciple of Ho Chi Minh, was at Dien Bien Phu when the French were defeated there in 1954, and accepted the surrender of Gen. Duong Van Minh when the Communists rolled into Saigon in April 1975.
He has a long and honored record as a Communist. He joined the Vietminh in 1945 as a teen-ager and became a member of Ho Chi Minh's private guard unit. In 1963, as Hanoi's leaders were debating whether to send major North Vietnamese troop units to join the Vietcong fighting against the Saigon Government, Colonel Tin was assigned to lead a secret scouting mission to South Vietnam.
 
Accepted South's Surrender
 He later left active duty and became deputy editor of the North Vietnamese army newspaper, Quan Doi Nhan Dan. As a correspondent for that paper in the last days of the Vietnam War, he was riding with the advance tank unit that broke into the Presidential Palace in Saigon. The tank commander deferred to him as the ranking officer present and gave him the honor of accepting General Minh's surrender.
Colonel Tin came to France at the invitation of L'Humanite, the French Communist newspaper. He said he planned to return home "in a few months."
By his account, he has been troubled by events in his unhappy country for some time, but could not say so. "I had a serious heart attack last year," he said, "which is why I felt I absolutely had to try to do something now to save the people."
 
Broadcast in Installments
 On Nov. 28, he made public what he calls "a petition from a single, ordinary citizen" to the leaders and people of his country. The BBC's Vietnamese-language service has been broadcasting his explanation and commentary on his views in installments. The last installment of the five- to six-hour interview will be broadcast sometime in January, said Richard Black of BBC radio here.
Vietnam, with North Korea, is one of the few Communist countries that still resists radical Soviet-style change, at least in economic and social policy. Last spring, its Communist Party purged Tran Xuan Bach, a senior member of the Politburo, for warning of the danger of rigidity.
The authorities in Hanoi have also menaced Colonel Tin. The Voice of Vietnam broadcast a statement by the editorial staff of Nhan Dan on Dec. 15, saying that Colonel Tin's BBC interviews contained "many points that distort our party and state policies and lines."
 
Said Aloud What Many Think
 In the interview today, Colonel Tin said, "Very well, I say, let's have a public discussion of how I did that."
"I have been thinking about the ideas in my petition for four years," he said, "and before I left Vietnam I discussed them with intellectuals and journalists in Hanoi. Some said that I would only be saying aloud what a lot of people think."
Colonel Tin has a record as something of a maverick. He tracked down Ho Chi Minh's last will and testament and proved that Ho's successors had doctored it. Ho had wanted his ashes scattered around Vietnam. But instead the party leaders built a huge mausoleum to Ho, which Colonel Tin felt was a fraud.
Colonel Tin's statement, as published in translation by the Asian Wall Street Journal on Dec. 3, said: "Our country is still confronting a grave general crisis, which has recently become more serious in a number of domains, leading to a further deterioration of our people's living conditions."
Later in the statement, he added: "Every Vietnamese is troubled by the country's present situation. There are acute economic problems, a return of galloping inflation, mounting prices and daily erosion of living conditions of civil servants and cadres. Bureaucracy, irresponsibility, egoism, corruption and fraud are becoming entrenched under an insolent reign of privileges and prerogatives.
"The decisions and measures thus far adopted remain ineffectual. There is an alarming deterioration of traditional ethical, moral and spiritual values. There is confusion among the youth, on whom the country's future depends."
Well over half a million Vietnamese "boat people" have fled the country's catastrophic living conditions since 1979, when Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia prompted China to attack it in retaliation. Several hundred thousand also fled after South Vietnam fell to the Communists in 1975.
 
Seeks National Reconciliation
 He told the British newspaper The Guardian earlier this month that a government of national reconciliation -- uniting Vietnamese refugees and exiles around the world with those at home -- could help build democracy and heal the wounds left by mass arrests and other repressive measures taken by the Communists after their victory.
"This caused many more to flee and die in the ocean," he told The Guardian. "The motive was prejudice, revenge and hatred. If Ho Chi Minh had been alive, there would have been an amnesty."
In his statement, he called for a reduction in Vietnam's army and security forces over a three-to-five-year period. The army now constitutes 2 percent of the country's 62 million people, he said, but it should only be about a quarter of its current size.
"We have to withdraw our troops from Cambodia and let the U.N. take care of it," he said today.

HEADLINE: Darkness and Confusion In a Smoke-Filled Train

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
When the No. 3 train stopped in the tunnel under Brooklyn Heights yesterday morning, it seemed to Milton Puryear just another of those everyday indignities of life in New York.
But suddenly waves of thick brown smoke billowed through the car. In front of Mr. Puryear passengers collapsed to the floor and began coughing and vomiting.
"The smoke was so thick you couldn't see in front of your face," he said.
Passengers on the nine-car Manhattan-bound train described a scene of panic and confusion, of people rushing from exit to exit, amid conflicting instructions from the crew. 
"It seemed forever to get out of there," said John Casson, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank who was in the front car. "The conductor tried to give instructions through the loudspeaker, but we could barely hear him."
 
'People Started Panicking'
 Urban Sanders, a flagman for the Transit Authority, said: "There was a lot of rumbling. People started panicking. Some people said close the doors. Other people said no, let's move back. Some people were screaming. Other people were pushing and shoving. The smoke was so black, you couldn't see what was ahead of you."
Another Transit Authority employee, Andrew Carcasole said: "I thought it was the end of the world. I didn't think we were going to make it."
The passengers said the ordeal lasted about half an hour -- from the time the train froze 125 feet short of the Clark Street station then backed up to Borough Hall again, where it was met by Transit Authority officials and paramedics.
In interviews, passengers gave varied accounts of how the incident began and how long it lasted, and whether train crews moved quickly enough to resolve the crisis.
Mr. Casson, for instance, said the people in the front car were baffled when the voice over the public-address system told them to "move back to Borough Hall."
"That was the only thing they said," said Mr. Casson. "Everybody knows front and back. Move to the back of the train would have been the thing to say. We needed better instructions."
But Mr. Puryear, an investment banker, and others said instructions to move to the rear of the train were clear, though they said they found the rear as smoke-filled as the front and middle.
 
Flashes of Light
 The passengers said the train pulled out of the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn about 9:15 A.M. They said that within seconds it stopped and that the crew announced there was a fire on the track ahead.
Mr. Casson said that after the train stopped, and before smoke filled the cars, he looked out the front window and saw quick flashes of light on the tracks ahead. He said the flashes were followed by muffled explosions.
Given the conductor's announcement, "Nobody thought anything about it," Mr. Casson said.
"But the smart people left the car" and started moving to the rear of the train, he said.
In the middle of the train, Mr. Puryear said, he could hear one transit worker over the public-address system tell another to shut the air conditioner off.
By Mr. Puryear's account, the passengers in his car still had no idea that this was anything more than a normal delay. "There was some groaning and moaning" at the announcement, he said.
Some said the smoke entered through the air-conditioning ducts, others said it seemed to come from under the doors.
Passengers in the more crowded cars seem to have panicked, while those less jammed were relatively calm.
Mr. Casson said that some of the men in his car tried to pry open the doors. Others tried to calm passengers who were frantically trying to jam into the rear cars, which quickly became packed.
"The vast majority of people were helpful," Mr. Casson said. But he added: "It was scary for a while. I thought I was going to be lying there on the floor covered by the bodies of people who died from smoke inhalation."
The train eventually lurched back to Borough Hall. Transit officials said it was idle because other trains had to be moved to make room for it.
Mr. Puryear said that another train was hooked up with theirs, so that passengers could walk through a clear car.
Mr. Sanders, the Transit Authority worker, said he waited for all the passengers to step off his car before he left.
"I was allowing the paying customers to leave first," he said.

HEADLINE: Great Lakes Bancorp Doubles Loss Reserve

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Great Lakes Bancorp said today that it would more than double its reserves for loan losses and write off $25 million of nonperforming good will assets, causing it to lose between $18 million and $23 million in 1990.
Great Lakes said that increasing its loan-loss reserves to $23 million, from $10.8 million at the end of September, would cause it to lose money in the fourth quarter, but it did not say how much. It also said it would reduce its 1990 net income to between $5 million and $7 million before the good will write-off. In 1989 the institution had net earnings of $13.7 million, or $3.10 a share, before extraordinary items. 
 Great Lakes, a Federal savings bank based in Ann Arbor, Mich., had $3.7 billion in assets and 52 branches in Michigan at the end of September. It increased the reserves before a routine examination by Federal regulators at the end of January, analysts said.
"This move reflects the tougher attitude among Federal regulators, as far as the amount of nonperforming loans thrifts can carry on their books," said Henry S. Peltz, an independent analyst and consultant in Ardsley, N.Y. "It's also a recognition by Great Lakes of the deteriorating economy."
 
 'A Bookkeeping Action'
 Mr. Peltz said the Great Lakes action was rare in the industry, because few savings institutions had enough capital to be able to add to their reserves. In June, Great Lakes Bancorp raised $27 million in new capital by selling preferred stock.
Good will is the difference between what an institution pays to acquire loans and mortgages, and what those assets are actually worth on the open market.
Until last year, savings institutions were allowed to include good will as regulatory capital, the funds they must set aside to serve as a cushion in bad operating years. As part of the Government's attempt to stem the huge losses arising from failing savings units, Congress voted in 1989 to require them to exclude good will from regulatory capital by the end of 1994.
Mr. Peltz said the Great Lakes good will write-off was "essentially a bookkeeping action, which has already been taken into account by investors."
The move will reduce Great Lakes' good will assets to approximately $50 million, according to Robert J. Delonis, the bank's president. Mr. Delonis said the institution did not expect to write off its remaining good will "for several years."
Great Lakes stock, traded on Nasdaq, fell $1.50 today to close at $8.

HEADLINE: Big Swings of Fortune From Rise in Oil Price

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The jump in oil prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has produced enormous swings in the fortunes of economies across the globe. Oil-producing countries will be the biggest winners in the standoff, although some experts say that they may not fare as well as many presume.
People who follow world markets said Saudi Arabia, for example, could spend half its windfall from increased oil production and higher prices to aid needier supporters of the coalition against Iraq and to help pay for the American military operation -- obligations that could last longer than the high oil prices.
 
 'Pentagon Dollars'
 "Petrodollars are becoming Pentagon dollars," said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. 
For oil-importing nations, particularly those in the developing world that can ill afford higher energy costs, the losses could be more severe than expected.
On top of these higher costs, some importers, like Turkey and Jordan, are losing billions of dollars in income from their citizens who lost jobs in Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. These and other countries are also losing out on trade with Iraq and Kuwait.
What is more, developing countries like Brazil will not benefit from petrodollars as they did during the oil crisis of the 1970's, when American banks recycled oil exporters' profits by making loans to Latin America.
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, and other analysts expect much of the increase in petrodollars from the crisis to be invested by the oil exporters in United States Treasury securities.
 
 No Significant Lift
 He said the oil exporters will want to save the windfall rather then spend it because oil prices are not expected to remain high for long. For the United States, this recycling could help lower interest rates slightly but would not provide any significant lift to an American economy weakened by soaring energy costs.
Among oil exporters, Saudi Arabia is on top of the list of winners from the gulf crisis in terms of increased oil sales, followed by the Soviet Union, Iran and the other major oil exporters, including the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ecuador, Norway, Algeria, Venezuela and Mexico.
While several of these countries, like Ecuador, are small oil exporters, the dollar increases are significant, since for all but the United Arab Emirates and the Soviet Union net oil exports account for more than 5 percent of their gross domestic product, according to Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting concern in Lexington, Mass.
"You don't want to get the image that this is an awful shock to the whole world," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources. "There are a lot of winners."
 
 Revenue Gains in Percent
 According to the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, an oil consulting firm, Saudi Arabia's oil revenues since August are 99 percent above pre-invasion forecasts. Based on the same analysis, Venezuela's oil income rose 94.7 percent; Indonesia's, 80.3 percent; Iran's, 45.4 percent, and Ecuador's, 58.3 percent. In Venezuela, for instance, the oil windfall is a lift to an economy whose reforms in 1989 touched off riots in which 300 people were killed.
In terms of the net gains after accounting for contributions to support the standoff, Hossein Askari, a professor of international finance at George Washington University in Washington, argued that Iran and the Soviet Union were probably the top winners.
Starved for hard currency, the Soviet Union, which is supporting the coalition but not providing troops or money, could make an additional $1.35 billion a month in oil revenues if oil prices stay around the current level of $27.50 a barrel, he said. Iran, which also in not providing financial assistance in the standoff, could reap an additional $1 billion a month.
While Saudi Arabia gets the biggest oil windfall -- $3.5 billion to $4 billion a month -- Professor Askari said these gains could be shaved in half by its commitments to aid countries like Egypt and to back the United States military operation.
These obligations are expected to last longer than the oil price rise, he said. The reason is that the economic damage to members of the coalition will take a long time to repair, while oil prices are expected to drop if there is a settlement or even a quick war.
 
 Eventual Price Fall Expected
 The increase in production by Saudi Arabia and other producers like Venezuela and the return of production from Iraq and Kuwait should increase the available oil supply and drive down prices after the crisis is resolved. Such a decline could create serious tensions within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and could sharply reduce the revenue of individual producers.
According to the Treasury Department, Saudi Arabia and the other gulf states have already contributed $8.8 billion to a fund to aid countries hurt by the crisis. Japan and the European Community have given $4.2 billion to the fund. Among the countries already getting aid are Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Djibouti and Morocco.
In addition to paying for the military operation, Saudi Arabia has contributed $760 million; Kuwait, $2.5 billion, and the United Arab Emirates, $250 million to the Pentagon. (Germany has contributed $272 million, and Japan, $426 million.)
 
 Aid Level Criticized
 But some American officials say that Saudi Arabia, Germany and Japan have not contributed enough to the cost of the standoff and are putting pressure on them for more money. Neither Germany nor Japan has provided troops. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the House majority leader, added his voice to those of the critics last week.
Another beneficiary of higher oil prices is Britain, which is a net exporter of energy. But the gains are not enough to keep Britain out of a recession. The slowdown in Europe and the United States caused by the oil price increase will hurt Britain's declining economy by reducing export sales.
For countries like Venezuela and Nigeria, rising oil prices are nothing but good news. But officials at the World Bank note that it could become a longer-term detriment if those countries use the money to expand government spending programs and then the windfall disappears.
On the losing side, the list is much longer because more countries import oil than export it. The list includes the United States; Japan, which has virtually no oil of its own; most of Europe; Eastern Europe, and all the oil importing countries of the developing world in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
 
 List of 51 Countries Hurt Most
 The World Bank has prepared a list of 51 seriously affected countries, including Chad, India, Panama, Uruguay, Brazil, South Korea, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia. Of course, Iraq and Kuwait are among the most obvious losers, losing billions in oil revenues and facing the threat of devastation from war.
The countries most sharply affected, whose net imports of oil equal 5 percent or more of their gross domestic product, are Turkey, the Philippines, Greece, Portugal, Thailand, Egypt, Jordan and Nicaragua.
In the Philippines, for instance, the price jump has set off protests and strikes and left the coup-plagued Government of President Corazon C. Aquino facing its worst economic crisis since 1986.
In Turkey, higher oil prices could siphon off about $3 billion, or 3.7 percent of the country's economic growth. In addition, thousands of its citizens who worked in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait have been sent home since the invasion.
According to the World Bank, the total pay lost by these workers could equal about 2.5 percent of the countries' gross domestic product in 1988. Turkey has also lost trade to Kuwait and Iraq, which together bought 11.7 percent of Turkey's exports in 1987, the bank said.
But foreign aid from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council should help offset the damage. And Turkey's support of the West could give it additional leverage in its quest to join the European Community.
 
 Losses for Jordan
 Jordan is another big loser, both economically and politically. Besides being a major oil importer, it has lost money from worker remittances, has had to cope with the refugees from Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion, has lost aid from Saudi Arabia because of its support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and at the same time has lost out on trade with Kuwait and Iraq because of its support of the United Nations embargoes. Its continued support of the Iraqi leader may severely damage its relations with the West over the long term.
Among the other countries that face rising oil bills and loss of remittances are Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Sudan.
East European countries, struggling to build market economies after more than 40 years of Communism, face a drain of $8 billion to $10 billion when the Soviet Union ends its subsidies on Jan. 1 and sells oil to them at market prices. The jump in the oil price to an average of $25 a barrel will double those costs.

HEADLINE: Data General's Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Data General Corporation, a company that helped make the minicomputer business soar a decade ago and was lionized in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Soul of a New Machine," made a clean break with its past this month by forcing out its founder and chairman, Edson de Castro. But the company is still trying to prove it has a future, and many industry analysts are not optimistic.
Sixteen months after the company leaped from machines that use proprietary hardware and software to embrace the new wave of "open" systems that has built up around the widely adopted Unix operating-system standard, Data General has sold more than $100 million worth of the new computers. The machines -- work stations and servers that act as hosts for a network of PC's -- have been well received by consultants and customers. 
 But analysts say sales of the new computers are not growing fast enough to offset the erosion of Data General's proprietary minicomputers. Intense competition from I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment is cutting heavily into sales, and margins are much lower than in the lucrative proprietary market. What is more, the new Data General machines are based on a Motorola microprocessor that no other major vendor has yet adopted.
But Ronald L. Skates, president and chief executive since November 1989, is optimistic that more aggressive marketing in the coming year will help the Westborough, Mass., company make the jump to open systems successfully. "We need to focus on selling something -- the days of products selling themselves are over," he said. A major advertising campaign is scheduled to begin in January.
In putting pressure on Mr. de Castro to step down, effective next Monday, Data General is signaling the end of an era that it is eager to put behind it. But people inside and outside the company say Mr. de Castro has had little to do with day-to-day operations for two years, and analysts think his leaving will have no impact. Mr. de Castro has not announced his plans for the future, and no new chairman has been named.
The contrast between Mr. de Castro, who is 52 years old, and Mr. Skates, who is 49, is stark. Mr. de Castro is a talented engineer; Mr. Skates, a Harvard M.B.A. and certified public accountant, is a strong financial manager who lacks technical credentials. Realizing that a heavy hand was necessary, he has overseen a slashing of costs and personnel at Data General since he joined the company in 1986.
A high-flying operation founded in 1968, Data General was the focus of "Soul of a New Machine," by Tracy Kidder.But it has been losing money since 1985, and last month reported a $140 million loss for the 1990 fiscal year, with a drop in revenues from $1.31 billion, to $1.22 billion. Mr. Skates said earlier this month that the company would not comment on financial results for the first quarter of 1991, which ends Saturday. John W. Adams of Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston reports that the company "is making some progress."
But most analysts are not optimistic. "The future of Data General is not bright," says Marc Schulman, vice president of UBS Securities Inc. "Their problems are not going to ease up; they'll continue to lose money and the economic environment makes it very tough for them."
 
 'We Built This New Strategy'
 "The erosion of their installed MV minicomputer base is happening faster than the growth of their Aviion open-systems base," added Thomas Willmott, vice president of the Aberdeen Group in Boston. "The prospects are grim."
Such dire predictions are familiar to Mr. Skates and J. Thomas West, a senior vice president and the company's technology leader who was a central figure in "Soul of a New Machine" for his work on the company's minicomputers. The two look haggard as a result of the fiscal struggles, but they remain optimistic about Data General's strategy.
"We've known for the past three years that we wouldn't be profitable as we built this new strategy," Mr. Skates said. "Now we know we have to get profitable as fast as we can. We've recruited a new team, we've added new customers with our Aviion line and we believe in the strategy we're following." He noted that the company would introduce a more powerful version of Aviion in April.
The strategy, initiated by Mr. de Castro nearly four years ago, was to continue to support the company's proprietary Eclipse MV minicomputer line, but also move to the Aviion open systems line.
Under this plan, the company has been forced to endure widespread and painful cost cutting. Employment has been cut virtually in half from a peak of nearly 18,000 in 1984 to 9,300. In the last three years, there have been two major consolidations, resulting in write-offs of $278 million.
 
 Morale Called Low
 A parade of top officers left the company. Eleven of 27 corporate officers in the 1989 annual report are gone. Over the last three years, Mr. Skates has recruited 17 new divisional vice presidents and corporate officers, and they have engineered a reorganization of the company into business units.
The extensive cost cutting and layoffs have been effective on the balance sheet but have left morale low. "I left in July after 12 years," said a former Data General engineer who requested anonymity. "I recently had dinner with a guy who is still there and he told me, 'Morale is worse than when you left.' I found it hard to believe because it was rock bottom when I left."
Even good news has been tainted. Data General received a $127 million contract with the United States Geological Survey, but Congressional investigators are looking into accusations by two Interior Department employees that the contract was rigged in the company's favor by a top aide to President Bush, Ronald Kaufman. Company officials deny any wrongdoing. Data General officials say the issue is closed and the company has already begun shipping the 6,000 Aviion work stations and servers called for in the contract.
Despite this and continued bad economic news, Mr. Skates thinks the worst is over. He said that Data General had a strong balance sheet, with only $57 million in long-term debt, and a low debt-to-equity ratio of 14 percent. The company has sold off several million square feet of space and "can keep going if we go at our current rate."
Through it all, Data General has stuck to its new script.
 
 'Orphan Technology' Cited
 The results have been mixed at best. The Aviion work stations and servers have met with some good reviews. "The hardware is rock solid; we haven't needed a single service call," says Tom LaMarche, data systems manager for the Maricopa County Flood Control District in Phoenix, a Data General customer for 10 years.
First-year sales reached $100 million and Mr. Adams predicts Aviion will grow to $500 million in sales "in fairly short order." But Mr. Schulman warned of tough competition from other computer makers.
In addition, consultants note that Aviion is based on Motorola's 88000 RISC chip, a microprocessor that no other large vendor has yet adopted. "They are out with an orphan technology," Mr. Willmott of Aberdeen said. "Everyone else is at Intel."
Mr. West countered that Motorola, as a $10 billion company, was committed to the chip and that others would jump on the bandwagon soon. Besides, Mr. West said, there are already 1,000 applications from 500 third-party software vendors running on Aviion.
 
 Committed to Its Base
 Rather than abandoning the lucrative MV line, with $600 million in revenues and a reported installed base of 40,000 machines and 200,000 users, Data General says it remains committed to that base. In the last 18 months, Mr. West said, the company has revamped the entire MV line, bringing out a fifth generation of systems, including the recently announced MV/30000.
"It was simply smart business," said Carolyn Griffin, a senior analyst at the International Data Corporation in Framingham, Mass. "They had too many systems to support so they streamlined the MV line. The proprietary line gives them much better margins than the Unix line and it lets the installed base know that it is going to be supported."
Unfortunately, the installed base is eroding -- 24 percent by revenue in 1990, according to Mr. Adams.
Customers are rooting for Data General to succeed. "The performance of their products is excellent," said Robert Neese, director of management information systems for Health One, a 16-hospital nonprofit organization in Minneapolis. "I'm comfortable with the equipment I have, but for future buys, I have to look real hard at Data General's finances. Profitability is a major element of the equation."

HEADLINE: MOSCOW PROMISES TO REMAIN STEADY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Soviet officials have pledged to the Bush Administration to continue coordinating efforts to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis and several civil wars, from El Salvador to Cambodia, in keeping with policies promoted by the departing Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
"They are conveying continuity and we are reasonably optimistic," said a State Department official. 
 American officials said meetings held by President Bush and Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, with Ambassador Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh this week, along with lower-level exchanges in Moscow, convinced the Administration that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains fully in charge of Soviet foreign policy, at least for the time being. Doubts had arisen because of his severe domestic problems, including economic shortages and challenges from rebellious republics.
 
Reassurances for Washington
 Officials refused to comment on the contents of a New Year's note Mr. Gorbachev sent to President Bush, but they said its friendly tenor signaled Moscow's desire to improve relations further at the summit meeting scheduled in Moscow in February.
They said the Soviets continue to express a willingness to complete work at the summit on a new treaty limiting strategic nuclear arms. That initiative was pressed by Mr. Shevardnadze before his surprise resignation last week and apparently was resisted by some conservatives in the Kremlin.
A senior Administration official said Mr. Gorbachev may have given himself more latitude in foreign affairs "at least in the short term" by appearing more open to the concerns of conservatives on domestic and security matters. Speaking of traditional elements in the Communist Party, the military and K.G.B., he said, "The focus of their pressure is much more on internal policy than on external policy."
 
Recurring Theme: Continuity
 He said that most Soviet conservatives who want to limit democratic changes at home tend to believe that Mr. Gorbachev has coordinated his foreign policy too closely to Washington's and "given away the empire," but they have not come up with a unified proposal on how to redirect foreign policy.
Mr. Bessmertnykh requested the 30-minute meeting he held with Mr. Bush on Thursday to reassure the Administration that no policy swings were anticipated in the Kremlin. American officials said the Soviet Ambassador held a more detailed 45-minute session with Mr. Kimmitt on Monday, in which he made a series of commitments that cheered the Administration.
A State Department official said Mr. Kimmitt emphasized the need for Moscow to continue promoting its "united front" with Washington with the approach of the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face eviction by force under a United Nations Security Council resolution. "Mr. Bessmertnykh agreed to that," the official said.
The official said "the recurring theme" of the Kimmitt-Bessmertnykh meeting was: "They want to continue working with us and we want to continue working with them."
 
Kremlin's Central America Role
 The two diplomats devoted the most time to the month-old guerrilla offensive in El Salvador, with Mr. Kimmitt suggesting that Moscow use its influence to stop Cuba and Nicaragua's Sandinista Army from sending arms, particularly antiaircraft missiles, to rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
Mr. Bessmertnykh reiterated Moscow's traditional line that its influence over Cuban and Nicaraguan arms transfers is limited. But he pledged that Moscow would do what it could to restart the stalled United Nations-sponsored peace talks between the Salvadoran rebels and the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani.
Administration officials said they valued the Soviet Union's involvement in Central America now that it no longer actively supports revolutionary movements. They said Moscow had helped prove that SA-14 antiaircraft missiles deployed not long ago by the Salvadoran guerrillas came from Nicaragua by identifying the serial number on an SA-14 missile casing found near a downed aircraft as that of a missile the Soviets had donated to the Nicaraguan Army in 1985.
The Administration hopes such evidence will strengthen the hand of the Nicaraguan President, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, as she tries to control the Sandinista-dominated military.
 
Talks on Afghan War
 Touching briefly on a series of other regional conflicts, Mr. Bessmertnykh promised Mr. Kimmitt that Moscow intended to continue nudging the pro-Soviet Government in Cambodia to compromise on forming an interim Government with a guerrilla coalition, in advance of United Nations-sponsored elections.
He also pledged that Moscow would continue discussions with Washington to settle the civil war in Afghanistan, in which rebels armed by the United States are fighting a regime supported by the Soviet Union. Those efforts have stalled in recent months over several issues, including the timing of future elections, the details of a proposed cutoff of Soviet and United States arms shipments and the future political role of President Najibullah.
Soviet-American relations in the post-Shevardnadze age will face their first test in early January, when peace talks to resolve the civil war in Angola between pro-American guerrillas and a pro-Soviet Government are to resume in a potentially decisive session in Portugal.
 
Complications Ahead?
 An American official said Mr. Bessmertnykh and Mr. Kimmitt expressed their Governments' willingness "to keep up the heat on both sides."
Leonid Sofanov, an aide to Mr. Bessmertnykh, said "we completely agree with our American colleagues that we can work together" on helping the two sides in Angola find a fair solution.
But Administration officials cautioned that complications in United States-Soviet relations could lie ahead. One warned that the appointment of one of the Soviet Government's Arabists as Foreign Minister could soften Moscow's apparent support for the use of force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Tough Clean Air Bill Signed in Massachusetts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has signed a clean air bill that adopts California's auto emissions standards, the toughest in the country.
The new emission standards, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003, are intended to reduce smog-producing pollutants sharply. 
 Based on California's new tailpipe standards, the law requires auto makers to cut emissions of hydrocarbons by 75 percent and nitric oxide by 50 percent beyond the requirements of the new Federal Clean Air Act. Hydrocarbons and nitric oxide are the chief components of smog and contribute to acid rain as well as to the warming trend known as the greenhouse effect, environmentalists say.
The new law, signed Thursday, also requires that Massachusetts adopt California's new warranty, testing and recall provisions.
 
The Cost of Bad Air
 "We are paying a tremendous economic cost for bad air, and this is a piece of state legislation that has national implications," said Representative David Cohen, a Democrat from Newton who sponsored the bill in the House. "The problem with other states is just that none of them had the courage" to follow California, he said.
Mr. Cohen said the new law is expected to help reduce air pollution in the state by 25 percent.
According to environomental experts, all other Northeastern states, as well as Texas and Illinois, are considering adopting California's new standards.
California has had standards that are more stringent than those set by the Federal Government since the 1970's. States can adopt either the Federal standards or California standards.
 
Action in New York
 This fall, environmentalists applauded New York for adopting the same anti-pollution standards that are to go into effect in California for cars in the 1993 model year. Under its new law, Massachusetts will adopt the even stricter standards that California has set for cars in the 1994 model year. New York and several other states are expected to adopt the more stringent emission control standards as well.
"We hope its passing in this state will give other states the impetus to do the same," said Jenny Carter, an environmental lawyer with the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
California officials have estimated that the anti-pollution equipment would cost about $170 a car. Other auto industry estimates put the price at about $300.
Under an agreement with automobile manufacturers, supporters of the Massachusetts bill agreed to postpone the date the new anti-pollution equipment must be in place from model year 1993 to model year 1995. The 1995 cars will go on sale in late 1994.
The new law will require that pollution control equipment be covered by a warranty for seven years or 70,000 miles. It would also require that the automobiles carry diagnostic equipment to alert the driver if the anti-pollution equipment was not working, Ms. Carter said.
The new law would also allow the state to order a recall if the pollution-control equipment failed at an unacceptable rate, she said.

The Buses That Haul In Players

BYLINE: By Ira Berkow

 BODY:
I had this dream. In the dream, buses from colleges backed up into black communities and made off with talented athletes and, despite the pressures of big-time athletics and the crassness and callousness and hypocrisy of many of those colleges, these athletes took advantage of the classroom opportunity and went on to make something of themselves.
 This dream was inspired by a segment on "60 Minutes" shown last Sunday night. The segment depicted some of the attitudes and actualities in top-level college sports, particularly in relation to blacks, black players having risen to dominance nationwide in recent years in the revenue-producing sports of basketball and football. 
 This dream was precipitated by a remark on the "60 Minutes" segment from Harry Edwards, the prominent black sociology professor from the University of California at Berkeley.
 "We still have a situation," Edwards said, "where essentially traditionally white institutions back buses up to the black community every recruiting season, haul off busloads of kids, bring them onto these traditionally white middle-class campuses, use them up, and then dump 75 percent of them right back into those same communities."
 It is true that athletic scholarships are not quite free, and that it is a veritable full-time job to play big-time sports for a university. It is also true that historically many without much funding from home -- athletes or otherwise -- but thrilled to have been admitted to a good college, have had to work long hours busing tables or sweeping floors or working on a garbage truck in summer to pay for tuition and board and books, and the occasional date to the movies.
 But too often, as "60 Minutes" illustrated, former stars like the Pancho Wrights of the University of Louisville and the Skip Hendersons of Marshall, who apparently majored in eligibility, don't earn degrees, don't get pro contracts and become lost souls, reduced to working freelance construction (Wright) or being arrested and accused of stealing a car (Henderson). And two current black players -- Dwayne Morton and Brian Hopgood of Louisville -- when whisked into the syndrome, say they are in college for just one reason. "Basketball," Hopgood said. "Make it to the N.B.A. and make big bucks."
 Meanwhile, a coach like Denny Crum of Louisville earns a salary of $250,000 a year, plus a $1 million bonus at the end of his contract, and he thinks naturally the system, which nets the school millions, is just fine, even though the dream of making the pros is achieved by merely 1.6 percent of all college athletes, with an average pro career being less than four years.
 Some school chancellors and coaches, and editorial writers, have paid attention to true schooling for these athletes, but the current system is so entrenched that it seems little will change in that nebulous period known as the forseeable future.
 On "60 Minutes," Edwards also pointed a finger at "black parents and the black community."
"In general," he said, they have "first set up young black athletes by allowing them to develop a higher priority on playbooks than on textbooks. The parents end up without the ticket out of the community they thought they were going to have."
 In the dream I had, these streetwise youths realized that, as Edwards and Arthur Ashe, among others, have urged, they must become educated in class, as a way to be extricated from the underclass. They realized by their street wits that it is a hard and cruel world and that the only people who will truly be looking out for them are not the recruiters or the coaches but themselves.
 I dreamed they comprehended that the percentages were so heavily weighted against their succeeding as pros that they began to regularly attend and even pay attention in the economics class, the philosophy class, the physics class.
 A number of years ago, Andrew Toney, a high school star in Birmingham, Ala., received a basketball scholarship to the University of Southwestern Louisiana. Before going off to school, his father, Ernest, laid down the law: you are going to college to learn in the classroom, he told Andrew. We wouldn't have the money to send you otherwise. It's a rare opportunity you're getting, and I don't want you to waste it. "My father knew of some others in the neighborhood who had received athletic scholarships," Toney recalled yesterday, "and they hadn't taken advantage of the education."
 It happened that Andrew Toney became a standout basketball player in college and one of the handful good enough to even make the pros. For several years he was a star guard with the Philadelphia 76ers, until an injury cut short his career.
 It's also true that Andrew Toney did so well in the classroom that he graduated from college in three and a half years.
 Andrew Toney's father had a dream, too, about that college bus that backed up into his community and hauled off his son, and the lad had the good sense to realize that dream for himself.

HEADLINE: Daring The Impossible

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins; Glenn Collins reports on culture for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Hanging upside down under the silver dome of the Tarrant County Convention Center in Fort Worth, 18 feet from the taut grid of the safety net below, his massive arms readying for the catch, Vilen Golovko sensed that something was dangerously wrong. Pyotr Serdukov, his flying partner for nine years in the Cranes, the aerialists of the Moscow Circus, seemed out of control. Pyotr, having exploded off the fly bar to soar in the four tucked turns of the quadruple somersault, was spinning too quickly -- overrotating, a gymnast would say. Now, arms outstretched to meet Vilen's midair grasp, Pyotr was too advanced for Vilen to catch the trick cleanly.
The rapt crowd of 1,500 Texans below had no idea what they were witnessing: if missed by Vilen, Pyotr -- turning at a speed of as much as 70 miles an hour -- could break his neck by tumbling to the net in an out-of-control fall. Or, if deflected beyond the net by a bungled catch, Pyotr could be killed in his plummet to the floor. 
 The 32-year-old captain of the Cranes did the only thing he could do. From the day that Vilen Golovko began catching for his troupe in 1981, he had reassured his fliers that it was his responsibility -- no matter what the cost -- to gather them in. Vilen knew now that he was certain to be hit by Pyotr. Nevertheless, he flexed forward powerfully and attempted to ensnare Pyotr's wrists with his crushing grip.
Vilen has no memory of what came next, something of a blessing because he received a stunning blow as Pyotr's knee slammed into his cheek. The flier slipped through Vilen's senseless fingers and caromed toward the floor at a bad angle, smashing into the net and hurting his back and shoulder. Vilen's fate was less immediately painful; he lost consciousness, suffering a concussion. He hung limply, his legs braced in the catch bar, swinging slowly, upside down, until another aerialist clambered across the rigging to rescue him. The soaring music of the Cranes continued, the act's seven other fliers kept performing and only a few audience members noticed as Vilen was lowered and carried from the arena.
This near disaster, which occurred on Dec. 10, 1989, did not keep Vilen and Pyotr out of the air for long. The improbably resilient Russians were throwing quadruple somersaults again within a month. But by then they were flying with new understanding. For, as the partners analyzed the accident, as they called to memory every split-second impression and fragmentary image of that midair collision, one conclusion was inescapable: The miss had occurred not because Pyotr was out of control but because he was flying too well. He was flying so high and turning so fast, that he had done four and a half somersaults instead of the requisite four. And if Pyotr could do four and a half without even trying to, then what would he be able to accomplish with disciplined effort?
The answer was intensely exciting: the Five. That's how Vilen and Pyotr refer to it, as if it were capitalized. The Five: five back somersaults from the flying trapeze to the hands of the catcher, a feat never achieved -- and scarcely imagined -- in the 131-year history of the trapeze.

REVIOUSLY, THE DREAM of circus aerialists, the four-minute mile of trapeze flying, had been the quadruple somersault. The feat was first attempted in the late 1970's and finally achieved in performance, in Tucson, Ariz., on July 10, 1982, by Miguel Vazquez and his brother Juan, flying for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The Cranes, the only other fliers ever to achieve the quadruple consistently, never thought seriously of attempting five.
But after the accident in Fort Worth, the quintuple somersault became a goal. Despite failure, injury and the vagaries of the unforeseen, the Cranes have steadily pursued the Five in rehearsal during the Moscow Circus's current 20-city tour of arena America. (On Jan. 16, the Circus, with the Cranes, will begin a two-week engagement at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.) Their progress is a tale of state-of-the-art acrobatics, world-class athleticism and high-tech apparatus. But it is also the story of one of the most determined, innovative and curious groups of performers in the world, whose spectacular antigravity dance transcends any mere acrobatic feat.
How to describe the flight of the Cranes? Try imagining three catchers and six fliers, all of them schooled in Soviet acrobatics and all of them performing simultaneously on a multilevel, $200,000 aerial grid. They fly skyward on electrically winched cables and hurtle from swings they call levitors, performing a seemingly weightless ballet that enacts the words of a Russian song. Their soaring leaps and explosive midair exchanges are accompanied by strobe lighting, stage smoke and the music of Tchaikovsky, Bach, Liszt, Ravel, Stravinsky and Wagner.
The Cranes use their safety net as both a trampoline and, in the context of their narrative performance, a symbol of the earth. Their text, derived from a poem by Rasul Gamzatov, celebrates the souls of soldiers who have perished and who are transformed into white cranes that ascend to the sky. It is a powerful, traditional Russian image, which also informs "The Cranes Are Flying," the World War II Soviet love story that won the best film award in Cannes in 1958. On the trapeze, the last of the fallen, played by Vilen Golovko's wife, Lena, is carried skyward so that peace may prevail. Although all of this activity has been scored, choreographed and lighted for maximum effect, the act can even be inadvertently magical: at one point, as the Cranes perform aerial feats in front of a celestial backdrop, clouds of powdered magnesium from the fliers' hands begin sifting down like star drift.
"They are really astonishingly great artists," says Jerome Robbins, the legendary choreographer, "and the work is incredible from a choreographic point of view. People in the dance field have been working on ropes and ladders, and doing things in the air, but no one has ever come close to what the Cranes do. They're not just passed back and forth, as it is usually done in dance. There is real creativity here. It truly gives the feeling of flying."
I first met the flying Cranes in August 1988, in Toronto, where they had touched earth for the first time on the North American continent. Vilen Golovko was lounging under a leaking circus dining tent as a mammoth thunderstorm approached.
I asked him why the Cranes never announced the completion of the quadruple somersault during their act, as do the Flying Vazquez. "Because our greatest achievement is not the quadruple," he said, through a translator, "but the simultaneity of our aerial gymnastics and the psychological effectiveness of our acting -- all of it working together to move an audience."
The thunder and lightning got closer. The rain on the tent grew louder, but Vilen seemed to become even more relaxed. "The individual trick means nothing in comparison to the overall impression," he continued. "And our act is not a series of tricks."
Soon the rain was so torrential that we put our feet up on chairs to keep from being inundated by the rivers of water coursing under the open sides of the tent. An especially close lightning pulse produced a deafening thunderclap. Vilen seemed not to notice.
"Nevertheless," he said softly, "we do the four because we wanted to do the most difficult trick in the world. We strive to reach perfection in our own work. We want to be the best, and do the impossible."
Two years later, Vilen was in North America again, resting in the bleacher seating of the deserted arena at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City. This time, he was oblivious not to lightning bolts but to the scurrying of cleaning crews that were vacuuming popcorn from under the seats.
Less boyish than he'd been in Toronto, Vilen was as inscrutable as ever, his broad face dominated by sleepy eyes that belie the active mind within. The Cranes would never try for a trick "if it got in the way of our theme," he said, as if the conversation in Toronto had never been interrupted. He quoted a maxim of one of his father's teachers: "In circus, if a costume gets in the way of a trick, get rid of the trick." Still, the Cranes had always assumed that they were the best in the world at whatever they did. And the quintuple had come knocking on their door. How could they not go for the Five?
"Psychological readiness is just as important as physical readiness," Vilen said of achieving the quintuple. "Pyotr must believe he can do it. And I believe in Pyotr."
There are several key aspects of the quintuple somersault that make it so dangerous and so seemingly impossible. The flier must turn five somersaults quickly enough to "open up" -- to stretch out his body from the tucked-in position -- in time to extend his hands so the catcher can grab his wrists. The flight path of the Five is very different from that of the quadruple, whose symmetrical pattern curiously resembles a highway cloverleaf in the air. To achieve the asymmetry of the Five, Pyotr would have to complete his first three somersaults near the top of his arc. This would enable him to complete two more turns during his descent to the catcher, who must compensate for the additional speed and momentum.
"Imagine a swirling ball coming into your face," Vilen said, "and for part of a second you see the arms in their place. And you have a millisecond to catch the flier. If Pyotr is too advanced in his rotation, then I need to compensate and to contrive to catch him by moving my own body."
Is that similar to what he had tried to do in Fort Worth? "The catcher is responsible for the flier's life, and he knows that," Vilen answered. "The flier is totally involved in his own trick, and so the catcher must make the decisions. Subconsciously, you know when to catch. And you know when not to catch. There is no time for thinking."

"IS THE FIVE IMPOSSIBLE?"
Tito Gaona, the most consistently daring young man on the flying trapeze in our time, repeated my question. He smiled. "That's just what they used to wonder about the triple and the quadruple," he said.
Nearly 30 years ago, as a 14-year-old member of a Mexican trampoline act, Gaona was inspired to be a flier by the movie "Trapeze." The film starred Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis as the two aerialists who first threw the triple somersault. (The trick was actually first thrown by Ernest Clarke to Charles Clarke in Cuba in 1909.) Gaona himself was the first modern flier to do the triple somersault consistently. Today, at 43, he estimates he has done more than 20,000 triples in his 25-year career.
It was in 1977 that Gaona attempted to become the first aerialist ever to achieve a quadruple somersault, but he never managed it in performance. Five years later, however, he predicted the success of Juan and Miguel Vazquez. "Miguel flies very high and very fast, and his brother Juan is a great catcher," Gaona told me in 1982, months before the Vazquez brothers achieved their goal in Tucson.
And now, in 1990, Gaona is still flying in the Circus Circus Hotel-Casino in Reno, and he is, as always, au courant about the art of the trapeze. "I first noticed that Pyotr was overrotating in August 1989," he said after a performance one night, explaining that he had watched his friends Pyotr and Vilen in practice. "Pyotr was so tiny and so light. I thought to myself, 'He can do five!' And Vil is a great catcher." Gaona looked very serious. "You know, the Five, it can be done by the Cranes. But they are really going to have to work at it."
Working is something the Cranes are accustomed to. They are the product of the hypercompetitive environment of pre-glasnost Soviet athletic training. Six of the Cranes have achieved the title of Master of Sport, meaning that they have arrived at the top rung of the Soviet sports academy. Recruited by Vilen Golovko and his father, Vilen Golovko Sr., a former aerialist himself, the Cranes began work almost exactly a decade ago, on Jan. 1, 1981. It took four more years to create their act, during a time when the Cranes lived on training athletes' starvation wages in Moscow.
"The early years were so very difficult," said 30-year-old Mikhail Illyushkin, recalling life in the Circus Studio rehearsal space in Moscow. "I don't think that I could withstand such pressure if I had to do it again. We would be four hours rehearsing in the air, then two hours on the floor, and then there was our class, that took place every day. This went on six days a week. There were injuries and accidents. One flier left the act after he cracked his forehead against the center perch and suffered a bad concussion. Exactly the same thing happened to another flier who was doing exactly the same trick -- a front somersault." Misha pointed to a two-inch scar on his leg. "And there was the time I ripped my knee." He shook his head. "I could stand it all, then, because I was young. All of us were so very young."
Added Vladimir Shumilin, the 32-year-old Crane who has, like Pyotr, mastered the quadruple somersault, "What kept us going was the idea that something extraordinary would develop."
That something extraordinary was, in the words of Golovko Sr., now 58, "a thematic aerial spectacle. I wanted it to be totally different from all other air acts in the world: it would have a theme. The idea was to mix theater and ballet and gymnastics and mime and circus."
The senior Golovko, who is often called Papa, is a dedicated chain smoker, with knowing eyes, iron-gray hair, a challenging jaw and a penchant for irony. For many years he made a living standing on his head on the flying trapeze. He later became the state circus administrator responsible for launching all circus acts in the Soviet Union. His son had entered the state circus school at the age of 14 and began performing as a circus acrobat at 16. After serving in the Army, he came to Papa at the age of 21, wondering what to do with his life.
"I told him, 'You continue your father's tradition and fly under the dome as I did,' " Papa recalled. "My idea was to create a flying act that no one had ever imagined before. And my son would put it together. My own experience told me that he could be a great aerialist."
To direct the effort, Papa turned to a rangy, graying director named Pyotr Maistrenko, also a former aerialist. Maistrenko, now 56, had been a private in the Russian Army during World War II and afterward suffered for a time from shell shock. He choreographed the Cranes' flight "to recapture the emotional effect that the war had on me," he recalled. "This is my story."
The Cranes speak of Maistrenko only with reverence. "I love him," Vilen said simply. "From the age of 21, he was like my father. He taught me how to be an artist, a person, a human being." Vilen had reservations about working with his own father, however. "But I thought, I cannot not recognize his experience and his knowledge."
Not only did Vilen struggle to preserve the Cranes during the years of rehearsal, but he also had to find flying equipment for the Cranes in a managed economy unaccustomed to allocating scarce materials to aerialists. Even after the act was up and ready to fly, disaster loomed. "Two weeks before the act was to premiere," said Shumilin, the flier, "after four years of practice, I went to a sports hall to practice -- and broke my hand." His acrobatic flight was essential to the premiere, which was also the athletes' final academic examination. The Cranes would have to fly before the state circus hierarchy, which approves acts and permits them to perform.
"I knew I just had to go up," Shumilin said. "And I did. I felt it impossible not to participate in the actual moment." Not only did the Cranes pass their examination, on March 25, 1985, but six weeks later they were the stars of the state Victory Day festivity in the Kremlin, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the triumph over Nazi Germany. In the audience were more than 3,000 World War II veterans. After the Cranes performed, many of the soldiers cried openly. "We always knew we could evoke such a response," Vilen recalled. "But it was another thing to actually see it."
These days, the Cranes are a circus collective of 25 -- including wives, children and technicians. They embody the tradition of circus in the Soviet Union, a mass entertainment that has the appeal vaudeville had in pre-television America. More than 100 million Soviets see the circus each year, under the aegis of Soyuzgoscirk, the monolithic state circus authority that performers call Soy.
But the Cranes have gone their own way. "Perestroika was in the Cranes from the very beginning, before it was in the country," Vilen said. In 1988 his father left Soyuzgoscirk, after being ousted with his entire administration. Papa Golovko created his own production studio, called Synthesis, sponsored by Moskva, another entertainment agency.
Papa decided he would bring the Cranes along with him to Moskva, and on April 1, 1989, Soyuzgoscirk reluctantly released the Cranes, partly because they had a fan named Mikhail Gorbachev. "Just by agreeing to break away and enter into a new arrangement, the Cranes are forcing the collapse of the old system," said Iosif Kobzon, a Moskva director, during a visit to the Cranes in Atlantic City this summer. "Prior to perestroika, all circus collectives were under the control of Soyuzgoscirk. It was an absolute monarchy. When an artist would go abroad for Soyuzgoscirk, it was not unusual for performers to get as little as $25 per diem on performance days."
But currently, performing for Moskva under the auspices of an American producer, Steven E. Leber, "the artists now get a salary, based on their contribution," Kobzon said. "The workers' collective decides, for example, that a horse tender should get $50 per show, the leading performers might be voted $120 per show. The director of the collective would receive $200 per show. This may not seem like a huge amount of money to American entertainers. But to our performers it is a great amount."
Papa Golovko puts it more bluntly. The Cranes are in "a very enviable position," he said. "No bureaucracy. No supervision. Moskva deducts 30 percent, and that's it. We have control of our own money. We are pioneering a new way of working in my country."

IT WAS THREE HOURS before show time, and Vilen Golovko, dressed, as usual, in black, was directing a Cranes practice session. They would be flying that night in the red plush spaces of the Ziegfeld Theater in the Bally's Casino Resort in Reno.
"It could take us a month, or a year, to do it," Vilen said of the quintuple. "We do it methodically, always remembering that the purpose of the act is not to do the Five. The purpose of the whole architecture of the Cranes is to tell the story line."
The Cranes have planned the assault on the quintuple in several well-defined stages, "all in strict accordance with the laws of physics," Vilen said. His eyes narrowed and he barely smiled. "Of course -- also in strict accordance with the laws of physics -- the quintuple is impossible."
Standing next to him, Pyotr Serdukov shrugged as he gestured to the twisted metal housing of a stage lamp that had broken his fall the previous week. A cable support had been improperly anchored, so that, as the music swelled and the other Cranes soared, Pyotr alone plummeted to the stage from a height of 20 feet, rebounding off the huge lamp. "I tore the ligaments in my left wrist and that was about it," he said casually. "I'll be flying again soon." But now, he explained impatiently, the quintuple was another few weeks farther from his grasp.
Pyotr's has been a life of impatience. Only six months after joining the Cranes at the age of 21, he was throwing the triple somersault. As for the quadruple, which he and Vilen have completed more than 150 times, it is "not difficult at all for me," he said. "I can do it six times a week, no problem. But I haven't been doing it, because it breaks my concentration for the Five."
The first flier to attempt the quintuple somersault was born in Chu, a city in Kazakhstan. Pyotr moved to Moscow at the age of 7 for athletic training, and started intensive acrobatics at 12. After he met Vilen, he contrived to be the first student in the history of his gymnastics school to be assigned to the circus school, which is administered by a competing Government agency.
Vilen joined Pyotr beside the battered lamp, and they began talking animatedly about the accident. Soon the conversation turned to the troupe's early days when Pyotr was trying to master the Cranes' first triple somersault.
"Pyotr didn't learn to fly with me," Vilen said impishly. "He learned on me! I still have the scars to prove it." He shrugged. "Of course, it was someone else who broke my nose -- and my jaw. Someone who weighed more."
"Yes, but in Fort Worth, I was able to knock you out, Vilya," Pyotr shot back. "That time, the lightweight won! With a knockout!"

IT WAS AFTER 1 A.M. ON A rainy Florida Saturday in late November, very late for a practice session in the Orlando Arena. Pyotr's shoulder was aching from a nasty fall in Auburn Hills, Mich., two weeks before, and Vilen's knee was acting up from a practice injury. But tonight, nonetheless, Vilen and Pyotr were going to try to put together the elements of the trick that each had been working on separately. Instead of coaching Pyotr from below, Vilen was ready to try to catch the quintuple for the first time.
Vilen, who weighs 172 pounds and is 5 feet 8 inches tall, climbed the rungs of the ladder to his catch bar, ascending in the fluid way of the Cranes. He reached his perch and languidly assumed the catcher's topsy-turvy stance.
When Pyotr danced up his ladder, he stepped onto the bridge, the elongated pedestal board from which he would push off into space. He was standing 49 feet from Vilen and 30 feet above the arena floor. His face rigid with concentration, Pyotr began visualizing the extreme exertion that lay ahead. He seemed oblivious to the belt attached to the lunge lines that would break his fall if the attempt ended badly. "Hup!" yelled Vilen, giving the signal to Pyotr to power away from the flying bridge, so he could swing out on the bar to pump up speed for his release. Pyotr, light and compact at 110 pounds and 5 feet tall, left the fly bar and arced toward the ceiling.
The world's first attempt to achieve the quintuple somersault took two seconds. It was not successful. Thirty minutes later, Vilen had shouted "Hup!" three more times. Pyotr had tried four times to throw the quintuple. Each time he had failed to connect with Vilen. Pyotr's weakened shoulder was preventing him from blasting off the fly bar with sufficient power to turn quickly enough to complete a full fifth turn and open up in time for the catch. Although he had performed five perfect turns many times practicing alone, he began to realize that this was not going to be his night.
After the fourth miss, Pyotr hit the net, hard, and looked exhausted. By now, Vilen and Pyotr were losing their concentration and their edge. That is when injuries occur, and the Cranes couldn't afford another injury. Pyotr began a slow descent to the arena floor.
As he did, a ripple of applause and shrill whistling drifted upward from the other Cranes, who had been watching. Vilen, returning from on high, looked as enigmatic as ever as he joined Pyotr. The Cranes gathered around them.
"We could have done it on the very first try," said Vilen, face deadpan. "I definitely could have caught Pyotr from behind if he'd only had hands on his backside! Will he consider surgery?"
With that, the assembled Cranes dissolved in laughter. Out came the paper cups and the vodka. The toasts began. "To Pyotr!" came first. Next: "To Vilen!" And then: "To the only performers in history ever to miss the Five!"
Certainly they were the first to miss. No one had ever tried it before. The quest for the quintuple had only begun.

Meanwhile, the catcher, Vilen Golovko, reaches, upside down, to grab him. The feat requires Serdukov to complete his fourth back somersault as he begins his descent.

HDTV, Videodisks and Sharper Images Come to the Fore

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
In video, 1990 may be remembered as the year when high-definition television (HDTV) finally went from promise to reality. Regularly scheduled HDTV transmissions, yielding a picture as good as a top-notch photograph, went on the air for the first time this year in Japan.
Progamming is still limited to a few hours a day, and with sets costing upward of $5,000, the principal display sites are in hotel lobbies and other public places. This situation recalls the period when color television first appeared in the United States 30 years ago and sets were also too costly for most viewers. People would go to watch color TV at their neighborhood bars. 
 The historic parallel is encouraging. As was the case with color television, prices for HDTV are likely to drop with the eventual spread of the new medium. How soon will HDTV find its way to the United States? The darkening economy presents a melancholy prospect. By late 1990 it became clear that neither broadcasters nor viewers were likely to come up with the cash soon.
And there was still no hint from the Federal Communications Commission as to which of half a dozen competing methods of HDTV broadcasting would be approved as the future standard. Not even a preliminary recommendation is expected before the fall of 1992.
To break this impasse, Faroudja Research Enterprises, a small firm in Sunnyvale, Calif., has proposed an interim solution. The company has developed a method of image enhancement that requires no new broadcasting standards, no new channel allotments and not a lot of money. Last month, Faroudja announced that it would undertake test transmissions of its system on TV stations and cable systems early next year in several cities -- probably Boston, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Washington.
The company's president, Yves Faroudja, is a French-born engineer whose prior inventions form the basis of Super-VHS and eight-millimeter video, concedes that his system isn't quite as good as HDTV. But with 1,025 scanning lines it is vastly superior to the present standard of 525 and comes close to the 1,125 scanning lines of full-fledged HDTV.
The main point is that the Faroudja signal can be transmitted through existing television and cable facilities, but present TV sets could not receive the enhanced picture, although they could still get the same quality picture as they do now. The cost of a home receiver capable of displaying the enhanced picture would be far less than that of a full-fledged HDTV set. A TV set capable of receiving the Faroudja system picture might cost about $300 more than present TV sets. The system might improve the quality of American television until HDTV becomes a reality in this country.
 Other video developments in 1990 are having an impact right now. One is the sudden rise in the popularity of videodisks, helped by heavy advertising and promotion. The trend confirms once again that viewers will buy better picture quality if it isn't too costly.
Disks are cheaper than cassettes and provide better pictures and sound, and the repertory available has expanded greatly. In many instances, the same program -- a full-length movie, for example -- can be had on disk for a price 30 to 50 percent lower than on cassette. According to industry estimates, nearly seven million videodisks were sold in 1990.
Also spurring the emergence of videodisks is the growing trend of combining sight and sound in a single "home theater" system. The central unit in such an arrangement is a combination (combi in trade talk) player, which plays both videodisks and compact disks.
Economic factors again figure importantly in this trend. The cost of combi-players has been dropping. Some now carry a list price as low as $500, making them competitive with VCR's.
 In television sets, there has been a general upgrading of picture quality. The better models can now produce a far sharper image than is obtainable from VHS cassettes, broadcasts or cable. The only way to take full advantage of these sets' capabilities is with videodisks.
The technical improvements in image quality -- involving digital data storage on some of the latest models -- make it possible to present larger pictures with acceptable sharpness and detail. This, in turn, accounts for rising sales among sets with larger screens, ranging from 27 to 35 inches, measured diagonally. Even the rather costly rear-projection sets, presenting images up to about 60 images diagonally, gained a larger share of the market in 1990.
While most companies applied the latest technical advances mainly to their larger models, NAD -- a Massachusetts-based company known mainly for its fine audio equipment -- took the opposite course and designed a 13-inch TV set incorporating advanced technology. Concentrated on the relatively small image area, these refinements yield a picture singular in detail and vividness. This small NAD set surely ranks among the more remarkable products of the year.
Among innovative products of 1990, some introduce new capabilities of enduring value: the electronically stabilized camcorder by Panasonic, which takes the jiggle out of videos made with hand-held equipment; Sharp's portable video projector, which throws a five-foot picture on any white wall; the tape-copying VCR by Go-Video that allows single-touch copying of cassettes; the Videonics Video Equalizer, which allows color correction of videotapes along with many other editing functions; and Gemstar's VCR-Plus, which makes it possible to program a VCR simply by punching in a certain set of digits for a specific program.

HEADLINE: SOUND;
It's the Numbers That Foretell The Future

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
Looking back is a good way to see where we are heading. In audio, the first year of the 90's has given us glimpses of technical advances that may take the rest of the decade to mature.
What may be the most important technical advance in audio -- digital broadcasting -- has attracted little notice in this country, aside from a small group of radio engineers, but this new technology has already been put into use in Europe. The development is comparable in importance to the invention of FM. 
 In an age of digital sound, conventional radio transmission, based on analog principles, has become a technical bottleneck. It is restricted in tonal range and dynamics and beset by obtrusive background noise and other interference. Digital broadcasting sidesteps these problems and delivers programs with a sound quality equal to that of a digitally recorded compact disk
The first regularly scheduled digital broadcasts went on the air last spring under the joint auspices of the German, Austrian, Swiss, Dutch and French broadcasting systems. Sixteen digital program channels are beamed over most of Europe from the satellite Kopernikus. Home receivers for decoding the signal use a small dish antenna, about the size of a salad bowl, and sell in Europe for about $1,000. Similar services for the United States are under discussion.
 For Americans, the year's most far-reaching audio event was the introduction of digital audio tape (DAT) after a long delay caused by by legal and political wrangling about possible copyright violations. The timing of the introduction was inopportune. In an increasingly cloudy economy, few people were eager to spend nearly $900 on a new type of tape recorder that wouldn't play their old cassettes. But from a technical point of view, the advantages of DAT are indisputable and make its eventual success seem certain. And, as more companies enter the market with DAT recorders, competition will inevitably cause prices to drop.
DAT is greatly superior to the familiar audio cassette. DAT is to conventional cassettes what CD's are to LP records -- both DAT and CD's make use of digital technology, with all its advantages: silent background, no tape hiss, frequency response to the upper and lower limits of audibility, rock-steady pitch that ends flutter and wow, and a dynamic range that extends from a whisper to a thunderclap.
DAT is also a lot easier to handle than conventional cassettes. There is no need for Dolby noise reduction because there is no noise. Gone is the need to deal with adjustments for different kinds of tape, because all digital tapes are the same. In addition, the wide dynamic range prevents overloading of the tape at peak passages. All this makes it far easier for casual and technically diffident listeners to obtain near-perfect recordings. And you never have to flip the cassette, for DAT has no "other side" -- yet it runs for two uninterrupted hours.
 As for digital disks, there were important developments in CD players, both economic and technical. Prices for CD players continued to drop, and it is possible to buy a competent, no-frills CD player for about $150. Only a few years ago the lowest price was about $1,000.
A growing number of manufacturers adopted a technique known as one-bit or "bitstream" decoding for converting the digital pulses from a CD into an audio signal. This decoding involves circuits able to process information at the startling rate of 33,868,000 bits a second. Bitstream is not inherently better than the best conventional decoding methods, but it makes it easier and cheaper to attain superior performance.
What characterizes well-designed bitstream CD players is the absence of the metallic hardness that often marred the sound of low-cost CD players. The bitstream technique allows even moderately priced players to achieve brilliance without stridency -- a tonal character that should help allay lingering objections to digital sound on the part of listeners partial to the gentler sonic aura of older recording methods.
Speaking of older methods, 1990 marks the virtual if not total demise of the LP record. Fewer and fewer stores stock grooved disks, and few companies still make them.
The passing of the LP may not be lamentable, for it has been replaced by something better. But those whose musical life began at the drop of a needle will cherish fond memories of the black, slow-turning platters.

HEADLINE: THEATER/1990;
Reality Nearly Upstaged a Paradoxical Year

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
If you believe everything happens for a reason, then why was the star of the year's second-most boring Broadway musical, "Shogun," knocked cold by a piece of falling scenery during a press preview? Why was New York's angriest theatrical controversy of the year about a performance -- by Jonathan Pryce, in "Miss Saigon" -- that has only been seen in London and even there by few, if any, of those leading the debate about it? Why in an exceptional year for new American plays -- "Six Degrees of Separation," "The Piano Lesson," "Prelude to a Kiss" -- did December find three prime Shubert playhouses on West 45th Street (the Plymouth, the Royale, the Golden) sitting dark, with no bookings in sight for the New Year?
Don't look here for simple answers to any of these questions. (The answer to an easier question -- Which Broadway musical was more boring than "Shogun"? -- can be more quickly provided: "Aspects of Love.") This has been a more paradoxical year than usual in the eternally irrational world of the theater. The high quality of new productions has been undermined by the low number of new productions, particularly on Broadway, where the output has slowed to a trickle. The American musical, having revived in 1989 with "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel," dropped dead once again on Broadway in 1990, only to have a small renaissance at one theater company Off Broadway, Playwrights Horizons (which originated "Falsettoland" and "Once on This Island" and is now previewing the new Stephen Sondheim-John Weidman "Assassins"). The gala relighting of two antique Broadway houses -- the Walter Kerr (with "The Piano Lesson") and, briefly, the Victory (with "Crowbar") -- has been overshadowed by the perpetual darkness of so many of their neighbors in the half-redeveloped, half-abandoned, increasingly surreal theater district. 
 More pressing still, this was a year in which some of the real-life dramas preoccupying the audience attending the theater -- racial conflict and recession, for starters -- permeated not only the year's outstanding plays but also racked the theater community, dividing it and depleting it. And sometimes the New York theater's own backstage story was as compelling as anything happening on stage.
Take, as one representative example, "The Grapes of Wrath," Frank Galati's epic adaptation of John Steinbeck's Depression novel, as performed by the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago. Watching this work, one could not ignore the parallels between the homeless Okies of the 1930's and the homeless New Yorkers of 1990, some of whom were begging for change outside the theater at intermission. But "The Grapes of Wrath" itself soon became a sad casualty of hard times, despite winning the Tony Award for best play, traditionally a sure box-office boon to any production in any year. The audience for the show, though by no means meager, was simply not big enough to support its populous payroll, and within weeks of its Tony victory, "The Grapes of Wrath" closed.
Thus did a play about a distant depression become in death a symbolic victim of a new economic tailspin, adding its own large company at least temporarily to the ranks of the unemployed and leaving another darkened midtown marquee to serve as a makeshift shelter for New York's destitute. Where did art end and real life begin?
The "Miss Saigon" dispute was also part of a sociopolitical drama far weightier and broader than any single play. Ostensibly the battle was about Jonathan Pryce's right, as a white British actor, to repeat his London performance as a Eurasian pimp in the Broadway production of a West End hit. In reality Mr. Pryce wasn't the issue at all but a symbol, merely the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time, rather like Sherman McCoy in Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Mr. Pryce's case proved to be a catalyst for the release of racial tensions that had been building up for some time and were bound to explode sooner or later in the theater industry, with or without "Miss Saigon."
 As is now history, Actors' Equity shot itself in the foot by attempting to bar Mr. Pryce: The union both unjustly slurred a colleague's performance, inaccurately branding it a "minstrel" routine, and unwisely set itself up as a censor, restricting the creative freedom of theater artists who want to cast whoever they think will best serve their show. (The Equity position was a particularly embarrassing one in a year when the theatrical profession was fighting government censorship of the arts.) But while Equity's quixotic stand on Mr. Pryce was eventually reversed, the wounds opened up by the episode are not going to heal so easily. Though "Miss Saigon" was an absurdly ill-chosen battleground for a debate about racial equality in the theater -- the show is likely to employ more minority performers for more months than any Broadway production in decades -- the debate continues to be a real and challenging one, as yet attracting more demagoguery than solutions.
No Solomon, this observer included, has emerged with a plan about how to resolve the legitimate complaints of minority actors, especially Asians, who feel they have not had a fair shake in pursuing their art on the professional stage. There are more questions than answers. What does one say about a musical like "Oh, Kay!," which gives employment to dozens of black performers but often treats them in a patronizing fashion? What is one to make of the white theater establishment, which often supports nontraditional, or color-blind, casting with its big mouths but not with its bigger productions?
In a letter to the editor published in The New York Times during the Pryce controversy, and typical of the discourse the affair engendered, a half-dozen prominent white actors and playwrights argued that affirmative action is the best route for improving a New York casting system in which "actors of color are silently and automatically excluded from consideration for the majority of offered roles simply because they would be 'inappropriate.' " The three playwrights who signed this letter -- Craig Lucas, Terrence McNally and Larry Kramer -- are all the authors of recent hits ("Prelude to a Kiss," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," "The Normal Heart") in which the lead roles, all of them repeatedly re-cast during the plays' lengthy New York runs, have been exclusively played by white actors.
Talk is cheap, and, heaven knows, there has been plenty of it. One of the few leaders in the theater who tends to back up his pronouncements with deeds, Joseph Papp, helped improve the climate by taking actual affirmative action, both by continuing his career-long practice of nontraditional casting (Morgan Freeman in the summer's "Taming of the Shrew") and by installing George C. Wolfe, the young black author (of "The Colored Museum") and director, as an artistic leader of the New York Shakespeare Festival. (This year Mr. Papp also practiced his convictions on another front by refusing much needed National Endowment funds rather than submit to strictures on their use.) The results of Mr. Wolfe's tenure at the Public so far have included "Spunk," a selflessly imaginative theatrical homage to the fiction of Zora Neale Hurston, and "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," an adaptation of Brecht's epic in which the writer Thulani Davis reset the story in Duvalier's Haiti.
Whatever the individual achievements of the Wolfe productions, they are even more notable for their lavishly executed and uncompromising African-American esthetics, realized by an informal, floating company of young actors and adventurous designers. When one considers the successful Broadway run of "The Piano Lesson," August Wilson's latest, Depression-era installment in his cycle of plays about black America in this century, it is clear that this year, at least, black theater art had far more than a token representation in the major venues of New York theater. But color-blind casting -- whether of blacks, Asians, Hispanics or any other minority -- is another cause entirely, and one that is likely to continue to erupt not just in the theater but in television and film as well.
 As the real-life dramas of racial division and economic hardship pressed on the theater in 1990, so again did the tragedy of AIDS. Both in "Falsettoland," the musical by William Finn and James Lapine, and in Mr. Lucas's "Prelude to a Kiss," writers unearthed beauty and heroism in a story of hideous suffering.
"Falsettoland," whose principal lovers were bracingly played by Stephen Bogardus and Michael Rupert, is the more explicit of the two shows, charting the path of the disease in New York in the early 80's, when, as one lyric goes, "something very bad" was happening but the something still lacked a name and identity. By contrast, "Prelude to a Kiss," which initially featured Alec Baldwin and Mary-Louise Parker as its spellbinding couple, never mentions AIDS but is just as moving in its depiction of bottomless love as the only defense in a "precarious" world where the young join the old in being tested by death. Usually I am tempted to run the other way from plays that try to be uplifting about terminal illness -- see "Shadowlands" for a treacly case in point -- but "Falsettoland" and "Prelude" do leave one feeling, as Mr. Lucas puts it, that "the miracle of another human being" is "never to be squandered."
I would be harder pressed to argue that the two best of the most overtly polemical productions of the season left one with such a full heart. Eric Bogosian's "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll," a brilliant solo performance touring nearly every urban battlefront in contemporary America, and the director Michael Greif's sensational Public Theater revival of Sophie Treadwell's forgotten "Machinal," a 1928 "tragedy in 10 episodes" in which a mercantile New York grinds up its proletarian heroine, leave one high about the power of theater rather than sanguine about humanity. For sheer escapism, a 1990 theatergoer would be better off watching Maggie Smith's outrageous star turn of the old school in Peter Shaffer's well-mannered "Lettice and Lovage," or Spalding Gray's cool star turn of the narcissistic new school in his autobiographical comic monologue "Monster in a Box." The happiest fairy tale of the year is "Once on This Island," a show that announces the arrival of the young songwriting team Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens.
In a class by itself in 1990 is "Six Degrees of Separation," the John Guare play that is an alternately hilarious and moving attempt to uncover what feelings, ideas and people might still be authentic in a city where the con artist is king. In only 90 minutes, Mr. Guare surveys a New York landscape that stretches from the Upper East Side to Rikers Island and that encompasses everything from racism, recession and homelessness to the spiritual qualities of art and love to the cultural significance of Sidney Poitier, Wassily Kandinsky, J. D. Salinger and "Cats." As directed by Jerry Zaks, "Six Degrees" is also a dizzying feat of stagecraft blessed with its own triumphant star performance, by Stockard Channing. In a year that has seen classical theater descend to a still lower estate in New York -- Kevin Kline's intelligent, almost passionless "Hamlet" was by default the best of a lot that included the Mabou Mines's cross-gender "Lear" and a disappointing Philip Bosco "Miser" -- Mr. Guare and Mr. Zaks have given the theater what looks like a new classic.
About the only up-to-the-minute phenomenon missing from "Six Degrees of Separation" is the supernatural. As the country reels from its various crises, not the least of which is the threat of war, Americans seem to want to believe in any world other than this one. Not for nothing was "Ghost" the most popular movie in the country this year. Is it coincidence that ghosts, poltergeists and miracles figure in so many plays this season, often to facilitate happy endings, whether in "Prelude to a Kiss," "The Piano Lesson," "Crowbar" or "Once on This Island"?
 If things do happen for a reason, and if one wants to be superstitious -- and I'm half-kidding, but only half -- maybe a message was being sent when the screen fell and beaned Philip Casnoff during that fateful preview of "Shogun." The effect of the incident on the audience in the Marquis Theater that November night, much of it theater people, was shocking. "Shogun" itself had been numbing most everyone from its opening number, "Karma," but Mr. Casnoff's accident roused the crowd to the loudest screams I've heard in a theater in memory, followed by an equally stunned silence. It was as if an alarm of some sort had sounded.
A karma alarm, perhaps? Mr. Casnoff got a happy ending, recovering from his injury within days. But the prognosis for the theater, like that for the world the stage inevitably reflects, is less clear. The deep divisions and economic darkness spreading throughout the New York theater were hardly abating as 1990 reached its final curtain. If the bizarre calamity at "Shogun" somehow seemed the perfect denouement for this whole disquieting theatrical year, so one cannot rule out the possibility that more than scenery might come crashing down in the months to come.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES/1990;
The Bids Were for Baseball And Florentine Cabinetry

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
As with other global markets, the weakening economy and events in the the Middle East took their toll on antiques buying in 1990. Through July, the 1980's boom continued, with certain rarities selling at auction for the highest prices ever paid for decorative arts. The most spectacular event of the year was the sale of an 18th-century Italian cabinet, which caused a sensation in London when it became the most expensive object other than a painting ever auctioned. The lavishly gilded architectural masterpiece inlaid with semiprecious stones, was bought at Christie's in London for $15.2 million by Barbara Piasecka Johnson of Princeton, N.J., the widow of J. Seward Johnson of the pharmaceuticals family.
Commissioned in 1726 by Henry Somerset, the third Duke of Beaufort, and made in 1730 at the grand ducal workshops in Florence, the cabinet reigned for 260 years at Badminton House (where the game was born), a Palladian-style mansion in Gloucestershire, England. 
 Commenting on that sale and other million-dollar purchases of antiques, Harold Sack of Israel Sack, a New York dealer, said such extraordinary prices are bound to be far fewer during a recession. "I expect a drought in masterpieces on the market," Mr. Sack said. "In my memory it has always been so. In the 1930's when I began in this business, there was a lot of material of quality for sale but very few masterpieces. The equation still holds."
 Over the last decade Mr. Sack paid many of the highest prices at auction for American furniture. In June 1989 at Christie's in New York, he paid $12.1 million for an 18th-century American desk-bookcase -- a triumph of Newport cabinetry that was the costliest piece of furniture ever auctioned until the Badminton cabinet.
Mr. Sack was back at Christie's in New York on Jan. 20 to bid and buy for $4.6 million an 18th-century Philadelphia console table by Thomas Tuffts. The table, with an apron of Chinese-style fretwork, tall legs and slender ankles, is the world's most expensive table sold at auction.
Collectibles commanded lower prices during the year but were ruled by the same psychology of buying. One of the hottest categories was baseball memorabilia. Shirts worn by celebrity players brought some of the highest prices ever paid for sports-related items. In June a 1950 shirt worn by Jackie Robinson was sold for $16,093 by Lelands, a Manhattan auction house. A pin owned by Lou Gehrig was sold for $41,300 by Guernsey's of New York.
Antiquities were in the spotlight throughout the year -- in museum exhibitions at gallery shows, at auction and in a court dispute that spurred an investigation by Scotland Yard. One of the most publicized objects was a restored Greek vessel -- a vase incorporating a fragment of a two-handled krater signed with the name Euphronios -- which was sold for $1.76 million in June at Sotheby's -- a record for a Greek vase. The piece was bought for the New York collectors Shelby White and Leon Levy, who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There it was included in the current exhibition of the couple's antiquities, on view through Jan. 27.
 The year began and ended with controversy over 14 pieces of ancient Roman silver -- lavishly decorated vessels that Sotheby's is trying to sell for the Marquess of Northampton of Britain. The origins and ownership of these silver objects, said by Sotheby's to date from the fourth or fifth centuries and known as the Sevso treasure after a name inscribed on one piece, have been in dispute since Sotheby's announced their existence in February.
The Governments of Lebanon and Yugoslavia each claimed to own the silver and obtained a preliminary injunction in Manhattan barring its removal from the United States. In March, at the request of the Yugoslavian Embassy in London, Scotland Yard began an investigation of the silver and reported in June that there may have been "conspiracy to defraud."
Legal skirmishes continued into November, when it was decided to try the case in this country at a date to be decided by the State Supreme Court. At issue are the two conflicting claims of ownership by Yugoslavia and Lebanon.
This past year antiques shows were dramatically affected by the downturn in the economy. Attendance and sales were down at the major fairs, including one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious events, the Winter Antiques Show, held in January at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan. Fewer socialites appeared at the preview parties, and overall attendance was off by about 2,000, down to about 29,600. And according to Mario Buatta, the show's chairman, the take was down, too -- about $240,000 below the $880,000 total of the year before.
 The International Antique Show attracted some 14,000 people -- down from just under 18,000 in 1989. Sanford Smith, who manages six art and antiques shows each year, said the gate was lower at all of them. The most popular of these bazaars, the Fall Antiques Show at a pier on the Hudson River, was attended by about 14,000 -- off from 17,000 in 1989 after eight years of escalating attendance.
"The dealers don't have any money," Mr. Smith said. "They don't buy enough new material. The need to buy something before someone else gets it isn't there anymore. The excitement that characterized shows in the 1980's is gone from the whole market."

Video Settles Down To Its Second Decade

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS

 BODY:
Video in 1990 was a story of moratoriums and "Rocky Horror," of rising sales and so-so rentals, of "Red October," "Lethal Weapon 2," "Pretty Woman" and "Total Recall," of best sellers that were also best renters. It was a year of dropping prices, used cassettes and "Dick Tracy," of the emerging laser disk, of consolidation and Blockbuster and Warner and MGM/UA, of "The Cook, the Thief" and NC-17.
In 1990 a score of acclaimed films went on tape; others, some not so acclaimed, were put to good commercial use by a maturing industry which was finding life in its second decade to be more problematic than it had been in the early 80's when the VCR was new and the viewers enthralled. 
 Judging the year with a critical eye, the best releases included Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," Paul Mazursky's "Enemies: A Love Story," Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," Michael Moore's "Roger and Me," Nancy Savoca's "True Love," Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" (an Academy Award for Daniel Day-Lewis) and Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July."
There were Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," Bruce Beresford's "Driving Miss Daisy" (Oscars as best picture and for Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman), Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train," Edward Zwick's "Glory," Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V," and Disney's "Little Mermaid" ("the best animated Disney film in at least 30 years," wrote Janet Maslin).
This fall brought Ken Burns's "Civil War," the highly praised series broadcast on PBS. Then came Peter Greenaway's "Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover," video's first title to carry the Motion Picture Association of America's new NC-17 designation.
 Ratings were controversial in 1990, but in video the real ruckus was over Paramount's "Hunt for Red October," released Oct. 25, starring Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. Here was a rental title arriving in stores at close to $100 retail, meaning that retailers were paying about $70 a copy wholesale (as opposed to the usual $65 or so). Would stores rebel and not stock large supplies of the title? Would other studios raise prices of their own hits? And if they did, would the stores raise their rents?
The answers were no (stores stocked the film in good numbers); yes (studio prices rose a bit, if not to the $100 level), and, as for rental increases, maybe. Rents rose here and there, but generally they seemed to be holding at their accustomed levels. "The consumer wants that price," said Brad Burnside, owner of Video Adventure in Evanston, Ill., last July. "Price is one of the great things about video."
Rentals still ruled the video business in 1990, but there was softness. The total number of cassettes rented rose somewhat; the number of tapes rented per household fell somewhat. At midyear, industry leaders were expressing hope that video would be fairly recession-proof. By year's end, citing such factors as the slowing economy, weaker-renting films and wandering consumer attention, many observers had tempered their optimism.
 In 1990, the good news was not rentals but sales. This year for the first time the studios took in more revenue from low-priced cassettes for sale than from tapes for rent. Among those sales titles were a string of hit films in the $20-to-$30 price range: "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Lethal Weapon 2," Disney's "Peter Pan" and "Little Mermaid," "Pretty Woman" and "Total Recall."
Two factors distinguished some of the year's best sellers. First, R-rated films, with sex and violence thought inappropriate for the family-oriented sales market, sold fairly well to very well indeed. Second, some of these titles also rented about as well as they sold. On Billboard's Dec. 15 best-seller list, for example, "Pretty Woman" ($19.99) was No. 1, and "Total Recall" ($24.99) was No. 3; on the best-renter list they were Nos. 1 and 2, respectively.
In 1990, though, it wasn't only the hits that sold well. Sensing a growing public propensity to own and collect, the studios -- MGM/UA, CBS-Fox, Paramount, Turner, Republic and others -- issued scores of older titles from their libraries, most often in series featuring stars and genres from westerns to comedies to crime at prices that seemed to go lower as the year progressed: $19.95, $14.95, $12.95.
Prices of used rental cassettes went lower still (a used "Indiana Jones," for instance, could be had for $7.95). This year even a studio encouraged dipping into the used-cassette bin. When the initial rental rush for "Dick Tracy," released Dec. 19, has slowed, Disney's Touchstone will offer a $3 rebate on used copies.
Along with higher sales and lower prices came various marketing schemes. This was a vintage year for the moratorium, that commercial arm-twister long used in video whereby studios offer titles for limited periods and then withdraw them from the market. The idea, of course, is to increase demand during the window of availability.
On Nov. 8, CBS-Fox, a practiced hand at the moratorium, presented the year's textbook case: "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," released as a rental title at $89.98. Dealers were invited to order the cult classic until Oct. 25, whereupon the supply line was cut. Many retailers found that they hadn't ordered enough, but, as analysts noted, moratoriums work only if you make them stick. This one stuck and it worked. An instant best renter, "Rocky Horror" is also one of only two titles most video dealers can remember that has sold in such numbers at that price ("Gone With the Wind" being the other).
Whatever measures video used in 1990, major operatives tended to get bigger and fewer. In November, Blockbuster Video, the country's largest chain of video stores, announced plans to buy Erol's, the second largest, and numbered close to 1,500 stores nationwide. And on the studio end, MGM/UA Home Video and its long list of titles passed into the hands of Time Warner, giving Warner what some analysts estimated as 22 percent of the video market.

The Important Things Were What Didn't Happen

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
The worst thing that happened to architecture in 1990 was that all the money went away. Then again, maybe the best thing that happened to architecture in 1990 was that all the money went away. There are going to be a lot fewer buildings getting started in the coming decade -- which means less of the glitz, less of the overbuilding, and less of the pretentious, overbearing excess that characterized the 1980's. Expect not a lot of huge skyscrapers being shoehorned into already crowded downtowns, as they were in the last decade. And there won't be a lot of zillion-dollar post-modern beach houses for investment bankers, either.
This will mean that there are also going to be a lot of unemployed architects running around. Indeed, there already are. Few and far between are the architectural firms that are expanding these days; the word is retrenchment, even in some of the largest and mightiest presences in the world of commercial architecture, like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, where a slew of layoffs inaugurated the holiday season. 
 It seems in the spirit of a year like this that a lot of the most important events were things that did not happen. The cancellation of the ill-advised plan by the architect Romaldo Giurgola to expand the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth -- a masterpiece by Louis Kahn that is one of the great museum buildings of the century -- ranks as one of the most positive architectural developments of the year. The plan would have stretched out the museum by replicating Kahn's design, an idea that seems on the surface to respect the masterpiece but in fact would have been a kind of vulgar parody, the architectural equivalent of a stretch limousine.
Another piece of good news in the did-not-happen category was the defeat of a proposal to erect a large jail in front of the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, Calif., one of the last buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright and certainly the greatest monumental civic structure of Wright's late career. The jail as originally conceived would have blocked the view of the Wright building, which is set along a freeway and is one of the first buildings ever designed specifically to be viewed from a moving automobile. As with the Kimbell, a coalition of architects and historic preservationists (who are increasingly accustomed to discovering that "modern" buildings can be in as much danger as old ones) came together to save the day.
Some of the did-not-happens were not so happy. The past year also brought the demise of a remarkable plan to redesign John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City by Henry Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed. The airport is the primary gateway to the United States -- but as it now stands it is a chaotic mess that probably gives the worst first impression of this country since the quarantine rooms on Ellis Island. Mr. Cobb's plan would have reduced the architectural cacophony of the airport's sprawling array of separate terminals by creating a vast central building, a modernist monument that would quite literally have brought order out of chaos. It was killed by a combination of economics and politics: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the airport's operator, lacked both the money and the political muscle to put the plan into effect over the objections of the airlines. Their competing economic interests were better served by the balkanization of the airport's present design.
Also a reminder of the extent to which the economy affects architecture was the near-demise of Donald Trump, who gave us in 1990 one of the world's most spectacular pieces of para-architecture, the Taj Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City, an ordinary building dressed up in so much glitz one was forced to pause before it in astonishment, if not in admiration. (Any place that has 3,000 slot machines in a single room, not to mention a 4,200-square-foot guest suite named after Alexander the Great, has to signify something.)
That not enough people flocked to the place Mr. Trump proclaimed the Eighth Wonder of the World to allow him to pay its mortgage contributed, at least indirectly, to the problems facing another, and ultimately much more important, Trump project: the vast "city" he planned to build on the site of the former Penn rail yards on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners, Trump City is an awful scheme, not only because of the 150-story tower planned as its centerpiece, but in its underlying conception: huge buildings around a mega-shopping mall. It's a grotesque parody of urban values, more a suburban vision blown up to immense urban scale.
While the project remains officially under consideration, the combination of Mr. Trump's own money problems, the decline in the New York economy, and the forthright determination of several civic groups to fight it makes the latest chapters of the still-unfinished saga of Trump City one of the more positive developments of 1990.
High up in the sad news category was the demise of Comiskey Park in Chicago, the magnificent, rough, messy old stadium that was the oldest baseball park in the country and as genuine a ball field as ever existed -- more truly the essence of Chicago than the city's more famous old ball park, Wrigley Field. (Comiskey's replacement, not quite complete, is not as endearing.)
If not a lot is getting built in New York, building still continues apace in Europe -- though by the end of the year, things seemed to be slowing down there, too. Among the other good events of 1990 was Frank Gehry's design for the American Center in Paris, announced in midyear; it will be a powerful and intense building by one of America's greatest architects, and a testament in the midst of Europe to the continued creative strength of American architecture. Also announced was an important European architect's first major building in America: Mario Botta's design for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
This was also the year that Ellis Island in New York harbor, superbly restored by the architectural firms of Beyer Blinder Belle and Notter, Finegold & Alexander, reopened to the public as a museum. It was the most elaborate and expensive restoration of a public building in the United States, and it was done with dignity and imagination.
The Pritzker Prize went to Aldo Rossi of Milan, an honoree who ranks with the best, confirming this international prize's reputation as the accolade to architects who have advanced the art of their profession. And just as the year drew to a close, the American Institute of Architects announced that its highest award, the Gold Medal, will go to the architect, educator and writer Charles Moore, an equally admirable choice.

La Guardia Projects Slow Airport Access
La Guardia Airport is one-quarter of the way through a four-year, $340 million redevelopment program to expand and improve its facilities. Because of construction and delays, passengers heading for the airport should set out earlier than they normally would because of detours and construction delays, suggests William Fife, manager of the redevelopment program.
The major goals of the project, scheduled to be completed by mid-1992, are expansion and modernization of the central terminal building, reconfiguration of the airport's roadway system and construction of a new passenger terminal at the east end of the airport.
"Conditions will get a little worse before they get better," says Mr. Fife. "We encourage the use of public transportation to get out to the airport during the renovation," he says, "but if you do take a car spend more time looking at the signs -- because the shapes of the roadways are different than before."
The central terminal building is being made 55 feet longer for expanded baggage claim areas, extra circulation space for passengers and new restaurant facilities and amenities. On the upper level, the number of lanes for dropoffs are being doubled to help alleviate some of the congestion on the roadways leading into La Guardia.
The new terminal will be for passengers of Continental and Eastern airlines.
This new $162 million facility is part of the plan by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the city's airports, to decentralize La Guardia's terminal facilities, redistribute passengers and relieve congestion in the central terminal area.
Information on public transportation to and from La Guardia, Kennedy or Newark is available by calling 800-247-7433.
 
London Begins Chunnel Station
 Work has started on Britain's first international railroad terminal, Waterloo International, in London, where completion is scheduled to coincide with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993.
According to British Rail plans, trains will depart every hour for both Paris (a three-hour journey) and Brussels (11 minutes more).
Waterloo International is being built as a separate terminal within the site of the existing Waterloo Station.
High-speed trains, with one power car at each end, plus 18 intermediate passenger coaches, will transport passengers at speeds up to 185 miles per hour, making it possible, a British Rail official said, to leave your office in the heart of London and arrive in Paris or Brussels in time for late dinner.
 
U.S. Warning On Fez Violence
The State Department has advised Americans contemplating traveling to Morocco, particularly Fez, to check with the Department or the American Embassy in Rabat for an update on the situation there after violent demonstrations the weekend of Dec. 14-15.
Tourists fled when the Des Merinides Hotel in Fez was set afire during riots following the start of a nationwide general strike. Violence erupted in other cities, including Tangier and Rabat, but it was most widespread in Fez, the country's religious and intellectual center. The city suffered extensive damage as thousands of people rampaged through the streets, looters ransacked jewelry stores, banks and public buildings and rioters set buses and cars on fire and burned the 90-room hotel. The violence, which was prompted, according to diplomats, by hunger, poverty and unemployment, was followed by a pledge by the Moroccan Government to raise salaries, improve social benefits and resume talks with unions and employers to resolve labor disputes. Estimates of the number of people killed in Fez varied; union officials put the number at about 35, including some soldiers.
 
AIR-TRAIN PLAN FROM AMTRAK
 Amtrak and United Airlines are offering packages that permit travel one way by rail and return by air. Travelers will save about 30 percent off the regular one-way fares for each leg. Reservations for the new program begin on Wednesday.
Christopher D. Bowers, a United vice president, said the cost of the plan's packages will help overcome resistance by travelers -- because of high one-way fares -- to taking trips by air one way and by rail the other. One-way fares are the highest in the transportation business, he said.
For example, a round trip (train and plane or plane and train) under the plan between Los Angeles and New York will cost $419 a person in off-peak months and $499 during peak, which is May 24 to Sept. 16 and the Christmas-New Year's period. The regular train fare between the two cities is $307 one way. The package, called the Amtrak Air-Rail Travel Plan, will also allow travelers to fly to a city served by United, journey around the region by rail and fly home from the same United city.
The plan may be used for trans-Continental trips or regional travel between Amtrak and United destinations in the Continental United States, except Alaska. Generally, the plan allows one-way air and one-way rail between two of four zones -- the West, Mountain States, Midwest and East. It also permits two "regional tours." One combines the East Zone with one of five Midwestern and Western cities: Minneapolis-St. Paul, Omaha, Kansas City, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston; the other links the West Zone with Chicago and New Orleans. Other price examples: for travel between Midwest and West, $369 and $399 in peak; Midwest-Florida, $299 and $349, and East-Mountain States, $399 and $439. The regional tour combining the East and five cities costs $419 and $489. The regional tour linking the West with Chicago or New Orleans is $359 and $389.
Reservations from Jan. 2: (800) 872-7245.
 
ART BRIGHTENS WALLS OF PARIS
PARIS
 Paris has blossomed with a new art form. Vivid, eye-catching paintings and metal sculptures brighten dead, windowless walls in a program organized by the city urban mangement office. The city encourages artists to submit ideas, and a wall commmitee that includes neighborhood property owners, votes on the works. The project was started by the Mayor, Jacques Chirac, in 1981 to brighten the many walls left bare when neighboring buildings disappeared during the creation of boulevards and squares beginning in the 19th century.
On a towering blank wall next to a fire station at 20 Rue St.-Fargeau (20th arrondissement), a mosaic depicts a fireman climbing a ladder to rescue a small black plaster cat marooned atop the real wall. Across from the Pompidou Museum at Rue Quincampoix and Rue Aubry-le-Boucher (4th arrondissement), strollers smile at four trompe l'oeil windows giving them a glimpse of a bird, romping children and a man playing a violin. At 58 Rue du Louvre (2d arrondissement) a giant Mona Lisa crafted from metal shimmers far above pedestrians hurrying past.
One of the largest paintings is at 103 Quai Branly (15th arrondissement), blanketing a wall bared when bulldozers leveled old buildings to construct the Eiffel Tower. Labeled "They Made the 20th Century," the wall is packed with the faces of 477 newsmakers from Albert Einstein to Judy Garland. A 14-story windowless wall at 182 Rue Nationale (13th arrondissement) glows with a cinnamon-colored door opening seductively onto a blue sea and crimson sky.
The city pays an artist $2,000 for the model of an approved design and in some cases another $8,000 in prize money on condition that he or she supervise the transfer of the work to the wall by craftsmen.
The Direction de l'Amenagement Urbain, 17 Boulevard Morland, 75004 Paris -- near the Sully-Morland subway stop -- can provide the addresses of the 73 rejuvenated walls. -- ALINE MOSBY

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Fort Worth

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO; ROBERTO SURO is chief of The Times's Houston bureau.

 BODY:
From honky-tonk dance floors to museum galleries, a cowboy spirit survives in Fort Worth. Here glass- sheathed office buildings tower over streets of antique red brick in a setting that offers the visitor gateways to the frontier past. Although its people are too numerous and too diverse to fit a generalization, they too convey the kindly flavors of an earlier time through their tastes and manners. Altogether this small prairie city has become an unusual repository of Western myths and icons.
On display are collections of the works of the American artists Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, and there are fine examples of Victorian architecture as interpreted by rich cattlemen. But there are more than mementos here. At rodeo time in late winter, the West of ranchers, riders and cattle comes to town. The 1991 Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show runs from Jan. 18 to Feb. 3 and offers 28 rodeo performances, 14 auctions and almost continuous showings of cutting horses, bulls, sheep and other animals. 
 Never really a fort, Fort Worth took on its first role in Western history as a way station for cattlemen driving their herds north to Abilene on the Chisholm Trail. After the railroad arrived in 1876 Fort Worth became the end of the trail for cowboys and a major shipping point for cattle. The city then acquired its moniker, Cowtown. Aside from picking up supplies and doing business, cowboys got drunk, gambled and visited prostitutes in a neighborhood known as Hell's Half Acre. Bulldozed over, the area is now the site of the Convention Center.
Fort Worth is one of the few cities beyond the East Coast that can be visited without a car because the major attractions are close to downtown.
The most economical trip from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is offered by the Airporter Bus Service. The trip takes 35 minutes to an hour and costs $7 one way.
The No. 57 bus traverses downtown on Throckmorton Street and takes 10 to 15 minutes to get to the museum district. The No. 73 bus takes about the same time to get to the Stockyards. The fare is 75 cents.
 
Coming Events
 Fort Worth's Western spirit is never more evident that during the rodeo. From Jan. 18 to Feb. 3 the Will Rogers Memorial Center comes to life from 8 A.M. to midnight. More than 18,000 head of livestock from llamas (raised for wool) to draft horses are entered in competitions and auctions on 42 acres of show space. Looking at the animals close up can be a thrill. In addition there is a Children's Barnyard and Milking Parlor, a carnival and midway and a huge commercial exhibition space with Western wear, arts and crafts and ranch equipment. The entry fee is $4, $1 for children.
Rodeo tickets are $12 for weekend performances (Friday night to Sunday night) and $10 for weekday performances. There will be evening performances every night from Jan. 18 to 24 and matinees on Jan. 18, 19 and 20. Then from Jan. 25 to Feb. 3 there will be matinee and evening performances every day. Call the rodeo ticket office at (817) 877-2420 or Rainbow-Ticketmaster at (214) 787-1500 or (800) 725-7200 outside Texas.
Some rodeo events like bronco busting, steer wrestling, bull riding and barrel racing -- though not always of the same quality -- can be seen at the Cowtown Coliseum, 121 East Exchange Avenue in the heart of the Stockyards National Historic District. It schedules single rodeo events, and admission is often free. For example, there is team roping at 2 P.M. on Feb. 10, 17 and 24 and at 8 P.M. on Feb. 12, 15 and 19. For a schedule, call the coliseum at (817) 625-1025.
A variety of buildings, many of them historic, comprise the stockyards district, offering shopping, dining and lodging along with sightseeing. Billy Bob's Texas, relatively new, claims to be the world's biggest honky-tonk. It offers dancing on 13,000 square feet of dance floors to bands that appear on week nights. There are big-name acts and professional bull riding in a miniature rodeo arena on Fridays and Saturdays. For neophytes who stumble making the turns in the Texas two-step there are free lessons on Thursdays at 7 P.M. Billy Bob's is at the corner of North Main Street and Stockyards Boulevard. Cover charges vary. The phone number is (817) 624-7117.
Another stockyards establishment, the White Elephant Saloon, plays host to an annual re-enactment of an 1887 gunfight in which one of the saloon's previous owners, Luke Short, outdrew a popular marshal, Jim (Longhair) Courtright. It was Courtright's last shootout and is said to be the last one on Exchange Avenue. The re-enactment is on Feb. 8 in front of the White Elephant at 106 East Exchange. The phone number is (817) 624-1887.
 
Frontier Art
 The exhibition space for the permanent collection at the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art comprises five small rooms and a long entrance gallery in an airy building designed by Philip Johnson. Taking an hour or two to walk through these compact quarters, however, involves a trip through the history of the American wilderness. Arranged chronologically, the collection offers an array of styles ranging from the landscapes of the Hudson River School to the stark earth tones of Georgia O'Keeffe.
Big Remington canvases like "A Dash for the Timber" show the West of action and drama while "The Fall of the Cowboy" is a somber coda. Russell's paintings often provide a comic counterpoint.
The juxtaposition of Remington's grand romance and Russell's more rustic cowboy art is even more evident at the Sid Richardson Collection of Western Art. About 50 works by the two artists are displayed in one big room on the ground floor of a restored turn-of-the-century building.
Through April 14 the Amon Carter is showing 27 Remington bronzes arranged by types of castings. From May 4 to Aug. 4 the museum will offer the first major exhibit in more than 40 years of works by Carl Wimar (1828-1862). Although this artist, who chronicled Indian and frontier life, may not be a familiar name, many of his images, such as "Floatboatmen on the Mississippi," which is on permanent display here, are familiar images.
The Amon Carter Museum is at 3501 Camp Bowie Boulevard. The phone number is (817) 738-1933. It is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from 1 to 5:30 P.M. Tours are conducted at 2 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Free admission.
The Sid Richardson Collection is at 309 Main Street on Sundance Square. The phone number is (817) 332-6554. Open Tuesday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.; free. Also at the museum is one of three visitor information centers. The other two are at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, 1501 Montgomery Street, and at the Cowtown Coliseum.
While Carter and Richardson restricted their purchases to Western art, the fellow philanthropists Kay and Velma Kimbell produced an eclectic collection from many periods. It is housed in an award-winning building by Louis Kahn at 3333 Camp Bowie Boulevard and is open Tuesday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturday from noon to 8 P.M. and Sunday from noon to 5 P.M. Tours of the exhibitions are conducted at 2 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday. Tours of the collection and the building are offered at 3 P.M. on Sundays. The phone number is (817) 332-8451. Free general admission.
 
The Outdoors
 Besides the Water Gardens, a series of concrete cascades spread out over four blocks between Houston and Commerce Streets, there is the Japanese Garden at 3220 Botanic Garden Drive two miles from downtown. Until March 31 it is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $1.50 on weekends, $1 on weekdays. For joggers and bikers there is the Trinity Trail along the north bank of the Trinity River.
 
Where to Stay
 The Stockyards Hotel, dating from 1906, offers rooms in four basic decors: Indian, Cowboy, Mountain Man and Victorian. If none of them satisfy, there are a few accommodations like the Bonnie and Clyde Room, where the bank robbers supposedly stayed in the summer of 1933. If all else fails, the bar stools at the hotel's Booger Red Saloon are topped with big Western saddles. The hotel is at 109 East Exchange at the entrance to the stockyards. The phone numbers are (817) 625-6427 and (800) 423-8471 outside Texas. Rates range from $95 to $120 a night for two.
Downtown first-class accommodations are available at the 16-story Hyatt Regency Fort Worth with 516 rooms at 815 Main Street; phone: (817) 870-1234 and (800) 233-1234. In the same class is the 12-story Worthington with 508 rooms at 200 Main Street; phone: (817) 870-1000 and (800) 433-5677. Rates at both range from $79 to $124.
The Residence Inn by Marriott at 1701 South University Drive is convenient to the river, the rodeo and the museum district. Rates range from $87 to $110. Phone: (817) 870-1011 or (800) 331-3131.
Budget choice: Days Inn Downtown with 300 rooms at 600 Commerce Street, three blocks from the convention center. Rates for two range from $35 to $55 a night. There is a restaurant and a garage, but a $5-a-day parking fee is not included in the room rate. Phone: (817) 332-6900.
 
Where to Eat
 Beef is naturally a favorite in Cowtown, and the Cattlemen's Steak House, 2458 North Main, is the place for it. In dining rooms decorated with pictures of prize steers, diners feast on selections ranging from an 18-ounce Texas strip sirloin, at $21.50, to more modest cuts, available at half the price. Lunch and dinner are served Monday to Friday, dinner only on weekends. The phone number is (817) 624-3945. Reservations accepted every night but Saturday.
Every Texas city and many towns have barbecue places that are part of local lore. In Fort Worth it is Angelo's at 2533 White Settlement Road. Brisket, pork ribs, ham and links are served cafeteria style in sandwiches and on plate dinners. Prices are about $5 to $10 a person, depending on the number of side orders. Phone: (817) 332-0357. Closed Sundays.
Texan and Tex-Mex cuisine act as the great social equalizers, with customers in blue jeans and business suits sitting side by side. At Joe T. Garcia's, for example, a fixed-price meal ($7.75 at lunch or dinner) served family style includes nachos, tacos, enchiladas, rice, beans and guacamole. There is no menu, but other dishes are usually served, including fajitas. The restaurant, at 2201 North Commerce, has a delightful patio and is open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. There can be long lines, so arrive early for meals like Sunday brunch. The phone number is (817) 626-4356. No credit cards accepted.

HEADLINE: DOOMSTER VS. BOOMSTER

 BODY:
What strikes me about Julian Simon is not so much his blind optimism, but rather his laissez-faire attitude toward change ("Betting the Planet" by John Tierney, Dec. 2). Simon acknowledges that population growth will cause "short-term problems." For countries in the developing world, such "short-term problems" include lack of adequate food or clean water, lack of needed medical facilities, etc. What Simon argues is a complacent acceptance of the status quo until the status quo become untenable. What seems more logical to me would be to avoid the problems as much as possible before they arise.

 BODY:
Tierney notes that doomsayers like Ehrlich have proved to be far more popular than Cornucopians like Simon. There is a simple explanation for this. By forecasting doom and gloom, Ehrlich energizes his audience by allowing them to assume the noble role of saving our planet.
It is much more satisfying to imagine that you are helping to shape humanity's destiny by using cloth diapers instead of disposable ones than it is to sit back and believe that somebody else will solve these problems for you.

Your article notes a swing in academic circles toward the optimists, but assumes that the pessimists still have a grip on the popular level. The recent defeat of environmental referendums was certainly part of the popular tax revolt; in part, however, it may have been a sign that the electorate is becoming too sophisticated for the gibberish of the "greens."

HEADLINE: Fillmore Center

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I appreciated the coverage of Fillmore Center in the Western Addition section of San Francisco ("Tenanting a Big, Controversial Project," Dec. 9). Despite the problems reported, the project is now 95 percent complete. It is providing homes for an economically and racially integrated 600 families, many of whom are from the Western Addition.
[Clarifying the leasing picture as reported in the article, the Filmmore Center management said that 23 of 103 new units that came on the market Dec. 1 had been preleased, and 523 of 686 units that were previously available had been leased. Ultimately Fillmore Center is to have 1,113 apartments. In the retail component, 15,000 square feet is leased, the management said.]
The current development team has successfully moved toward completion of its several goals -- affordable housing, increased neighborhood employment, assistance to minorityes and women contractors, and the provision of neighborhood amenities.
A total of 223 of the units, or 20 percent, are affordable to low-income households, while 335, or 30 percent, are affordable to middle-income households. The development has pumped more than $13 million in wages directly to the neighborhood workers. Special use and contracts for minority and women contractors generated contracts in excess of $21 million. Fillmore Center has provided a 16,000-square-foot community center, and careful design has made it possible to preserve nearly half the site as open space.
As a 25-year resident of the Western Addition, I can attest to both the historical problems and the current successes of the Fillmore Center. Creating housing and new retail uses of this magnitude, which are good neighbors to our surrounding subsidized housing, has been a daunting task and one that is not yet finished.
The agency remains committed to achieving its goals with this development in a way that embodies the best of urban design and city living.

HEADLINE: Essex Incinerator: New Look at Old Debate

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AN overestimation of the amount of trash that would be delivered to Essex County's solid-waste incinerator in Newark has intensified the debate between advocates of incineration and supporters of increased recycling. The discrepancy has also focused new attention upon Gov. Jim Florio's plans for regionalized incineration.
The waste-to-energy incinerator, designed to handle up to 2,250 tons of trash a day, was guaranteed by Essex County officials to receive a delivery of 1,800 tons a day. The county, however, has been able to deliver only half that amount. 
 As a result, officials are trying to negotiate a long-term agreement with another county to make up for the shortfall. But such an agreement could require expanding the plant and the burning of even more trash than anticipated in Essex County.
Environmentalists say the situation is proof that the plant was deliberately oversized and that regionalization of incineration is no guarantee that less trash will be burned. Regionalization, they say, only concentrates pollution in the state's poorer, densely populated areas.
But state and county officials say Essex County's problem will have positive results. They say it will make cooperation between counties and the regionalization of incineration inevitable. And that, they say, will result in more efficient processing of solid waste and in lower disposal costs for taxpayers.
The debate comes at a time when the cost of solid-waste disposal continues to rise sharply and when counties are re-examining their waste-disposal plans in an effort to meet the Governor's goal of 60 percent recycling statewide.
"We are going to turn a problem into an opportunity," said the Essex County Executive, Nicholas Amato, referring to the county's effort to remedy its solid-waste shortfall.
"If we can put together a regional situation with Bergen County or with both Hudson County and Bergen County, then we will be the county to copy," Mr. Amato said.
An ideal agreement, Mr. Amato said, would require Essex County to burn another county's trash, while the other county would provide landfill space for the resulting ash. With such an agreement, Mr. Amato said, Essex County would have "the best technology, the best price, and we would have solved the solid-waste crisis in this area."
 Officials say Essex County has little choice but to enter into an agreement with another county to burn imported trash. That wasn't necessarily the plan from the beginning.
Initially, the Newark incinerator was designed to burn only Essex County's trash. But critics and environmentalists have asserted from the beginning that it was built larger than necessary to handle the tonnage the county could provide.
County officials, however, signed a contract with American Ref-Fuel of Essex County and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the operator and the owner, respectively, of the incinerator plant, that requires Essex County to pay for the processing of 1,800 tons of trash a day whether that amount is delivered or not. Since the plant opened in November, Essex County has consistently fallen short of the daily tonnage requirement.
 
Population Has Declined
 "In essence, we're nowhere near the tonnage that's required," said Joseph Parlavecchio, president of the Essex County Board of Freeholders. "We are providing half of what we're supposed to."
When the incinerator was designed, Mr. Parlavecchio said, engineers calculated the required capacity from estimates supplied by the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission. Those estimates, however, were based upon the number of truckloads of trash being processed at the transfer station operated by the commission rather than its weight, the currency in which the incinerator deals. In addition, he said, the population of the county has declined over the last several years and recycling efforts have proved more successful than had been anticipated.
And finally, Mr. Parlavecchio said, officials are suspicious that as the cost of solid-waste disposal rose steadily, hundreds of thousands of tons of Essex County trash "leaked" out of the county illegally to out-of-state landfills.
As a result of Essex County's inability to deliver the required amount of trash, the Department of Environmental Protection and the State Board of Public Utilities recently ordered Union County to divert some of its solid waste to Essex County. In addition, 13 municipalities and four private transfer stations in Bergen County were also ordered to begin delivering waste to the Essex incinerator, beginning last week.
 
Lower Rates for a Year
 At the same time, Essex County officials were able to persuade the Port Authority and American Ref-Fuel to lower the $97-a-ton rate at the incinerator to $65 a ton for December and $70 a ton beginning in January.
The lower rates, however, are effective for only one year, and the diversion orders are both temporary, each expiring in 90 days.
As a result, Essex County officials are negotiating with officials from several counties, including Bergen, Hudson and Morris, for a supply of trash and a long-term agreement.
But, officials say, to accept all the waste from another county, the incinerator might have to be expanded and a fourth boiler added to increase capacity. And that has rankled environmentalists who have opposed the incinerator from its inception.
"We predicted that something like this would happen," said Madelyn Hoffman, director of the Grass Roots Environmental Organization in Bloomfield. "Since the very beginning we have been challenging the Essex County freeholders to tell us how much would be burned, how much is available and how much it's going to cost."
Ms. Hoffman said she was not surprised that the county could not provide the amount of trash it had agreed to deliver, since the plant was obviously larger than was needed. As a result, Newark residents may end up with an even larger incinerator where no incinerator should have been built in the first place, she said.
 
'Improperly Chosen Technology'
 Similar situations are likely to occur in Camden County, Gloucester County and Passaic County, Ms. Hoffman said. These are densely populated, urban areas where large incinerator projects are now planned or under construction.
"It's the perpetuation of an improperly chosen technology," Ms. Hoffman said.
Arnold Cohen, a member of the Ironbound Committee Against Toxic Waste, a Newark organization that has opposed construction of the incinerator, said he believed that expansion of the Essex County plant had long been anticipated by both the Port Authority and American Ref-Fuel.
"We contend that they purposely oversized this incinerator and we said so in 1985," Mr. Cohen said. "The more garbage they can put into it, the more profitable it is for them."
Indeed, while Port Authority officials deny that the plant was deliberately oversized, they acknowledge that the incineratorwas built with the possibility of expansion in mind. "We built it to handle 2,250 tons per day," said Deborah Schneekloth, the project manager for the incinerator, "but we did put in some of the infrastructure for a fourth boiler, so it is able to be expanded."
 
A Debate on Regionalization
 Ms. Schneekloth said expansion of the Newark plant fitted in with the state's current policy of regionalization. "There are economies of scale and economies of efficiency," she said. "And there is something to be said for larger plants' being more efficient environmentally."
Ms. Hoffman, however, said that having fewer, larger incinerators was just as damaging to the environment as having numerous smaller ones.
"Instead of having 19 separate ones, they're going to burn the same amount of trash at six or seven facilities," she said. "We've been saying from the beginning that we don't believe regionalization is going to be the solution to our problems."
The situation in Newark, Ms. Hoffman said, underscores environmentalists' concerns that rather than reduce the amount of trash that gets burned, regionalization only centralizes incineration. That becomes even more offensive, environmentalists say, when incinerators are squeezed into densely populated areas like Newark, Camden and possibly Passaic.
At the same time, Ms. Hoffman said, recycling is inevitably discouraged when officials struggle to comply with contracts that require specific minimum amounts of trash to be delivered to the incinerator. And a question no one has answered yet, Ms. Hoffman said, is where to dispose of the ash.
 But in that regard at least, officials say, Essex County's trash shortfall may work to its advantage.
"If Essex County is going to accept some other county's garbage, then they are going to have to provide somewhere to put the ash," said Thomas J. D'Alessio, the Essex County Sheriff, who will become the County Executive on Tuesday. "Getting rid of the ash can end up being more expensive than getting rid of the garbage."
 
The Lesser of Two Evils
 Officials in Morris County, it seems, might be willing to talk business.
"We're seeking a long-term contract for our solid-waste disposal," said John Rae, director of public information for Morris County. Officials there had been considering an incinerator, he said, but the plan generated strong public opposition.
An ash landfill, Mr. Rae said, might be the lesser of two evils. "No matter what you want to put in any community, there's going to be opposition," he said.
William J. Glover, vice president of American Ref-Fuel of Essex, said an agreement between Morris County and Essex County might be "a good fit" since it would not necessarily require a fourth boiler at the Essex incinerator.
"I think this is a perfect example of how regionalization can work," Mr. Glover said. "We can make an agreement with another county, eliminate a resource-recovery project that might have been oversized and resolve two counties' requirements in a single site."
But Margo Reinhardt, vice president of One Clean World, an environmental organization in Flanders, said that even an ash landfill in Morris was unacceptable.
"I want to see Morris's trash composted and recycled and anything that's left over safely landfilled," Ms. Reinhardt said. "We'd be sending Essex a thousand tons of garbage, and they'd send us back a thousand tons of ash. That doesn't solve anything."
Indeed, Ms. Reinhardt said, nothing short of waste reduction and intensive recycling will result in a long-term answer to the solid-waste problem.
"Regionalization of incineration," Ms. Reinhardt said, "is just regionalization of pollution."

HEADLINE: WEEHAWKEN JOURNAL;
Group Fights to Keep 'Magical' Skyline View

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: WEEHAWKEN

 BODY:
EVEN the most jaded Lincoln Tunnel commuter can remember at least one day when the sight of the sun rising over Manhattan into a pastel sky meant that the morning hadn't started so badly after all.
New York as seen from the western shore of the Hudson River is a sight that is seldom disappointing, often inspiring and on occasion nothing short of breathtaking. 
 So for 20 years, a group of citizens from this compact, proud community have fought to preserve as much of that view as possible. Though their concerns may seem self-serving to some, their current battle is being fought on behalf of people who may never even know that Weehawken exists.
 "We have a national treasure here; you can't put a price tag on that view," said Ruth Elsasser, president of the Weehawken Environment Committee, one of the grass-roots groups that have banded together to protect the waterfront environment. "When you see that open vista, that magical view, even if it's just for a moment, it's something you always remember."
 
Protests Before Planning Board
 So when Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus submitted plans for its 93-acre Lincoln Harbor development along the waterfront, Mrs. Elsasser's group, which had been monitoring waterfront development since 1970, quickly became a thorn in the developer's side. Members descended upon planning board meetings and protested almost every aspect of the project that deviated from Weehawken's zoning ordinance.
"We said that the developers were trying to plan for an extension of New York City," Mrs. Elsasser said. "We thought that the development should be an extension of Weehawken."
As a result of the group's persistence, the developer was sent back to the drawing board until it finally came back with a project that was acceptable to officials.
 
Offices, Housing and a Marina
 The final plan, approved in three phases, provided for a total of 2,202,316 square feet of office space, 99,324 square feet of retail and restaurant space, 322 rooms in two hotels, a 250-slip marina and 300 housing units.
But though township officials had accepted Hartz's proposal, Mrs. Elsasser's group took exception to the final phase, which permitted construction of two 10-story buildings that would be "mirror images" of two buildings constructed in an earlier phase. The new buildings, the group said, would block the view of the lower portion of the Hudson.
Though that view is enjoyed primarily by people driving on the ramp to and from the Lincoln Tunnel, Mrs. Elsasser's group believed that it should be preserved and that the buildings should be reduced in height.
John R. Weingart, director of the Division of Coastal Resources in the Department of Environmental Protection, the state agency whose approval is necessary for a waterfront development permit, agreed.
"I feel that this is a spectacular view that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people," he said. "And the role of a state agency like the Department of Environmental Protection is to protect resources that are important to large numbers of people."
<> <> As a result, Mr. Weingart decided to reject the plan as it was proposed. But in a departure from the department's own regulations, Christopher J. Daggett, then the Commissioner, pre-empted Mr. Weingart and issued the permit himself.
 
'Momentary Glimpse' for Motorists
 In his written opinion, Mr. Daggett said that while the proposed buildings might indeed block a portion of the view, that view amounted to nothing more than a "momentary glimpse" for passing motorists. Mr. Daggett's decision was welcomed by municipal officials who were counting on the millions of dollars in anticipated property taxes the project would generate.
The Weehawken Environment Committee, however, saw the Commissioner's approval as an abrupt finale to its 20-year efforts.
"We were outraged," Mrs. Elsasser said.
A few dozen miles to the south, officials of the American Littoral Society, a national environmental group based in Sandy Hook, had been quietly watching the issue as it developed. As long as the local environmentalists were successful, the society remained an observer. But when Mr. Daggett issued his approval, officials of the society decided it was time to act.
"The society pays close attention to the permit process that takes place in the Division of Coastal Resources," said Dery W. Bennett, director of the 9,000-member society. "And when one comes up that we think is bad, we pursue it."
The Weehawken situation presented just such a case.
"This is not a private view issue," Mr. Bennett said. "We aren't raising questions of whether somebody had a condominium bedroom with a blocked view. Our concern is with the public."
State regulations, he said, require that coastal views from public roadways not be blocked. So the society filed suit in the Appellate Division of the State Superior Court to invalidate Mr. Daggett's approval. "We did not like the idea that anytime somebody up above didn't like the decision from down below, they could just yank it away and do it themselves," Mr. Bennett said.
Former Commissioner Daggett later said he believed that his decision had been warranted by the circumstances, but the three-judge Appellate Court apparently disagreed. It vacated the permit and returned the matter to Mr. Weingart for a decision.
Municipal officials were not happy with the court's decision.
"In our opinion, this is not a view issue; this is an economic issue," said Weehawken's Mayor, Richard F. Turner. "There has to be a balance between preserving views and bringing in the ratables that Weehawken needs."
The portion of the view that is blocked, Mr. Turner said, is a small area of the river near the tip of Manhattan.
"We've have tried to preserve the view of midtown and lower Manhattan, and in fact 95 percent of the view will be there forever," he said. In any event, he said, the small portion of the view that will be blocked by the buildings is enjoyed primarily by commuters who contribute nothing to Weehawken.
"While they're sitting in traffic enjoying the view, we're putting up with air pollution and noise pollution and congestion on our local streets," Mr. Turner said. "We estimate that Weehawken will lose between $2 and $3 million in taxes if these buildings are not built. So to preserve 100 percent of the view for commuters who leave nothing in Weehawken is unwarranted, unjustified and unfair."
 
'Proud of What We're Doing'
 Officials of Hartz Mountain Industries, who have appealed the Appellate Court's decision to the State Supreme Court, said they had done everything in their power to create an attractive, viable development.
"We're proud of what we're doing," said Martin Gold, director of planning and marketing for the Secaucus developer, referring to the construction that has already been completed. "But we've put things in place with the idea of going forward with the site as it was originally approved."
And with regard to the loss of the "momentary glimpse" of the river, he said: "It would seem to me that most people ought to be concentrating on driving instead of staring out the window. It's not like there is a scenic overlook where you can pull over."
But for James T. Dette, a Weehawken resident and a member of the environmental committee, even that momentary glimpse is precious.
"Everybody who passes by enjoys it, even if only for seconds," he said. "It's like looking at a bright light. Even after you close your eyes, you can still see it."

Tutoring Inmates In Literacy: A Chance to Grow

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn.

 BODY:
Students from Connect icut College and inmates at three nearby prisons are learning a lot from one another.
The college is one of a handful in the nation with literacy training geared to the prison population, said Diana Hayman, manager of the Federal Department of Education's Student Literacy Corps program. The program provides money to colleges and universities to support literacy work by students, and Connecticut's corps began operating this semester under a grant. 
 Participants study the socio-economic and political reasons behind illiteracy and the skills needed to tutor functionally illiterate adults. The practical phase of the program calls on them to teach some adults to read and write.
Fifteen professors from seven departments helped set up Connecticut College's course, "Origins and Consequences of Adult Illiteracy."
Students spend three hours in a weekly seminar and six hours tutoring inmates at one of the prisons -- J. P. Gates and the Niantic Correctional Facility, both in Niantic, and the Montville Correctional Facility.
 
'Forgot I Was in Prison'
 Rachel Parratto, a junior anthropology major from Philadelphia, said she was surprised at how comfortable she became with her student, who, she said, always arrived early for his sessions and completed extra assignments.
Lorraine Boucher, a visiting instructor in sociology and the academic coordinator for the literacy program, previously taught a class in social problems at Mohegan Community College in Norwich. But this program, she said, is her first opportunity to integrate theory and practice.
The class, which is already over-enrolled for the spring semester, will be underwritten by the Federal grant for two more semesters.

HEADLINE: Setting Up an Island in the Soviet Storm

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
On a fall Friday, just after Pepsico opened its first two Soviet Pizza Huts, a small yellow Lada puttered up to the curb outside the larger one. Out stepped a slight, middle-aged woman who wired the doors shut. The woman, a sanitary inspector, said Pizza Hut had failed to file all the necessary papers, including venereal disease tests for every employee. "This is the cleanest restaurant in Moscow," protested Andrew Rafalat, Pizza Hut's regional director for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. She shrugged, but would not relent.
Just days before, American executives and Soviet officials had hailed the restaurants as evidence of a new epoch, the fruit of perestroika. Said Donald M. Kendall, head of Pepsico's executive committee, "We hope that today's opening sends a clear message to the world that Western-Soviet business initiatives can succeed." 
 Welcome to fast-food capitalism in the Soviet Union, where doing business requires a mastery of bureaucratic intrigue, Socialist economics, international trade and jungle survival techniques.
With 16 years of experience here, Pepsico presumably knows the system as well as anyone. After several calls to Soviet officials, its Pizza Hut reopened in time for Saturday night. Both restaurants are now attracting crowds.
But even a company as well-connected as Pepsico, maker of the most widely available consumer brand in the Soviet Union, cannot insulate itself from growing turmoil. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has courted Western businesses, but others, including the chief of the K.G.B., have said they represent an intrusion and a security threat.
One reason Mr. Rafalat left most of his belongings in Britain is his fear of economic collapse and social chaos. As he said even before the leadership went so deeply into crisis, "There could be a time when we have to pack a few suitcases and get the family out real quickly." By last week, he was reckoning with food costs that had, in some cases, more than tripled. In coming weeks, he plans to raise menu prices as much as 50 percent.
Many American consultants and trade officials are advising caution about Soviet ventures. Without huge stocks of patience and capital, businesses thinking about coming here might best wait until the nation settles down, they say. "The obstacles are just overwhelming," said Richard E. Ericson, a specialist in Soviet economics at Columbia University. "Anyone trying to invest had better enjoy risk."
The McDonald's Corporation has armed itself against those risks by building a $45 million plant to make its own beef patties, pasteurize its own milk and bake its own buns. A 700-seat restaurant -- its largest -- opened here last January, beating Pizza Hut by eight months and generating front-page American coverage when Soviets waited for hours to get inside. But when the state raised meat prices in October, McDonald's nearly doubled many of its prices, and customers often could walk right in.
 
The Pizza Hut Way
 Pizza Hut has taken a more modest approach, spending just $4.8 million and relying on private-sector farmers and existing channels of supply. In Mr. Rafalat's words, "Our objective is to source locally, to live off the land."
A 39-year-old British subject, Mr. Rafalat joined the London office of Pepsico Food Service International in 1984. After opening Pepsico restaurants, which also include Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell, in Africa, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and the Middle East, he knew how to create one from scratch practically anywhere. Or so he thought. Then, in 1987, he was assigned to Moscow.
Three years later, Mr. Rafalat at first seems to overflow with enthusiasm, like a head counselor leading his campers to the swimming hole. Seldom parking himself behind a desk, he constantly bounds from kitchens to storerooms to tables.
But get him to sit down for a few minutes and he talks of experiences that have made him watchful and wary, like someone who has recently been mugged. Or shipwrecked. "Setting up a business here is like setting up an island in an ocean," Mr. Rafalat said. "You hope it will survive the storm."
Pepsico began planning its Soviet Pizza Huts in 1986 at the suggestion of Anatoly F. Dobrynin, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, according to Mr. Kendall. When Mr. Dobrynin was Ambassador to the United States, from 1964 to 1986, he had came to enjoy riding bicycles with his granddaughter to a local Pizza Hut.
The restaurants here are joint ventures, 49 percent owned by Pepsico, 51 percent by the City of Moscow. Mr. Rafalat wanted the city to contribute two locations. First the city offered some cellars on Moscow's outskirts. "We had to explain to these guys that typically, restaurants have to be where people are," Mr. Rafalat said.
Finally, the city agreed to two spots: one, the main restaurant, somewhat out of the way but on a major thoroughfare, Kutuzovski Prospect; the other, a small space on what was then Gorky, but now Tverskaya, Street. At the Kutuzovski building, Mr. Rafalat took the two floors above as well, for offices, warehouse space and possibly the Soviet Union's first Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 
Socialist Savvy
 Mr. Rafalat hired Polish construction workers for their combination of Western work attitudes and Socialist savvy. If a truck he needed to pick up some supplies was late, Mr. Rafalat tended to fume and wait. "The Poles realized," he said, "you go out on the street and give 15 rubles for the nearest truck."
He drilled eager, inexperienced youngsters in the arts of pepperoni-pizza production and relentless good cheer. "This is something the Russians don't understand," he said. "You don't want trained cooks. You want kids off the street. Within a few weeks, they are the best pizza cooks in the world."
Mr. Rafalat found the sanitary codes arcane, with officials standing on every provision. "The Russians will drown you in papers," he said. Inspectors objected to plans for a bathroom on the main building's second floor, with dishwashers below. "They can't imagine a toilet that doesn't leak," he said. They demanded venereal disease tests for every employee. Mr. Rafalat hired his staff a month in advance to make sure all the tests would come back in time, but they didn't.
City officials also quarreled with his plans to take hard foreign currency as well as rubles, saying that Pepsico could count on the ruble's convertibility soon. "We have been here nearly 20 years and it hasn't happened yet," Mr. Rafalat told them. "We need an insurance policy."
Soviet laws required Mr. Rafalat to divide both restaurants into two sides, ruble and hard currency. The ruble side, where a large Evropeskaya, or European, pizza with ham, beef and mushrooms costs less than $4 at the tourist exchange rate, usually has long lines by night. On the hard-currency side, where it costs more than $14, there is seldom a wait. "We have got a lot of hard-currency costs," Mr. Rafalat said. "We need hard-currency earnings."
Then there was the matter of supplies. Mr. Rafalat's insistence on predictable deliveries and consistent quality mystified Soviet officials, he said. "They say, 'If it's a good winter you'll have more. If it's a bad winter, you'll have less.' "
Mr. Rafalat decided to search the growing private market, where food remains plentiful at several times the official prices. He found a middle man who drove him 150 miles south of Moscow, where the paved roads disappear, to inspect his farm.
Mr. Rafalat is educating his suppliers step by step and ruble by ruble. At first all his cabbages arrived in unwieldy sacks and wooden boxes, caked with dirt and covered with unusable leaves. Now, he said, picking one up, they come in plastic bins, cleaned, with the outer leaves peeled away. "Each time they do something better," he said, "I pay a little more."
Stepping into the Tverskaya Pizza Hut several weeks after the opening was like visiting another country. At a dowdy state-run restaurant, an hour and a half can pass while a diner is seated, waits for menus, waits to order, then waits some more to be told that the kitchen is out of what he wants.
At the Pizza Hut, the young waiters and chefs, in their red striped shirts and visors, seem cured of the Soviet knack for standing still. They sweep, they scurry, they serve. Hanging plants, brass railings, oak trim are all immaculately transplanted from the West.
But bureaucratic obstacles persist. "It's impossible," said Mr. Rafalat. "I have a problem knowing whom to call." A few months ago, he would have had no trouble winning permission from the Soviet Council of Ministers to bring in Western small change. But now, the Soviet authorities refer him to the Russian Republic. He has filed applications there, but in the meantime, engineers coming from abroad haul hundreds of dollars in coins.
Mr. Rafalat is training Soviets to take over from him, possibly as soon as the middle of next year. "The whole Pizza Hut concept is a real world business school," he said. Once he has proven that two Pizza Huts can survive the winter, he plans to launch several more.
 
Rough Start
 At first, Mr. Rafalat had cause for wondering whether his restaurants would last a week. The crowds nearly overwhelmed him. Nowhere else had he seen hundreds waiting for hours,to enter a Pizza Hut, though he admits he should have learned from the experience of the Moscow McDonald's. Within days, he assigned more guards and planted galvanized steel railings outside.
Then there were the beer busters. Rambunctious young Soviets knew from the first day that there was no easier place to get beer for rubles. By the second day, Mr. Rafalat banned beer and smoking on the ruble side of his main restaurant, keeping them on the hard-currency side. "People may criticize us," he said. "But they were turning the restaurant into a bar."
Security at the Pizza Huts remains tight. Beer and wine are locked in cages with heavy steel bars. "People would risk their future for a can of beer," Mr. Rafalat said as he walked past the storerooms above his main restaurant. But salamis and canned peas are locked up too. "There is more food in this restaurant than you will see in any food store in Moscow," he said.
Another mistake was the Moscva Seafood pizza, with salmon and sardine. Nothing wrong with the taste, given the Soviet appetite for flavorful fish. But few Russians risked ordering an apparently domestic product in an American restaurant. "Russians have this thing," Mr. Rafalat said. "If it's their own, it must be bad."
All these problems were dwarfed by the inspector's arrival in her yellow Lada.
Tass reported that sanitary problems -- dirty onions and such -- were the reason Pizza Hut was shut down. To this day, Mr. Rafalat said, he has never been shown a copy of the regulations. His other theories include a feud between the city government and the district government, which was hungry for a slice of the joint venture's profits. But according to a local joke, Pizza Hut's only sanitary problem was that its pipelines to local officials weren't working. As Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of the Harvard Russian Research Center, said, "That's what anyone coming from the Chicago region would call a shakedown."
Mr. Rafalat said that several local officials pressured him for favors, telling him, "You have to satisfy our needs." He said he responded by giving them only meals.
After his restaurant was closed down, he frantically called local health authorities. They told him to see them at 4 that Friday afternoon. When he came by their offices, they had left for the weekend.
Meanwhile, in the Bordeaux region of France, an urgent call alerted Mr. Kendall, who was bicycling there. Mr. Kendall phoned Mr. Dobrynin, who had not heard the news. "How are things going to look in the West if we have this problem there?" Mr. Kendall asked him. "This will scare people off."
On Saturday afternoon, the Pizza Hut was back in business, in time for a busy night. But how many companies have a Donald Kendall to reopen the right doors?
 
 
 
LIFE IN MOSCOW: SERIOUS BUSINESS
 Imagine what an executive's life in the United States would be like if getting the car fixed meant driving from Chicago to New York, with a visa and export license required for every trip. In Moscow, Andrew Rafalat found that the nearest garage for anything more than an oil change on his 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser was in Helsinki, 800 miles away. "It's the longest service run in the world," he said. "A real pain."
Mr. Rafalat moved from Britain to Moscow with his wife, Kristina, a 9-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son in January to open some Pizza Huts. Like most Western executives here, he has to be as resourceful in running his household as his business.
His apartment, a half-hour from work, is on the 20th floor in a cluster of new high-rises. Rubble scattered outside and bare, concrete-lined hallways within make it look as though the construction workers quit a few months before they finished.
Neighborhood thieves treat Mr. Rafalat's Toyota as a steady source of second-hand parts. "I've had my alarms stolen. My heater stolen. My radio stolen," Mr. Rafalat said, pointing to a dashboard with gaping holes.
Mr. Rafalat first inspected the premises in October 1989, flashlight in hand. There were no light bulbs. The stove that was supposed to be included wasn't. No mirror or medicine cabinet in the bathroom. No drain pipe underneath the sink. "I never dreamed that opening a Pizza Hut would involve designing my own apartment," he said.
By Russian standards, the apartment is huge: three bedrooms, one bath, a combination living and dining room. Having the City of Moscow as his business partner helped him get more space than most foreign executives. Some live in hotel rooms for a year.
Like backpackers, the Rafalats had to carry or ship in almost everything they needed, including 100 light bulbs. They bought their furniture from a British store that specializes in inexpensive goods for export. The furniture cost $16,000, shipping $20,000.
At first glance, the apartment has the clean, efficient look of a well-run budget motel. On closer inspection, things don't seem quite right. The same bathroom tap swings to serve sink and tub. The vents are covered with tape. "We had super-mosquitoes," Mrs. Rafalat explained. Plumbing leaks had left stagnant water in the basement, perfect breeding grounds, and mosquitoes migrated up through the ducts in the spring.
Foreigners in Moscow have their own sparse network of services. Stockmann's, a branch of a Finnish retailer, offers Western groceries at twice the Western price. The American Embassy has a health club and school, which the Rafalat children attend.
But even those with wallets full of hard currency and rubles have to gather and hunt for their meals. "Day in and day out," Mrs. Rafalat said, "you have to plan a week, or two weeks, or three weeks in advance."
On a weeknight, she assembled a meal of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers from a private market, plastic trays of salads from Stockmann's, canned salmon from a former restaurant manager Mr. Rafalat knows, and a chocolate cake from a cart downtown. The Soviet Union, Mr. Rafalat said as he finished his meal, "is not a place where we can set up a house, put our feet up and feel comfortable. At the end of the day, Moscow's no fun."

 
 
PEPSI-COLA -- BY THE TRICKLE
 It took Pepsico Inc. 15 years of negotiations to become, in 1974, the first American consumer product sold in the Soviet Union. Since then, Pepsi has seldom missed a chance to expand production or introduce Western-style marketing -- or to brag about its success. It has sponsored hockey, soccer and gymnastic events, put red, white and blue "Pepsi" logos on buses and, in 1988, became one of the first Western companies to buy advertising on Soviet television.
Capitalizing on its tenure, the company signed a 10-year agreement with the Soviet Union in April, valued at more than $3 billion, to more than double the number of Pepsi plants, to 50 from 24. In return, the Soviets promised to expand shipments of vodka that allow Pepsico to take its profits in the United States, and to build at least 10 freighters and tankers that the company can sell or lease.
Pepsi sells only its concentrate to the Soviet Union, relying on state-run bottling plants to do the rest. But the company aims to make the plant managers feel like they work for Pepsi as well as the Government. Visits to the West, advanced equipment, technical advice, spare parts -- Pepsi is there to help.
But keeping Pepsi flowing has become difficult as the Soviet economy has unraveled. Every plant has had to interrupt production. Bottling-plant managers sound like harried consumers when they describe how they scrounge for materials. "The whole range of supplies. Everything," said Aleksei A. Kochetov, director of the largest Pepsi bottling company in Moscow.
Keeping bottles on hand, and persuading stores and customers to return them, is hardest of all. "I use the economic-incentives method," said Mr. Kochetov. "You don't give me bottles, you don't get the product. It's as simple as that."
Some of Moscow's ubiquitous Pepsi kiosks always have soda, but elsewhere Pepsi fountains have been disconnected. And Pepsi usually vanishes before it reaches Moscow grocery shelves. As with other goods, it pays to have a friend who knows when shipments arrive, or, better yet, can set some bottles aside.

HEADLINE: For U.S. Airlines, a Sudden Lust for Foreign Entanglements

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The nation's airlines, many of them burdened with debt, have plunged into a crisis under the twin pressures of recession and higher fuel prices. Consolidation, through merger or bankruptcy, threatens to sweep the industry.
Amid this sudden distress, there is a growing temptation to look abroad in search of capital to save the struggling airlines and further bolster the power of the stronger companies. This has renewed the debate over whether it is time to lift the limits on foreign involvement in the domestic air travel market. 
 The question is whether it would be wise -- or helpful -- to change the legal limits that prevent foreigners from exercising financial control over domestic airlines, especially the law that blocks foreign companies from owning more than 25 percent of an American airline's equity.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner "plans to take the first ten days of January and basically go into a full court press" on this issue, Jeffrey Shane, Assistant Secretary of Transportation for policy and international affairs, said in a recent interview.
The issue is one that Mr. Skinner has confronted before, notably in 1989, when KLM Royal Dutch Airways invested in a leveraged buyout of Northwest Airlines and British Airways flirted inconclusively with an investment group attempting to buy out United Airlines.
In both cases, strict limits on foreign ownership were invoked. But this time, the question is being addressed in a much more comprehensive fashion. Airline executives and Government policy makers alike say they hope to resolve it in a way that could have lasting and pervasive effects on international aviation.
 "We must re-examine the limits on foreign investment in U.S. carriers," said Edwin I. Colodny, the chairman of USAir, in a speech this month in Washington, where he was awarded the aviation industry's Wright Trophy for distinguished leadership.
"The current 25 percent limit is outmoded," said Mr. Colodny, whose own airline has been attempting to expand rapidly overseas.
"The U.S. is under increasing pressure to allow greater penetration by foreign carriers of its travel market, including access to U.S. domestic traffic. Alliances and cross-ownerships are spreading. If this trend is representative, it follows that access to foreign equity is just as rational. Indeed, the airlines are already financing much of their aircraft acquisition with foreign debt capital," he said.
The airlines' enormous appetite for capital is the driving force behind the quest for foreign money. Morton S. Beyer, chairman of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm, pointed out that the world's airlines are expected to take delivery of about 8,000 airplanes over the next 15 years, at a cost of about $480 billion. Already, vast numbers of these planes are purchased using complex international leases financed in Japan and Europe, as well as the United States.
But airlines like Pan Am and TWA, which are negotiating a possible mutual salvation in a risky merger, or those like Continental and Eastern, which are in bankruptcy, have a hard time tapping these sources of debt financing. They have pretty well exhausted their credit. Among the United States airlines, American, United, Delta and Northwest are most able to turn to the banks right now.
"What you find is that since 1978 the capital markets have funded huge amounts of money for the U.S. airlines," said Clark Onstad, a former senior executive of Texas Air Group, which managed Eastern and Continental during the reign of Frank Lorenzo. "But now, the only people who find the synergies that make the return on investment worthwhile are air carriers, and those are mostly foreign."
The best remaining source of cash, people in the industry say, is foreign airlines eager to benefit from the huge American market, where they cannot operate except under the very limited international route agreements negotiated between nations around the world.
Foreign airlines are generally prohibited from carrying passengers in domestic American travel, a right known as "cabotage." The restriction has two effects: it prevents a British Airways jet departing London from landing at Kennedy Airport in New York and picking up passengers for a later stop. Consequently, it is more convenient for some passengers to cross the oceans on an American airline than on a foreign carrier because of the ease of making connections inside the United States.
But American airlines face similar restrictions abroad. This has made access to the lucrative routes between the world's major cities some of the most valuable, if intangible, commodities owned by competing airlines, which can buy and sell the routes for hundreds of millions of dollars.
CHANGING the rules on foreign air carriers' investments in American airlines would, in effect, change the way access to these markets is parceled out.
Consider what would happen if an airline like Lufthansa owned half of United, or if Japan Airlines were a third partner in the proposed combination of TWA and Pan Am. Whose interests would be served then by granting American airlines new access to the global hub cities of Frankfurt or Tokyo?
"What if we simply repealed the current constraints on the ability of foreign airlines to control -- and even create -- airlines in the U.S.?" asked Mr. Shane of the Transportation Department in a speech last month that signalled the department's fresh look at the issue.
"For the first time, in effect, we would be allowing foreign carriers to buy for cash the access to our market that, heretofore, they have been able to obtain only by agreeing to open up their own markets," he said.
Mr. Shane was the State Department's leading airline route negotiator before moving to the Transportation Department, where he has helped engineer a program designed to open up international aviation.
His speech disclosed little inclination to relax foreign ownership rules if that would undermine his broader negotiating agenda: "Is there anything in the history of the international airline industry outside the U.S. -- characterized by state sanctioned and even state owned monopolies, price-fixing cartels, capacity sharing agreements, and other economic anachronisms -- that should encourage us to welcome their influence on decision-making in the domestic U.S. air services market?"
IN a subsequent interview, Mr. Shane said that the Bush Administration would prefer to open up the airlines to foreign investment, if only it could first open up the world's aviation markets in the way that many other trade barriers have long since been conquered.
"The issue is, are we ever going to reinvent the global frame in a way that removes the concern about foreign investment?" he said.
The intense pressure being felt right now to allow foreign investment may falsely assume that such a step could provide a lifeline to carriers that are in financial difficulty.
 "There is the legal adage that hard cases make bad law," Mr. Shane said. "In the same way, economic crises can, if you are not careful, beget bad policies. We are not going to abandon all caution. That will not happen."
Even so, there are signs that the Transportation Department has already begun to loosen its grip on foreign investors.
The department has twice allowed KLM extensions of the deadlines to reduce its investment in Northwest under an agreement reached in 1989, when the department ruled that the investment would give the Dutch company too much control over Wings Holdings, which had just taken over Northwest in a leveraged buyout led by the investor Alfred Checchi.
The current arrangement could be allowed to stand, Mr. Shane suggested. To date, "there is no evidence of any inappropriate level of foreign control at the new Northwest," he said.
For now, the Admininstration would prefer to decide airline investment cases one at a time, which is simpler than trying to write a rule governing all cases.
If the Administration decides to rewrite its rules, it has two options, both of which could be problematic.
It could seek a change in the law, something that would require hearings in Congress and would probably face opposition from those who think airlines are national assets.
The Administration also could by executive action seek to redefine the index of foreign control in cases where an airline's equity remains in the hands of United States citizens or corporations. This would allow airlines to borrow more heavily from foreigners, perhaps using more of their assets as collateral, and would allow more foreign representatives into corporate boardrooms. But Mr. Shane said it would take complex regulations to effect such a change, which would reverse decades of case law, and that the changes would be require extensive public comment.
Bradley Larschan, the general counsel at the Association for International Investment, a nonprofit organization that works for liberalized trading rules, said that he also believes Congress could be persuaded to support foreign investment in airlines.
"The initial reaction will be, absolutely no way," he said. "Then they will think what happens if we do not allow this. Doing nothing is also an affirmative choice. Something is going to happen. The Department of Transportation is not motivated by good wishes. It is motivated by reality."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Ah, the Weird Whimsy of It All

BYLINE: By Diana Henriques

 BODY:
Generally speaking, Wall Street research is no laughing matter. Day in and day out, thousands of highly paid and (usually) hard-working men and women monitor the vital signs of thousands of public companies, alert for any development that might affect the market's view of a company's worth. Their findings flow from Wall Street with the force, if not always the clarity, of a mountain cataract seeking the sea.
Some of these reports make a real contribution to investors' understanding of some arcane corner of global finance, or identify a promising investment opportunity. A few even warn investors of a company's deteriorating prospects early enough for them to exit with a portion of their profits intact. (These accomplishments are even more notable given the increased workload that analysts are facing in these lean times. Barry Graubart of Nelson Publications points out that, since 1987, Wall Street firms have been paring research staffs while increasing the number of companies they monitor.) 
 It has become customary on Wall Street for those who turn out these top-notch examples of the analyst's craft to be honored by inclusion in the "All-American" teams compiled each year by Institutional Investor magazine. But where, one wonders, are the annual awards for ghoulishness? For the steadfast support of unsteady stocks? For sheer whimsical weirdness? In short, for all the qualities that make Wall Street what it is? Here, that's where.
Wall Street has long cultivated a reputation for being able to find profit opportunities where others see only grief and pain. This honorable tradition was sustained in 1990 by Jeff Adams, until recently an analyst for PaineWebber. Last January, Mr. Adams saw encouraging prospects for the Loewen Group, a Vancouver-based funeral home chain that trades over the counter. Among his reasons: "Improving death rates."
Although death rates declined in 1989 for the first time in nearly 30 years, Mr. Adams explained, they had started to "improve" as the beginning of 1990 neared. "This implies that 1989 was likely an aberration due to the warm winter and light flu season," he observed. If death rates resumed their normal bullish trend, he added, his profit estimates for Loewen Group could be too conservative.
For the record, the stock advanced more than 40 percent during the year and another PaineWebber analyst, Gerald May, decided in August that the stock was "no longer cheap," given the company's rapid growth and various other risks, including "future trends in cremations vis-a-vis traditional funeral services." Cremations are less costly, "taking into account caskets, limousines and travel time for relatives," Mr. May noted, and a shift toward this less-elaborate ritual might "place some pressure on pricing of traditional funeral services."
If Wall Street gave out a Rhett Butler Award for the swashbuckling defense of a losing cause, the walk-away winner this year would be Robert McAdoo, a widely followed aviation industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. The fearless headline on his Oct. 24 report on Continental Airlines Holdings says it all: "New Chairman Removes President and 4 VPs; Press Reports Fuel Costs Led Company to Review Possible Bankruptcy Filing; Stock Still Attractive."
The shares were trading on the American Stock Exchange at just under $6 each.
The management purge? "A new broom sweeps clean," said Mr. McAdoo. Those press reports of a possible bankruptcy filing? Merely one cost-saving strategy being considered by the debt-heavy company. "Interest costs are the expenses most easily cut by bankruptcy," he said. Still, he did not believe that Continental's fuel price problems were "sufficient to force such a filing."
They were, though. On Dec. 3, the airline filed. This was how Mr. McAdoo concluded his report that day, as Continental's stock fell more than a dollar to close at $3.50 a share: "We are removing Continental Airlines Holdings from our Special Research Series Recommended List. We believe . . . that holders of both the debt and equity securities will be expected to share the pain of the restructuring. At this time, we would avoid all of the company's securities except the secured debt, and would hold that debt only after closely reviewing the collateral associated with the various issues."
Continental closed on Friday at $1.875.
If Woody Allen ever felt inclined to produce a comedy about the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, a useful resource would be the whimsical report issued on Oct. 15 by Eric I. Hemel, a mortgage finance industry analyst for First Boston. "Freddie Mac's stock is torturing us," wrote Mr. Hemel. Resolutely bullish on the deteriorating stock, which was then trading at $43.25 a share, Mr. Hemel had some advice for the agency's top executives, who were "obviously experiencing difficulties communicating clearly with investors."
One of the big problems, Mr. Hemel said, was that "Freddie's management is completely honest intellectually." He explained that several key executives of the company "are all former professors of economics or finance. Intellectual integrity is an almost inherent aspect of their personalities." The problem with all that inherent integrity, he continued, was that "economists have the tendency to qualify almost everything they say with a caveat (i.e., 'Our credit quality trends are positive but, on the other hand, if Saddam Hussein invades New York City, trends could turn negative.')"
While Mr. Hemel, himself a former academician, said he was sympathetic to these "personality quirks," others on Wall Street "tend to infer that a corporate official who hedges every positive point with a negative point must really mean to imply that something is seriously wrong."
The psychoanalysis may have helped; Freddie Mac closed Friday at $48.75.

The Starch Goes Out of the Dollar

 BODY:
Reality caught up with the dollar this holiday week. The American currency surged before Christmas to the 1.51 level against the German mark. Last week, it jumped to 1.54 against the mark and 136 against the yen. Although still quite weak, the dollar was showing signs of strength not seen for months. But on Thursday the Government reported that orders for durable goods had fallen 10.5 percent in November. And on Friday, it was reported that the index of leading economic indicators had declined for the fifth month in a row, dropping 1.2 percent in November. These recession signals knocked the dollar down sharply to -- 1.4936 marks and 134.85 yen -- and put it back on the downward track most forecasters expect it to continue on.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Coping With the Threat of Peace

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
With the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and the possibility of a war afterward staring them in the face, you might expect portfolio managers and market analysts to be beside themselves with anxiety. So why are they so calm?
The answer is that since last August, when the Persian Gulf crisis began, they have become adept at coping with uncertainty about war. And when they look at the larger global picture, they see other factors clouding the outlook for the coming year far more than the situation in the Persian Gulf. 
 These managers point to the decline in world economic growth, with the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia in recessions, the problems with banking systems in America and Japan and the high level of interest rates in Europe and Japan.
"To an extent, it is still the same question," Martin Paling, international strategist for James Capel Inc. in London said about the uncertainty of war. "The deadline does not necessarily say that you will have a war after the Jan. 15, even if the United Nations requirements are not met. We have no idea what is going to happen."
"I do not treat lightly the possibility of hostilities," added Lawrence W. Harris 3d, a director of Lombard Odier International in London. "But this is the most prepared for war portfolio managers have been in my lifetime."
That does not mean that a war would not send stocks down sharply in markets around the world. This would be the likely immediate reaction, especially because some markets have rallied a bit since the lows reached in the fall. But these managers and analysts believe that a war could be quick and that markets would rebound.
In fact, one portfolio manager stands ready with cash to leap in and buy when stocks drop if there is fighting. Another is already putting some cash back into stocks in case there is a negotiated settlement.
Mr. Harris knows a long conflict is possible, but he is counting on a negotiated settlement or quick war that would do no long-term damage to oil production.
"I am convinced there is so much oil out there that it is hard for me to believe that the price of oil would go up very much," he said. Earlier this year, the uncertainity for stock markets caused him to keep 30 percent of the Worldwide Value Fund in cash. He has cut that to 18 percent so he can buy back some stocks, on the theory that there will be a settlement or quick war followed by an equities rally.
Mr. Paling of James Capel agreed. "We feel that the impact of a war on the medium-term economic performance would be limited," he said. Asked about the threat of a war, he answered, "The real question is what is happening if peace breaks out."
Sander Cseh, who runs Cseh International in Philadelphia, has about 10 percent of his small fund in cash. He expects the drop in stock prices to be so shortlived if war breaks out that he is ready to snap up stocks should it happen.
Such strategies reflect the view that a war will not mean a long-term jump in oil prices, an analysis based on the recent sharp increase in oil production in Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries.
But beyond that, analysts and portfolio managers fall back on fundamentals -- the outlook for the world economy and interest rates in general. And although they are generally positive that global stock markets will rise moderately in 1991, after the sharp declines of 1990, there are seeds of doubt. "The main thing that worries me is the possibility that the deterioration in the economy is worse than I thought," said Mr. Harris.
Madhav Dhar, a global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York who is much more bearish, believes that stock markets are too anxious for a rally, which he said means they are ignoring the shakey economic fundamentals.
Finally, there is the problem of the Soviet Union, the wild card in everyone's analysis. It is a country whose problems could send stock markets around the world reeling if something went seriously awry. "With Russia about to implode, that just adds to the risk premium," said Mr. Dhar.

HEADLINE: All About/Tractors;
An Uncertain Reprieve For Tractor Makers

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Gleaming new tractors are becoming more familiar sights on America's farms. Sales and profits at the three leading United States tractor makers -- Deere & Company, the J.I. Case division of Tenneco Inc. and the Ford Motor Company's Ford New Holland division -- are all up, reflecting renewed agricultural prosperity after the near-depression of the early and mid-1980's.
But the recovery in the tractor business, now in its third year, is fragile. War in the Middle East could send oil prices still higher, cutting into farmers' cash flow and undermining their ability to buy new tractors. The price of wheat, one of the most important crops tended by tractors, has been slumping. Further declines could make farmers skittish about buying new equipment. 
 Chief among the longer-term concerns is competition from Japan. Some industry experts fear that the Japanese, who entered the United States market more than a decade ago with small tractors, will increasingly compete with American and European companies for sales of larger machines.
 
The Big Question
A Lull Or Downturn?
 After three straight years of increased sales, America's largest tractor makers wonder whether they are tipping into a temporary lull or a decline like the one that nearly bankrupted them a decade ago.
Dealers report that retail sales of giant row tractors used to harvest crops fell 3 percent in August, 35 percent in September and were flat in October. Although sales rose 18 percent in November, many analysts remain concerned. "The business stopped dead in August," said David Mowitz, senior editor of Successful Farming magazine.
The tractor makers say their troubles are temporary because farmers are in their best financial condition in years. "It's clear the farmer has money," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at PaineWebber. Added Tobias Levkovich, Smith Barney's machinery analyst, "For tractor makers, the up cycle is still intact."
Farmers have paid down debt, and interest rates on their remaining borrowings are lower. The value of their land is up due to higher commodity prices and less acreage in production. And farm incomes tend to run counter to the rest of the economy, as demand for food remains steady while farmers' interest costs and other expenses stabilize or decline. A long recession might leave farmers more prosperous and more inclined to buy new tractors, even those priced close to $100,000..
Analysts say the sudden slump in sales recently was caused by the fear of reduced Federal farm subsidies and the spike in energy prices. But Federal subsidy levels for 1991 have survived with only minor reductions, and many farmers have decided they can absorb the higher costs of energy so far.
Still, even optimists say that war in the Persian Gulf could derail the industry's long-term recovery. Energy comprises more than 6 percent of a farmer's costs, from gasoline and diesel fuel to the petroleum used in many fertilizers and pesticides.
"Barring oil prices going up, I see replacement demand continuing to go up," said Thomas G. Burns, the farm machinery analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company. "But if it's war in the Middle East Jan. 15, you won't have farmers going into dealer showrooms."
 
More Competition
Japan's Move Into Big Tractors

Having conquered the market for small tractors, will the Japanese next attack the market for mid-sized and large machines?
The Japanese developed small tractors for tiny Japanese farms, then penetrated the United States over the last decade by selling to weekend farmers. Each of the Big Three sells Japanese tractors under its own nameplate, and some Japanese makers have dealers of their own.
Farm-machinery executives in the United States would just as soon avoid the topic of the Japanese. But industry experts say tractor makers should remember that the Japanese auto companies scored their first American successes with small cars.
Two Japanese farm-equipment companies, Iseki and Shibauri, are now test-marketing large tractors in Australia. Another Japanese company, Kubota, recently opened a large-tractor plant in Portugal, and Kubota already sells a mid-sized tractor in this country. Deere, Case, Ford and European companies like Deutz-Allis of Germany and Italy's Fiat still dominate sales of large tractors. Ford has recently agreed to merge its tractor division with Fiat's.
But the market's shift toward larger machines to serve larger farms, and the wider profit margins on the bigger tractors, are bound to attract the Japanese. Mid-sized tractors are used primarily in Europe, while the largest roar across the vast farms in the American and Canadian West. "No market is secure," said John Stark, an analyst who publishes Stark's Off-Highway Ledger. "The mix of business is changing and the Japanese could change with it."
 Some analysts say the Japanese would need five to seven years to match the quality of American and European competitors. "U.S. machinery makers have been building awfully good tractors," said Mr. Mowitz of Successful Farming magazine.
The Japanese also lack extensive dealer networks. "Establishing a distribution channel would be the major obstacle for the Japanese," said Vickie L. Rickey, a marketing vice president in Case's tractor group.
Still, the Japanese might not want to expand their commitment to tractors. Profit margins have been slipping due to price cutting and promotions. And with the number of farms declining, long-term tractor demand is headed down.
 
 
Emergency Parts
Federal Express To the Rescue
The competition among major tractor makers has become a race to get parts to farmers in the field. The companies figure that with tractors increasingly alike, they can win sales by convincing farmers of fast service in case of a breakdown. Rapid delivery of parts is particularly important for so-called custom cutters, nomadic harvesters who travel in groups, like wagon trains, following the crops from south to north.
All the tractor manufacturers have developed systems that deliver spare parts within a day of a breakdown, often within hours. Farmers use mobile telephones or C.B. radios in their cabs to relay parts requests to a dealer. The dealer searches his inventory and delivers the partsimmediately if they are in stock. If not, the dealer dials the manufacturer's computer system, which uses satellite communications to comb the world for the part. The computer searches from one parts depot to the next, starting with the closest. Deere and Case both have nearly a dozen parts depots scattered throughout North America.
The computer generates a written order for the depot to remove the part from stock, pack it and ship it to the farmer. In many cases, the picking and packing is done by robots, so once the dealer keys the parts request into his computer terminal, machines do the rest.
Parts are delivered by overnight services like Federal Express or United Parcel Service. Because competition has forced these couriers to serve increasingly remote spots, tractor makers can offer next-day service to farmers in Saskatchewan and Montana. Even at $20 or $30 for shipping, the practice has become commonplace. As Ms. Rickey of Case said, "When you consider the cost of the down time associated with a $100,000 machine, it becomes pretty cost effective to deliver that part."
 
 
PLOWING BY COMPUTER
 IT is a problem farmers have suffered since the era of the ox and cart: getting stuck in the mud, with wheels gaining no ground. Most tractors gave farmers few choices besides revving their engines. Now, electronic sensors and on-board computers are giving tractors a push.
Deere, Case and Ford are all coming out with tractors that electronically sense the difficulty of the terrain and the task, and transmit this information to a computer that makes the necessary adjustments. If the computer learns that a plow pulled by a tractor is encountering a rocky stretch, it signals the hitch to raise the plow height to make the going easier. On steep slopes, the computer directs the tractor's transmission to downshift -- much like a car's automatic transmission downshifts when climbing a hill -- or engages the tractor's front-wheel drive. The same computer disengages the front-wheel drive when it senses the beginning of a sharp turn.
"Based on the operator's chosen strategy -- conserving fuel, keeping a constant implement depth or maintaining a certain speed -- today's tractors are close to being able to manage themselves," said Gary Ball, Ford New Holland's chief tractor engineer.
Extricating tractors from the mud is not the only mission where electronics are handy. Electronic sensors to monitor levels of crucial fluids like coolant and oil are already common. Many tractor makers have added shut-off systems that bring a tractor to a halt if it overheats or if the oil level is dangerously low. The shut-offs are particularly popular where farm operators hire migrant workers, many of whom cannot speak English or read dashboard monitors.
Next, perhaps: satellite-to-tractor links. Already, larger farmers sometimes use satellite photographs to determine which of their tracts, once planted, will generate the highest yields. Tractor makers hope to install computers that can digest this information, then automatically concentrate the application of costly fertilizer and chemicals on the most productive land. "Within the next 15 years, that capability will be commonplace," predicted Mr. Ball.

Philanthropy as a Business Tactic . . .

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
For more than a decade, companies have been asked to take on more responsibility for the nation's social programs. But how? According to Craig Smith, editor and publisher of the Corporate Philanthropy Report, a Seattle-based newsletter, they should make philanthropy part of their business plans. Mr. Smith spoke with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times. 
 Question: What will be the impact of the recession on corporate philanthropy?
Answer: The impact will be mixed. For 1991, not much impact. Corporate contributions will keep pace with inflation. They will stay at about the $2 billion-a-year level. Usually there is a two-year lag before changes in profits are felt in corporate contributions.
Q. You have talked about making philanthropy part of a company's business strategy. What do you mean by that?
A. It means that a company puts in place a management system that allows the person in charge of contributions or corporate social policy, a term I like better, to be in close consultation with the heads of the company's other operating units and divisions. It means the social-policy person talks with the heads of human resources, marketing, research and development, new product development and so on. It means the social-policy person sits with the human resources director and asks what he or she is trying to achieve for the company. Out of this comes a dynamic, and ideas emerge about how the company's social policy can assist the company's business strategy.
Q. In practice, how would that work?
A. Well, the human resources person, for example, might say the company needs to attract higher quality recruits from the nation's top business or engineering schools. The social-policy person may then strengthen the company's contributions to the schools that the human resources people want to recruit from. At some schools, becoming a major donor means that a company can get the first crack at seeing students' resumes. At the same time, if a company makes product donations to the school -- computers, for instance -- then the image of the company goes up as the graduate students use the company's products.
Q. Does this mean that companies should be more self-serving in their giving?
A. Not really. I don't think it should be a one-way street, with philanthropy just there to support the company's recruitment efforts. That is why there must be a dynamic so that when the social-policy person and the head of another division sit down, they will create some synergy.
For example, if a company's social agenda is to advance public-school reform, the social-policy person will look for ways that the different units of the company can be orchestrated to pursue that end. The social-policy person will coordinate the resources of the company -- by getting volunteers to work for K-12 education, by using the company's research and products and so on.
Q. What about companies that are generous with their money but don't make philanthropy part of their business strategy?
A. I don't think you can achieve much just by giving money. It doesn't affect the factors that created the problem.
For example, pharmaceutical companies can just give money to combat AIDS. Or, they can pursue solutions to the crisis in ways that go beyond just the typical calculations of short-term returns. They can take on initiatives that would tap their scientific capacity. They have a lot to contribute -- products, cutting-edge knowlege, laboratories, product development.
They can contribute by fostering relationships between workers in the medical world and by helping build networks. They can go to their industry associations and become levers for bringing about industry-wide relationships. They can bring their distributors, stakeholders into the fight and mobilize their employees as volunteers. The social-policy person could orchestrate all this.
Q. Have pharmaceutical companies done this?
A. No. The pharmaceutical industry hasn't done any of this. It's an industry that hasn't gathered around a cause.
The insurance industry is different. Insurance companies set up a think tank on social issues and they have an industry forum on social policy. In the mid-1980's, the insurance industry emphasized AIDS education and put major dollars into programs that they thought would help prevent the epidemic from spreading. They responded before the Federal Government and United Way responded. They recognized immediately that it was in their interest to work strategically on AIDS education as a social-policy issue.
Q. Have other industries mobilized around causes they are familiar with?
A. Yes. As hunger was becoming a huge problem in the mid-1980's, and people were lining up at soup kitchens, the Government did nothing but give out food stamps. The food industry, on the other hand, got together and found ways to get donated food into food banks and soup kitchens. They put into place an emergency food-distribution system, and it didn't cost them much because of the tax benefits. General Mills, Pillsbury and Sara Lee worked on this. These groups of companies were the natural experts. They allowed their philanthropic strategies to work with their business strategies. A lot of companies haven't figured this out.
Q. Are there other ways companies benefit from philanthropic activity?
A. Yes. Philanthropy is also a marketing issue. In most mature industries, there are a number of products of the same quality and price. When you have that circumstance, corporate citizenship makes the critical difference between whether a company's product can be trusted or not. A recent Roper poll showed that 52 percent of consumers said they will pay more for a socially responsible product. Companies viewed as socially responsible have a marketing edge.
Socially conscious companies also have better morale. A recent study by David Lewin at the Columbia Business School looked at 188 companies. Mr Lewin found that employee morale was three times higher in companies with a strong degree of community involvement than in companies that were not involved.
Q. Which companies are the best philanthropists?
A. The most generous company, in terms of overall giving is I.B.M. It gave $135 million in 1989. It will give $150 million this year.
As far as contributions as percentage of net earnings before taxes, Cummins Engine Company at 16.5 percent was the best.
And as far as who are the best philanthropists, Levi Strauss & Company has linked all of its programs to fighting AIDS throughout every aspect of the company. The Baby Bell companies have been the leading-edge forces behind public-school reform and the Dayton Hudson Corporation and the Weyerhaeuser Company have been very good strategic givers.

HEADLINE: For Toe-Wigglers to Wear to the Office

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
Men dressing for success these days are likely to also be slipping into comfort -- on their feet.
Makers of men's dress shoes say the trend is fed by a generation used to the relaxed roominess of athletic shoes, as well as by the changing workplace of the 1990's, with its less rigid ideas about what is acceptable in business footwear. Toss in high technology and orthopedic improvements, and " 'the comfort factor' is the news in men's shoes," said Tom Julian, a spokesman for the Men's Fashion Association, a trade group. 
 To compete, the 140-year-old shoe company Johnston & Murphy, whose headquarters are in Nashville, introduced business shoes with what it calls a "trampoline" cushion system in wing tips, kilties, slip-ons and cap toes that can go toe to toe with any other dress shoe in the haughtiest board room on Wall Street. No rubber soles: the company still uses leather, as well as welt construction. The shoes are sold in its specialty shops and at Macy's and Nordstrom stores for about $215.
Allen-Edmonds makes dress shoes that are known for their cork cushioning. Virginia Riddle, a spokeswoman, said the technology hasn't changed since 1922. The shoe is welted -- stitched all the way around -- and there are no nails, metal shanks or plastic parts. It is flexible, and there is little if any breaking-in period.
"Due to the recession, a huge part of our business growth in our executive shoes has been tied to our policy of recrafting old shoes," Ms. Riddle said. It is not uncommon, she said, for customers to send back 40-year-old shoes for repair. More than 500 pairs with an average age of 10 years arrive at the factory in Port Washington, Wis., every week. The company ships about 6,000 new pairs a week.
The cost for recrafting a pair of shoes is $79. They get new soles, heels, cork cushioning and welting, and the calfskin uppers are completely stripped and refinished. This all takes three to four weeks.
Allen-Edmonds's wing tips, cap toes, loafers, oxfords and Fred Astaire-style spectators are $205 at Saks, F. R. Tripler, Macy's and Nordstrom. "Men who wear ours also use Rockport, frankly," Ms. Riddle said. She was referring to a competitor that many men say eased them into comfort shoes.
Next fall the Hush Puppies division of Wolverine World Wide will enter the dress-comfort race with five styles, at $80 to $95. "We did it as a reaction to the athletic shoe phenomenon," said Dick Simpson, a spokesman for the company, which is in Rockford, Mich. "The extreme lightweight constuction and support inherent in athletic footwear has developed a new awareness among a lot of men who have till now been channeled into stiff dress shoes."
 
Sneakers Are Stealing In, Too
 Naturalizer is also planning a men's collection that it hopes will make compromise a thing of the past. And sport brands like L.A. Gear, Reebok, Cole-Haan and Nike are tailoring their casual styles more for the business setting, using things like sueded canvas, beefier treads and soft interior construction.
The trim heels and soles of Rockport's dress shoes, introduced in October, look normal. But the leather wraps around polyurethane cushions. They are $210 at Tip Top Shoes, Moe Ginsburg, Fellman Limited, Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
"There's been this whole comfort myth that men's shoes were flat, therefore comfortable," said Reina O'Connor, Rockport's director of corporate marketing. "Men are now getting what women got in high heels last fall."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
A Decade Under the Spell of Technology

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
I see it coming. Some time in the next couple of years, not to mention late in the decade, you will need a glossary to read this column.
Right now, we have ABS (antilock braking system) and AWD (all-wheel drive) and CVT (for constantly variable transmission), among others.
But more alphabetized technology is on the way. And, surprisingly, that means that high petroleum prices and automobile sales have not stalled automotive progress. In fact, cars just keep getting better and better.
There is, for instance, active suspension, available now on Nissan's Infiniti Q45. Like so much of what is going on everywhere, active suspension is a new use for the computer, and it will be the widely accepted major technology of the middle future.
In Infiniti's case, the suspension uses two computers, a pump and hydraulic actuators to smooth the road by moving the wheels into the road's depressions. More than that, active suspension works against the laws of physics and can make a car lean into a turn like a motorcycle instead of heeling to the outside.
The flat cornering allows a behemoth to behave like a sports car, controlling roll, brake-dive, acceleration-squat and load-leveling. And, believe me, you will hear more about all of this.
Another technology for the 90's is traction control, with names ranging from the clever "Traction Control" (Cadillac Allante) to ASD and ASR. The latter two come from Mercedes-Benz and stand for the German words for automatic locking differential and automatic slip control.
Infiniti and other cars also offer the feature, and it is sort of the reverse of antilock brakes. Using the computer and wheel sensors, the system recognizes imminent wheel spin and throttles down the engine. That prevents tires from slipping, and it gets you out of the rut or up the hill.
Honda's version is called TCS (traction control system), and it is designed for front-drive cars. According to the company, it provides "ultimate cornering and acceleration on various road surfaces, including gravel." It also sends the same amount of power to driven and steered wheels, and the computer makes everything all better, even if the driver puts a heavy foot into the gas.
Computers also are keeping an eye on engine mounts. The idea here (it's experimental and doesn't yet have an alphabet-soup name) is much the same as active suspension. But the purpose is to make shaky four- and six-cylinder engines as smooth and vibration-free as V8's.
According to developers in Europe and America, the systems can breathe new life into the small-engine concept, which means saving weight, increasing economy and eliminating billions of dollars in engine-development costs. Accelerometers and actuators are used to shorten and lengthen hydraulic engine mounts so that the powerplant's throb is not sent to the car's body.
Less dramatic, but interesting in its own way is another electronic breakthrough, this one by General Electric's lighting division. According to Motor Magazine, the system uses only one bulb, which feeds a network of fiber optics to light everything from the road ahead to the ashtray in the back seat.
"A star-shaped gas-discharge bulb, called a Light Engine, would be mounted somewhere out of the way and light any time the ignition was on," the magazine says. "Light would be piped through a fiber-optic network to wherever it was needed."
The advantages would be a minimum of power to generate light and easier packaging that could cut automobile assembly costs. There is, however, one disadvantage: You're in big trouble when that light bulb blows.
Further dabbling with the magic of electronics has generated some hot ideas about cleaning up tailpipe emissions, and most of the manufacturers are working on "preheated catalysts."
Almost all of the pollution produced on short trips comes out of the exhaust in the first several minutes, when an engine is cold and not operating efficiently. And the notion here is that a catalytic converter, heated electrically before the engine is started, could eliminate the problem.
Such a system might double the cost of the converter, and it would mean a driver would have to wait 10 to 20 seconds before starting the car, but tests by the Environmental Protection Agency show that an electrically heated catalyst can reduce hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide by more than half, compared with current systems.
And then there is Volkswagen's experimentation with a sort of Thermos-bottle way of saving engine heat. Again, the purpose is to eliminate cold starts, but VW has developed a way to store warmth from the cooling system and release it when needed. It's all very complicated, and we'll talk more of it later. For the moment, just remember that it is called a "heat battery."
In fact, why don't you just clip this column? Then I won't have to write all those glossaries.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
War And Malaise

BYLINE: BY Tom Wicker

DATELINE: ROCHESTER , Vt.

 BODY:
Despite a flood of Christmas sentimentality about "the kids over there" -- this time including women -- little appetite for war in the Middle East can be found among the American people; quite the opposite.
As the announced deadline of Jan. 15 approaches, the problem seems more than the natural reluctance of any nation to send its youth into war. It's more, I believe, than the obvious truth expressed by Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont to President Bush: 
 "Americans support defensive measures to contain the Iraqi Army, but there is no consensus for . . . an offensive war that would cost the lives of thousands of Americans."
The unease is palpable -- to some extent because memories of Vietnam remain so corrosive, and because Mr. Bush has not provided convincing reasons for another distant war in which, again, "allies" are likely to become fair-weather friends. No doubt, too, many Americans have heard with anxiety their military leaders' protests that U.S. forces, which will do most of the fighting and dying, are not yet ready for combat.
The end of the cold war, being celebrated only last Christmas, now seems far away and forgotten. The so-called peace dividend is fast disappearing into a military operation costing at least $2.5 billion a month even before the shooting starts.
Still, even more than all that is at the root of American malaise during a holiday season overshadowed by threats abroad and at home. Americans, it seems to me, are deeply troubled by the sheer incongruity of mounting a huge military operation abroad, the necessary purpose of which remains unclear, while the economy deteriorates at home, our children go begging and shooting, crime spirals upward, the schools educate poorly if at all, millions neither have nor can afford medical care and bridges fall down on the homeless sleeping beneath them.
A sampling of holiday domestic news makes the point:
Dec. 20 -- The Commerce Department revised its estimate of third-quarter growth in gross national product, from 1.7 percent to an anemic 1.4 percent. The fourth quarter will be worse.
Dec. 21 -- In 1990, the New York metropolitan area lost about 100,000 private industry jobs, according to a Federal survey. Three more of the nation's largest banks reported millions in bad-loan write-offs or dividend reductions. For 1991, U.S. businesses plan to expand spending by only 0.4 percent, the least in five years.
Dec. 22 -- The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's senior economist said it would take three to five years for growth to resume in New York City. U.S. health care spending was announced to have reached $804 billion last year; but though the law requires lead-poisoning tests for all the nation's 12 million poor children, only a third actually are being tested.
Dec. 23 -- In Washington, five children, one only 6 years old, were shot by other youngsters from a passing car; there have been 471 homicides in the city this year. The Federal budget office sought about $1 billion in reductions in aid to mass transit, despite a recent increase in the gasoline tax.
Dec. 24 -- Experts said the health of Americans in the inner cities had deteriorated to "critical condition," while the rest of us are healthier and living longer. Even the television networks suffered one of their worst years; all lost market share and CBS announced a fourth-quarter loss.
Dec. 25 -- Retailers reported "the poorest Christmas season in years" as shoppers didn't show up. Signs of the first U.S. price deflation since the 1940's also were reported -- bad signs for a government, businesses and people burdened with debt.
Dec. 26 -- Further signaling recession, a wide spectrum of American manufacturers, caught in a price squeeze, are deferring plans to modernize and expand. Some are laying off employees.
And on and on. It's true that spending for another war might provide stimulus to a sick economy. But that's not only a distasteful way to prime the pump; it's inefficient, in lives and money. Already the Pentagon is having to pay premium prices -- sometimes twice standard rates -- for shipping space to the gulf.
Anyway, it's not just economic problems but values that trouble the nation, as Jan. 15 nears. In Britain in 1939, leaders sought "peace in our time" and shrank from a war to defend a people "of whom we know little." Now, in ironic reversal, many Americans sense that their most pressing problems are here at home, largely unattended by leaders in the fatal grip of superpower illusions, who hasten them into ill-considered war.

HEADLINE: Sverdlovsk Shows the Way the Soviet Economy Is Retooling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Urals City, the Communist Apparatus Ends but Not the Communist Power," your Dec. 13 report on my home city, Sverdlovsk, was not only provocative and stimulating, but also itself a sign of real and deep changes in the Soviet Union and in Sverdlovsk in particular. However, readers need to know the framework in which these changes are taking place to understand the positive nature of the fast-moving developments.
Sverdlovsk was a closed city until early this year. Today it is opening rapidly, with visas widely granted to businessmen and scientists (and even reporters) from the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea. Free elections were held for the first time last March, bringing inexperienced newcomers in to replace previously unopposed party candidates.
Your reporter ran into the contradictions of a political and economic system in transition. Sverdlovsk's economy, and that of the whole Ural region, was heavily dependent on military production; today, there is a rush to convert even some of the military plants to a market-style economy with civilian goods.
As with political power, the size of the plant (or enterprise) determines how it is managed or controlled. Some enterprises are so large that they can only be directed at the Russian Republic or All Union central government level -- two or three levels of authority above the City Council.
The City Council has responsibility only for its small shops and enterprises. Some of the city's problems are not solvable at the local level. The large enterprises have the hard currency that is the engine that drives a free market economy. These enterprises pay taxes to the city government, but refuse to pay hard currency because they can use 30 percent of those funds to purchase (usually through the central government) supplies and consumer goods from abroad for their employees as fringe benefits and incentives.
Major changes are under way in the Urals. The regional government was granted by the Soviet Council of Ministers last August the rights to carry out direct trade in the products of the region, amounting to $1.3 billion in the next two years. This and other orders are designed to make the Sverdlovsk region a model for trade and development.
It clearly constitutes a major step in economic decentralization -- a process that was not emphasized to your reporter on his first (but, let us certainly hope, not his last) visit to Sverdlovsk.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Kuwaitis in Washington Plan Rebuilding of Nation

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Behind an unmarked door in an office building five blocks from the White House, more than 100 Kuwaiti bureaucrats are devising a master plan to rebuild their war-ravaged nation.
Working at computer terminals in two dozen glass-paneled offices, they are planning the reconstruction of everything from sewers to hospitals to airport communications systems. They are hoping for an opportunity to make some changes in the cultural structure as well. 
 "It's not going to be the same old Kuwait," said Kareem al-Saeed, a spokesman for Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group of Kuwaitis and Americans who proposed the project and obtained sponsorship from the Kuwaiti Government in exile in Taif, Saudi Arabia. "We're going to build a very modern, very progressive, high-tech nation."
The cost of reconstructing Kuwait, which has been plundered by the Iraqi forces that invaded on Aug. 2, is estimated by Fawzi al-Sultan, the project's director, at $20 billion. He says the sum is based on the worst case scenario: the total devastation of his nation.
 
$2.8 Trillion in Foreign Banks
 The estimate may be low, but the country's vast overseas property holdings and $2.8 trillion deposited in foreign bank accounts mean that the Government in exile is unlikely to have any problem paying for the rebuilding, whatever the cost.
The planners, described by Mr. Saeed as "the cream of Kuwait's bureaucrats," were sent here about two months ago after the reconstruction proposal was accepted by the Government in exile. They are working closely with American officials and businessmen, under the supervision of Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, the exile Government's Finance Minister.
The planners are organized into 10 teams, each devoted to a segment of Kuwaiti society: communications, transportation, education, health and food, airports and ports, electricity and water, oil, public works, information and the legal and judicial system.
Their work is both broad and specific. Because the Iraqis have destroyed many Kuwaiti public records, they seek to recreate a national data base beyond the census data and property records smuggled out of Kuwait City on computer tapes.
 
'Institutional Memory' Gone
 "Saddam Hussein destroyed Kuwait's institutional memory," Mr. Saeed said. "If you want to rebuild a refinery, all the blueprints are gone. You have to go back to the builder of the refinery."
Mr. Sultan, a Yale-educated World Bank official, said: "We need detailed implementation plans -- which man takes which container of drugs to which medical facility. We need to provide refrigerators before we can provide meat. We need to know who can deliver what, and when."
The planners also hope to eliminate what they consider the built-in inefficiencies of the Kuwaiti way of life.
"We'd like to reconstruct our attitude toward life," said Saif Abdullah, a professor of public administration at Kuwait University, who is working with Hassan al-Ibrahim, a former Education Minister, on plans to re-create the education system. "We try to create a consensus in our society, which requires one to accept inefficiencies, and give automatic promotions. This is an opportunity to take a new direction toward competition and merit."
For instance, he said, the officials hope to demolish the national concept of higher education as an entitlement.
 
Competition Is Promoted
 "In the past, education was considered a social right," Mr. Abdullah said. "In the future we have to talk more about responsibility, competition and merit."
Mr. Sultan said: "We're reorganizing the bureaucracy and redefining the roles of the government and private sector. We had a welfare system -- anybody who came in was given a job." Such a system will not survive, he added.
A critical question is the size of the population, he said, adding, "We had a population of 2.2 million, and now we're down to half a million." He said the size of the population would determine the character of his nation, and the roles of government and the private sector.
The State Department is coordinating the Kuwaitis' dealings with other United States agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers and Civil Affairs Corps, the Department of Commerce and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 
Making 'the Right Contacts'
 "They're getting in touch with contractors who will be able to go back in very quickly after the place is liberated and begin reconstruction activities," a State Department official said. "We're helping them make the right contacts."
The planners are also working closely with Pentagon civil affairs specialists, who do everything from helping restore civil order to providing public services.

States In Distress: The Seeds of Fiscal Calamity/A special report National Desk

LENGTH: 3264 words

HEADLINE: 80's Legacy: States and Cities in Need

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS with ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
All across America, state and city governments have been stricken by financial crises that were not even imagined a year ago.
More than half are facing serious financial shortfalls, and many are considering Draconian measures, including huge layoffs of public employees and major cutbacks in social services and public works. Some states, like Connecticut and Rhode Island, must find a way to cut their budgets by 20 percent in the next few months. 
 Making up for the cash shortage with tax increases may be political suicide for the public official who suggests it. Memories are all too fresh of the beating incumbent governors and legislators suffered in the November elections as voters registered their anger over rising taxes and reduced services.
 
'Unprecedented Cutback'
 "The fiscal plight seems to be worse than at any time during my memory," said Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a research organization based in Washington. "I think you would have to go back to the Great Depression to find similar anguish, in terms of the number of states that are facing an unprecedented cutback in service or significant increases in taxes."
The immediate cause of the crisis is the nation's economic downturn, which has drastically cut into tax revenues. But the seeds were sown over the last decade or so, and what public officials are now facing is the collision of several long-term trends, including these:
*Starting in Jimmy Carter's Administration and accelerating under President Ronald Reagan's "New Federalism," the Federal Government has shifted a heavy financial burden to the states and cities, cutting and eliminating Federal grants for housing, education, mass transportation and public works projects. In the late 1970's, Washington provided 25 percent of state and local budgets. It now provides 17 percent.
*The public is increasingly resistant to new or higher taxes, partly because they believe government is not wisely spending the money. In the November elections, voters in two states, Nevada and Oregon, approved initiatives to limit tax increases or roll back taxes. In other states voters showed their displeasure by ousting officials who raised taxes. Altogether 14 governors' offices changed political parties in the upheaval against the old order.
*The pressures to spend are enormous. They range from the public's demand for better schools and harsher punishment of criminals to an increased number of elderly people who need help with nursing home costs. For instance, Medicaid, the health program primarily for the poor and disabled, now accounts for 12 percent of state spending; 20 years ago it was 3 percent.
 
 Growing Responsibilities
 In many cases the pressure to spend comes from the Federal Government itself. The growing body of Federal rules and regulations often place new responsibilities on states and cities without providing sufficient money to carry them out. And the situation is unlikely to improve soon because the budget compromise worked out this fall by Congress and President Bush provides some added money for domestic programs this year but freezes domestic spending for the next two years and restricts its growth for two years after that.
Sometimes the pressure comes from the courts, which have forced states to build new prisons to ease overcrowding or to make costly changes in education programs.
Unlike the Federal Government, which can and does operate at a deficit, all states but one -- Vermont -- are legally bound to have balanced budgets. So, their options are limited to raising taxes or reducing spending.
Experts say many states will be forced to raise taxes in the next year or two. And some predict that the electoral drubbing many governors suffered in November will turn out to have been but a preview of 1992.
 
 'End of Their Political Careers'
 "Our Federal politics are gridlocked, and governors have become the ones who have to have the courage to put their necks out," said Daniel M. Sprague, executive director of the Council of State Governments, an organization of state officials that is based in Lexington, Ky.
"Unfortunately, for a number of governors who raised taxes, that has been the end of their political careers," he added, referring in particular to William A. O'Neill of Connecticut and Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who both decided not to run for re-election this year.
Although the converging trends have produced a crisis atmosphere in governors' offices and state legislatures, they spell special disaster for poverty-stricken inner cities, said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany. Worsening economic prospects, especially in the Northeast, a tapering off of state aid coming after a sharp drop in Federal aid and a "hardening and concentration" of social problems like drugs, crime, poverty, homelessness and AIDS mean "a new crunch time for cities," he said.
 
 The States
Most Ambitious Fall the Hardest

Twenty-seven states are being forced to reduce spending below what they had planned this fiscal year to head off a deficit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They are eliminating programs, freezing hiring, laying off employees, raising college tuitions, increasing fees and fines, using up savings and doing almost anything to avoid raising taxes. The Northeast is hurting most: New York State is laying off 10,000 employees, Massachusetts has already laid off 1,700 and Connecticut, one of the handful of states that do not have an income tax, may impose one, something once considered unthinkable there.
In Rhode Island, Governor-elect Bruce G. Sundlun, a Democrat, predicted "a major downsizing in government." After he takes office in January, he said, he will have to make spending cuts of about 20 percent of the state budget to balance the books by June 30, the end of the fiscal year. New taxes are not an option, he said. Last year, Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, a Republican, added $200 million in taxes, and political analysts say that was a major reason he lost his bid for re-election by a resounding 3-to-1 ratio.
Rhode Island's financial experience is fairly typical of about one-third of the states, many of them in the Northeast, a region that had rapid growth in the 1980's, said Marcia A. Howard, research director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, which is based in Washington. These states were able to cut taxes, start new programs and put aside some money in the decade's strongest economic years, 1984 through 1988. The other two-thirds of the states, Ms. Howard said, saw relatively little or slow growth during the 1980's. Now the economy has pulled the rug out from under both groups of states, and the ones that started the most ambitious social programs are now falling the hardest.
Massachusetts, for instance, set up its own universal health care program two years ago, but now that the financial crisis has hit, Governor-elect William F. Weld, a Republican, has vowed to repeal parts of the program.
Some of today's problems have shallow roots. Uncertainties about how people and companies would react to the Federal Tax Reform of 1986, which eliminated many tax deductions, made it difficult for states to forecast revenue. Several, including New York, California and Massachusetts, were overly optimistic. In addition, economic forecasters did not predict that the Northeast would be on the leading edge of the recession, causing serious budget miscalculations in the region.
The states having the least trouble balancing their budgets this year are primarily those in the West with growing populations and energy-rich states that are benefiting from the rise in oil prices since the Persian Gulf crisis began, as well as slow-growth states like Arkansas and West Virginia that for years have tried to keep a tight rein on expenditures.
Ms. Howard of the National Association of State Budget Officers said that even without a recession, widespread fiscal problems were inevitable, paricularly because of spending on health care and prisons. "These problems are cascading on the states," she said.
Medicaid, the shared Federal-state program covering medical costs of the poor, and, increasingly, nursing home costs of the middle class, has become one of the states' biggest budget headaches. That is because of the aging of the population and the increasing number of middle-class elderly people who have exhausted their savings or transferred their assets to their children and are now dependent on Medicaid for nursing home care.
"Medicaid is becoming the Pac-Man of state government, eating up every dollar," said Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governor's Association.
Some experts argue that when the current economic downturn is over, state and local revenue is likely to pick up briskly enough to relieve the pressure. Others doubt it.
"The tax bases are going to grow more slowly in the 1990's than they did in the 1980's," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York at Albany, citing projections of slower economic growth in the years ahead in many regions.
 
 The Cities
Major Burdens, Limited Options

In more than half the nation's cities, spending is outpacing revenue this year, largely because of declining economic conditions, loss of Federal and state aid and state prohibitions on increasing local taxes, the National League of Cities said.
Philadelphia, which has already cut $65 million from social service programs this year, may not be able to pay its 25,000 workers their full pay after Jan. 4 and may soon be insolvent. New York and Washington each plan to lay off thousands of city workers and teachers. Los Angeles and Louisville, Ky., have already closed neighborhood health centers.
And New Orleans dealt with an expected $42 million deficit in 1991, in part by budgeting only enough money to run its criminal justice system and neighborhood health clinics for just six months in the hope that the state will make up the difference. But Louisiana's Governor, Buddy Roemer, said, "We can't spend the money we don't have."
The plight of cities is raising old questions about shared responsibility. "The cities have a disproportionate burden to carry, and nobody wants to talk about it," said Alair A. Townsend, who directed New York City's budget office under former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "New York or Chicago or Philadelphia cannot solve these problems on their own."
One problem for New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and many other financially troubled cities is a limited taxing authority. New Orleans, for example, collected enough money through its sales and property taxes to deal with social problems when Federal and state governments shouldered 50 percent of the city's budget two decades ago. But now that Federal and state aid has fallen to 15 percent of its budget, the city's taxes do not bring in enough money to cope.
"Pressure from suburbanites is part of the reason we can't have a wage tax or a gas tax, and the legislature just prohibited us from having an inheritance tax," said Mayor Sidney J. Barthelemy of New Orleans.
He went on, "People can't constantly tell us to stand on our own two feet if they keep cutting our legs off."
 
 The U.S. Government
The Shift In Responsibilities

Financial distress is focusing attention on a historic shift over the last decade in Federal relations with the states and cities. Federal grants, which blossomed during the Depression and President Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society," peaked in the late 1970's as the Federal deficit began to mount. Under President Reagan, Federal aid declined and more responsibility was transferred to the states.
As Federal grants waned, the share of total state and local spending paid for by Washingon declined from a peak of 25 percent in the late 1970's to 17 percent now. Cities lost much more than the states as programs like revenue sharing and aid for low-income housing were cut. Nor was there as much assistance as the cities and states needed to attack new problems like homelessness and AIDS.
While Federal aid to state and local governments has declined, Federal assistance to individuals has steadily climbed. The individual payments that pass through state budgets are mostly poverty-related money like Medicaid and welfare. The Federal Government pays more than half the cost of Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and the entire cost of food stamps. In addition, the Federal Government directly pays the elderly and others through Social Security and Medicare.
From 1984 to 1988, the strong economy helped state and local governments raise the money to continue programs that had lost Federal support. But now as the economy sours, states are saddled with heavier social responsibilities and few options to pay for them.
"We don't have New Federalism, we have New Feudalism, where every community fends for itself with a hodgepodge of responsibilities and taxing powers," said George Sternlieb, an urban specialist and professor emeritus of public policy at Rutgers University.
Optimists view the financial distress as a chance to cut the fat from government.
"There's no question that the Federal cutbacks are part of the problem. or the opportunity, depending on your perspective," said Richard S. Williamson, who was a special assistant to President Reagan for intergovernmental relations and promoted the idea of transferring more reponsibility to the states.
"There are those of us who feel you get better decision making when both funding and execution are closer to local levels," he said. "If my name were Florio, and I had to increase taxes, I'd probably disagree with that."
He was referring to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey. Although Mr. Florio was not up for re-election last month, another New Jersey Democrat, Senator Bill Bradley, was. Mr. Bradley, who was expected to win re-election easily, barely squeaked into office as voters expressed their displeasure with tax increases pushed through the State Legislature by Mr. Florio earlier in the year.
Mr. Florio blames President Reagan for making it difficult for governors and mayors to govern. "Folks have become very skeptical, if not cynical, about government because President Reagan convinced people that you never need to make any tough decisions," he said.
Governor Roemer of Louisiana, also a Democrat, agreed. "I think the question of Federal responsibility needs to be discussed candidly with the American people," he said. "It might be that the government closest to the people works best, and federalism, in shifting to the states more responsibility is the best thing if done carefully. But the price tag, the purpose, the goals, the methodology, all need to be discussed."
Having less money to distribute has not stopped Congress from trying to set local priorities, often necessitating large expenditures. The states say they are being forced to take on responsibilities without the ability to pay for them.
"The Federal-state story is mandates," said Gerald H. Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. "The Federal Register averages 200 pages a day, and much of that is for new mandates and rules," he said. These range from rules on major national goals, like whether poor children should receive welfare, to less weighty matters. One proposed rule, fiercely opposed by governors as setting a new standard for Government meddling, tells states how they can spend interest income from fees they charge for fishing and hunting licenses.
Gov. John D. Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican who is the National Governor's Association's spokesman on Federal policy, said, "The most pernicious part about it is that when the Federal Government wants to expand a program, the Government funds its share of the program by borrowing and printing money, while the states have to come up with real money by forfeiting other things we'd much rather do."
The major destabilizing force in Missouri's budget, he said, was $143 million needed to finance additional Medicaid costs , which were mandated by Congress. The new rules extend care for more poor children, pregnant women and elderly people.
But as that example shows, Federal mandates can involve goals with which most would agree.
Defenders of the expanded Medicaid coverage like Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, an architect of the program, agree that Medicaid is becoming unwieldy and is overburdening the states. But he argues that without broader restructuring of the nation's health system, Medicaid is the only available vehicle to meet crucial goals. "I think the Federal Government has a responsibility to be sure we provide prenatal care for low-income women and to make sure poor children have health care available," he said.
Governors also contend that the Federal Government, while saying the states should take on more responsibility, is hampering their ability to raise revenue. The new Federal taxes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco are expected to decrease demand slightly for these products and thereby reduce state revenue from existing taxes on those products. In addition, the new Federal taxes make it harder politically for states to tax those items.
 
The Outlook
Who Should Take Which Roles?

More than just balanced budgets are at stake. Alice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution who formerly headed the Congressional Budget Office, argues that states must take the lead in some areas. "Infrastructure must be modernized," she said. "school systems dramatically improved and public services, from child development to adult retraining, made dramatically more effective."
She added, "These are the kinds of programs that work best when well adapted to local conditions and local people."
In turn, she said, the Federal Government should take more responsibility for programs like Medicaid and welfare, which can be fairly addressed only on a national scale.
There is surprising agreement among many liberals and conservatives that the Federal Government, with its unsurpassed ability to raise and redistribute money, should take special responsibility for welfare measures and leave service programs to the states. The main disagreement comes on the levels of services to be offered.
"Intellectually, I have no problem with federalizing programs like Medicaid," said Mr. Williamson, the former Reagan adviser. His fear is practical. "Politically, it's hard for me to see how in the process you won't end up ratcheting the coverage up in a fiscally irresponsible manner."
New roles for the states would mean more taxes. And Mr. Gold, the expert on state governments, is optimistic about the ability of the states to find the needed income, albeit at the cost of spilled political blood.
"If the governors are smart, they will present clearly the budgetary implications of not raising taxes," Mr. Gold said.
"They will be able to convince legislatures that there is no practical way to avoid raising taxes without spending cuts that are unthinkable."
"When the dust settles there will be many big tax increases in 1991," he predicted. "This will lead to a strong backlash in 1992."
"It's going to be real uncomfortable in state capitals," Mr. Gold said.

HEADLINE: Umpires Give an Early Call: It's Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Millions of Americans believe that the nation recently entered a recession, but like players in a baseball game, they must wait for the umpire, in this case a committee of prominent economists, to make the official call. Now the ruling has come, but weeks ahead of schedule.
Normally the committee, known as the Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, issues its ruling only after observing six or more months of hard times. Just as the umpire in a baseball game waits until a pitch has crossed the plate before he calls it a ball or a strike, the committee waits until enough data has accumulated before it declares that a slowdown qualifies as a recession.
 
Uneasy About Silence
But this recession has been so anticipated by the public and so chronicled in the news media that the committee members said they felt nervous and uneasy remaining silent in the midst of the public uproar over hard times. So in a rare, jump-the-gun ruling, the committee declared that a recession probably began in the summer, most likely in August. It was as if the umpire had called a strike before the pitch crossed the plate. 
 "We did not want to be viewed as laggards," said Victor Zarnowitz of the University of Chicago, one of the seven committee members. "If we had waited a few months to say something, when most people are convinced that we are in a recession now, then we might have been laughed at."
Never before has the Dating Committee declared a recession ahead of its normal schedule -- and mindful of tradition, the committee said a final ruling was not yet possible. The same seven committee members, for example, waited until Jan. 8, 1982, to announce that a recession, the worst since World War II, had begun the previous July. Similarly, they waited until July 8, 1983, to declare that the recession ended nearly eight months earlier. In the intervening periods, the Dating Committee said nothing.
In the present case, many other economists, of course, have speculated that a recession started during the summer. But the Dating Committee, and its parent organization, a prestigious private academic group in Cambridge, Mass., operate on another plane that carries far more weight. The committee's seven members, each an expert in a different aspect of economics, are considered by Government officials and fellow economists to be impartial and highly qualified to decide when recessions begin and end.
 
Silencing Optimism
 Even this early ruling makes the recession that everyone sensed was underway more or less official -- and in the process forces Government officials and others to deal differently with the economy. For one thing it is likely to silence the optimism still coming from a handful of economists and politicians who have maintained that the current economic downturn was not severe enough to qualify as a recession.
Until recently, Bush Administration officials had not used the word recession, and the Federal Reserve has not yet explicitly described what is happening today as a recession. Now the Fed might be under more pressure to explain why it did not recognize the onset of a recession last summer and take action then to reverse the decline.
Still, the committee members normally try to function as historians rather than as "chroniclers of real time action," as Robert M. Hall of Stanford University, the committee's chairman, put it. (The committee's final rulings go into the Federal Government's record books, affecting all sorts of future studies of economic activity.)
 
Likely Date of Recession
 The early announcement, made public in a news release distributed in the past week, suggested that the final determination will not be made until January or February at the earliest. "It appears likely that the committee will identify a month between June and September 1990 as the peak of activity in the economy and onset of a recession," the committee said.
Some economists, gathered here for the American Economic Association's annual conference questioned whether the Dating Committee should have issued so early a pronouncement. One concern was that the declaration, from so important a body, might help to discourage consumer spending, business investment or other behavior that gets a nation out of recession.
"These guys may have been thinking about the relation between what they say and what the world does, in which case, discreet silence would have been better," said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel Laureate in Economic Science.
 
All Indicators Sag
 During a conference call about a week ago, six of the committee members (the seventh, William Branson of Princeton, was in Bulgaria) agreed that key measures of economic performance all signaled recession, including the latest figures for industrial production, employment, retail and wholesale trade and personal income.
There was disagreement as to when the recession might have started. Geoffrey Moore, director of Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, favored June. Most others thought the recession probably started in August, when jobs were clearly disappearing.
The most popular definition of a recession is one in which the gross national product, measuring the dollar value of all the goods and service produced in a given period of time, declines for at least two consecutive quarters, or a total of six months. The Dating Committee also prefers that a downturn last at least six months to qualify as a recession, but it frequently dates recessions as starting in the midst of a quarter. And the committee does not consider the Commerce Department's G.N.P. data to be the ultimate criterion of a recession. It bases its judgment on its own analysis of the weekly and monthly statistics that measure economic performance.
 
3d-Quarter G.N.P. Debated
 For example, there was discussion of whether the G.N.P. really rose by 1.4 percent in the third quarter, as the Commerce Department reported this month. The G.N.P. would have risen by only five-tenths of 1 percent if a more accurate inflation adjustment had been used, Mr. Moore said.
The Dating Committee defines a recession as "a recurring period of decline in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year, and marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy."
But that definition means the Dating Committee could end up eating the words in its release. As the release itself suggested, the committee cannot know until late January or February whether the downturn had lasted long enough to qualify as a recession.
Robert J. Gordon, a committee member from Northwestern University, believes that the economy has gotten progressively worse in recent weeks. But he said he had opposed the release, in part because of the outside chance that the economy might turn around.
So why was the release issued? During the conference call, the committee, whose two other members are Benjamin Friedman of Harvard and Martin Feldstein, considered how the public might view the committee's silence and also how to handle frequent inquiries from journalists. "It is hard to control the evolution of a conference call," Mr. Gordon said.

HEADLINE: Homelessness in New York: Years of Plans, No Solution

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
A decade after vast numbers of homeless people began to be seen on New York City's streets, officials and advocates fear that homelessness has become embedded in the city's life for the foreseeable future.
Thousands of destitute single adults still roam the streets. Hundreds of families, primarily young single mothers and their children, still pass their days and nights in rundown welfare hotels. The city's huge makeshift system of overnight accommodations -- from large barracks-style shelters to small centers with private rooms -- is now anything but temporary.
 
Dinkins's Effort
 Advocates for the homeless had seen the election of Mayor David N. Dinkins as the last, best hope for transforming the machinery built to cope with homelessness into a mechanism for ending it. The Dinkins administration, which had promised a new level of innovation and commitment to New York's most vulnerable population, is in the midst of devising an ambitious five-year plan for the homeless. 
 But even before she is finished drafting the plan, the mayoral aide responsible for it acknowledges that the recession squeezing the region means that the effort inevitably will fall short.
"The flaw is that we probably won't have the money to do it all," said Nancy Wackstein, director of the Mayor's Office of Homelessness and Single-Room Occupancy Housing. "We know what the goal is. We can move closer, but we will not be able to house everybody."
At the end of his first year in office, Mr. Dinkins has been overtaken by the city's devastating financial troubles. Neither the Federal Government nor the state can be counted on for much help. Rather than expanding the city's array of homeless programs, the Dinkins administration thus far has struggled just to maintain the system it inherited from Mayor Edward I. Koch.
That has frustrated many advocates for the homeless and many ordinary citizens, who have begun to conclude that, without expensive new programs to provide alternatives to shelters, homelessness is likely to remain a part of the city's fabric.
"By and large, Dinkins says kinder things, but Dinkins, like Koch, is not moving toward any solution," said Robert M. Hayes, chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless.
"All the good-hearted people in the Dinkins administration wring their hands, rue the budget -- and aspire to do no less than Koch," said Mr. Hayes, who brought the landmark lawsuits in the early and mid-1980's that forced the city to shelter the homeless.
In 1989, the city spent more than $320 million to shelter a total of about 25,000 single homeless people and 11,000 homeless families.
In a report released last week, the Partnership for the Homeless, a coalition of churches and synagogues, applauded some mayoral initiatives, including a city-state agreement to provide 5,200 new beds for mentally ill people in group homes and single-room-occupancy apartment buildings.
But the Partnership lamented that the Dinkins administration had not come up with a plan to eliminate the use of huge shelters in armories and other cavernous public buildings. It criticized the city's continued reliance on welfare hotels, and it begged the administration not to allow the budget crisis to become an excuse for tolerating the status quo.
"Resolve to come up with some creative ways to do more with less," the report urged.
Ms. Wackstein said she, too, was frustrated that financial constraints made it impossible for the administration to do as much as it would like. But she also said she thought some of the criticism was premature.
 
A 'Catch-All Phrase'
 "That's what I think is so unfair, to think that within one year we were going to dismantle the shelter system," Ms. Wackstein said.
"Homelessness is really the end result of a whole lot of failed systems," she said. "When people talk about eradicating homelessness, we also have to talk about eradicating poverty, drug abuse, mental illness and family problems. Homelessness becomes this catch-all phrase, and behind it is the whole range of social problems, plus the housing shortage.
"I think we in this administration are beginning for the first time to deal with those complexities," she said. "The disappointing part is that I don't know where we will be able to find the money to do these wonderful things."
Ms. Wackstein said the administration had made several significant changes in recent months. It decided for the first time to give priority to the "hidden homeless" -- families living doubled up with family or friends -- for new apartments produced by the city. Only homeless families already in the city's shelter system had previously qualified.
 
Working on Prevention
 The city is also starting a new effort to prevent people from becoming homeless. It will provide lawyers to help those threatened with eviction and sometimes will give financial benefits beyond those in the basic welfare grant to enable poor families to pay their rent.
The most important initiative from the Dinkins administration, Ms. Wackstein said, is the five-year plan that will probably be completed by February.
Ms. Wackstein said she was hopeful that the city could eventually shut down the worst of the large shelters for homeless single adults, replacing them with smaller and better temporary housing centers. She also hopes to provide more social services like drug treatment and job counseling.
But with the city's fiscal woes and the shelter system "bursting at the seams," as Ms. Wackstein described it, the administration may find it difficult to make broad changes.
A tally taken on Thursday night, the night of the snowstorm, showed that 9,950 single men and women were staying in the 25 shelters operated by the city. At the annual peak, which comes in February or March, as many as 11,000 adults are usually in the shelters.
An additional 3,853 families, more than 12,000 people, were in the city's 13 family shelters and in hotels Thursday night.
 
Different Categories
 The two categories of homeless people -- single adults and families -- are strikingly different, as have been the city's efforts for each group.
While many of the single people are capable of working and living on their own, a sizable portion and perhaps a majority are afflicted with emotional or psychological problems, often complicated by drug or alcohol abuse.
Some of the young mothers who become homeless also have deep personal problems, but many others simply lack a place to live. Typically, they become homeless after being evicted from an apartment or after living doubled up with family or friends.
In recent years, new permanent housing and new apartment-style temporary shelters created by the city have provided significant relief for many homeless families. But there has been little new permanent housing produced for single adults.
The new housing for families made it possible for the city to reduce the number of families in welfare hotels from a peak of more than 3,600 three years ago to 147 last July.
But the city was ultimately unable to make good on a promise -- and a court agreement -- to keep families out of the hotels altogether. Last week, about 640 families were in hotels. City officials attribute that primarily to an increase in the number of families coming into the system. But some homeless advocates say the real problem lay in the failure of the Koch and Dinkins administrations to construct enough new apartment-style temporary shelters in time.
 
'Question of Planning'
 "The city tried to stop using the hotels without bringing the new temporary units on line," said Steven Banks, coordinating attorney for the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project. "It's clearly more a question of planning and management than anything else."
Mr. Banks's group is awaiting a decision on a lawsuit it filed that seeks to force the city to stop using the hotels.
The city in recent years has built much more temporary and permanent housing for homeless families than it has for single adults. Some single-room-occupancy hotels have been rebuilt, but most of the single homeless population continues to live on the streets or in large shelters. No one knows how many people are on the streets and in the subway; the advocates' estimates run in the tens of thousands.
Mr. Hayes and other representatives of the homeless acknowledge that the city's budget crisis is real. But they also said that the economic retrenchment makes it more incumbent on the city to find creative new ways to help the homeless.
Mr. Hayes suggested, for example, that the city take advantage of the weakened real-estate market by giving rent subsidies to homeless people and leasing apartments for them.
George McDonald, the president of the Doe Fund, another homeless advocacy group, has long championed the creation of small, new factory-built single-room occupancy hotels, known as S.R.O.'s, for homeless adults.
Last week, the city turned down Mr. McDonald's proposal to build such a center in Brooklyn. City housing officials said their policy was first to renovate existing S.R.O. hotels and then to create new ones from abandoned buildings. Only then, they said, would it make sense to authorize new construction.
"If for no other reason, they should allow this to be done to see if it works," Mr. McDonald said in an interview. "Where is the creativity?"

HEADLINE: Fairhope Journal;
From a Utopian Dream, A Single Tax Remains

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAIRHOPE, Ala., Dec. 28

 BODY:
The end of the year is tax time here and it is perhaps fitting that the busiest place in town is the office of the city's largest landowner and taxpayer, the Fairhope Single Tax Corporation.
The corporation is the successor to the 28 people who moved from Iowa in 1894 and established Fairhope as a utopian colony. The community was based largely on the ideas of Henry George, a 19th-century journalist and economist who excoriated land speculation as a great evil of the time and the cause of poverty and inequality in society. 
 George argued that land ought to be held as a public trust by the community rather than in private hands, and that it should be leased for homes, farms, factories and stores.
And that is what is done in Fairhope, with the corporation owning about 4,300 acres, about a third of all the land here. The corporation leases it to about 1,300 homeowners, business owners and farmers.
The tenants pay a single annual tax to cover the costs of public services like water, roads, electricity, schools and parks. The tax is based solely on the value of the land and not on the value of buildings, crops, or businesses.
Perched on a gully-riven bluff called the Ecor Rouge, or Red Cliffs, overlooking Mobile Bay, Fairhope stands as a tribute to George's ideas on urban planning and land use. Because of the corporation's control of the land, the town has open vistas, open beaches and abundant parkland.
In other interesting ways time, progress and prosperity have drowned out the envisioned utopia. Fairhope is clearly no longer the haven of radical political experimenters and artists that it once was. Recent lawsuits filed by residents have attacked the tax-setting practices of the corporation, or the "colony" as it is often called.
Some critics, pointing to steep tax increases on some farmland, suggest that even the corporation has become infected by the greed and land-lust that George despised. It is still a wonderful and beautiful place to live, they said, but Fairhope has lost its sense of mission.
"It was once a place of radical ideas that now votes Republican and gave Ronald Reagan huge margins some years ago," said Paul Gaston, a history professor at the University of Virginia whose grandfather, Ernest B. Gaston, was one of the town's founders. "It was once a place where people came to try to solve social problems. Now it is a place where people go to escape social problems."
The offices of the Single Tax Corporation were abuzz this week with activity as people trooped in and out, and the corporation's secretary, Gale W. Rowe, sortedthrough tax bills.
This time of year, when the corporation finishes collecting and begins to turn over about $470,000 to the various taxing authorities in the area, is the time when the George legacy is most obvious.
With the exception of their Federal income tax, all leaseholders truly pay a single tax, from $500 to $1,000, for a multitude of services.
And even though the corporation does not own all of the town, the single tax concept has influence other purely local tax decisions. "You know we don't have a sales tax in Fairhope partly because the corporation has worked to oppose one," Mr. Rowe said. He noted that the corporation still required those wanting to join to pay the same $100 fee that was required in 1894 and to take a short course instructing them in the principles of Henry George.
This feature along with the annual collection procedure makes Fairhope the "purest" of the Georgist communities around, said Pat Aller, assistant director of the Rober Schalkenbach Foundation, a New York City-based organization that promotes and publicizes George's views. There were never very many laboratories for George's view and today two others -- Arden, Del. and Free Acres, N.J. -- still exist.
"But Georgist practices and ideas are fading or have already faded in those communities," Ms. Aller said.
Founded at a time of unbridled individualism of robber barons and laissez-faire capitalism, Fairhope was one of a number of utopian experiments tried around the country. But its location in the South was unusual.
"There were not a lot of utopian communities in the South since most such communities had as a premise that they had to spring from free men and women," said Steven Suitts, head of the Southern Regional Council, a non-profit educational organization. "That was a very hard premise to find in the South with its agrarian and low-wage economy and its history of slavery."
Mr. Rowe said that from the beginning the colony made a lot of compromises and adaptations in order to survive and it is likely that those adaptations helped doom its success as a laboratory of the single tax idea.
For one thing, the founders decided that they would open up the colony's land so that it could be leased by people who were not members of the corporation. The idea, Mr. Rowe said, was that eventually these people would see the wisdom of George's approach and freely join. But that never happened and today, only 10 percent, or those on 1,360 leaseholds, are members of the corporation. At one time members were given the first opportunity to lease any new property, but today membership has no special privileges.
Mr. Gaston said another compromise was to incorporate the colony as the town of Fairhope in 1908, an attempt to blunt opposition that had grown over the fact that only corporation members and not nonmember leaseholders could vote on colony decisions. The community was being viewed warily by those in the state capital as some sort of "communist community." But in creating the town, the town mixed leased land with deeded property and the mixture of two kinds of land ownership proved a problem over the years.
"The colony and its association dominated things for a long time but eventually the larger community overtook the colony," said Mr. Gaston.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
AS JAN. 15 NEARS, SOME SEE A CHANCE FOR GULF SOLUTION

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 29

 BODY:
With 17 days before the United Nations deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis remains distinctly possible, Iraqi officials and European diplomats say.
These officials suggest that despite tougher public statements by President Bush and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in the last week, the deadlock over arranging a final set of high-level meetings in Washington and Baghdad can be broken by a European diplomatic initiative. "This is the only chance for a breakthrough," a longtime Eastern European envoy said. 
 [In an interview with Time magazine, Mr. Bush said his "gut" feeling was that Mr. Hussein would leave Kuwait without a war.]
 
European Dialogue Sought
 A Western European Ambassador here said today that he believed the 12-member European Community would review its decision against holding its own dialogue with Iraq if Mr. Bush and Mr. Hussein could not agree on an exchange of foreign ministers by the end of the year on Monday night.
Iraq asked 10 days ago for a separate dialogue between its Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, and European Community officials. Some European officials said they felt that the meeting would enable the community to mediate the dispute over the dates, but the community declined the offer and American officials expressed satisfaction with its decision.
In the disagreement over the timing of the American-Iraqi meetings, Washington has said it wants Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to see Mr. Hussein in Baghdad no later than Jan. 3. Baghdad has said Mr. Hussein is too busy to meet before Jan. 12, three days before the United Nations deadline.
 
Tug of War Over Meeting
 Washington says it feels that a meeting so close to the deadline would be used by Mr. Hussein to postpone a troop withdrawal beyond Jan. 15. The Baghdad talks were to be preceded by a visit to Washington by Mr. Aziz.
Earlier this week, Mr. Hussein recalled his ambassadors from Western and other capitals, presumably to brief them on gulf policy, and sent them back to their posts without public disclosing their instructions. On Wednesday, the American envoy in Baghdad, Joseph C. Wilson 4th, the deputy chief of mission, said, "I have not given up hope on the diplomatic process."
The United Nations resolution authorizes the use of force against the Iraqis if they remain in Kuwait past Jan. 15..
The Bush Administration has indicated that American forces leading the anti-Iraq military coalition in the gulf may attack at any time after the deadline expires. But the Administration has not definitively stated when, or even if, such an attack will come.
Iraq has insisted on linking withdrawal of its troops to a solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute and the problems of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. Washington rejects any linkage of the issues.
 
Popular Sentiment Against War
 Here in Baghdad, strong popular sentiment against a new war is adding a new element of pressure for a diplomatic settlement. Tonight, acknowledging public anxiety over war, the Government was denied persistent rumors that it was organizing mass demonstrations for Jan. 10 to plead with Mr. Hussein to pull out of Kuwait as a means to preserve his leadership.
A statement issued by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council said, "This sick thinking exists only in the minds of the planners of evil and their suspect circles."
Whatever optimism there is that the crisis will be resolved at the 11th hour, however, is tempered here by the realities of the enormous task ahead, and concern about misunderstanding or miscalculation by either side.
Japan's Ambassador to Baghdad, Kunio Katakura, said in an interview this week that he felt a growing pessimism about the chances for a diplomatic solution, because "the gap is so great" between the minimum requirements of both sides before they will pull back from their vows to go to war if necessary over Iraq's occupation of its smaller neighbor.
Mr. Katakura, the longest-serving Arabist in Japan's Foreign Ministry, said he was worried that the Iraqis "take very lightly" the Jan. 15 deadline and the prospect of imminent miltiary action afterward.
 
'Dangerous to Take It Lightly'
 After a long meeting this week with Iraq's First Deputy Prime Minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, the Japanese envoy said: "They are convinced that the Soviet Union and China will not allow the use of force automatically after the 15th. I think it is very dangerous to take it so lightly."
At the outset of the final two weeks of diplomacy, the minimum requirement of the Bush Administration is an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from all of Kuwait and a restoration of the ruling family of Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
Though he denied that he was offering an incentive to Mr. Hussein, Mr. Bush, in an address to the United Nations in September, expressed the hope that a successful resolution of the gulf crisis might create the momentum for new efforts to solve the overall Arab-Israeli dispute.
In what could be construed as a further incentive to Iraq on security arrangements after the crisis, Mr. Baker pledged in a television interview last month that if Iraq withdrew its armed forces from Kuwait, the United States would not attack Iraq.
Mr. Hussein's minimum requirements for withdrawing his forces from Kuwait are far more murky.
On Aug. 12, the Iraqi leader acknowledged for the first time that "arrangements for the case of Kuwait" could be made -- but only if "arrangements shall be made for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon; for the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon, and for the withdrawal between Iraq and Iran."
Shortly afterward, Mr. Hussein pulled his remaining forces out of Iran, but he has continued to insist that any resolution of the gulf crisis must be linked to the Palestinian question and other regional disputes.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hussein and senior Iraqi officials have been increasingly ambiguous on how much progress would have to be made on the Palestinian question before Iraq would seize the fig leaf that many here believe it is seeking to cover its retreat from Kuwait.
An Iraqi familiar with Government thinking said today that the effort here is "to get the rights of the Palestinians to be focused on" and to "get movement that should satisfy the Palestinians that they are involved in the peace process." He added that Iraq is "not worried about specifics at this point."
This Iraqi said Iraq was willing to make "sacrifices," a word used by Mr. Hussein and others in a manner to mean "concessions," but without the negative political connotation that this word carries. "Sacrfice is the term we use," the Iraqi said. "We are not ready for concessions."
"If others are willing to sacrifice, Iraq for its part will be willing to sacrifice when serious and meaningful talks will start," the Iraqi said, adding, "It is premature to speak about sacrifices which Iraq would make."
In any face-to-face meeting, Iraq also would probably press for security guarantees in the region that would enshrine Mr. Baker's pledge that Iraq would not be attacked in the future, and perhaps seek to extend such a pledge to address Israel's future intentions toward Iraq.
 
Iraq Fears Israeli Attack
 Foreign Minister Aziz, in an interview with the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, expressed the concern that "if the United States does not attack us now, sooner or later Israel will." That official theme has infected relations between the United States and Iraq since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in August 1988.
A Western Ambassador said he would expect Mr. Hussein to try to extract a pledge from the Administration to forswear any future attempts to destabilize Iraq economically or politically, or to seek Mr. Hussein's overthrow.
"I think security guarantees are needed for Iraq as a state and the whole region," the knowledgeable Iraqi said. "How can you establish peace in the region at large unless there are security guarantees?"
An inescapable element in any diplomatic settlement will be the role of Mr. Hussein's onetime allies in the Arab world, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in particular, which now are arrayed against him in military alliance with the United States.
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, though strongly in the American camp, has sent more than one signal to Mr. Hussein that an Arab rapproachment is still possible, but the King has resisted the temptation for dialogue with Mr. Hussein until Iraq leaves Kuwait.
Most recently, in his address to the heads of state of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, King Fahd said he would like Mr. Hussein "to know that we have proved to him, when he chose the path of confrontation, that we are capable of making a decision on confrontation, and that as soon as he decides on concord, we, in turn, will be able to make a decision on concord."
For the moment, the lull of the holiday season and the tactical standoff between Washington and Baghdad have frozen diplomacy.
"Practically there is no diplomacy in the normal sense of the word," an Iraqi official said today. "The two Governments, United States and Iraq, are not talking to each other."
 
BUSH EXPECTS WITHDRAWAL
 President Bush has told Time magazine that his "gut" feeling is that President Hussein will withdraw from Kuwait before war.
In an interview in the current edition of Time, Mr. Bush was asked if there would be a war with Iraq. "My gut says he will get out of there," the President said of the Iraqi leader.
While he acknowledged that "that flies in the face of what some of the Arab leaders tell me, which is that he cannot get out," Mr. Bush said he held a different view.
"He cannot do in Kuwait what he did in Iran," he said. "He cannot do it and survive domestically. I just think that any person who has fought a war, once he understands what he is up against in terms of power, is going to have to find a way to see that he does not fight another one."
Mr. Bush also said he was confident that he had made the right choice in the crisis, even if it meant going to war. "Maybe that is why I am -- I will not say relaxed, but determined," he said. "And I am not churning about it."
"I know what has to be done," he added. "And I know the promise of a new world order if it is done right. I know the devastating effect on the world if it is done wrong. We will do what we have got to do."

HEADLINE: Dental Clinic Is Rebuffed In Bid to Avoid Liability

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A Manhattan appeals court has made it easier for patients of a teaching clinic that provides low-cost dental care to sue the clinic for malpractice.
In a unanimous decision, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said that the New York University Dental Center's practice of requiring patients to sign waivers, in which they give up the right to sue for malpractice, was "against public policy" and that the waivers cannot be enforced. Such waivers are generally not used by hospitals, medical clinics and private doctors and dentists. 
 "It is clear that the state's substantial interest in protecting the welfare of all its citizens, irrespective of economic status, extends to insuring that they be provided with health care in a safe and professional manner," the court said in its ruling on Thursday.
 
Earlier Ruling Reversed
 "We find that the exculpatory agreement sought to be enforced between a dental clinic and its patient implicates both the state's interest in the health and welfare of its citizens as well as the special relationship between physician and patient and that it would be against public policy to uphold such an agreement," the court said.
The ruling would directly apply to dental clinics operated in Manhattan by New York and Columbia Universities.
It overturned a 1989 decision by State Supreme Court Justice Ira Gammerman that dismissed a malpractice suit by an 82-year-old patient against the New York University Dental Center, at 345 East 24th Street.
The patient, Arthur Ash, a retired salesman, was referred to the clinic in 1986 by his dentist, Dr. Charles Lennon, so that he could have about $6,000 worth of dental care done for half the cost. In return for the savings, the center required Mr. Ash to sign away any claim of liability.
According to the court, when Mr. Ash was treated by Dr. Lennon and dental students at the center on Oct. 15, 1986, two gold crowns slipped down his throat and lodged in his right lung. They had to be removed surgically.
Justice Gammerman ruled that the center's agreement protected it from a malpractice suit.
 
Services for Poor Patients
 But the appellate court, in a decision written by Justice Betty Weinberg Ellerin, found that "the agreement in this case is in violation of public policy and should not be enforced." The court ordered the suit reinstated.
The court took note of the services that the dental center provided to poor patients, but said that such services "cannot serve as a basis for excusing such providers from complying with those minimum professional standards of care which the state has seen fit to establish."
Poor patients, the court said, "cannot be considered to have freely bargained for a substandard level of care for a financial savings."
If dental centers were absolved of any liability, the court said, it would create an "invidious" system in which "services received by the less affluent are permitted to be governed by lesser minimal standards of care and skill than that received by other segments of society."
 
Malpractice Insurance
 Generally, the courts have upheld agreements in which consumers give up the right to sue for damages, provided certain conditions are met. One is that the consumers have sufficent choices. Another is that there is an "arm's length" distance between the parties involved, as in the case of owners and patrons of parking lots. Courts also insist that the agreements are specific on what they cover.
Howard R. Cohen, the lawyer for the dental center, said the ruling would hurt poor patients by requiring the center to charge more for its services in order to pay for malpractice insurance. He said the center had not decided whether to appeal the ruling or to defend itself against Mr. Ash's suit at trial.
Mr. Ash's lawyer, Steven DiJoseph, said the ruling upheld the right of poor people "who can't afford better treatment to sue when they are denied it because of malpractice or negligence."

HEADLINE: 1990/THE YEAR IN SPORTS;
New Names, Troubled Times

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
As the 1990's began, many of the usual sports names persisted. George Steinbrenner was sentenced to baseball limbo and Pete Rose was sentenced to Federal prison. Lou Piniella guided the Cincinnati Reds to a stunning World Series sweep. The San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Pistons and Edmonton Oilers were again measured for championship rings. Jerry Tarkanian and the college basketball titleholders, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, argued with National Collegiate Athletic Association investigators. Greg LeMond repeated in cycling's Tour de France. West Germany won soccer's World Cup. The usual number was multimillion, as in salaries; sometimes even a billion, as in television contracts.
But different names surfaced in 1990, different names that stirred new controversies or new scenarios. 
 Howard Spira, a self-described gambler from the Bronx, accepted $40,000 from Steinbrenner for information discrediting Dave Winfield, and because he made the payment the Yankee principal owner was barred by Commissioner Fay Vincent from participating in the day-to-day operation of the franchise, a ruling that Steinbrenner signed but is now debating.
James (Buster) Douglas, never more than a journeyman boxer, swatted the heavyweight crown off Mike Tyson's head with a 10th-round knockout in Tokyo that the promoter Don King loudly protested before being shouted down. But Douglas, too flabby and too docile, was later dethroned by Evander Holyfield in a third-round knockout in Las Vegas, Nev.
Hank Gathers, a basketball all-American at Loyola Marymount, collapsed on the court and died soon after, prompting an examination of his school's concern for his known irregular heartbeat, which required medication.
Hall Thompson, the founder of the Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, Ala., acknowledged a club policy that discriminated against blacks, stirring civil-rights protests before the Professional Golfers Assocation Championship there. That led to the acceptance of an honorary black member and altered the membership policies of several host clubs on the pro golf tours.
Lisa Olson, a sportswriter for The Boston Herald, was sexually harassed by three members of the New England Patriots in their locker room, prompting Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to fine the players and club a total of $72,500. Sam Wyche, the Cincinnati coach, was fined about $30,000 for barring another sportswriter, Denise Tom of USA Today, from the Bengals' locker room.
Pete Sampras, a mannerly 19-year-old tennis player with a blistering serve who was ranked No. 81 only a year ago, established himself as the youngest United States Open king, while Jennifer Capriati, turning pro at age 13, enchanted fans and established herself as a threat to dominate women's tennis in the near future.
And the city of Atlanta, never the answer to an Olympics word-association test in other years, was awarded the 1996 Summer Games despite the challenge of Athens, which had hoped to stage the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics where they began in 1896.
In baseball, the Reds, who conquered the Pittsburgh Pirates for the National League pennant, used their Nasty Boy bullpen of Randy Myers, Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton to cleanse baseball's oldest franchise, muddied again by Pete Rose's conviction for Federal tax evasion, mostly of income from trading-card shows. Already exiled by baseball for his gambling habits, the former Reds manager was sentenced to five months in an Illinois prison, three months in a treatment center and 1,000 hours of community service in Cincinnati schools.
Even before a 32-day lockout delayed the start of the schedule by a week, Steinbrenner assured Bucky Dent of being the Yankee manager all season. But on June 6, Dent was gone and Stump Merrill was hired. And on July 30 Steinbrenner was gone, soon to be succeeded by Robert Nederlander, the Broadway impresario. As the team skidded into last place, its low point came when Andy Hawkins pitched a no-hitter and lost, 4-0, to the Chicago White Sox in a comedy of outfield misplays. After the season, Dave Righetti joined the San Francisco Giants for $10 million over four years.
The Mets also changed managers, hiring Bud Harrelson on May 29 to succeed Davey Johnson. The switch inspired a quick streak to the top of the National League East, but the Mets soon settled into a second-place stride. As a free agent, Darryl Strawberry departed to join his hometown Los Angeles Dodgers for $20.25 million over five years. But the Mets' front office responded by signing Vince Coleman for $11.95 million over four years and obtaining Hubie Brooks in a trade with the Dodgers.
Until the World Series, the Athletics were baseball's most dominant team, winning the American League West by nine games and sweeping the Boston Red Sox for the pennant. In the playoff finale, Roger Clemens, the Red Sox's ace right-hander, was ejected by the plate umpire, Terry Cooney, for having argued a close pitch with vulgarities. Fined $10,000 and suspended for the first five games next season, Clemens has appealed, charging that Cooney provoked him.
Jose Canseco, the Oakland slugger, signed a five-year, $23.5 million contract, which inspired the baseball boom: 29 players will average at least $3 million a year for the duration of their current contracts. But there was no explanation for a record nine no-hitters, including a record sixth at age 43 for Nolan Ryan, who also notched his 300th victory. For the first time in modern baseball history, two no-hitters occurred on the same date, June 29, when Dave Stewart of the Athletics and Fernando Valenzuela of the Dodgers each pitched his first. Cecil Fielder, returning from Japan, hit 51 homers for the Detroit Tigers.
In pro football, the 49ers routed the Denver Broncos, 55-10, for their second straight Super Bowl title. Entering today's final games of the current season, the 49ers, with a 13-2 record, were the early favorite for what would be a record third consecutive Super Bowl triumph if Joe Montana could avert the bane of quarterbacks on other contenders -- the severe injury.
The 49ers and the Giants each opened with a 10-0 start before losing a week before their showdown, which the 49ers won, 7-3. But the Giants salvaged their second straight Eastern Division title and will enter the playoffs with Jeff Hostetler at quarterback. The Jets, a struggling 5-10 going into today's finale, hired Bruce Coslet from the Bengals' staff to be their head coach.
 Two offensive trends developed: the run-and-shoot as popularized by the Houston Oilers, Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons, and the no-huddle as originated by the Bengals and refined by the Bills.
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, meanwhile, recommended to N.F.L. owners that the 1993 Super Bowl game be moved out of Tempe, Ariz., after Arizona voters rejected Martin Luther King Day as a paid state holiday.
In college football, the mythical national champion will be determined in the New Year's Day bowl games with Colorado (which defeated Missouri, 33-31, on a fifth-down play), Georgia Tech, Miami and Texas each having a chance to wave index fingers as the No. 1 team. Ty Detmer, the Brigham Young quarterback who set 30 N.C.A.A. passing records, was voted the Heisman Trophy.
In college basketball, the Runnin' Rebels from Las Vegas routed Duke, 103-73, for the national title but now, as then, Coach Jerry Tarkanian has been surrounded by N.C.A.A. investigators. After first declaring U.N.L.V. ineligible to defend its championship in 1991, the N.C.A.A. ruled that the Runnin' Rebels would be ineligible for the 1992 tournament instead. Only a few weeks later, U.N.L.V. was confronted by N.C.A.A. sleuths with a new series of allegations of recruiting violations.
Jim Valvano resigned as North Carolina State's basketball coach after disclosures of his shoddy attitude toward his players' academic progress, and also after allegations of point-shaving by Wolfpack players that have yet to be substantiated by law-enforcement officials.
Hank Gathers, who had been diagnosed as having an irregular heartbeat, collapsed during a game on March 4. His death inspired Loyola Marymount's drive to the Western Regional final amid controversy over whether his fatal heart attack could have been averted. In the N.C.A.A. tournament, the Lions routed New Mexico State and the defending champion, Michigan, and edged Alabama before losing to U.N.L.V.
In the National Basketball Association, the Pistons repeated as champions, dominating the Portland Trail Blazers in five games, but the triumph set off a celebratory riot in Detroit that left 8 people dead and 127 injured. Pat Riley, who had four championship rings, resigned as the Lakers' coach; Mike Dunleavy succeeded him. Early in the current season, John MacLeod was hired to replace Stu Jackson as the coach of the Knicks.
For the fifth time in seven years, the Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup as Mark Messier, the runner-up to his ex-linemate Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings for the regular-season scoring title, was voted the Hart Trophy as the National Hockey League's most valuable player. The Oilers conquered the Boston Bruins in five games after sweeping the Kings.
Bolstered by the late-season acquisition of Bernie Nicholls and Mike Gartner, the Rangers finished atop the Patrick Division, the first time they had finished first anywhere since 1942. But after eliminating the Islanders in the playoffs, the Rangers lost to the Washington Capitals, who had ousted the New Jersey Devils.
In July, Mario Lemieux, Pittsburgh's superstar center, had surgery for a herniated disk in his back, which plagued him last year and has kept him off the ice this season.
In tennis, the United States finally recaptured the Davis Cup for the first time since 1982, with Andre Agassi and Michael Chang winning the opening singles matches of the final with Australia on clay in the Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, Fla. For the first time since the Open era of tennis began in 1968, the men's and women's Grand Slam events were won by eight different players: Sampras and Gabriela Sabatini in the United States Open, Stefan Edberg and Martina Navratilova (a record-breaking ninth All-England singles title for her) at Wimbledon; Andres Gomez and Monica Seles in the French Open; Ivan Lendl and Steffi Graf in the Australian Open.
In golf, Nick Faldo repeated as the Masters champion and also won the British Open, the first to win two majors in the same year since Tom Watson in 1982. At age 45, Hale Irwin emerged as the United States Open's oldest champion in a 19-hole playoff against Mike Donald. After the Shoal Creek controversy, an Australian, Wayne Grady, took the P.G.A. title. Lee Trevino was golf's top money winner with $1,190,518 in dominating the Senior PGA Tour with seven victories, including the Senior Open in a duel with Jack Nicklaus. Beth Daniel earned a record $863,578 while winning seven tournaments, including the L.P.G.A. championship, but Betsy King won the Women's Open.
At the Breeders' Cup at Belmont, the death of three horses, notably the champion filly Go for Wand in front of millions watching on national television, saddened what is known as thoroughbred racing's greatest day. At age 92, Frances Genter finally owned a Kentucky Derby winner, Unbridled, which later finished second to Summer Squall in the Preakness and fourth to Go and Go in the Belmont Stakes. At age 58, after 8,833 victories, Bill Shoemaker rode for the last time on Feb. 3, a fourth-place finish on Patchy Groundfog in the fifth at Santa Anita.
For the first time in 40 years, the United States soccer team qualified for the World Cup finals of Italia '90 but it quickly lost all three of its first-round games. In another early game, the small African nation of Cameroon stunned Argentina, 1-0, but the defending champions recovered to advance to the final before losing to West Germany, 1-0, in Rome, a result typical of the low-scoring games that dulled the anticipation of the World Cup's debut at various United States sites in 1994.
In boxing, Buster Douglas's knockout of Mike Tyson provoked a courtroom power struggle for Douglas's first title defense that the promoter Don King lost to the Las Vegas casino-hotel owner Steve Wynn. But it wasn't worth the legal fees. Douglas was leveled by Evander Holyfield's one-punch knockout. But when Holyfield signed to defend against 42-year-old George Foreman instead of Tyson, squabbles resumed. Julio Cesar Chavez, the super-lightweight champion, extended his record to 73-0, including a streak-saving knockout of Meldrick Taylor with 2 seconds remaining.
In auto racing, Arie Luyendyk, a 36-year-old Dutchman, won the Indianapolis 500 with a record average speed of 185.981 miles per hour, more than 15 m.p.h. faster than the previous high. Dale Earnhardt drove to his fourth stock-car championship.
Randy Barnes set a world shot-put record with a heave of 75 feet 10 1/4 inches but he and Butch Reynolds, the world-record holder at 400 meters, later were suspended for having failed steroids tests. Each is appealing. Ben Johnson was cleared to return to the coming indoor circuit following his two-year suspension for having tested positive for steroids after winning the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Douglas Wakiihuri and Wanda Panfil won the New York City Marathon. And Lynn Jennings, the world crosscountry champion, emerged as the dominant force in distance running.
Television contracts soared to $3.6 billion for N.F.L. games over four years, $1 billion for N.C.A.A. basketball over seven years, $175 million for college football over five years, plus a separate $38 million just for Notre Dame games over five years. All this while the nation's economy was suffering. But as 1991 approached, sports was as persistent in booming as so many of its usual names had been in making headlines along with so many different names.

HEADLINE: Narrow vs. Wide In Tire Safety

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Marshall Schuon provided some sound advice about winter driving ("Getting From Here to There -- Safely," About Cars, Dec. 16), but he perpetuated a common fallacy that wide tires "provide less downweight per square inch" than narrow tires. Actually the weight per square inch of any tire is always equal to the air pressure in the tire. Any tire inflated to 32 pounds per square inch, for example, presses down on the pavement with 32 pounds per square inch. Also, tires of various aspect ratios but with the same inflation pressure and supporting the same weight will have contact patches of different shapes but with the same area.
Narrower tires, better for snow, sink deeper because of their different proportions of length and width of the contact patch's shape. The edges of the patch along the sidewall lead to an almost vertical wall that lets the tire sink into snow; the front and rear edges of the patch at the tread lead to a very gradual slope, following the curvature of the tire, that buoys the tire. A narrow tire's contact patch is long and narrow, maximizing steep and minimizing sloping edges. This minimizes flotation and the tire sinks into the hard packed snow underneath where the tread's lugs can get a bite. In contrast, a low profile tire's contact patch is short and wide, minimizing the steep and maximizing the gently sloping edges. This increases flotation and the tire's tread stays in the loose upper layers of snow.

Decadence and Profit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Madonna as an economic enterprise is formidable (Op-Ed, Dec. 14). So was Donald Trump. The 1980's are over, and just as Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal is an inflated fantasy with faltering success and little value to the quality of life of most Americans, so are the for-profit lyrics of Madonna and hits like "Papa Don't Preach, I'm Going to Keep My Baby."
As a society, let's dump our romance with an illusion and decadence that are in service to the profit of a few. The new American poor consist of single mothers and their children. The age of these women declines every year, and 20 percent of all children in this country live in poverty.
This is not just a feminist issue, but one that affects every American. Unavailability of prenatal care, low-birthweight babies, welfare, insufficient health care and a burgeoning prison population, as these children fall through the cracks, is a future that belongs to all of us.
And Madonna tells these kids to keep having babies.

The Mob Is Back, And Not Just for Fun

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
WAS it one of those only-in-New-York coincidences, or what? Three of the city's most-talked-about stories last week seemed so tightly interwoven that the seam between fact and fiction became all but invisible: John Gotti spent Christmas in ratty quarters behind bars instead of natty clothes in front of bars of a different kind. The film "The Godfather Part III" played to, pardon the expression, mobs of movie-goers. And officials declared that the city's privately run school bus companies are controlled by organized crime.
Out-of-towners have long been puzzled that mob figures in New York have about the same name recognition as, say, elected officials. With organized crime so much in the headlines, perhaps it is no surprise that a favorite dinner-party joke is that the economy is so bad that the Mafia had to lay off three judges. And even a part of the labor force not usually mentioned in the same breath as garbage-haulers or cement-truck drivers -- authors -- admit to mob influence. The mob was not mentioned in "The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste" by Jane and Michael Stern because, Mrs. Stern says, "Michael and I don't want to wind up at the bottom of the Hudson River wearing cement shoes." 
 But this mob business is not so funny, nor so romantic. There was a shootout last week at a Long Island theater showing "The Godfather Part III," but no one was sure it was real until the lights came up. One 15-year-old was killed, and four other people in the theater were wounded, including one who did not come forward for at least 48 hours.
 Law-enforcement officials have long maintained that New Yorkers pay for the pervasiveness of organized crime. The costs of basics like food, clothing and shelter are inflated, prosecutors say, because of sweetheart deals with trucking and construction unions. One executive who works with nonprofit housing projects says organized crime constitutes a "hidden infrastructure" that means only one thing: higher costs. "I once said 30 percent to a former high official in housing and he said more, at least 40," said the executive, who refused to be quoted by name. "Nobody knows. Of course, new construction is dead for the time being, so maybe they'll lessen their greed."
Contractors pad the bottom line with no-show workers; the authorities claim that school-bus companies use "ghost buses" and "phantom riders." Officials say the cheating is possible because they lack inspectors to check on how many buses are dispatched or how many students they haul.
Still, no one has claimed that the buses are unsafe, and at least one parent boasts that his child's bus is never more than 30 seconds late. The driver, this parent says, has a special incentive for on-time performance.
One school-bus company executive told prosecutors that he got together from time to time with top Gambino crime family members "for coffee." Among them, he said, were Gene and Peter Gotti, brothers of the man the F.B.I. says is the nation's most powerful mobster, the chief executive of a half-billion-dollar empire of loan-sharking, extortion, hijacking, robbery and murder.
 
Love-Hate Relationship
 John Gotti has become an object of unparalleled fascination: he is at once decried and glorified. The 50-year-old self-described businessman is, law-enforcement officials say, a rough-spoken descendant of a notorious line that includes Lucky Luciano, Albert Anastasia, Carlo Gambino and Paul Castellano. On the basis of sound bites recorded on his way to court, he is characterized as the kind of guy who orders executions the way other New Yorkers order coffee.
Now prosecutors are accusing him of carrying out the execution of Mr. Castellano and "The Godfather Part III" is lampooning his Hollywood-grade flamboyance. Is this art imitating life, or the other way around?
"Gotti has the image he has," said David Feldman, an author and social historian, "because people believe he does what he's accused of doing, and there doesn't seem to be much revulsion about it. That's scary because we're countenancing it. We get so upset by the murder of the week or Humphrey the Whale or whatever the lead is on the 5 o'clock news, and yet we are able to enjoy the Gotti sideshow."
Some New Yorkers say the year-end preoccupation with the mob -- in real life and at the movies -- is a diversion from the city's fizzling economy and a mayor less charismatic than his predecessor. Whatever the reason, Tony Hiss, the author of "The Experience of Place," said: "There are two things going on: the media event and the underlying reality of what it means to life in New York, and I don't think the difference is very well understood."

More Than Ever, Personality Drives World Events

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PERHAPS, as Josip Broz Tito once said, "an intelligent man cannot accept the theory that personalities create history." Or perhaps Harry S. Truman was right when he said that "men make history and not the other way around."
Historians have argued endlessly about whether great individuals or great forces shape history, and future generations are sure to continue the fight. 
 For at the beginning of the 1990's, at a pause in history on the verge of what promises to be a period of fundamental change, a case can be made that the world is truly feeling the power of individual men and women.
Some people simply force their way onto the world's stage; Saddam Hussein, not the head of a nuclear or economic superpower, nevertheless altered the course of post-cold war history when he brought the world to the brink of war.
There are those whose strength is their voice, even at a time when eloquence has been supplanted by sound bites: Vaclav Havel, the playwright turned President in Czechoslovakia; Nelson Mandela, who emerged from a South African prison to the adulation of a world hungry for heroes; Margaret Thatcher, more powerful in defeat than many politicians are in victory.
It can be argued that these people's voices have helped guide history; it seems indisputable that they at least colored the way much of the world saw the events in which they were involved.
It may even be that the history of how the post-cold-war era began will prove less that of personal vision than of personality:
* Helmut Kohl, who by his own admission lacks ideology, demonstrated a skill at wardroom politics that may have been the perfect formula to guide German unification.
* Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose vision for the Soviet Union still seems obscure, held his country together seemingly through sheer force of will.
* And George Bush bounded through his second year in office with a helter-skelter syntax that was the antithesis of Presidential oratory. Continuing to defy "the vision thing," he produced a Persian Gulf strategy based largely on the fact that he is friends with most world leaders and has the home numbers of the rest in his Rolodex.
Mr. Hussein thrust himself into the world's consciousness with a blinding display of violence that seemed driven more than anything else by the particular nature of his character: his wounded pride at Kuwait's refusal to come to terms on his financial demands; his ambition to assume the pan-Arab mantle that had eluded so many other Middle Eastern leaders, and then his thirst for a one-on-one showdown with Mr. Bush.
On a larger stage, Mr. Gorbachev has come as close as anyone to refuting Tito's view of history, although some, including President Bush and Ronald Reagan before him, argue that it was Western pressure and military strength that forced the collapse of Communism.
Mr. Gorbachev has made the creation of a new Soviet federation a test of his personal leadership and, in the view of his critics, is on the road to accumulating as much, if not more, power than even Stalin had.
For the Bush Administration, Mr. Gorbachev virtually embodies the Soviet Union; when Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned, Washington was shocked by the loss of the only other central link in the East-West chain.
As for Mr. Bush, his operating style is based almost entirely on the force of personality, expressed in his contacts with other politicians, especially world leaders.
The President has often spoken of the resurgence of the United Nations, of the rule of international law, and of the weight of nations brought to bear against Iraq. But in his view, the alliance against Baghdad is one of individual politicians, not governments. He knows the leaders, calls many by their first names, and talks to them often on the telephone, his favored instrument of diplomacy.
Chancellor Kohl, too, has affected history through skill as a politician rather than vision or ideology. Was Germany's unification inevitable? Perhaps, and no doubt Mr. Kohl was aided by Mr. Gorbachev, by Mr. Bush and by his ability to spend German money. But many in Europe argue that the ideological drives of a Willy Brandt or even of a Hans-Dietrich Genscher could not have done what Mr. Kohl did.
While Mr. Bush bristles at the suggestion that he lacks vision, Mr. Kohl seems serene. This is not to say that Mr. Kohl has no conceptual framework. He does, a typically plain one. Asked what his vision of Germany's future was, Mr. Kohl said: "That we simply don't stick out."
In Eastern Europe, Mr. Havel's public agonizing over moving from revolutionary idealism to political compromise seemed to symbolize the disappointments that produced a bleak morning after to the celebrations of 1989.
On New Year's Day, Mr. Havel told his countrymen to stop lying to themselves about their economy. Then he faced the possibility that his country would fragment. Even when Czechoslovakia celebrated the first anniversary of its revolution, Mr. Havel was somber. "Are we really a nation capable of reviving its virtues only once in 20 years' time?" he asked.
Mr. Mandela, too, faced a grim reality on his release from prison: a country nearly as rent by fighting among blacks as by their struggle against apartheid. He, too, faced political maneuverings within his movement. But he seemed to influence the rest of the world by the power of his vision. He told the United States Congress he had come "as a particle of a people whom we know to be noble and heroic, enduring, multiplying, permanent, rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that their humanity will be reaffirmed and enlarged by open and unfettered communion with the nations of the world."
Mrs. Thatcher, before leaving 10 Downing Street in November, had made sure her voice was heard in the debate over the decline of Communism, the rise of a common Europe and the crisis in the gulf. Even Mr. Bush drew strength from her after the invasion of Kuwait, about which she was characteristically blunt in her warnings to Saddam Hussein.
In "War and Peace," Tolstoy wrote that a belief that free will shapes events "is the same to history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy."
But some historians watch the emergence of global personalities with bemusement, like Gabor S. Boritt, a professor at Gettysburg College, who in times like these delights in conducting guided tours of the battlefield near his office.
"I love to go to specific spots in the field and say, 'This one man did that one thing that made history in that one square mile,' " Mr. Boritt said. "It may be the subject of argument on a grander scale, but the power of the individual is self-evident out there in the battlefield."

 BODY:
In the last year it has been widely reported that measured in dollars, Japan has become the No. 1 donor of foreign assistance. But in some ways its status can be attributed to the high value of the yen and cutbacks by the budget-squeezed United States Government. Last week, some Japanese officials said they hoped that the selection of a Japanese woman, Sadako Ogata, as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would show that Japan is serious about extending its world leadership beyond the domain of business. "I think it would be pretty good if Japan, in becoming an economic power, becomes a humanitarian power as well," said Ms. Ogata, dean of foreign studies at Sophia University in Tokyo. Ms. Ogata, who spent five years in the 1930's in San Francisco and Portland, later earning a doctorate in political science from the University of California at Berkeley, is accustomed to a cosmopolitan perspective. Her husband, Shijuro Ogata, an economist, has been mentioned for a possible role as director of the International Monetary Fund.

The Poor Mainly Recycle Poverty

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
ONE of the biggest disappointments for New York City's fledgling recycling program has been the low participation by residents in poorer, densely populated neighborhoods. In areas like Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant, already overwhelmed by life and death issues, recycling seems trivial.
"They're not talking about landfills," said Eddie O'Jay, a Harlem resident on Community Board 10's sanitation committee. 
 As city officials look for ways to cut recycling costs while improving compliance, some experts suggest that expensive curbside pickup of recyclable material in low-income neighborhoods should be replaced with programs that offer residents economic incentives to recycle. The idea is simple: People are more likely to recycle if they are paid to do so.
 "Everyone recognizes it is much tougher in a poorer neighborhood than an affluent one," said the city's Sanitation Commissioner, Steven M. Polan. "It's obvious."
The concept of providing an economic motivation to recycle is receiving strong interest. The city's 21-month-old recycling law calls for establishing in each borough at least one center to which residents can take recyclable material like newspapers in exchange for cash. Such businesses, called buyback centers, are also intended to create jobs for depressed communities.
 
The High-Rise Problem
 The nation does not have much experience with high-density urban recycling, and as a result, New York City is generally viewed as a pioneer. For example, there are many successful suburban recycling programs, but few places have tried recycling on a large-scale in neighborhoods dominated by high-rise apartments. Buyback centers have been around for years, but in no great numbers in cities. Even Newark, which boasts a recycling rate exceeding 50 percent, has poor participation in low-income, high-density areas, a study by that city has found.
"We don't know of a single city that approximates New York in complexity in waste handling," said Nancy A. Wolf, executive director of the Environmental Action Coalition, a local nonprofit group that organizes recycling programs.
That complexity is translating into big problems for New York City's mandatory recycling program. Although tonnage goals were met in the first year, collection costs have been much higher than anticipated. Without productivity gains, the Sanitation Department expects the program, once it is fully in effect, to cost more than four times what had been projected.
Under the best financial circumstances, the city would be hard-pressed to afford that. Now, when budget paring is the priority, the Sanitation Department must make do with less. Continued phase-in of the recycling program has already been set back at least until July. Currently, 29 of 59 community boards, or 2 million households, have curbside recycling for at least some materials.
If New York City is to reach its goal of 25-percent recycling by April 1994, Sanitation Department officials must figure out how to increase participation in low-income neighborhoods. In recent testimony before the City Council, department officials said residents of Staten Island, where single-family homes predominate, were recycling 18 percent of their garbage -- the best in the city -- while residents of northern Manhattan, including Harlem, were at 5 percent. As a result, the cost per ton of collected materials is much higher in neighborhoods with low compliance than in neighborhoods that generate a lot of recyclables.
Reasons for the poor compliance range from the basic social and economic problems of the neighborhood to uncooperative building management to insufficient education by the Sanitation Department.
Mr. O'Jay, the Harlem community board member, also noted that some residents have started to view recycling as a city revenue-raising effort because fines are now being assessed to violators. Others doubt recycling is actually occurring when they see separated materials tossed into regular garbage trucks instead of specially marked trucks, he said.
Perhaps most important, "the outreach program has been a dismal failure," Mr. O'Jay said. "You can't just expect people to understand a problem by handing out literature."
Mr. Polan, the Sanitation Commissioner, acknowledged that educational efforts have been lacking. The delay in expanding the program in the next six months will enable department workers to return to Harlem to promote the recycling program, he said.
It would be premature to discontinue curbside recycling in Harlem, Mr. Polan said. "I don't think we've given it a fair test in any neighborhood, low-income included." He also said the Sanitation Department wants to establish more buyback centers, but has found strong community opposition to locating them near residential areas, where neighbors are concerned about additional truck traffic, noise and foul smells.
Supporters of buyback centers take a different view. David M. Muchnick, chief executive officer of a successful center in the South Bronx, said that in low-income neighborhoods the buyback approach is "cheaper and more cost-effective" than curbside pickup programs.
"Places like ours can be immensely effective in generating a lot of tonnage," he said.
Mr. Muchnick runs Recoverable Resources/Borough Bronx 2000 Inc., a for-profit enterprise started eight years ago as a subsidiary of the nonprofit South Bronx 2000 Local Development Corporation. Since April 1982, the center has sold about $5 million in paper, plastic, glass, metal and wood to recyclers while paying $800,000 to people who bring in such materials. R2B2, as it is called, is a partner in a joint venture to open a Brooklyn buyback center next month.
"We know that poor people will participate in recycling efforts," Mr. Muchnick said, but "one should maximize the cash opportunities."

HEADLINE: The T-Shirt Industry Sweats It Out

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Their appeal transcends income, education and taste. While other fashions have come and gone, the lowly T-shirt keeps selling. But even this garment's sales may be vulnerable to a recession. Indeed, a surge in domestic capacity and the flow of imports have made T-shirt marketing a sweaty contact sport. Analysts are expecting cutbacks in domestic T-shirt output to continue in 1991.
"The T-shirt market this year is soft due to too much capacity and the erosion in general economic conditions," said Robert Blanchard, president of the National Knitwear Manufacturers Association, of Morristown, N.J. "Retailers knew that they can always get the supply they need and are controlling their inventories." 
 Because T-shirts are relatively cheap and readily available in a wide range of styles and designs, they appeal to many different people. For example, wearing a T-shirt is a way to assert one's identity or or back up a boast, whether it be about surviving the New York Marathon, visiting Dolly Parton's Dollywood in Tennessee or proclaiming an allegiance to Calvin Klein. "Over the last five years, demand for T-shirts has been very strong," said Deborah Bronston, apparel analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., in New York City.
Meeting the demand can yield stunning profit margins. Start with a simple white cotton or cotton-polyester shirt, dye it in the factory or run it through a screen or thermal printing machine. With little added expense, a basic $3-wholesale shirt can emerge as a garment that sells for several times more.
This year, about a billion T-shirts have been made for the United States market, or four for every back. Domestic mills produced about 609 million outerwear-style T- shirts and produced another 300 million meant to be worn as underwear. About 108 million shirts have been imported.
T-shirts are the only clothing sold not just in stores, but also on the street, in gasoline stations, bowling alleys, movie theaters and zoos. A single shirt can fetch as little as $5 or as much as $150 when sold in boutiques. Even better, in Manhattan's Times Square, three shirts can sell for as low as $10.
Large makers like Fruit of the Loom Inc. and the Hanes division of Sara Lee Corporation, together account for more than 50 percent of the domestic outerwear T-shirt market, with Fruit of the Loom having a somewhat higher share than Hanes. But retailers buy only about 15 percent of their shirts directly from the manufacturers. The rest filter through wholesalers who either print T-shirts themselves or sell to independent, entrepreneurial style printers.
Some executives and analysts forecast continuing strong sales. Millions of young and older Americans constantly add to their T-shirt wardrobes -- attesting to the enduring American passion for the casual. "T-shirts and jeans naturally go together, since each seems to be just right for the other," observed Richard Ruster, the president of the Tee Corporation of America, a producer and importer in New York City. "They're the leisure wear for the 1990's."
Few fashions are so adaptable. What began as outerwear for the fitness craze has become an all-purpose garment for the home and many work places. Indeed, the greatest growth in T-shirt sales has been in outerwear. Jack Hershlag, executive director of the National Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers, speaks of "the two worlds of T-shirts."
One, he said, is the world of fashion T-shirts, proprietary creations marketed by companies or designers, usually as part of coordinated wardrobes. The other includes the blank shirts that are printed with cartoon characters, team names, product logos, special events, political slogans and jokes. "Bart Simpson is probably outselling any other cartoon character," Mr. Hershlag said. "It's a case of the product creating its own market, and the more bright ideas there are, the bigger the market will be."
Some analysts say that fashion and novelty will continue to fill T-shirts and T-shirt demand. "Even though some see an oversupply, I see a continuing, solid trend because of the tie-ins with popular movies or television shows," said Arthur Britten, a New York retailing and apparel consultant. "The 'Dick Tracy' and now 'The Simpsons' shirts have had sales in the millions."
As demand grew in the late 1980's, factories expanded more than 10 percent a year but still ran at capacity. Domestic outerwear production boomed from 382 million shirts in 1986 to 648 million in 1989. Output fell closer to 600 million this year as the manufacturers, fearing oversupply, cut back.
Importers have had to retreat as well. The biggest source of imported T-shirts is Pakistan, followed by China, Hong Kong and the Philippines. While the foreign flow increased from 14.9 percent of the outerwear market in 1986 to 18.2 percent in 1989, it has slowed this year, dropping an estimated 6 to 8 percent through June, Mr. Blanchard said.
Domestic T-shirt makers have depended on automation to fend off the imports that have inundated many other types of apparel companies. T-shirts are made from knit jersey, either an all-cotton or polyester blend, by high-speed knitting machines that, in a plant with 500 employees, turn out 17 million shirts a year. But lower fiber costs help keep the price of imported shirts a dollar or two below the cost of domestic products.
Some American companies are trying to compete by shifting their production overseas. Mr. Ruster said that imports are more likely to thrive in 1991 than domestic production. His three-year-old T-shirt company produces all its garments from abroad. Foreign makers often pay more for import rights -- which, under national quotas, can be bought and traded -- than for actual shirt production. In Mr. Ruster's view, "That shows the demand still exists for the import."
For manufacturers like Mr. Ruster, T-shirts will never go out of style. "It's still a very hot business," he said. "The T-shirt business is at its peak and everyone still wants to be in it."
 
 
 
DESIGNER T-SHIRTS' TRUE WORTH
 Nobody would price a Claude Monet painting by totaling the value of its canvas, pigment, frame and labor, as well as the retail markup. Likewise, the Monets of the fashion world insist that standard accounting fails to capture their creations' true worth. Far from treating T-shirts as designer doodlings, clever retailers promote them as essential elements in wardrobes.
Earlier this year, at the Claude Montana boutique in Beverly Hills, Calif., $150 bought a white T-shirt with a big M on the front. However, the French designer will no longer produce these shirts, because, as the boutique manager said, "We do not renew last season's styles."
Those in the business stress that the finished masterpiece justifies a shirt's high price. "The designer who decides to do a T-shirt will design it totally, from the fabric, construction, shape and trim," said Jack Hershlag, of the National Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers. "Basic T-shirts are mass-produced and chopped out in standard shapes. But the designer might want his creation longer, shorter, fuller or deeper, or with a higher neck."
Not that this effort is always evident. "You are paying for the designer's name, which is usually on it, and for the pleasure of the reaction you get," Mr. Hershlag said. "It's a matter of fashion appeal and probably snob appeal. Is it better made? Yes, but probably not much more than the best-made, moderate-priced T-shirt."
Mr. Hershlag said that consumers will never tire of letting designers advertise on their chests. "Not one bit," he said. "People want that name on their jeans or their T-shirts. Manufacturers are falling all over themselves to get the permission of designers to use their names on the products they make."

HEADLINE: Joseph Long, 78, Philanthropist And Founder of Drugstore Chain

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Joseph M. Long, the chairman and co-founder of Longs Drug Stores and a prominent philanthropist, died Thursday at the John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 78 years old and lived in nearby Danville.
He died of a brain hemorrhage, a company spokesman said. 
 With his brother Thomas, Mr. Long founded the retail drug company in Oakland, Calif., in 1938. The Longs chain, now based in Walnut Creek, employs 14,000 people in 257 retail drug stores in six states and did $2 billion in business last year.
Several years ago, Mr. Long's son Robert was named president and chief executive officer of the company but the father continued to exercise oversight. Thomas Long is retired but continues as a member of the board.
Joseph Long was also a former director of Safeway Stores, the Western Department Stores, Cutter Laboratories and served on the boards of several other companies.
 
Education and Environment
 An advocate of educational and environmental causes, Mr. Long donated millions of dollars to the University of California and wildlife institutions. Among his contributions was $3.2 million to the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center.
He also established the Foundation for Excellence at the School of Pharmacy at the University of California at San Francisco and set up a marine laboratory at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Mr. Long served as chairman and co-founder of the California State Parks Foundation and was co-founder and president of the California Waterfowl Association.
A native of Covelo, Calif., he graduated in 1933 from the University of California at Berkeley and stayed on for three years of graduate studies in economics and public administration.
He is survived by two sons: Robert M. of Lafayette, Calif., and Kirk of Spain; two daughters, Nancy Fink of Berkeley and Marion Souyoultzis of Piedmont, Calif.; two brothers, Thomas J. of Alamo and Ralph of Millbrae, Calif.; two sisters, Sarah Sweeney of El Sobrante, Calif., and Leta Lowry of Walnut Creek, and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Facing His Toughest Year: Making Up Deficit and His Mind

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The Governor's inauguration is traditionally the high point of New York's election cycle, an occasion that has all the pomp a state government can muster: commemorative key chains, Indian chiefs in full regalia, geysers of punch served up in little plastic cups.
This year, however, there will be no pomp, no key chains, no chiefs. In a gesture of austerity, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has canceled the inauguration and will take his oath of office in a modest ceremony on Monday. 
 The spartan swearing-in ceremony is a fitting prelude to the demanding year that lies ahead for the Governor. Somewhat diminished at home by a disappointing re-election but still a prominent national figure, Mr. Cuomo is entering what is likely to be the most arduous year of his tenure, a year of grave austerity and government hardship.
When he presents his budget in January, the Governor will have to close a budget gap that by many estimates has already grown to almost $4 billion. That is more than 10 percent of the general tax revenues the state expects to collect in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Not one to minimize a challenge, Mr. Cuomo said recently, "In terms of the numbers, this is the toughest since the 30's."
 
Decision Time on '92
 At the same time, Mr. Cuomo will have to decide, perhaps for good, whether to run for President. Most political analysts, including those closest to the Governor, say that in order to run a credible campaign in 1992 he must make his plans known by September.
"You ought to know this summer whether he's running," said Robert S. Strauss, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "Beyond that it gets pretty late, particularly for someone who's never been around the track before."
The awkward confluence of decisions facing the Governor in 1991 -- political and fiscal, presidential and parochial -- makes the coming months peculiarly treacherous for him. A misstep in Albany, which the Governor says is facing its most serious budget problems since the Depression, is likely to have harmful effects in Washington. Conversely, a false move on the national front could weaken him at home.
As one associate said, "The next three or four months could kill him."
Mr. Cuomo's situation both as Governor and as a potential presidential candidate is further complicated by the deepening fiscal worries facing New York City.
As a practical matter, the state government is inevitably drawn into any crisis facing the city; the city relies on the state for a significant part of its budget, and the state relies on the city's tax base for a substantial part of its revenues.
 
'Can He Manage a Tailspin?'
 That Mr. Cuomo cannot avoid being tugged into the city's troubles was amply demonstrated last Wednesday, when the Governor rebuked Mayor David N. Dinkins, saying the Mayor was relying on state aid that simply did not exist. The rebuke led to a chorus of protest from those who said that the Governor, instead of criticizing the Mayor, should solve the problem.
"New York City becomes the test of Governor Cuomo's vision," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who called reporters from his Washington headquarters to register his criticism. "It is a reflection of his priorities."
With New York State and New York City dragging each other closer to insolvency, the task facing the Governor is nothing less than to arrest the slide.
"The issue is, Can he manage a tailspin?" said the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat. "If he does it well, then it will be phenomenal."
When it comes to the Presidency, Mr. Cuomo's fondness for secrecy is legendary. Those who are closest to him insist that the Presidency is an issue he does not even discuss privately. Indeed, they say, whether he will run in 1992 is something that the Governor himself does not yet know.
 
Key to a Presidential Run
 Still, there appears to be a consensus among Mr. Cuomo's advisers that if he resolves the state's budget problems this spring -- or at least is perceived as having done so -- he could be a formidable candidate if he chooses. But if he does not appear to master the budget, he has effectively disqualified himself from a national campaign. Since the outcome of state budget negotiations will not be known until April or May, the Governor, his advisers say, will probably wait until the summer to make his plans known.
"If you wanted to speculate that the Governor would wait until after the budget before saying anything, you'd probably be right," one of his closest advisers said. "Mario is very good at not saying anything. And since you don't have to say anything, why do it?"
But even as the budget unfolds and Mr. Cuomo ducks the inevitable questions about 1992, few expect him to give up the long flirtation with the Presidency that he began six years ago.
In June, when Mr. Cuomo declared his candidacy for governor, he repeatedly evaded questions about why he was not declaring, as he had in 1986, that by running for Governor he was indicating that he would not run for President.
Since then, Mr. Cuomo has discussed national political issues at least as much as Albany's. Even when he was presenting $1 billion worth of midyear budget cuts last month, he made the event a forum on Washington, saying: "It's obvious that the problem is national and will need national remedies."
 
Taking Objections to Washington
 Three weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo took his criticism of the Federal Government directly to Washington, speaking to the National Press Club on themes that made him the toast of Democratic dinner parties: the failures of Reaganomics, the nation's faltering economy, President Bush's preoccupation with foreign policy.
"There is a long-term national economic crisis as dangerous to this country as Saddam Hussein," Mr. Cuomo told the Washington press. "But so far there is little evidence that Washington is prepared to deal with it."
Aides denied that the Governor's speech was intended to reinvigorate speculation about his national ambitions. Yet they complained when the speech did not receive the kind of display they said it deserved. And the address, which sounded curiously like the blueprint for a Cuomo candidacy, quickly became the talk of national political circles.
"I think he reminded a lot of people why they would like to see him run," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll-taker. "He seemed big enough to fit in the presidential chair without a couple of phone books under him."
Mr. Cuomo has always been well served by his status as a potential presidential candidate, and, his advisers note, there is no reason for him to change this status as he enters his administration's most challenging year.
 
'I'm Not Good at Being Coy'
 "Why would you do it?" one adviser said. "Who knows what it would do?"
As a potential candidate, the Governor has always enjoyed a national audience that has amplified his image in New York. But Mr. Cuomo has also been able to avoid the kind of rigorous questioning on national and international affairs that would follow a declaration of intent to run.
"I don't think the Governor has to say anything," Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, said. "He gets all the attention anyway."
After the Governor's agonizingly coquettish dance with the 1988 presidential race, he told reporters that he had rued the whole episode. "Did I have fun with the media?" he said. "Yes. When it was all over, did I regret it? Yes. I'm not good at being coy."
When asked recently on national television whether he planned to run, Mr. Cuomo answered: "What's more important than who runs is, am I right about the economy? Am I right about education?" If he is not good at being coy, he is still practicing.

As Documentaries Soared, Newscasters Went on Ego Trips

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Thanks to Ken Burns and company, choosing the year's best documentary presents no headaches. "The Civil War" made a powerful narrative out of the evocative photographs and moving words of the men and women, famous and obscure, who played a part in the nation's epic conflict. In addition to serving as an absorbing course in American history and a tribute to those who bore the pain and achieved the glory, these 11 hours, which attracted a record number of viewers for a PBS limited series, are a landmark of American television.
 Although "The Civil War" was special, public broadcasting came through with many other first-rate documentaries. Several, most notably the eight-part series "Eyes on the Prize II," focused on black Americans. This strong sequel by Henry Hampton to his memorable 1987 series, relied on newsreels to carry forward the eventful history from the ascendance of Malcolm X in the mid-1960's up to 1980, when race relations seemed less explosive yet still unsettled and unsettling. 
Two other solid documentaries looked at race relations from a fresh perspective. "Politics: The New Black Power" was a sophisticated account by Juan Williams, a Washington Post reporter, of the phenomenon of the "crossover politician" -- black officials, like Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Ron Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who are making it in the political mainstream. Mr. Williams suggested that whatever hope there is for greater black participation in American politics can be found in the careers of these successful politicians rather than in those of more sectarian figures.
 Another unorthodox approach to black-white relations came from Shelby Steele, a professor of English at San Jose State University, who reflected on issues growing out of the killing in Brooklyn of 16-year-old Yusuf K. Hawkins by a gang of young white men. In "Seven Days in Bensonhurst," Mr. Steele concluded that racial provocateurs like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who exploit such events, may be obscuring changes in white attitudes and misdirecting energies needed by blacks for economic development.
 In quite a different spirit, " 'Amazing Grace' With Bill Moyers" found the busy journalist on a search for the origins and the appeal of the hymn, written by a reformed 18th-century English slave-trader, that has found so abiding a place in America's gospel tradition, white as well as black.
 The public stations also had their share of less impressive documentaries. The year's superdud was "Race to Save the Planet," 10 hours' worth of worthiness about the efforts of nations around the globe to save mankind from self-destruction. For all the programs' good intentions, much of the material seemed recycled, and the overall effect may have been to send people rushing out of their living rooms to chop down trees in preference to grinding their teeth.
 Over on the commercial stations, the most stirring news specials were inspired by the freeing of Nelson Mandela after many years in South Africa's prisons. All the networks were there, and it was emotion-rich television, with a world-class hero at its center. It cannot be said that the networks' analysis of the ramifications of Mr. Mandela's release or their treatment of South African politics in the months since have matched those early hours. But television news is generally better at capturing the moment than explicating its significance.
 For viewers with the time, C-Span's unabridged attention to the Senate Ethics Committee hearings into the relations of five United States senators with Charles Keating, of savings-and-loan infamy, offered an instructive if sometimes dispiriting look at the marriage of politics and money. With its straightforward coverage of the workings of Congress and other institutions through the year, C-Span reinforced its special niche among the cable channels.
 Several big news names basked in their celebrity this year, while others tried out new ventures, with mixed results. "The Best of Nightline With Ted Koppel, 1980 to 1990" was an engaging review of the ABC program that began with the taking of American hostages in Iran and continues to deliver nightly vitamin supplements to the once-over-fast helpings of network news.
 Again this year, ABC News gave time, via Mr. Koppel and Peter Jennings, to important stories, including the abortion issue, America's role in supporting the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and the political commotions in Eastern Europe.
 Among the more worthless documentaries of 1990, on the other hand, was NBC's "New Hollywood," Tom Brokaw's report on nothing new. Dan Rather of CBS News was particularly busy racing around the Middle East in search of stories, which he occasionally found.
 Another self-tribute, "Mike Wallace, Then and Now," offered evidence of the place that the CBS veteran has won in the hearts of his fans. Some of the excerpts misguidedly tried to show Mr. Wallace in a soft light, but the fun of the hour lay in examples of his performances as Mean Mike, the Scourge of the Tube. The most resounding quote of the hour came from Richard Nixon as he was taking office in 1968: "I hope to restore respect to the Presidency."
 A less successful exercise in self-celebration came this month, on PBS, in the form of "15 Years of MacNeil/Lehrer." It featured puffy comments by biggies of the tube like Walter Cronkite, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley and Mr. Jennings. Why the estimable Mr. MacNeil and Mr. Lehrer should have sat still for a public ego massage is perplexing. It was the latest display of the embarrassing lengths to which public broadcasting is driven in its endless quest for viewer contributions.
 Among the most-publicized events of the television year were the appearances of three network glamourpusses, Ms. Pauley, Connie Chung and Maria Shriver, in new formats that can be collectively thought of as the "With" shows.
 The premiere hour of "Real Life With Jane Pauley," which began with a report on America's young parents working harder than ever, was a lightly handled mix of once-over-easy sociology, mild reporting and just fooling around. Nothing particularly important, but unpretentious and unpatronizing, in the Pauley manner.
 "Face to Face With Connie Chung" led off with an interview with Gene Wilder, who had lost his wife, the comedian Gilda Radner, to cancer. "You miss her, or she's with you anyway?" Ms. Chung had the face to inquire.
 "Cutting Edge With Maria Shriver" had pretty Ms. Shriver rushing around interviewing several near-celebrities, with camera equipment often on camera. The tricky production and slightly offbeat guests could not conceal the conventionality of spirit. "So many of your songs do express pain and loss," Ms. Shriver informed the pop singer Sinead O'Connor and then asked, "Is it painful for you to write it?" Probably not as painful as hearing that sort of question.
 With "The Civil War" on one end and show-biz style specials on the other, television once again showed its range and its potential, for better and, all too commonly, for worse.

HEADLINE: Focus: Cleveland;
Bucking the Trend on Shopping Malls

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL

 BODY:
WHEN banks in Cleveland were approached in 1986 to invest in redeveloping 34 downtown acres into an ambitious mix of shopping, restaurants, offices and a hotel, they reacted cautiously.
As in most cities, suburban shopping mall development had for several decades drawn business out of the city's center, and attracting new retailers and bringing shoppers back to downtown was clearly going against the tide. Yet the downtown project was attractive to bankers because they were already heavily invested in this city's turnaround. 
 Crowned by the landmark 52-story Terminal Tower -- since the 30's a prominent office building atop the central transit station -- the redevelopment was seen as crucial to revitalizing a much-beleaguered city center. Its site spans several blocks between the Cuyahoga River and Public Square.
 Ameritrust was the first of several local banks -- Society Corporation, Bank One, Huntington National Bank and National City Bank -- that, along with the Chase Manhattan Bank, invested a total of $59 million in the $400 million project.
 Now, just nine months after opening, Tower City Centre's 380,000 square feet of retail space is 98 percent leased to such stores as Brooks Brothers, Bally of Switzerland, the Gap and Gap Kids, some of them new to the city. According to Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, the owner and developer, the leasing pace is three years ahead of projections. And despite gloomy national retail forecasts, individual stores report that sales for the center's first Christmas season are better than expected.
 But any further expansion of the project has been postponed indefinitely, including an agreement from Neiman-Marcus to build a 120,000-square-foot anchor store that was to have opened in 1992. The original development plan called for three additional anchor stores.
In fact, Forest City's development plans nationwide have come to a near halt. "Very few transactions are taking place," said Albert B. Ratner, president and chief executive officer of Forest City. "It's a flaky market."
 After more than three decades of almost frenzied building of shopping malls, the financial hurdles are higher for getting any project off the ground. Besides an ever-shrinking supply of attractive markets without malls, a stagnating retail industry plagued by takeovers and liquidations has lenders less willing to finance projects without stable anchors firmly in place. Blaming tougher regulators and examiners, lenders are also demanding that developers finance as much as 25 percent of their projects.
 "There's a simple reason," said John Jardine, vice president and managing partner at Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of New York, a heavy investor in malls. "The banking, pension and insurance industries are all less liquid than they were 18, 24 months ago. As a result, everyone is slowing down."
 The change of heart has hit developers nationwide. In a survey released in August by the International Council of Shopping Centers, the industry trade group based in New York, 43 percent of developers said credit became tougher to come by in mid-1990. Forty percent said their most recent loan application had been turned down.
 "We never could have done this project, in fact most of what we have today in our portfolio we couldn't finance in this climate," Mr. Ratner said.
 As a result, shopping center construction has plummeted. The number of construction contracts awarded nationwide in the third quarter of 1990 was 41.4 percent lower than in the same period a year ago. The Midwest saw a drop of 45 percent, faring better than only the Northeast, where starts dropped 53.9 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. The South saw a 37.2 percent decline in construction, the West, 30.5 percent.
Ohio has managed to hold onto its rank as third behind Florida and California in the number of new centers under construction. Yet if the trend continues, the decline nationwide will represent the lowest number of new project starts since 1982, the council said..
 "We're looking at a turmoil in retailing, in particular affecting the larger department stores, and a credit crunch choking the developers," said Isaac Legnado, director of research at the shopping center council. "In normal circumstances one or the other would be serious enough."
In the late 50's and early 60's, as the nation moved to the suburbs, where land was plentiful, mall speculation was a sure thing. Twenty years ago, most urban areas were ripe for a regional mall of 400,000 square feet or more in an affluent suburb. Today there are often five or six regional malls in the same metropolitan area.
AS rising land prices accompanied the shrinking availability of the 60- to 90-acre tracts needed for such regional centers, the popularity of smaller, less-expensive, unenclosed strip centers grew. Strip centers, typically smaller than 100,000 square feet and anchored by such convenience stores as groceries and discount druggists, represent 63 percent of the country's 36,650 shopping malls.
 The retail industry's upheaval has also taken its toll on centers already in place. The 1.5-million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati celebrated a gala opening in 1989 and this year lost three of its six anchors -- Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and Parisian. In November the principal lender, the Bank of Nova Scotia, moved to foreclose on the entire development.
 Despite such highly visible difficulties, developers deny there is widespread vacancy. The average vacancy rate for shopping centers of all sizes nationwide was 10.6 percent in 1989, nearly unchanged from 10.5 percent in 1988, according to the shopping center council. The vacancy rate for strip centers was 12.3 percent in 1989 -- double the rate for larger malls.
 Smaller developments and smaller developers are being hit hardest. The council survey found that developers who own less than a million square feet are less likely to have their loan applications approved.
 "There is no question, a lot of strip centers -- and malls for that matter -- should not have been built," said Irving Maizlish, chairman of Leo Eisenberg & Company of Kansas City, Mo., a strip center developer.
 While the current squeeze is being felt throughout the shopping mall industry, it may translate into fewer, better-marketed centers. And for those projects, it seems, money is available.
"WE'RE always interested in a good deal, one with a superior land position and good connections to department stores," said Mr. Jardine of the Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association. "Regional shopping malls continue to be a preferred investment, much superior to offices or hotels."
 For his part, Mr. Maizlish of Eisenberg & Company reported that development would be off 15 to 20 percent in 1991 from the typical rate of 20 centers a year he kept up through the 1980's. To raise cash, he will continue to sell completed centers to private investors.
"We're continuing to go on building with blinders on," he said, "just not as many as last year."
 Forest City expects the slowdown in development of new centers to continue for at least a year, Mr. Ratner said, so its focus will be on renovating existing centers to make them more attractive to shoppers and prospective tenants.

HEADLINE: Does Community Policing Work?;
Efficient, Cooperative

BYLINE: By Herman Goldstein; Herman Goldstein, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin, is author of "Problem-Oriented Policing."

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
If New York and other cities want to succeed in aggressive campaigns to reclaim the streets for all citizens, they must make the most of a relatively new idea: community policing. This concept, also known as neighborhood policing, empowers the police to do more than just make arrests.
Officers are permanently assigned to one neighborhood so they can get to know the people living and working in it. They tackle problems once deemed unimportant: noise complaints, trespassing, teen-agers' hullabaloo. The public is given easy access to them through storefront stations and officers' telephone numbers at work, not the impersonal and frequently busy 911. 
 Community policing, which is expensive, cannot replace traditional investigations into such violent crimes as homicide, armed robbery and sexual assault. But by emphasizing crime prevention, it can improve a neighborhood's quality of life, an urgent issue in America's cities.
New York's 1,457-member Community Patrol Officer Program (called CPOP), which such evaluators as New York's Vera Institute of Justice considers promising, is staffed by special units. In other cities, the entire force does community policing.
Some programs are ambitious and far-reaching. Others are narrow and superficial. They are little more than public-relations efforts such as police athletic leagues and foot patrols intended to evoke nostalgic recollections of the friendly cop on the beat. These shallow efforts threaten the movement's credibility.
In the most advanced neighborhood programs, the police systematically identify and analyze particular crimes such as theft from cars and robbery of the elderly, and develop tailored responses. This fine-tuning approach, specifically labeled problem-oriented policing, is best exemplified by New York City; Baltimore County, Md.; San Diego, Calif.; Tulsa, Okla.; Newport News, Va., and Edmonton, Alberta.
The CPOP program began in June 1984, and within about a year it began making its mark: Vincent Esposito, a CPOP officer assigned to the 72d Precinct in Brooklyn, N.Y., foiled drug dealing in Rainbow Park, on Sixth Avenue. First, he arrested drug dealers, but that time-consuming process hardly stopped the traffic. After gaining the trust of elderly residents in neighboring apartment houses, he got them to telephone him confidentially and tell him where dealers were stashing drugs. He entered the park, ignored the dealers and seized the drugs. The dealers, suffering heavy losses, soon gave up and went away, and the park was restored to young mothers and elderly residents of the neighborhood.
Baltimore County's COPE (Citizen Oriented Police Enforcement) unit, begun in 1981, has reduced crime and repeated calls for police assistance and residents' fear in apartment complexes beset by burglaries, drug-dealing, vandalism, petty theft and conflicts among residents. It has done so by working with management to make repairs, improve lighting, modify areas where intruders could hide, and improve the appearance of buildings. It has organized tenants, mediated disputes between tenants and between tenants and management and made sure both sides honor leases. It has involved the fire, building inspection, zoning and health departments, and has connected residents with social services.
The police traditionally deal with the public the way many parents treat their children. Armed with authority, they have cultivated an omnipotent air, hoping the threat of arrest and punishment would keep things under control. Their bluff has been called. In many inner cities, they cannot control violence, curb disorder and reduce fear simply by a show of authority and the implicit threats that go with it.
Yet, large segments of the public have not yet acknowledged these limitations. They prefer old-fashioned approaches: a greater police presence, more arrests, more prosecutions -- even though investing more and more resources in such methods does not reduce street crime and violence. This is wasteful. It ignores everything learned about the complexity of policing in recent decades, and caters to the notion that more officers mean less crime. That sounds good, but it's not necessarily so.
Community policing discards the assumption that only criminal-law enforcement defines the police's social role and priorities. It recognizes that officers face an incredible range of knotty problems and that the law is but one means for engaging them.
Today, there are not enough officers to protect the public properly. Consider New York's Police Department, staffed by 26,992 officers of all ranks. Allow for days off, vacations, sick leave, court appearances, administrative support and supervision, and important special assignments such as investigative and organized-crime units. Apportion the remaining officers to cover the three daily shifts. Spread that number on the streets of five boroughs.
No more than 3,000 officers are on patrol on any shift to protect the lives and property of 7.5 million residents of widely varied cultural, educational and economic backgrounds in a volatile city. Would adding 2,000, 4,000, 6,000 officers dramatically reduce the crisis of the streets? I doubt it.
Besides being spread so thin, the police are preoccupied with responding to 911 calls, not all of which merit their attention. While foot and motorized patrols may reduce fear, researchers question whether they significantly reduce street crime.
Generally, officers lack legal authority to deal with many offensive street situations: harassment by panhandlers, disorderly behavior by the homeless. When they have proper authority, they must depend on the criminal justice system to enforce it. However, the overwhelmed courts can handle only the most serious offenders. Thus, traditional policing makes no sense in certain situations.
When officers arrange for the quick removal of abandoned cars and the speedy demolition or repair of abandoned buildings -- "quality of life" issues that can affect self-respect and crime rates -- they are not doing "soft social work," as critics charge.
Such community policing can succeed only by cultivating a neighborhood's respect and trust -- a tall order given the tensions between the police and certain ethnic groups. Alone, it cannot overcome such endemic problems as racial tensions. It is, at best, a holding operation to keep the peace until national social forces and political will address the underlying problems.

A New Center For Downtown

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

 BODY:
A $60 MILLION waterfront convention center on which construction is to start early next year is being hailed by city officials and business leaders as the key to downtown revitalization.
This city of 200,000 people, situated at the head of Mobile Bay 31 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, is Alabama's major port and the state's largest metropolitan area. But the downtown is a classic example of the decay of inner cities, in part because of retail flight to suburban malls, said Wilbert Wetzel, manager of the city's Office of Community Services. 
 "Lack of retailing means a lack of pedestrians, and the reversal of that process begins with putting people back on the street," he said.
City officials hope the convention center will do that by attracting hotels, retail shops, restaurants and entertainment establishments.
Albert R. St. Clair, executive director of the newly formed Mobile Downtown Redevelopment Commission, said the city is working with Charles K. Brelant Jr., who bought the 200-room Sheraton Hotel four blocks from the convention-center site, on finding funds to restore the building. The hotel closed in 1983.
The city is also negotiating a lease of its vacant, 68,000-square-foot Kress Building a block from center's site with Jerry Valent of Miami and James Van Antwerp of Mobile. Initially, they plan to spend $5 million to convert half the space for lease to upscale shops and specialty restaurants.
Mr. St. Clair said several people are also interested in developing the 11-acre C. S. X. railroad yards across from the convention center site into a riverwalk with shops and restaurants. The railroad is asking $9 million.
The 317,000-square-foot convention center will be built on a four-acre site along the Mobile River that the city bought from the state in 1987 for $2.85 million. The three-story building, topped with a lighthouse-style tower and featuring outdoor terraces and landscaped river walks, was designed by the Architects Group of Mobile and Thompson, Zentulett and Stanback of Atlanta. It is to have a 286-car underground parking garage and to be connected to the existing 376-room Stouffer's Riverview Plaza Hotel and a proposed 400-room hotel by elevated walkways. Completion is set for the fall of 1992.
The project is being financed by a $48.6 million bond issue to be paid off with revenues from the city's 2 percent hotel and restaurant tax and a 2 percent sales tax on all prepared food items.

Innovative Creations in a Hotel Setting

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH 1990's economic indicators pointed downward, the news for Long Island restaurantgoers was not all bad. Hard times have spawned two positives. Some luxury restaurants have lowered their prices, and a handful of Manhattan's star chefs have, of necessity, made the trek to the Island.
The Garden City Hotel has enticed one of them, Ali Barker, who earned his stripes at the Union Square Cafe and 150 Wooster in New York City. He has been dishing up his innovative creations at the Polo Grill since September. 
 Unfortunately, the trend toward lower prices is not part of the new regime. Entrees are competitively priced at $16 to $25, but other courses make the tab soar. Most appetizers are $8 to $11; mixed drinks, $6; glasses of wine, $5 to $7.50, and special desserts, $7.50.
The new chef and menu are not the only changes at the Polo Grill. This lobby dining room now has a wraparound cozy feeling. It is still possible to see the passing parade of hotel guests and hear the piano music from the adjoining bar, but tapestry banquettes, brass railings, wood paneling and etched glass contain and define the room.
The service staff is abundant and attentive, with a few inconsistent lapses. One evening, the extraordinary service included fresh napkins after the entrees. On another, water was by request, and then served only to the person asking for it.
Yet, the staff and decor are mere acolytes to the exciting new menu at the Polo Grill. It features many of Mr. Barker's signature dishes: a heartwarming appetizer of "risotto" of barley and sausage with a roasted red-and-yellow-pepper fillip, entrees of duck breast topped with both green olives and slices of roasted garlic and Tuna Diane, a takeoff on the Cognac, mustard and green-peppercorn sauce that usually adorns Steak Diane.
But execution of these exciting dishes sometimes falls short. The tuna was dreadfully overcooked and dry. So, too, was a grilled salmon steak charred to the point of tasting acrid.
Diners who ordered those fish were understandably more taken with their vegetable accompaniments, wisps of deep-fried zucchini with the tuna and a warm compote of cannelini and pinto beans beneath the salmon. Soothing mashed turnips topped with shallot crisps also outclassed the menu's very ordinary shell steak.
Main courses rating hurrahs for both concept and delivery are the juicy roast chicken under its mountain of thinly cut French fries, the delicate red snapper kissed with red wine and contrasted with crisp minicubes of potato, flaky sea bass on a fresh-tasting, almost-crunchy, ratatouille and an evening special that our table nicknamed "Turkey in the Straw." Turkey breast scaloppine glossed with a shallot ginger sauce was buried beneath a thatch of crisply fried vegetables.
Creamy leek soup spiked with white port and complemented by Roquefort croutons and crackly fried leeks is the one to order. Black-bean soup and corn chowder are routine alternatives.
Hardy pastas like homemade fettuccine bathed in a lusty lamb ragout and tricolored fettuccini perky with bacon, white wine and cream are also fine openers. Thumbs up, too, for the lobster-fennel ravioli and the roasted oysters mated with fried parsnip chips. In spite of a lemon-pepper aioli that shares honors with the usual red sauce, the shrimp cocktail ($11) is pedestrian.
All salads shine, but the leader is the spinach, with its warm brown-sugar-and-bacon dressing.
Except for a silken creme brulee with crackly crust, desserts are routine. The raspberry mousse cake was rubbery, and the chocolate mousse cake and fruit tart was run-of-the-mill.
The prestigious 200-choice wine list mirrors the restaurant itself. It is well thought out and intelligently selected with occasional surprises. Opus One (1987), the magnificent Mondavi-Rothschild collaboration that sells for as much as $60 a bottle retail, is priced at $90, less than the standard 100 percent markup. But a 1988 Antinori Orvietto that is $9 at many stores costs $25 at the Polo Grill. Steer toward the Seppelt Australian chardonnay for $25, one of the most modestly priced chardonnays here and one of the most outstanding.

HEADLINE: Securities From Abroad

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Americans bought a net $810 million of foreign stocks in the third quarter, down sharply from the $2.4 billion they bought a year earlier, the Securities Industry Association said last week.
The figure was also down sharply from the second quarter, when American investors bought a net $6 billion in foreign stocks. Net purchases of foreign stocks were near record highs for the first nine months of the year.
 "U.S. investors have faith in foreign equity markets despite the precariousness of the world's political and economic situation," said David Storin, the association's director of international finance.
The trade group's Foreign Activity Report said purchases for the first nine months totaled $7.3 billion, second only to the record $9.4 billion in the 1989 period.
Foreign investors sold a net $1.3 billion of American stocks in August and more than $2.5 billion worth in September, the report said.
For the third quarter, net sales by foreigners of American stocks totaled $2.4 billion, compared with net sales of $3.8 billion in the second quarter and net purchases of $5.8 billion in the third quarter of 1989.
American investors bought a net $665 million of foreign bonds in the third quarter, down from $5.7 billion in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Barometer's 8-Year Low

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The Chicagoland Business barometer, a measure of economic conditions in the industrial center of the Midwest, has fallen to its lowest level in eight years, the Association of Purchasing Management of Chicago said on Friday.
The group said its monthly index fell to an unadjusted 41 percent in December, from 45.1 percent in November. A reading below 50 percent signals a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, while a level above 50 percent suggests expansion.
The index reflects conditions in 200 industrial businesses in northern Illinois and northwest Indiana.
The overall index "appears to indicate a recession is upon us," the Chicago association said.
The National Association of Purchasing Management does not use data from the Chicago report for its monthly survey, which will next be released on Jan. 2, but conducts its own research.
None of the five components that make up the Chicagoland business barometer were at or above 50 percent in November.
Production rates fell to 44 percent in December from 48 percent last month. New orders, to which the association gives the most weight, fell to 40 percent from 44 percent.
The report showed order backlogs had declined to 35 percent, from 38 percent in November, and employment had slid to 40 percent, from 43 percent. Supplier deliveries, which used to be called vendor performance, fell to 45 percent, from 50 percent in November.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Primary Dealers' Profits Reportedly High in '90

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
One bright spot in the gloom that has hung over Wall Street for much of this year was the financial performance of the 41 primary dealers of Government securities.
A number of people at these firms say that the trading profits of primary dealers for 1990 were the highest since 1986, a time when financial firms of all stripes seemed to be printing money. 
 The financial condition of the primary dealers is monitored on a daily basis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But the New York Fed, which also has the responsibility of awarding primary dealership status to firms that seek the designation, allows the public a glimpse only once a year at how the dealers are doing . Even then, the information covers just the first eight months. The firms that are designated as primary dealers by the New York Fed make markets in Government securities. In addition, the Fed conducts its open market operations exclusively through those firms.
 
Released Each November
 The figures are released each November at the annual meeting of the Public Securities Association, an industry group.
The New York Fed said at that time that the combined profit of the primary dealers was $600 million through August. A steady decline in interest rates since then has helped to raise profits further, because the direction of interest rates has been obvious, and market participants were saying late last week that profits for all of 1990 probably amounted to $800 million or more.
In contrast, the New York Fed said primary dealers posted a small loss in the comparable period of 1989, while in 1988 aggregate profits amounted to $300 million.
The New York Fed declined to comment further on 1990 earnings or on industry speculation about profits.
 
Plagued by Overcapacity
 The rebound in the earnings of primary dealers has been hard-won. As with much of Wall Street, as the 1980's drew to a close primary dealers were plagued by overcapacity. Too many firms were chasing the limited amount of business, and profit margins became razor thin.
A shakeout, which began in 1989, continued this year. Five firms gave up their dealerships in 1990, while two, Deutsche Bank and SBC Government Securities Inc., a subsidiary of the Swiss Bank Corporation, were added to the list. Some people in the industry expect that the number of primary dealers will shrink, within the next year or so, from 41 to the mid-30's.
Almost certainly, not all of the firms that remain primary dealers made money in 1990. "I would bet that a large number were either in the red or broke even, at best," said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm that has a number of primary dealers as clients. "Maybe a dozen firms accounted for all of the profits; 1990 was a respectable year, but the last three years were miserable."
Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer, said that "assuming that most dealers were profitable in the last four months, we can say that 1990 was a better year than any of the past four." He continued, "This business has been in a recession since 1986, but in my judgment there is light at the end of this tunnel."
 
Aided by Correct Bets
 Mr. Kelly added that the contraction in the business in the last few years had slightly widened profit margins on trades. In addition, dealers were helped by their correct bets in August and September, when the markets were roiled by rising oil prices and fear of war in the Middle East. Finally, he said, with fewer players in the business the prospects for making money at a Treasury auction had increased.
"In past years, competition among dealers was so intense that bidding in the auction process was a losing proposition, even though it was something you had to do," he said. "In 1990, as the competition became somewhat less intense, dealers had greater success in underwriting Treasury securities."
A trader in Government bonds at a primary dealer firm, who insisted that he not be identified, said, "This year it seemed like 9 out of 10 times you made money when you bought securities at the auctions."
 
Focus on Other Matters
 Aside from celebrating the holidays, shoring up the bottom line has been the main focus for dealers in the last two weeks. But now, with the books on 1990 all but shut, the focus will shift to other matters.
The first reports on how the economy fared in December will be the object of much attention this week. Analysts said the data, especially a report expected Friday on employment conditions in December, will probably be very weak, rekindling thoughts among market participants that the Fed will again lower the Federal funds rate from its current target level of 7 percent.
"Barring a seasonal fluke, the December employment report should be substantially a replay of the prior month's debacle," Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly "Comments on Credit."
 
Further Easing in Rates Seen
 "The broad-based slowing in business spending and consumer outlays, together with the deterioration in direct measures of the labor market, points to further easing in the funds rate to at least 6.75 percent soon after Friday's report," he said.
Salomon analysts are forecasting that nonfarm employment probably fell by an additional 200,000 jobs in December, after a drop of 267,000 reported in November. A contraction of that size would raise the unemployment rate, which last month stood at 5.9 percent, to 6.1 percent.
"We think that by Friday the market will take a different attitude with respect to the Fed," Mr. Santow said. "After the employment data we think the market will be absolutely convinced the Fed will ease by the second week in January."

The Long Wait For the PC Payoff

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE personal computer, so ubiquitous in the United States, is one of those historic breakthrough technologies that should be revamping the lives of millions of Americans and making them wealthier. But so far, the great payoff has not materialized and, if history is a guide, which it usually is, the payoff will probably not appear until the 21st century.
It is inconvenient that this vigorous young technology is not offering much help in reversing the economy's current decline. Yet it is in good company. The railroad, the electric motor and the car were similarly anemic when they were in their youths. Ingrained national habits had to change before they generated economic growth, and in each case that took a generation or more to achieve. The personal computer is still in its first decade as a widely used technology. 
 "It is not so strange that these desktop computers and the tiny chips that make them run have not led right away to greater productivity and economic growth," said Paul A. David, an historian in economics at Stanford University. The reassurance is important. The personal computer is not the only new technology likely to make the economy grow, but it is the most promising. Biotechnology might vastly increase food production. Trains that run on a bed of air undoubtedly will travel three or four times as fast as those that run on rails. And "hypersonic" aircraft, now being developed, will someday fly travelers from New York to Tokyo in two hours.
But in the opinion of economists, none of these inventions seems to match the potential of personal computers to expand the economy and also to reorganize it. Electricity, or more precisely the electric motor, eventually realized a similar potential. But first it was an obstacle to economic growth, Mr. David notes. For example, manufacturing productivity -- that is, the output of a factory with a given number of workers -- actually declined in the early 20th century. For more than two decades, electric power was a hindrance to production rather than the great accelerator that it finally became in the 1920's.
By then electric power had reorganized the manufacturing process. It meant that each machine in a factory could have its own motor. Until then, machines were driven by belts or chains connected to a single power source for the entire factory -- a big steam engine or a water mill that made the network of belts rotate.
With the advent of the motor and of utilities that furnished inexpensive electricity, factories no longer had to be compact, multi-storied structures that kept each machine near the central power source. In time they became the long, one-story buildings common today, with the machines arranged to make possible the modern assembly line and much more rapid production.
But in the interim, from the 1890's to the 1920's, managers and workers had to operate the old system while learning and installing the new one. That was time consuming, and it slowed production. Something similar is beginning to happen with desktop computers and the corporate office.Although computers are commonplace, the office is still organized around memos and paper work, secretaries and clerks, and paper filed in metal cabinets. The corporate office in 2010, if the personal computer reaches its full potential, will no longer have paper or be housed in a single building. It can be spread across a city or a nation, if that makes workers more efficient.
The office, in effect, will become a series of computers connected by a fiber-optic network -- a network that carries information, images and voices at speeds many times faster and in much greater quantities than today's copper telephone lines.
The information on 900 paper pages, for instance, can go from one personal computer screen to another in less than a minute, and "tele-conferencing" will become standard practice, with people seeing and talking to each other as if they were around the same table.
But productivity is dragged down until the old system is phased out and the new one fully absorbed. "It doesn't make for greater output to have expensive computers everywhere and executives who still dictate letters to secretaries taking shorthand," said Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Perhaps most important, the fiber-optic network still has to be installed. Only the beginnings are in place. And here, too, there are parallels with the past. Just as private companies installed electric power lines early in the century, telephone companies are stringing fiber-optic cable today. Just as the Government set electric power rates, it will probably have to set rules or priorities for the fiber-optic network.
Some hold that the Government's role is to stand aside, letting the telephone companies install the network and operate it as they please. Others favor Federal subsidies to speed up the installation of a network, which could cost $200 billion, and Federal rules governing its use.
So far, the Bush Administration has not produced a policy. "It is not clear what Government imprimatur is needed," said Robert E. Kahn, president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives. "But some guidance is necessary."

'89 Stock Winners Still on Top in '90

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
If 1990 was a year when it was best not to own stocks, it was also a year when those who did own them were well advised to stay with the winners of 1989.
The old reliable consumer growth stocks, the ones that make products everyone buys, again led the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, as they did in 1989. Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Philip Morris were the top three stocks in 1990, as they were the year before. 
 The Dow is by far the best-known stock market average in America, but its inadequacy as a market measure is limited by its very nature: 30 large companies in a market that includes thousands. This year, that unrepresentative nature led to a picture of a market that was much kinder and gentler to investors than the reality.
Through Friday, the Dow was off just 4.5 percent for 1990, and 11 of the 30 stocks showed gains for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500, a more broadly based index of large stocks, was down 7 percent. And the Russell 2,000, which measures the small stocks ignored by larger indexes, fell 22.5 percent. All the figures include price performance only, ignoring dividends.
Within the Dow, the idea of going with a winner and avoiding losers was well illustrated. In 1989, a fine year for stocks, seven Dow stocks went down. Of those, five went down further in 1990. The worst performer in 1989, Navistar, improved its relative performance only a bit this year. It was next to last. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, the fourth-worst performer in 1989, moved into last place this year, with a stunning 56 percent drop.
The biggest turnaround on the up side this year came from International Business Machines, the company with the largest market capitalization in America and, in recent years, one of the more disappointing. It rose 20.5 percent, giving Big Blue shareholders their best year since 1985.
I.B.M. benefited from the successful introduction of its next generation of mainframes, as well as from the perception that its efforts to cut costs were finally paying off. And, after years of under-performance -- this was the first year since 1984 that I.B.M. shares outpaced the Dow average -- expectations may finally have been brought down to a level that was excessively pessimistic.
Over the years, one strategy of playing the Dow that has worked more often than not has been to buy the stocks least popular with investors, assuming that unloved stocks may grow to be worth more than expected.
Michael O'Higgins, an Albany investment manager and author of "Beating the Dow," to be published this week by HarperCollins, has developed a strategy of buying the 10 Dow stocks with the highest indicated yields at the end of each year, and holding them for a year. That assumes that the stocks with high yields have been driven to low prices by negative expectations in the market, and that at least some of those expectations will turn out to be unreasonable.
This year, the strategy was not a particularly great performer, with the 10 highest-yielding stocks of a year ago showing an average decline of 7.8 percent, before dividends, compared with a loss for the Dow of 4.5 percent. Including dividends, Mr. O'Higgins estimates, the 10 stocks had an average loss of 2.7 percent, while the Dow fell less than 1 percent.
The figure was pulled down by poor performances from Sears, Roebuck; Union Carbide; Allied-Signal, and General Motors, but helped by I.B.M. and a strong contingent of oil stocks that benefited from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Those included Texaco, Exxon and Chevron. The other stocks among the 10 were Du Pont and Eastman Kodak.
 
Gain of 1,511 Percent
 Even with that poor performance, Mr. O'Higgins calculates that an investor who followed the strategy for the last 18 years would have a cumulative gain of 1,511 percent, compared with a rise of 495 percent in the Dow itself, having outperformed the Dow in 12 of the years.
The portfolio of high yielders for next year is led by Goodyear, which now has an indicated yield of 9.6 percent, based on a $1.80 annual dividend. There is more than a little doubt on Wall Street that Goodyear, burdened by debt from a corporate overhaul, will be able to pay the dividend if the recession continues, but so far it has not cut it.
The other stocks with high dividends as 1990 ends are General Motors, Sears, Allied-Signal, Texaco, Union Carbide, Exxon, Westinghouse Electric, Eastman Kodak and USX.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Time Warner's Merger Payoff

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
When communications companies merged with wild abandon in the 1980's, executives attributed much of their enthusiasm for the combinations to an untested phenomenon called synergy.
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation could now offer advertisers space in TV Guide packaged with time on the Fox television network, so the theory went. Capital Cities/ABC could promote ABC's soap operas in a special magazine from its publishing division. By vaulting the boundaries separating print, film, television and records, these new giants could make one plus one equal three. 
 A year after the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications created the world's largest communications company, Time Warner Inc. is finding that the combination adds up to a lot less than three, but something more than two.
 
Small and Unusual Payoffs
 Profits from such synergies are hard to pinpoint. The major projects held out by the company as examples could have been accomplished by either Time or Warner alone.
Yet the merger appears to be paying off in numerous small and unusual projects that, while not providing large returns for the company, could help Time Warner with its $10.7 billion merger debt.
Since the merger, Time has packaged ads for its newest magazine in Warner videotapes; Warner's Looney Tunes cartoon characters are appearing in books published by Time, and Time has tapped its customer data base to promote Warner's movies by mail.
But the deal the company has heralded as the best example of combined strength consists of a gallon of Time but only a pinch of Warner. Last month, Time Warner announced a marketing arrangement with the Chrysler Corporation that involved advertising and promotions using the media company's magazines, movies, books and direct-marketing capabilities. Executives said the deal exemplified what Time Warner's 1989 annual report called "a synthesis that would lift us to a position neither could achieve alone."
 
Sole Sponsor of Special Issues
 Yet the most innovative elements of the Chrysler package revolve around the Time Inc. magazines. Chrysler will be the sole sponsor of special issues of Fortune, People and Life, tied to the promotion's theme, "Rediscover America."
As part of the package, the automobile company will place advertising inserts in several Time Inc. magazines beginning in February, asking through personalized cards for readers' opinions on various issues. The tabulated responses will be distributed at the 1992 political conventions, and will also become part of a computer data base that Time Warner and Chrysler can use to develop advertisements aimed at particular types of people, said Michael D. Drexler, the worldwide media director of Bozell, Chrysler's ad agency.
Videotapes of Warner Brothers movies will be among the premiums offered to consumers responding to test-drive promotions, but other than that, Warner's involvement consists of several "maybes."
Warner may produce a "Rediscover America" television special and television spots featuring public figures discussing the readers' survey. Chrysler also has the right to buy product placements in a half-dozen Warner Brothers movies.
 
Greatest Marketing Obstacle
 Donald M. Elliman Jr., the executive vice president for marketing of the Time Inc. Magazine Company, attributed the lack of Warner elements in the Chrysler project to what may be the greatest obstacle facing marketing ventures involving the two sides of the merged company. Warner's records, movies and television production, he said, "have a little less applicability to advertising than do the old Time Inc. elements," especially the magazines.
This does not surprise media analysts, many of whom have been skeptical that communications companies could earn significant new revenues from cross-media projects.
"The truth is, the synergies, or economies of scale, usually take place at the very top of the company and from combining duplicated operations, rather than by forcing several different media to work together," said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates.
Still, with advertising growth at a virtual standstill, many communications executives say media companies must package their assets creatively simply to remain afloat.
One midlevel Time Warner executive, who insisted on not being identified, described the situation bluntly. "Marketing budgets for clients are static; that's a fact of life and it's directing the thinking of most media companies," he said. "We're saying that if a company normally spends $10 million on our magazines, let's get them to spend an additional $5 million on a bigger idea and force them to take that money from other media companies. We want to squeeze out our competitors."
 
Millions in Ad Revenues
 The Chrysler deal, for example, was reported by the advertising trade press to be worth $40 million to $50 million in ad revenues. Privately, some executives said the auto maker was increasing its spending at Time Warner by a third to a half over its normal expenditures. Time Warner and ad agency executives said similar deals were in the works but would not identify the advertisers.
The best examples of true cross-media ventures at Time Warner have been quite small. "The synergistic things happening between the two companies run from the monster level to the mundane, and the mundane things are the most cost-effective and efficient," said Sanford E. Reisenbach, the executive vice president of marketing and planning at Warner Brothers.
Warner Home Video included a subscription offer for Entertainment Weekly, Time's new magazine, in the videotape release of the film "Lethal Weapon 2," and the publishing division is enclosing promotions for Warner movies with its magazine subscription billings.
The greatest benefits from the merger have been realized through Time Warner Direct, which oversees the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club, as well as the television offers for parapsychology books and other ventures that sell by mail or telephone.
 
Promotion for 'Memphis Belle'
 Access to Time Warner's data base of 13 million direct-marketing customers enabled Warner Brothers to send tens of thousands of promotions for "Memphis Belle," a Warner film about the crew of a World War II bomber, to many of the 550,000 people who had bought war books or movies, Mr. Reisenbach said.
Warner has also been the source of numerous new products promoted by Time's direct-marketing operation, including a videotape series featuring such Warner Brothers properties as World War II movies, Clint Eastwood films and Looney Tunes cartoons, said Paul R. Stewart, the chairman of Time Life Entertainment.
The cartoon characters are also featured in a direct-mail book series for children, which another unit, Time Life for Children, started test-marketing two months ago.
"We'd never done cartoons in home video before, and it wouldn't have occurred to us if we hadn't gotten together with Warner and understood them," said Christopher T. Linen, the president and chief executive of Time Warner Direct.
 
Some Disappointments
 The effort to create cross-media ventures has not been without disappointments. One letdown has been "Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones," a biography of the musician-producer that was done as a film by Warner Brothers, a cassette tape and compact disk by Reprise Records and a book by Warner Books, all of which were produced by Courtney Sale Ross, the wife of Time Warner's co-chairman, Steven J. Ross. One analyst who insisted on anonymity estimated that the company spent $4.5 million producing the movie and $1 million advertising it, for a return of only $250,000 in film rentals.
Nonetheless, "the project has a value beyond the box office," said Aubrey Balkind, the president of Frankfurt, Gips, Balkind, the New York ad agency and design firm that created the book, did the film's titles and ads and produced a music video.
The benefit appears to have been only the opportunity to experiment, however expensively, at crossing corporate lines. The company's cable subsidiary offered time on several of its systems for advertising for "Listen Up." In turn, the cable companies were able to host premieres of the film on behalf of charities in Houston, Kansas City, Mo., and other cities. Executives said the events had public-relations value, particularly with local regulators who wield enormous control over cable franchises.
Time Warner executives say that they generally do not receive discounts when they buy products or advertising space and time from other divisions. Nonetheless, there are financial benefits from the internal deals. Because money is being spent inside the corporation, some divisions are authorized to spend more on promotions for other divisions' products, Mr. Linen said.
 
'The Jury Is Still Out'
 Many media experts remain cautious about the eventual profitability of such projects. "To some extent, the jury is still out," said Steven Rattner, a general partner and head of the media department at Lazard Freres & Company, the investment firm. "This is still a relatively new concept that has yet to be fully tested. Thus far, the impact on the bottom line is difficult to quantify."
Beyond the Chrysler deal, Time Warner executives are refusing to comment on how much revenue the company has gained from synergies in its first year. They concede the amount is small, but maintain that money comes second, after the new methodology.
"This today is not a mammoth part of Time Warner's profit picture," Mr. Elliman of the Time Inc. Magazine Company said. "So maybe the critics are right. But we are blurring lines, and this company was never run that way before."

Trade-Talk Role Seen For Ottawa

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Officials of the United States, Canada and Mexico say they are fast sweeping away obstacles to Canadian participation in the free-trade negotiations expected to open in 1991 between the United States and Mexico.
The three countries are expected to begin shaping a single agreement that would create a North American common market of 350 million people. "We're clearing away the underbrush and will start on the big trees very quickly," said Canada's Minister of International Trade, John C. Crosbie. 
 Since August the three countries have held a series of unpublicized high-level meetings, the latest just before Christmas, to try to work out the shape of the new negotiating table. They have announced nothing, but trade officials say they have set a deadline of Feb. 1 by which time they expect to reach agreement on the ground rules for a three-way deal.
 
Addition of Mexico Preferred
 Most American officials say they would prefer to bring Mexico into an agreement based on the accord that Canada and the United States signed two years ago, rather than negotiating a separate pact with Mexico.
Separate agreements with Canada and Mexico would mean two sets of rules, rights and obligations, complicating the tasks of exporters seeking markets in all three countries.
"If you look at it from a long-term perspective, we're going to be more regional," said a senior American trade official, who asked to remain anonymous. "So why not start being regional now? From the point of efficiency and use of resources, it makes a lot of sense."
 
'Studying the Modalities'
 Antonio Ocaranza, press attache at the Mexican Embassy here, said: "From the beginning we have been interested in liberalizing trade in the three countries, and our long-term goal is a North American free-trade area. But for the specifics of the present negotiations, we are still studying the modalities and the requirements that such modalities would entail."
The United States is also considering something similar in the "Enterprise for the Americas" program of prospective trade agreements with South American countries willing to cut their trade barriers.
The apparent collapse in early December of a four-year effort to liberalize and revamp world trade has added impetus to the North American discussions, which would give the three partners greater leverage in dealing with the 12-nation European Community and others.
The deadlock in the global trade talks, which centered on the European Community's refusal to cut sharply its farm subsidies as much as the United States, Canada and other food exporters wanted, is likely to generate more trade conflicts as well as regional trade groupings.
The goal in North America, trade officials say, is a common set of rules embracing the maximum number of common objectives.
The three-nation free-trade agreement would include such basics as duty-free and quota-free trade in goods, a common set of customs rules, nondiscrimination in trade in services and in the treatment of investors, protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property and procedures for the resolution of disputes. Most of the elements already exist in the Canadian-American agreement. Where they do not, the Canadian pact might be amended, trade officials say.
 
Complications Seen
 Yet some people worry that the three-way talks might delay freer trade between the United States and Mexico. "A three-way negotiation invariably would be more complicated, increasing the likelihood that already difficult negotiations would encounter additonal delays and complications," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Crosbie countered that "there isn't any reason for trilateral discussions to take any longer than bilateral ones."
One possibility, said Jeffrey J. Schott, a trade specialist at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy research group, is a two-track negotiation. The United States and Mexico would be left to decide tariff-cutting and other specific bilateral trade issues while the three Governments would work together on administrative and institutional provisions to insure a commonality with the existing United States-Canadian free-trade pact.
President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico announced that they would seek a free-trade pact only six months ago. In August, Canada's Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, said he wanted to explore the possibility of participating, suggesting that what Mexico and the United States decided would inevitably touch Canada.
Canadian labor organizations are worried, for example, that products made by cheap Mexican labor -- wages of less than $1 an hour -- would flood Canada through the United States. Wages in both countries average above $10 an hour. The wage differential is a touchy point also with American labor groups, which fear the impact of low-cost imports on such industries as textile, steel, cement and on fruit and vegetable growing in such states as Texas, Florida and California.
What Canada hopes to gain from freer trade with Mexico is similar to what excites American industry. Mexico is a market with more than 80 million people who are growing more prosperous under the stimulus of trade and economic changes.
Canada's trade with Mexico is still modest -- $2.5 billion of imports and exports -- but the volume has been growing by more than 10 percent annually since the mid-1980's and it expanded by 25 percent in 1989.
Canada and the United States are each other's largest customers, exchanging more than $150 billion of goods and services. The United States is Mexico's biggest export outlet. Mexico is the third-ranking customer of the United States after Canada and Japan. The annual two-way trade of Mexico and the United States amounts to more than $60 billion.
President Salinas has fixed on free trade with the United States as the centerpiece of his efforts to open up the Mexican economy, following cuts in tax rates, relaxed currency and other controls and the aggressive sale of state enterprises. He sees free trade as a spur to both investment and growth.
At a meeting in November in Monterrey, Mexico, Presidents Salinas and Bush envisaged conclusion of a pact by the end of 1992. Mr. Bush notifed Congress on Sept. 25 that he intended to begin the trade talks with Mexico.

World Markets Begin 1991 Pressed by Problems of 1990

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
World stock markets begin 1991 facing the threat of a war in the Persian Gulf, recessions or economic slowdowns around the world, and dismal earnings -- the same factors that drove stock markets down sharply in 1990. Yet many market watchers expect a better year than the one ending today.
In 1990, these pressures resulted in a worse year for stocks than even 1987, when stock markets crashed in October. 
 The Financial Times World index for 24 markets, excluding the United States, dropped 30.8 percent in local currency in 1990, compared with a 1.7 percent dip by the end of 1987. For American investors, the sharp drop in the dollar cut the 1990 decline to 24.6 percent. But in 1987, the dollar's fall and a smaller decline in equities resulted in a 24.2 percent gain. While stock markets are open today in the United States, Britain and Cananda, most markets ended the year on Friday.
Many forecasts for 1991 are based on what could turn out to be optimistic assumptions: a quick recovery from a recession in the United States, a peaking of interest rates worldwide, no war or a quick war in the Persian Gulf and a cap on oil prices. If these assumptions do not hold, markets could be in for another troubling year.
The abrupt resignation earlier this month of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, provided a vivid reminder of the fragility of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's experiment in the Soviet Union. An unraveling there -- or more problems in Eastern Europe -- could also send stock markets tumbling, especially in Germany and Europe.
Striking a pessimistic note, Madhav Dhar, global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said: "The economic, political and corporate outlook is not right. The markets are not reacting as if the news is gloomy. We think the fundamental troubles around the world are not fully discounted in the prices. We think the markets are poised to respond to good news and that is a mistake."
Sander Cseh of Cseh International in Philadelphia was more optimistic. "We could have a lot of good things happening, even if there is a war," he said. "If it is a short war, you are going to have a huge decline in oil prices, and that will benefit cyclical companies. If gasoline prices drop, consumers will be more optimistic."
The uncertainties in the outlook for 1991 revolve around the assumptions for the pace of the slowdowns in Europe and Japan, the length and depth of the recessions in the United States and elsewhere, and the course of interest rates. Stock analysts also differ over the impact of a capital shortage around the world as both the Japanese and the Germans keep money at home that used to buoy markets abroad.
But analysts seem to agree that the motivation for buying equities in 1991 is the attractive values one can find, not the prospect of strong earnings. "The most important factor in the market in 1991 is the valuations," said Guy Rigden, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London.
In addition, many analysts think that stock markets have further to fall because they have rebounded since the lows reached last fall.
While there is a split on the outlook for 1991, there is general agreement, in hindsight, on much of what went wrong in 1990, a year that began with some forecasts of 15 percent increases in markets.
Not only did the experts not foresee the invasion of Kuwait, but they missed the quickness of the economic decline and the high level at which interest rates have remained. Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, major stock markets around the world were in a swoon or ready for one because of the high interest rates and the deterioration of the economy over all.
 
'A Match Touched to Tinder'
 "I believe that the Aug. 2 hostilities were simply a match touched to tinder that was already dry," said Lawrence W. Harris 3d, director of of Lombard Odier International in London.
In the end, 1990 was a year of new highs and new lows for many stock markets. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks plunged 28 percent from a record high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989 to 28,002.07 by April 2. After the Iraqi invasion it slumped to below 20,000 before closing Friday for the year at 23,848.71, down 38.7 percent for the year.
New Zealand's Barclay's index is at its lowest level in more than six years. In Australia, the All Ordinaries dropped to a 30-month low. And in Norway, despite the benefit its oil-rich economy receives from higher prices, the All Share index fell from a record high on the day of the Iraqi invasion to a string of 1990 lows at the end of the year.
One surprise is that two countries now thought to be in recessions -- the United States and Britain -- have performed relatively well. For the year through Friday, the Financial Times index for Wall Street is down 7.2 percent, the sixth-best performance of the 24 markets in local currencies. Britain's market is No. 4 in dollar terms, up 4.6 percent because the strong pound wiped out the market's local losses when results were turned to dollars.
 
Interest Rates
 A main factor in the performance of markets last year was interest rates, which are likely to have a strong effect next year, too. In Europe, the interest rate impact is heightened by the discipline of the European Monetary System, which links the currencies of 10 countries. In effect, it has forced Europe to match the high-interest-rate policy of Germany, even though the Government in Britain, where the economy is in a recession, and the Governments in France and Italy, where the economies are slowing down, would like to cut rates to lessen the economic damage.
The Milan stock market, which had been the pick of analysts last spring, wound up falling 28.8 percent in local terms, according to the Financial Times index, the fourth-worst performance of the year. In dollar terms, the loss was reduced to 20 percent. For 1991, many economists predict Italy will have one of the slowest-growing economies in Europe.
The French market, another popular one earlier in the year, also fell sharply as France's economy began to slow and it felt the backlash of the Persian Gulf crisis. The Paris Bourse was down 25.7 percent for the year in local terms and 15.7 percent in dollars, according to the Financial Times Index.
In Britain, despite the emerging recession, the market was one of the best performers of the year for dollar investors, with a rise of 4.6 percent. But for locals it was not that bad either, declining 12.2 percent in pounds, the eighth-best performance in the index. A key reason the market suffered less than others was North Sea oil production, which insulated Britain and its stock market from the impact of the sharp jump in oil prices.
Britain is also one of the markets of choice for many managers next year, partly because of the good values in the market.
 
Shipping Stocks Hurt
 Norway is another oil exporter whose stock market fared better than others. Unlike Britain's, Norway's market had a sharp decline after the invasion because the crisis hurt shipping stocks. The British market had most of its decline before the invasion because of its faltering economy and high interest rates. Norway's market finished fifth in local currency and dollars, declining 8.9 percent kroner and increasing 1.9 percent in dollar terms.
The Frankfurt market soared to a record high in March amid euphoria about Eastern Europe, only to succumb to the worries about the cost of German unificiation later in the spring.
Rallies after that were halted when economic worries came to the fore and Iraq invaded Kuwait. For the year, the market is down 20.1 percent in marks. The strong mark halved that loss to 9.7 percent for dollar investors.
Analysts are divided on the outlook for 1991, with some still worried about the negative consequences for equities of the cost of German unification and the potential for even another rise in German interest rates. But the longer-term benefits of German unification and the fact that the economy is expected to be one of the strongest performers in Europe make it attractive to some.
Tokyo's stock market was the worst performing stock market in the Financial Times index, falling 40.4 percent in yen terms, a notch worse than the 39.2 percent plunge in New Zealand's stock market.
The Japanese market's fall from a record high at the end of 1989 was swift, as the market was undermined by a weakening yen, rising interest rates, higher oil prices and politicial uncertainty.
As with Germany, there is a divided opinion over the Japanese outlook. Many managers prefer to stay away because of the high cost of Japanese stocks. But others, including Merrill Lynch, are betting that interest rates in Japan may finally be at their peak, given recent data showing the economy to be slowing.
 
Mexico Earns the Top Rank
 Mexico's market rose 97 percent in pesos and 79.2 percent in dollar terms, giving it the top ranking for the third year in a row. The Government's success in dealing with its debt and its effort to open the economy have made the stock market a great bet.
Hong Kong eked out a gain of 4.9 percent in local terms and 5 percent in dollars, making it the second- and third-ranked market, respectively. Its performance was based on the strong rally in the first half that finally brought it back from the low levels it hit after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989.
"Hong Kong is marching to a different tune than to what is going on in the rest of the world," said Mr. Harris of Lombard Odier Internatinal. The market, he added, is less affected by high interest rates and the Persian Gulf crisis than most other stock markets. Analysts still like it because its stocks are cheap and they are a little less worried about the impact from the takeover by China in 1997.
Austria, one of the smallest European markets, also did well relatively, falling only 4.4 percent in schillings and rising 7.7 percent in dollars, making it the second-best performer of the year. But part of the reason it held up so well was the cushion it gained from a huge rally at the beginning of the year on the back of Eastern Europe euphoria. While the German market was up just 5 percent in the first six months of the year, Austria's market jumped almost 33 percent.

HEADLINE: Sandinistas Admit Missiles Went to Salvador

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
In their first such admission, Sandinista army officers have acknowledged that advanced weapons were smuggled recently from Nicaragua to guerrillas fighting in El Salvador, Administration officials said today. But the Sandinistas have pledged to United States diplomats that such aid has been halted, the officials said.
The Bush Administration was gratified by the admission, which the officials said came at a meeting between senior Sandinista officers and United States diplomats in Managua twoweeks ago. But officials expressed disbelief that the Nicaraguans had stopped their arms smuggling entirely. 
 Attempts to contact Sandinista officials for comment were unsuccessful.
The Administration officials also said there was evidence that the Sandinistas were transferring explosives to a small guerrilla group in Honduras to attack American military personnel based there.
An Administration official said, "I don't believe it is their intention to stop or that this is an isolated incident."
The reported smuggling occurred since President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua took office bydefeating the Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega de Saavedra, in elections last February. Although she is the national leader, she has limited control over the armed forces. Mr. Ortega's brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega de Saavedra, remains the army commander.
Mrs. Chamorro has privately told President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador that she will do all she can to halt the arms flow.
Mrs. Chamorro's seeming inability to rein in the Sandinista military has caused growing friction among conservatives serving in her coalition Government and has also led to growing protests and violence among the former contra rebels who once fought to oust the Sandinistas.
"The Sandinista Front," said Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, "is squandering every ounce of good will they won when they accepted the results of the Nicaraguan elections by continuing to arm and supply violent revolutionaries in El Salvador."
During the Reagan Administration, charges that Nicaragua served as a conduit for Soviet bloc arms shipments to the Salvadoran rebels led to a cutoff of United States economic aid to Managua and the launching of the contra rebels.
Sandinista arms shipments arose again as a vital issue in United States-Nicaraguan relations in the last five weeks when guerrillas shot down two Salvadoran Air Force aircraft withSoviet-manufactured SA-14 missiles. The deployment of the antiaircraft missiles, the most sophisticated ever seen in El Salvador, has forced Salvadoran pilots to fly well above heights considered desirable for maximum battle effectiveness.
The new check against the air force represented a major advantage for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels as they began their most effective offensive in more than a year.
The increase in fighting led the Administration to announce it would rush $48.1 million in military aid to San Salvador months ahead of schedule. The Salvadoran guerrillas announced Saturday that they were ending their offensive to give peace talks another chance.
The Sandinistas called for the meeting with United States officials shortlyafter the Soviet Foreign Ministry identified the serial number of a SA-14 missile casing found near a downed Salvadoran AC-46 gunship as the same imprinted on a missile Moscow donated to the Nicaraguan Army in 1985.
An Administration official said the Sandinista officers, whom he would not identify, had said, "Yes, indeed there had been a diversion, but it had been a small one."
The officers said an air force captain had smuggled six anti-aircraft missiles to El Salvador in the last few months before his unauthorized action was discovered. They promised that the smuggling was being investigated and that all involved would be prosecuted and punished.
The Salvadoran guerrillas have publicly denied that they received the missiles from Nicaragua.

HEADLINE: Successor To Dukakis Ready to Be Unpopular

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 30

 BODY:
With the Massachusetts economy battered by recession and the state budget hemorrhaging red ink, William F. Weld prepares to take office on Thursday as the state's first Republican governor in almost two decades.
So grave is the situation that even some of Mr. Weld's advisers worry that he will be only a sacrificial one-term Governor. But sitting in the book-lined living room of his spacious house here, the 45-year-old former United States Attorney said he believed the job "is doable." 
 To balance the budget, Mr. Weld said, "I'm certainly prepared to take some fiscal actions that are wildly unpopular." He said he planned to offer a package of tough budget cuts early in January.
"We'll have to take away some things that some people have gotten used to," Mr. Weld said.
 
Proposal on Deficit
 He indicated that some of the reductions he would recommend to the Legislature, which is still solidly controlled by Democrats, would come in the area of social services, like Medicaid and welfare. Others would come through reorganizing state government, like changing the way the state now pays for much of Boston's transit system.
But he would not say how big he believed the deficit in the $13.4 billion state budget actually is, a matter of widespread dispute. Estimates range from $100 million to $700 million.
Representative Richard A. Voke, the chairman of the State House Ways and Means Committee, said he believed that without large cuts the state would end the current fiscal year on June 30 with a deficit of up to $500 million. Because half the fiscal year is already gone, Mr. Weld will have to make reductions of about $1 billion on an annual basis, or 7.5 percent of the total budget, to get it in balance.
"I don't know how you make those kinds of cuts in that period of time," Mr. Voke said.
Moreover, Mr. Weld is required to submit his budget proposal for the fiscal year 1992 on Feb. 27, just 55 days after he takes office.
 
Previous Budget Cuts
 The crisis confronting the incoming Governor is compounded by several other factors. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat who decided against running for re-election, has already cut $1 billion out of the budget in the past two years, including laying off 6,000 state employees and reducing spending for higher education by 15 percent.
"So a lot of the so-called fat that Bill talked about has already been trimmed and the next cuts are going to be from the bone, whole programs like closing a state college," said a Boston businessman with close ties to Mr. Weld who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition, Mr. Weld takes office at a time when the recession in Massachusetts is continuing to deepen, meaning that state tax revenues are likely to drop further, while the demand for social services like unemployment compensation and Medicaid will increase, thus adding to the deficit.
Unemployment in the state jumped from 6.3 percent in October to 7 percent in November, more than double the rate of two years ago, the United States Labor Department says. And business failures in Massachusetts in the first nine months of the year more than tripled from the same period in 1989, by far the worst rate in the nation, according to the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. Further large layoffs are expected in the state's troubled high technology companies in January.
 
Pledge on Taxes
 Mr. Weld possibly added to his troubles when he pledged in the campaign that he would not raises taxes during the next four years.
"It will be fiscal triage, a revolution," said an adviser to Mr. Weld who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "To get the budget under control, it will require a radically reduced state work force and radically reduced and restructured state services."
Richard Manley, the president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan group financed by businesses, agreed. "I think it will be four years of brutal cuts," he said.
At the heart of the trouble, Mr. Manley said, is a deficit stemming from social programs that must be eliminated. This deficit, of at least $1 billion, was created as large programs like Medicaid, welfare, and pensions and health insurance for state employees grew twice as fast as state revenues, and that was in normal times, Mr. Manley said. In the past two years state revenues have fallen.
 
Voter Anger Over Dukakis
 But Mr. Manley said he is confident Mr. Weld will succeed. "Sometimes just a change of faces is a big improvement," he said, pointing out that much of the public anger in Massachusetts was directed at Governor Dukakis, who campaigned for President in 1988 on the strength of the "Massachusetts Miracle," the state's enormous economic growth in the 1980's.
"I also think that if Weld gets the budget in balance, despite the pain of the cuts, the public reaction won't be as harsh as you might think," Mr. Manley said.
Mr. Weld said he thinks his job will be made somewhat easier because he received a popular mandate to restructure state government. Mr. Weld defeated John R. Silber, the president of Boston University, by a ratio of only 52 percent to 48 percent. But Mr. Weld said those figures were deceptive, since he believed "the real election" occurred in the September primary, when voters picked him and Dr. Silber as the two candidates most seen as outsiders and likely to bring about change.
Mr. Weld said he has spoken extensively with the Democratic leaders of the State House and Senate and is convinced that they share his view that decisive action must be taken in January and February to cut the deficit.
 
Proposed Cuts in Social Service
 If the Governor and the Legislature do not act before March, he said, it would be difficult for him to go to Wall Street to borrow further to cover the deficit. Massachusetts already has the lowest credit rating of any state.
Mr. Weld said many of his proposed cuts would come from the social services area, like Medicaid, welfare and health insurance for state employees. "We've outdone ourselves in an attempt to be the most generous state in the nation," Mr. Weld said. "I think we've gone beyond providing for the needy, down on their luck, to the notion that human services benefits have become a middle-class entitlement."
One of his proposals will be to reorganize the state Medicaid system, turning it into a managed health care system like a commercial health maintenance organization.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Post 24.1% Decline

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools dropped 24.1 percent in November from the October level, as concerns about the weakening economy and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf dampened demand for factory machinery.
Orders totaled $203.4 million last month, compared with $268.1 million in October, according to a monthly report by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade group in McLean, Va. 
 Compared with November 1989, when machine tool orders amounted to $184.4 million, orders last month rose 10.3 percent.
Machine tools are sophisticated machines, costing $500,000 or more, that cut or shape the metal parts that are used to make a variety of products, ranging from aircraft to kitchen appliances. Economists consider orders for these machines a good indicator of manufacturers' willingness to invest in their factories.
Actual shipments of machine tools rose 5.9 percent in November, to $268.7 million, from $253.8 million in October. But compared with a year earlier, when shipments amounted to $313.7 million, orders fell 14.3 percent.
While orders for machine tools are carefully watched for hints on plans for capital spending, they tend to vary widely from month to month.
"Orders for any individual month are really quite meaningless because of the large chunk of orders that can come in at any time," said Richard C. Kleinfeldt, vice president of finance for Giddings & Lewis Inc., a machine tool company in Fond du Lac, Wis., which supplies automated systems used to assemble General Motors' new line of Saturn automobiles.
Orders often drop in November and December because the automobile companies, which are large buyers, historically shut down for several weeks at the end of the year, said James J. Paper, a machine-tool industry analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc., an investment firm in Omaha.
Mr. Paper attributed the sharp decline in November orders to the weak economy, the historical seasonal slowdown and the volatility of monthly orders for machine tools.
"The important thing is that this November is better than last November," he said.
 
'Understandable Wariness'
 Mr. Paper said industry executives had not reported large cancellations of orders, which often occur in a severe economic downturn. He also said that the number of inquiries from customers asking for price quotes on new machines was growing but that it was not clear how many of the inquiries would result in orders.
"Concern about the economy and the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf have created understandable wariness in recent months," said Albert W. Moore, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology. He added, however, that "there are fundamental reasons for optimism" in the machine tools business, citing the drop in the value of the dollar, which has made American tools cheaper overseas and has spurred exports.
November orders for metal-cutting tools were $137.5 million, down 24.5 percent from the $182 million in October. Orders were up 6.7 percent from November 1989. when they were $128.9 million.
Orders for metal-forming tools amounted to $66 million, a 23 percent drop from the $85.7 million in October. Orders increased 18.9 percent, from $55.5 million a year ago.
The machine tool backlog for November 1990 was $1.52 billion, compared with $1.59 billion in October. The backlog in November 1989 was $1.98 billion.

Moving to Future, City Finds Gap in the Present

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Dec. 30

 BODY:
In the long term, St. Louis of ficials and boost ers expect to see a downtown convention complex doubled in size, complete with a 70,000-seat domed stadium and a new 1,100-room hotel, a complex large enough to make the city a leader in the nation's convention business.
In recent years, St. Louis has seemed to have everything to offer major conventions like the national political conventions or the American Bar Association -- everything but space. Now it is trying to remedy that. 
 But the effort to reach that goal has cost St. Louis a 614-room hotel in mint condition, the only large hotel adjacent to the existing convention center and one for which conventions were already scheduled. The hotel, the Sheraton Convention Center, was scheduled to close a year from now to make room for the new stadium, but its owners are closing it on Wednesday, a year early.
"There was a very dramatic erosion in the kind of business we normally were having," said Brice R. Smith Jr., chief executive of the Sverdrup Corporation, the major investor in the hotel, which is managed by the I.T.T. Corporation. "The facts of the matter are people have already decided the building has closed."
Occupancy was down by 15 percent since 1989, Mr. Smith said. The declining occupancy rate coupled with the a traditionally slow first quarter meant the 13-year-old hotel would lose at least $2.5 million by staying open another 11 months.
The Sheraton and the Cervantes Convention Center have been linked since their birth in the late 1970's, and city officials say building the center would have been out of the question without a hotel of the Sheraton's size across the street. The future of the 19-story Sheraton has been in doubt since the mid-1980's when plans to expand the convention center were first discussed. But it was the stadium that doomed it.
The city hopes to regain a National Football League franchise with the new stadium as a lure, and when there are no games it would be used for conventions. Once the stadium became part of the $500 million expansion project, the only feasible location, the city decided, included the hotel site.
Officials counted on the Sheraton to remain open through November 1991, however, to narrow the gap between it being torn down and a larger replacement being built. Plans for the larger hotel have fallen through once, and officals are talking to developers about the prospects for it.
The sudden announcement on Dec. 13 that the hotel would close on Jan. 2 sent tourism officials scrambling to find enough rooms in other hotels for the 38 conventions already booked at the Sheraton for 1991. So far, 34 have been relocated.
Mr. Smith said he agonized over the closing, especially because of the 300 employees who would lose their jobs. "It's really kind of a bad thing to do at Christmas," he said. "I hated that."
The announcement stunned the hotel's employees. "It surprised us because we were taking reservations for up to the end of 1991. It's a shock," said Mrs. Vickie Stephenson, an administrative assistant in the executive offices who has worked at the Sheraton for nine and a half years.
The employees were not the only ones taken by surprise. So was Marvin Lewis, the chairman of the national convention commission of the Brotherhood of Elks who has spent nearly four years arranging the organization's convention in July 1991. The convention would attract about 20,000 Elks, relatives and guests, he said, and would likely bring $10 million to the St. Louis economy.
"We're still trying to work with the city of St. Louis," Mr. Lewis said . "I like the people and the amusements for families. You have one of the finest zoos in the world; you have the river."
Keith Arnold, president the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission, and his staff hastily put together a new plan for the Elks, which found substitutes for every lost room and kept each state delegation together.
While Mr. Lewis and the Elks have yet to accept the new proposal, Mr. Smith and St. Louis officials prefer to see the closing as a temporary setback.
Some people even see an immediate silver lining. J. Christopher Grace, head of the city's St. Louis Development Corportion, expects the closing to boost the 1991 occupancy rates for the remaining hotels in the city. He added that the closing of the Sheraton might make it easier to find a developer for a larger hotel, because of the greater urgency of getting the project going.
As for the Elks, Mr. Grace said, "You never want to lose something, but in an economy in the billions, $10 million is insignificant."

HEADLINE: EMPLOYERS SHUN SUB-MINIMUM WAGE

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Although a law that took effect on April 1 allows employers to hire teen-agers at less than the minimum wage of $3.80 an hour, few of them have elected to go below this level, an initial survey indicates.
A survey of 167 fast-food restaurants by two university economists found that only three were using the sub-minimum wage, which ranges between $3.35 an hour and $3.80. Most of the restaurants, all part of the Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken or Wendy's chains, said they did not think they could attract acceptable workers at the new sub-minimum wage. 
 They also expressed concern that paying some young employees less than others would be demoralizing and disruptive -- a criticism that leaders of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations have often leveled at the concept of two-tier pay scales.
The behavior of the companies is in sharp contrast to the importance President Bush attached to the sub-minimum wage. When Congress passed a bill last year that raised the minimum wage to $3.80 on April 1, 1990, and $4.25 next April 1, Mr. Bush threatened a veto unless a sub-minimum wage was provided for teen-agers. Congress agreed to include that provision for three years.
The President contended that companies would resist hiring and training disadvantaged teen-agers unless they were allowed to pay less than the new minimum for the first six months of the new worker's employment. A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined to comment today on the survey, which studied the 167 restaurants in Texas, where many fast-food outlets have historically paid young workers no more than Federal law requires. Fast-food companies had been among the supporters of the separate wage scale for teen-agers.
 
A Social Role
 Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard Univerity labor economist, and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University, the co-authors of the survey, said the response of the fast-food restaurants suggested that the minimum wage played a social role beyond the supply-and-demand laws of economics. The Federal minimum wage has come to be accepted by most employers and employees as a sort of guide to the least that should be paid for the most menial jobs, they added.
Officials at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said they knew of no other study that had attempted to measure the use of the new sub-minimum wage. Indeed, future studies might turn up more use of the sub-minimum wage. But the bureau's wage and employment data tend to confirm the survey's findings.
Month after month, for example, bureau data show that about 2 percent of the nation's employed workers earn less than the minimum wage, including 6 percent of the 16-to-19-year-old wage group, the one most affected by the sub-minimum wage. This 2 percent receives less than the legal minimum because of loopholes in the law or violations of it. And since April 1, the percentage has not risen.
The bureau's unemployment data also fails to turn up evidence bearing out the Administration's concern that joblessness would rise among teen-agers without the sub-minimum wage to offset the April 1 rise in the minimum to $3.80 an hour, from $3.35.
Although few employers appear to have resorted to the sub-minimum wage, the teen-age unemployment rate remained unchanged until late summer. Bureau officials and most private economists attribute the increase not to wage levels, but to the downturn in the national economy.
 
No Unusual Changes Reported
 Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger, who presented their survey at the annual conference of the American Economic Association, which ended here today, found that the fast-food outlets they surveyed did not report unusual changes in employment levels and hours worked after the new minimum wage went into effect.
Nor did they report cutbacks in fringe benefits, although a majority of the employees at fast-food restaurants work part-time and do not qualify for health insurance and other benefits.
Still, some economists argue that the April 1 increase in the minimum wage put relatively little pressure on employer costs because the minimum had remained at the old level, $3.35 an hour, since 1981, and during that unusually long period many companies found themselves moving their wage scales above the minimum. In this view, the minimum might begin to hurt employers when it rises to $4.25 an hour on April 1. That might prompt more companies to resort to the sub-minimum, which will rise at that time to $3.80 an hour, some economists say.
 
Little Training Required
 Finally, most people earning only the minimum wage are in retail trades, with a heavy concentration among fast-food outlets. The jobs they occupy usually require only a few days of training to master. The sub-minimum wage provision, on the other hand, allows an employer to pay a teen-ager $3.35 to $3.80 an hour for the first three months on the job, even without offering training. To extend this special pay level pay for an additional three months, training must be involved.
"The fact there is very little use of the sub-minimum means that employers are not chomping at the bit to train young people and being prevented from doing so by the minimum wage," Mr. Krueger said.
Sixty of the 167 outlets surveyed had been paying the old minimum of $3.35 an hour and they reported jumping to $3.80 an hour on April 1. Most of the rest had been paying above the old minimum to teen-agers and they generally increased their wages by enough to keep their pay above the new minimum.
 
Upward Shift for Thousands
 The hourly wages of thousands of people earning just above the minimum shift upward when the minimum does. The Texas survey found this phenomenon and other studies, in the past, have also reported it.
Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger selected Texas because it is one of the 25 states that does not have a minimum wage law that could override the national minimum.
The new sub-minimum wage scale replaces one that had been in existence since 1961 but was limited to full-time students who worked part-time. Studies showed that the only employers to use that wage were universities and movie-theater chains.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
With the Bedouins Banished, Jordan's Caves Lose Tourists

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WADI MUSA, Jordan, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Two thousand years ago, when the Nabatean civilization was at its peak, some 25,000 people lived here in Petra, long Jordan's most celebrated tourist attraction. Last year at this time, 1,200 people a day came here. This year on New Year's Eve, the Petra Forum Hotel has reservations for five.
"The gulf crisis is more of a disaster for us than for Iraq," said Nyazi Shabaan, the 35-year-old director of tourism for Petra and this town of 12,000, which depend on tourists for their survival. "I don't know what we will do if they don't come back." 
 This town is a microcosm of Jordan's ruined tourist economy, a major source of hard currency. Only three months ago, a delegation from Unesco came here to consider ways to limit the 130,000 tourists who poured each year into these long-hidden remains of one of the great trading cities of ancient times. But Petra is now nearly as silent as it was for the 1,000 years when it languished as a lost city.
Already devastated by the Persian Gulf crisis, Jordan was dealt a further blow this week when the State Department asked all Americans on nonessential business in this country, Yemen, Mauritania, and the Sudan -- all deemed sympathetic to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq -- to leave the area.
This town has been impoverished by the gulf crisis. The Petra Forum Hotel, normally the busiest hotel in Jordan, whose 82 rooms are usually booked weeks in advance and which began expanding to 160 rooms before Aug. 2, is now practically empty. One night last week, there were only 25 guests, of whom 14 were members of a Japanese group, one of the few tours that did not cancel.
 
Halt to Construction
 Two more expensive hotels were planned by private Jordanian investors, but the plans are now on hold. Three more modest guest houses in Wadi Musa were already being built, but this construction, too, has stopped.
In normal times, the tourism office employed 15 to 20 guides a season, Mr. Shabaan said. It has now been forced to let most of them go. The town's 350 horses, each of which used to bring its owner about $200 a month, now earn less than $10 each. "It costs between $30 and $40 a month just to feed a horse," he said.
Mr. Shabaan is just old enough to remember what life was like in Petra before tourists began coming in such vast numbers. An archeologist trained at the University of Amman, he is no ordinary tourism director. He was born in one of the many caves to which tourists have flocked and in which the Nabateans lived, and he is one of the eight sons of an very poor Bedouin family, which like most of the Bedouins only a decade ago made the caves their home.
He and his family used to sleep by a "very cozy" fire in the middle of the cave. "It was wonderful to have this place to yourself at night," he said.
His interest in archeology came from his curiosity about the people who used to come from all over the world to stand in awe of Petra's lost civilization -- its rulers' tombs, its ancient paved streets and its giant amphitheater, which seats 4,000 people.
 
Reserved for Tourists
 The Bedouins no longer inhabit the caves. The Jordanian Government, eager to preserve its special archeological legacy and to turn Petra into a major tourist site, ordered them out of Petra five years ago. Just outside the ancient city, the Government built for them a modern village of cinder block and concrete houses, complete with running water and electricity, a school, mosque and stores.
Bedul Village, as it is called after the local tribe, now has about 1,000 inhabitants. But some Bedouins have refused to move there.
"You see the same faces in the same place," complained Ruwaih Bedul, who lives near Petra in a Bedouin tent made of coarse black wool from his own sheep. The inside of his tent was even warmer than the cave, especially since he shares it with his wife, 8 children, 25 goats and 10 sheep.
Mr. Bedul's simple life might not seem dependent on tourism. But in fact he used to earn extra money as a guard at the archeological sites, money that provided the extra tiny glass tumbler of tea, heated inside the tent in a black iron pot boiled over a fire of twigs.
"We all miss the tourists," Mr. Bedul said.
What is a disaster for the city, however, is a boon to the rare traveler here. For the celebrated rose rock city carved out of the sandstone cliffs can be seen today just as David Roberts, the English artist, must have seen it in the last century when he came here to draw its wonders.
"Petra is this country's natural treasure," Mr. Shabaan said. "It is more precious than oil. I can't help but believe people will always want to see it and will come back, God willing."

International
For much of Eastern Europe, 1991 is certain to be a year of swift economic change, one that aims to keep pace with the monumental political changes in the region. So far, with the first year of Eastern Europe's post-Communist era drawing to a close, the region's economies, except for Poland's, have moved only a few steps down the road to capitalism. [Page 1.]
Officials of the U.S., Canada and Mexico say they are fast sweeping away obstacles to Canadian participation in free-trade talks expected to open in 1991 between the U.S. and Mexico. The three countries are expected to begin shaping an agreement that would create a North American common market. [29.]
World stock markets begin 1991 facing the threat of war, recessions or economic slowdowns, and dismal earnings. Yet many people expect a better year than the one that ends today. [29.]
 
The Economy
A law that took effect on April 1 allows employers to hire teen-agers at less than the minimum wage of $3.80 an hour. But few companies have elected to go below this level, a survey has found. [1.]
The F.T.C. has subpoenaed records of the leading manufacturers of infant formula, suspecting that they collaborated to raise prices. The formula is a key ingredient of packages given to low-income families under the WIC supplemental food program. [1.]
Orders for machine tools dropped 24.1 percent in November from the October level, as concerns about the weakening economy and fear of war dampened demand for factory machinery. [29.]
 
The Media Business
A year after the merger of Time and Warner created the world's largest communications company, Time Warner Inc. is finding that the combination adds up to a lot less than three, but something more than two. [29.]
One publication remains happily aloof from controversy over ads in children's magazines. Sesame Street Magazine, about to celebrate its 20th birthday, has never accepted advertising. [34.]
The U.S. may be poised to give Europeans a peculiarly American broadcast innovation: the plug. [34.]
Remarks by a Cuban-American television commentator about Puerto Rican women have enraged Puerto Ricans in many cities and embroiled the nation's largest Spanish-language network in a dispute that threatens its advertising and its base of viewers. [1.]
The World Paper covers topics ranging from nuclear proliferation to fundamentalism from a foreign perspective. Press. [34.]
Thompson Medical will begin new commercials for its Slim-Fast diet aid, intended to serve as an umbrella campaign for a new line of reduced-calorie foods. Kim Foltz: Advertising. [35.]
 
Companies
Best Buy has converted nearly half of its 70 consumer electronics stores to warehouse-style operations. The move has proved popular with consumers but has angered Japanese suppliers. [36.]
CS Holding says the decision of a Swiss court will make business more difficult. The court stated that CS Holding is subject to the capital requirements of Swiss banking law. [33.]
 
 Today's Columns
The old reliable consumer growth stocks again led the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average in 1990. Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Phillip Morris were the top three stocks again this year, as they were in 1989. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [29.]
The personal computer is a breakthrough technology that should be revamping the lives of millions of Americans and making them wealthier. But so far, the great payoff has not materialized. And if history is a guide, the payoff will probably not occur until the 21st century. Louis Uchitelle: Business Scene. [30.]
One bright spot in the gloom that has hung over Wall Street this year was the financial performance of the 41 primary dealers of Government securities. The trading profits of these firms are likely to be higher than in any year since 1986. Credit Markets. [33.]

Dole Cautious on U.S. Role in Gulf Combat

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said today that putting the Emir of Kuwait back on his throne was not "worth one American life, as far as I am concerned."
Appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Senator Dole said the American people "want to make certain that President Bush has done everything, pursued every avenue, for peace before the firing starts." 
 He said that one of the things Mr. Bush should do is "pursue, at least one additional time, figuring out a date" that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d could go to Baghdad to meet with President Saddam Hussein.
"I have sort of a gut feeling the American people are not yet committed to war," the Kansas Republican said.
Senator Dole disclosed that he had telephoned Iraq's Ambassador to the United States, who is in Baghdad, and taken from the conversation the conviction that "there is some flexibility" on setting a date for talks.
He also appeared to suggest that President Bush should show some flexibility on a date for sending Mr. Baker to Baghdad for negotiations with Iraq. Mr. Bush has said that the date of Jan. 12 proposed by Iraq is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
Senator Dole said the President's ability to handle the "twin problems" of the gulf crisis and the worsening domestic economy represented "make-or-break time for George Bush."

HEADLINE: Comments on Puerto Ricans Embroil Hispanic Network

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
A Cuban-American television commentator's remarks about Puerto Rican women have enraged Puerto Ricans in many cities and embroiled the nation's largest Spanish-language network in a dispute that threatens its advertising and viewer base.
The remarks, broadcast Nov. 5 nationwide on the Univision network, have led to demonstrations and demands for the dismissal of the commentator, Carlos Alberto Montaner. Network officials have offered explanations, met with protesters and repeatedly broadcast opposing views, but they have refused to take any action against Mr. Montaner. 
 Mr. Montaner's comments were made on "Portada" ("Cover" in Spanish), a one-hour weekly news program that is broadcast on Monday nights. Mr. Montaner, a syndicated columnist whose work appears in newspapers in the United States, Latin America and Europe, discussed why Puerto Ricans in the United States suffer worse economic conditions than other Hispanic groups.
"There's probably more than one explanation," he said, "but the one that seems the most important to me is this: because there is a grave family problem in the Puerto Rican ghettos of the United States, where there are thousands of single mothers, very young, who try to escape poverty through welfare or through new partners who then leave, and leave behind other children to worsen the problem."
The statement was immediately rebutted as "sexist" by another commentator, Sergio Munoz, editor of La Opinion, a Spanish-language paper in Los Angeles, and it sparked a flurry of condemnations from Puerto Rican leaders in major cities. They said Mr. Montaner's argument perpetuated stereotypes and implied that Puerto Rican women were promiscuous.
"You can cite the statistics, but where he went off base was targeting the Puerto Rican woman and making comments about sexual behavior," said Elizabeth Colon, head of the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors in New York City. "He then infers that we have lost our sense of family, our values."
Although Mr. Montaner later apologized for his comments, the furor has not died down, and the protests seem to be having an impact. Starting Wednesday, Goya Foods of Secaucus, N.J., one of the nation's leading producers of foods intended primarily for the Hispanic market, will no longer advertise on WXTV Channel 41, Univision's station in Secaucus.
 
Insulting a Community
 "His comments wre an insult to the Puerto Rican community," said Rafael Toro, a company spokesman. "Freedom of speech is not the right to insult a community." Officials of the company said the decision would affect only the Secaucus station and that Goya offices in other cities with Univision stations were free to make their own advertising decisions.
A coalition of 25 Puerto Rican organizations is pressing other major advertisers to follow suit, including The Coca-Cola Company and Philip Morris Companies.
Univision Holdings Inc., whose majority owner is Hallmark Cards Inc., owns eight television stations and the network, which broadcasts in more than 30 markets. The network has production studios in Miami and sales offices in New York City. New York, Miami and Los Angeles are the network's three largest markets, said Carmen Herrero Biaggi, a spokeswoman.
As a result of Mr. Montaner's remarks, El Diario/La Prensa in New York City stopped publishing his weekly column.
 
'Ignored, Abused and Mutilated'
 On a Dec. 24 broadcast of "Portada," Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the United States Surgeon General and a native of Puerto Rico, said: "There are many Antonia Novellos in this country, Puerto Ricans in New York, Cubans in Miami, Mexicans in Los Angeles. They will also succeed, despite the prejudices expressed by Mr. Montaner."
The intense emotions provoked by the Montaner comments took some Hispanic-Americans by surprise, but on reflection they said it was understandable, in light of other perceived biases against mainland Puerto Ricans. Some pointed to remarks by the former New York City Police Commissioner, Benjamin Ward, that linked them to drug buying, and to opposition in Puerto Rico to mainland Puerto Ricans' voting on the island's political future.
"The Puerto Rican community really feels like it's been ignored, abused and mutilated, and that it has to bear all these social problems and there's no real understanding of what the community has gone through," said Angelo Falcon, head of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a research and advocacy group in New York.
Others said that part of the response stemmed from shock. They said Hispanics expect more sensitivity from Spanish-language media organizations, which often act as an advocate for the Hispanic-American community.
 
Network Cites Censorship
 "What appalls me even more is that the station and this gentleman are Latinos and should be interpreting facts correctly and intelligently," said John Garcia, a Puerto Rican who is a Daily News reporter on strike and Northeast region representative for the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.
Univision officials said they are willing to discuss improvements in programming but that dismissing Mr. Montaner would violate his right to give his views without fear. In an editorial broadcast Dec. 18, the network president, Joaquin Blaya, a Chilean-American, said:
"Montaner may or may not be mistaken. We personally believe that he is, and we deeply regret the effect of his words. For this we apologize. But with equal conviction we believe in his right to express his opinion and not be censored."
In a telephone interview last week Mr. Montaner, 47 years old, said that he never meant to give the impression that Puerto Rican mothers "voluntarily" try to escape poverty through welfare or by taking new boyfriends. His point, he said, was that there is a higher percentage of families headed by women among Puerto Ricans than in other Hispanic groups and, as a result, these families have less income than those led by a couple.
 
'Clumsy' Remarks
 The Census Bureau's 1989 population survey showed that 31 percent of Puerto Rican families in the United States were led by a woman, compared with 20 percent for Central and South Americans, 16 percent for Mexicans and 14 percent for Cubans.
"When the woman is left alone and has small children and can't go out to work, if she doesn't work, the income is less and the children have much fewer possibilities of a better education and of access to cultural riches," he said.
Conceding this was not what he said in his commentary, he said he was "clumsy in organizing the information." But he termed allegations that he was racist and sexist ridiculous and said he had been greatly surprised by the uproar.
After the Nov. 5 program, he went returned to "Portada" to apologize and explain his comments, but the criticism did not subside.

Quayle Meets With Saudi Royalty And Seeks More Aid for Military

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle met with this country's rulers today and said he wanted the Saudis and Kuwait's exiled Government to provide greater financial support to the United States military effort in the Persian Gulf.
"They will have to be making more contributions" because of the likelihood that American troops will remain in the gulf longer than initially anticipated, the Vice President told reporters before his meetings. 
 "We do expect collective responsibility to be exhibited," he said.
American officials traveling with Mr. Quayle said King Fahd had given them the impression that the Saudis would provide more financial aid, although no figures were discussed.
 
Three-Day Visit
 Mr. Quayle's three-day visit to the gulf comes two weeks before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations Security Council for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
He met separately with King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah shortly after his arrival. He planned to meet with the exiled Emir of Kuwait on Tuesday after a New Year's visit to some of the more than 300,000 United States troops in the region.
 
Duration of Deployment
 Aboard Air Force Two during his flight to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Quayle said he would discuss with the Saudis the American determination to get the forces of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq out of Kuwait and explain that the United States expected greater financial support as its effort grew in size and duration.
The Pentagon previously projected the cost of the deployment at $8.2 billion through the end of 1990. But the costs are expected to increase because of the additional troops currently being sent. It has been estimated that a full-scale war would cost as much as $1 billion to $2 billion a day.
"You are seeing other nations making contributions," Mr. Quayle said on the flight. He said he would thank the Saudis and Kuwaitis "for the contributions they have made thus far, but point out that more contributions will have to be made because the crisis is going to continue."
 
Billions Already Contributed
 So far, Saudi Arabia has contributed $9 billion, nearly half of it in cash and the rest in military support for United States troops in Saudi Arabia, according to the State Department. Kuwait has given $2.5 billion, United States officials said.
Saudi Arabia also has spent $3.9 billion and Kuwait $3.3 billion to help countries like Turkey and Egypt, which have suffered severe economic repercussions from the United Nations-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq.
Mr. Quayle will spend much of New Year's Day visiting with American troops. Among those deployed to the region are units of the Indiana National Guard, in which he served during the Vietnam War. He was later embroiled in controversy over whether he had used family connections to get into the Guard unit rather than risk being drafted and sent to Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Selling Books to be Cherished, Not Just Read

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
The world of rare books, battered by soaring prices, a scarcity of good volumes and a shift by American collectors away from foreign language manuscripts and books, is struggling to redefine itself.
The large houses that once dominated the trade have been hurt by auction houses that now sell directly to the collector and by the growing number of small dealers that specialize in one or two lines of books, such as Roman histories or medical texts. 
 The number of good books available on the market has fallen dramatically and those that are available have shot up in price, in large part because of big acquisitions in the last two decades by academic institutions and libraries.
But most worrying to dealers in ancient and classical texts, the taste in the American market has changed as fewer collectors are familiar with, or interested in, Greek, Latin and foreign-language books.
 
The Decline of a Bookseller
 "The really rare and important material has tended to diminish on the market," said Kenneth A. Lohf, the librarian for rare books and manuscripts at Columbia University. "There are not as many key items being sold today."
H. P. Kraus, at 16 East 46th Street, Manhattan, once had stock that ranged from illuminated manuscripts to James Joyce. At its height, two decades ago, it employed 16 people in its New York City store, 200 in Mamaroneck, N.Y., where it produced reprints and periodicals, and 100 more in Liechtenstein who were dedicated to the same task.
But H. P. Kraus, like many of the larger rare-book houses, is now a shadow of its former self, especially with the death of its founder and owner, Hans P. Kraus, in 1988.
"I am not so sure we will ever be able to achieve something like these great bookstores again," Mr. Lohf said. "It takes a great deal of money to stock a book shop like H. P. Kraus, almost impossible today."
 
A Glory of the Past
 Many of the great shops that had vast, diverse quantities of manuscripts and books, such as the baronial John F. Fleming Rare Book Company, which was at 322 East 57th Street in Manhattan, have closed and have not been replaced.
Mr. Fleming's shop had 20-foot ceilings, English woodwork, heavy tapestries and paintings, including a life-size portrait of the actor David Garrick. Mr. Fleming used to work at a 20-foot-long Spanish refectory table surrounded by polished oak bookcases. The shop was closed after Mr. Fleming died in 1987 and its contents were sold at auction.
"The whole trade used to be enormous," said Lucien Goldschmidt, whose Lucien Goldschmidt Inc. was one of the best known rare-book shops in New York until 1987. "When I first came to New York in 1937 you could spend weeks going from one rare-book dealer to another."
H. P. Kraus has scaled back, dealing only in manuscripts and early printed books. The current owners are selling off some of Mr. Kraus's collection and estimate they do two-thirds of their business with European collectors, said an owner, Mary Ann Folter.
 
The Demand Slackens
 "It is much more difficult now to buy old books," said Roland Folter, the shop's director. "If we had the same demand we had 20 or 30 years ago it would be practically impossible to fill that demand."
But the demand is not what it was. The libraries that spent lavishly 20 years ago to aquire rare volumes and manuscripts are no longer major factors in the market. And their aquisitions were so extensive that the available volumes on the market were significantly reduced.
The business is not large financially.
Worldwide sales for rare books do not top $500 million, said George S. Lowry, the president of Swann Galleries, 104 East 25th Street, Manhattan, the largest book-auction house in the country.
"The book auctions in the United States amount to about $50 million a year in sales," Mr. Lowry said. "The book sellers do about $150 million a year in sales."
"The biggest book sellers probably do under $5 million a year in sales," Mr. Lowry said. "The smaller ones probably do under $100,000 a year in sales."
 
Relying on Fewer to Make More
 And many of these houses now depend on a handful of very high priced items to make their profits, rather than the vast amounts of scholarly material that sold so well in the past. In the 1979-80 season, for example, Swann sold 17,600 lots for a total of $2.9 million; a decade later, it sold about 10,000 lots for $6.1 million.
But those collectors who can afford the high prices often have very different interests from their predecessors. And the lack of versatility by dealers has been matched by a change in the academic background of many collectors.
"Americans are not well versed in foreign languages," said T. Peter Kraus, a distant relative of Hans P. Kraus and the owner of Ursus Rare Books Ltd., at 981 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, one of the few open rare-book stores left in New York. "The European emigrants who came over before the war, and were the major rare-book dealers, had a general education in foreign and classical languages. Today most dealers only speak English and this limits them to English-language books."
"The decline in classical education has meant that books in Latin, Greek or Italian hold less appeal to today's collectors," added William J. Wyer, the head of rare books at Ursus.
 
Specialists Are More Common
 And even those who continue to collect rare books in the United States increasingly lack the broad knowledge that typified older collectors.
"You have people who specialize in one author," said Mr. Wyer, "who know everything about Charles Dickens's books, but a general connoisseurship is rarely found in collectors today."
"Collectors are now going the same route as the dealers," Mr. Lohf said. "They are specializing."
"There are fewer people who want to assemble the tangible proofs of the history of our intellectual development," the 78-year-old Mr. Goldschmidt said. "Many people only want to collect a few high points. This is part of the whole downgrading of the role of literature in American society and the increase in the role of the image. Now people are far less tempted to read. They are forever looking at pictures. You go into a fashionable bookstore and a large part of the books are hardly books at all."
The decline of the established houses, which could handle large stocks and ran shops that were accessible to the public, has hurt the collector's ability to gain general knowledge about the field.
 
What Was Once Goldschmidt
 Mr. Goldschmidt, whose shop at 1117 Madison Avenue, at 84th Street, combined rare books with the illustrated page, the association copy, original prints from Schongauer and Durer to Picasso and Matisse.
The shop was on the ground floor of a modern building. It was about 20 feet wide and about 60 feet deep. The books were behind glass cases and numerous framed prints or drawings, which ranged from the 16th to the 20th century, covered the walls.
"There were always over 100 items on display," Mr. Goldschmidt said, "whether we had an exhibition or not. This was very important to the graduate students and younger people who could not buy anything but who could wander around the shop."
Mr. Goldschmidt said that since World War II the number of major rare-book dealers in the New York area has fallen from about 50 well-stocked shops to about 20.
 
Emphasis on 'Star Items'
 "Keeping a good, diversified stock has become too expensive," Mr. Goldschmidt said. "The economics have killed the scholarly antiquarian bookseller. The shops that have fared best are those that have the star items."
"The auction houses have taken over many of the functions we used to have," he said, seated in his apartment overlooking Riverside Drive, "and being large and aggressive organizations they have done just about everything we hoped they wouldn't do. They go after collections, do appraisals and hire well-respected scholars to handle their stock."
The smaller shops, which specialize in limited numbers of books, can frequently only be visited by appointment and often do not sell lower-priced volumes that would appeal to collectors of more modest means or those who were first stepping into the market.
"If you want to become a collector there are no longer many stores where you can just drop in and browse," Mr. Wyer said. "The loss of the open rare-book shop is tragic. A whole culture has disappeared."

HEADLINE: Not All Fun and Games for Sports Commissioners

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
Being the commissioner of a major sport has to be the greatest job in the world, right? All the games you want to see. Best seat in the house. Travel. World Series. Super Bowl. Slam-dunk contests. Hockey night at the Forum any night you want.
 "That's the fun part," Pete Rozelle, who served as commissioner of the National Football League for 30 years, said with a hearty laugh. "I also remember the litigation, the legislation, the internal problems." 
 Indeed, the officials who run major sports leagues have to be equal parts chief executive officer, public-relations expert, tax-law and antitrust expert, economist, litigator, judge, police officer and, lastly, diplomat within the growing international sports venues.
 So, while the best seats in the house may be enviable to some, the ability to sit in them and also turn in what are often 12-hour workdays, and nights, requires the deft touch of the most gifted juggler.
 
With a Capital 'T'
 "The thing that is so difficult, and definitely never on the agenda, is trouble," Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball, said. "It's the constant disruption that cuts across everything. I have no way to evaluate how much of my time will get caught up in that, but it's more than I would ever have imagined."
 Vincent's path in particular has been strewn with rocks. Forced to make the transition on the run because of the death of his predecessor and close friend, Bart Giamatti, in September 1989, Vincent has had to deal with the earthquake-marred 1989 World Series, labor strife that included last spring's lockout, collusion and the investigation and subsequent disciplining of George Steinbrenner.
The year will end with Vincent awaiting release from a hospital in Greenwich, Conn., where he is recovering from a bacterial infection that resulted in the removal of his spleen.
 "In terms of my health, I'm going to be fine," said the 52-year-old Vincent, who hopes to be back to a full schedule by the end of January. "None of this had anything to do with being commissioner. The doctors assure me that the bacteria, which caused an abscess on the spleen, was a fluke. It could have happened to me whether I was commissioner or in retirement in Cape Cod."
John Ziegler, the president of the National Hockey League, cannot relate to having to pull a World Series through an earthquake. But he, too, knows of trouble and the various sorts of demanding issues that confront commissioners daily.
 "This is my 14th year and I can only remember one summer where something crucial or some crisis didn't use up the off season," said Ziegler, who is dean of the chief executives of the four major professional sports.
 
'Some Unique Rigors'
 Paul Tagliabue, who succeeded Rozelle in November 1989, has also learned just how precious a commodity time is. "You have some unique rigors," Tagliabue said. "The number of teams, different ownerships, the issues create intense pressures. Once you're in this job, you realize it may be more difficult and rigorous than one held by a major officer of a large corporation."
 It has not always been that way. When Rozelle succeeded Bert Bell, there were 12 teams in the N.F.L. Now there are 28. "The first couple of years, I visited training camps and had more personal contact with the players," Rozelle said. "Then it got bigger. The high visibility has increased greatly with the general public, the owners, the media. Now, almost everything is done in the glare of the spotlight. But you can't feel sorry for yourself. You cope with it. That's a given."
 It has also been a given that as the sport expands, the central structure has to become more sophisticated.
 In the late 1960's, Larry O'Brien, then the commissioner of the National Basketball Association, heeding an internal study that advised that the small-office approach was outmoded, appointed a deputy commissioner/chief operating officer.
David Stern, the current commissioner, was not available last week to comment on the demands of his position. Russ Granik, who serves as Stern's deputy, said: "The way we're set up, I tend to be involved with the day-to-day running of the league, dealing with public relations, broadcasting, security. David becomes involved when issues become major."
 
Rewarded for Their Troubles
 Each commissioner, of course, receives handsome compensation for his work. Stern last winter received a contract reportedly worth a whopping $25 million for 10 years, plus a $10 million bonus. Tagliabue has a five-year contract that pays him approximately $700,00 a year, and Vincent earns $650,000. Ziegler's compensation has not been reported but is presumed to be less than that of the other executives.
When Ziegler was offered the N.H.L. presidency in 1977, he accepted on the condition that the sport modernize. Thus was Ziegler empowered to participate in labor negotiations and to involve ownership more in league activities.
"We operate by committee," Ziegler said. "I don't chair every one of the approximately 17, but I do chair probably two-thirds." The N.H.L.'s central administration also includes an executive vice president (Brian O'Neill) as well as vice presidents of marketing and public relations (Steve Ryan), broadcasting (Joel Nixon), legal counseling (Gil Stein), finance (Ken Sawyer) and hockey operations (Jim Gregory).
 
Many Hands to Shake
 Granik and Stern have worked together at the N.B.A. for 14 years, both having served as general counsel under O'Brien. Granik said Stern's time was taken up by a great deal of ceremonial and public appearances, including meetings with corporate sponors. "But when we have problems," Granik said, "David doesn't run away from them, he gets involved."
In baseball, Giamatti also delegated, bringing Vincent in as the game's first deputy and chief operating officer in 1989. Steve Greenberg now fills that position and handles nuts-and-bolts issues, like the Steinbrenner investigation.
 As for the N.F.L., Rozelle said that during the latter stages of his administration he also wanted to reorganize. But he was also contemplating retirement and, said the 64-year-old Rozelle, "I didn't want to make changes with a new commissioner coming in."
 Tagliabue did after his first season. Last March, he created several senior positions and upgraded others. The N.F.L. now has an executive vice president and league counsel (Jay Moyer) and a director of club administration and international development (Roger Goodell), as well as vice presidents of broadcasting and productions (Val Pinchbeck) and communications and development (Joe Browne).
 Despite the diversification, it's hard for a commissioner to discharge his obligations to owners, Government officials, sponsors and the public. Dealing with so many constituencies can intrude on private lives.
 "You make a conscious effort when it comes to family, but it doesn't mean you're always successful," said Rozelle. "My wife, children and stepchildren were always understanding. Still, it was difficult to establish a personal life the last 10 years on the job."
 While trying to strike that delicate balance, the commissioners still manage to cram more and more into their schedules. By Tagliabue's estimate, he will attend approximately 18 games this season. Ziegler estimates he sees 35 to 40 hockey games in a season.
 
Making the Rounds
 Vincent, too, has made games and appearances a major part of his routine. Partly paralyzed in both legs because of an injury suffered in college, Vincent nonetheless accomplished in 1990 something none of his seven predecessors did: visiting all the teams' home parks (now 26) in a single season.
 Cognizant that people might believe such demands caused his illness, Vincent said such thoughts are erroneous.
"The doctors first mentioned travel when they were doing their usual crossword puzzle when trying to find a cause," he said. "It was just one of the checklist points, but then they found the abscess, which was the cause of the illness."
 Vincent said he expected to work from his home during January, being "very much involved by telephone." And he said he was eager to hit the road again and vowed to do so when the first pitch is thrown. Tagliabue said he understood fully.
"Our philosophies are similar," the football commissioner said. "We both love the sport. It's important to get out to the games. Yes, it can be relaxing, but it's also a part of doing the job."

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: EUROPEANS PLAN A SPECIAL SESSION ON CRISIS IN GULF;
White House's View

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
An Administration official said tonight that the White House was not alarmed by the prospect of the European Community meeting and indicated that the Bush Administration had assurances from European Community nations that they would not undertake any diplomatic initiatives that departed from the Persian Gulf policy of the United States and the United Nations.
The official said the United States had no specific agreement with the community to act on Washington's behalf. But he indicated that with Jan. 3 approaching quickly, the United States would welcome a friendly third party's involvement in the quest for a peaceful settlement of the crisis. President Bush has proposed Jan. 3 as the latest reasonable date for direct talks with Iraq. 
 "Our position is as it was: no negotiations," the official said. "Having said that, anything that can facilitate a peaceful solution would obviously be a welcome step. Any such move or undertaking by the E.C. should be geared toward confirming for Saddam the seriousness of the situation, that the international community is aligned, that the international community is ready to work in unison both diplomatically and militarily against him, and that he has to take this very seriously."
In that context, the official said, a European initiative "could be beneficial." He said the European Community carried "economic and financial clout as an institution that could drive home the message to Saddam in a way that so far we seem to have failed to do through other means."
"But the understanding has to be as always that the European Community members as individual countries, and as a group through NATO, are supportive of United States policy and of the U.N. resolutions," the official said.
The official added, "Irrespective of the shape that this new move takes, or its venue, we're confident that they're not going to do something as individuals or as a group that goes against United States policy."

World Markets Begin 1991 Pressed by Problems of 1990

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
World stock markets begin 1991 facing the threat of a war in the Persian Gulf, recessions or economic slowdowns around the world, and dismal earnings -- the same factors that drove stock markets down sharply in 1990. Yet many market watchers expect a better year than the one ending today.
In 1990, these pressures resulted in a worse year for stocks than even 1987, when stock markets crashed in October. 
 The Financial Times World index for 24 markets, excluding the United States, dropped 30.8 percent in local currency in 1990, compared with a 1.7 percent dip by the end of 1987. For American investors, the sharp drop in the dollar cut the 1990 decline to 24.6 percent. But in 1987, the dollar's fall and a smaller decline in equities resulted in a 24.2 percent gain. While stock markets are open today in the United States, Britain and Cananda, most markets ended the year on Friday.
Many forecasts for 1991 are based on what could turn out to be optimistic assumptions: a quick recovery from a recession in the United States, a peaking of interest rates worldwide, no war or a quick war in the Persian Gulf and a cap on oil prices. If these assumptions do not hold, markets could be in for another troubling year.
The abrupt resignation earlier this month of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, provided a vivid reminder of the fragility of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's experiment in the Soviet Union. An unraveling there -- or more problems in Eastern Europe -- could also send stock markets tumbling, especially in Germany and Europe.
Striking a pessimistic note, Madhav Dhar, global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said: "The economic, political and corporate outlook is not right. The markets are not reacting as if the news is gloomy. We think the fundamental troubles around the world are not fully discounted in the prices. We think the markets are poised to respond to good news and that is a mistake."
Sander Cseh of Cseh International in Philadelphia was more optimistic. "We could have a lot of good things happening, even if there is a war," he said. "If it is a short war, you are going to have a huge decline in oil prices, and that will benefit cyclical companies. If gasoline prices drop, consumers will be more optimistic."
The uncertainties in the outlook for 1991 revolve around the assumptions for the pace of the slowdowns in Europe and Japan, the length and depth of the recessions in the United States and elsewhere, and the course of interest rates. Stock analysts also differ over the impact of a capital shortage around the world as both the Japanese and the Germans keep money at home that used to buoy markets abroad.
But analysts seem to agree that the motivation for buying equities in 1991 is the attractive values one can find, not the prospect of strong earnings. "The most important factor in the market in 1991 is the valuations," said Guy Rigden, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London.
In addition, many analysts think that stock markets have further to fall because they have rebounded since the lows reached last fall.
While there is a split on the outlook for 1991, there is general agreement, in hindsight, on much of what went wrong in 1990, a year that began with some forecasts of 15 percent increases in markets.
Not only did the experts not foresee the invasion of Kuwait, but they missed the quickness of the economic decline and the high level at which interest rates have remained. Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, major stock markets around the world were in a swoon or ready for one because of the high interest rates and the deterioration of the economy over all.
 
'A Match Touched to Tinder'
 "I believe that the Aug. 2 hostilities were simply a match touched to tinder that was already dry," said Lawrence W. Harris 3d, director of of Lombard Odier International in London.
In the end, 1990 was a year of new highs and new lows for many stock markets. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks plunged 28 percent from a record high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989 to 28,002.07 by April 2. After the Iraqi invasion it slumped to below 20,000 before closing Friday for the year at 23,848.71, down 38.7 percent for the year.
New Zealand's Barclay's index is at its lowest level in more than six years. In Australia, the All Ordinaries dropped to a 30-month low. And in Norway, despite the benefit its oil-rich economy receives from higher prices, the All Share index fell from a record high on the day of the Iraqi invasion to a string of 1990 lows at the end of the year.
One surprise is that two countries now thought to be in recessions -- the United States and Britain -- have performed relatively well. For the year through Friday, the Financial Times index for Wall Street is down 7.2 percent, the sixth-best performance of the 24 markets in local currencies. Britain's market is No. 4 in dollar terms, up 4.6 percent because the strong pound wiped out the market's local losses when results were turned to dollars.
 
Interest Rates
 A main factor in the performance of markets last year was interest rates, which are likely to have a strong effect next year, too. In Europe, the interest rate impact is heightened by the discipline of the European Monetary System, which links the currencies of 10 countries. In effect, it has forced Europe to match the high-interest-rate policy of Germany, even though the Government in Britain, where the economy is in a recession, and the Governments in France and Italy, where the economies are slowing down, would like to cut rates to lessen the economic damage.
The Milan stock market, which had been the pick of analysts last spring, wound up falling 28.8 percent in local terms, according to the Financial Times index, the fourth-worst performance of the year. In dollar terms, the loss was reduced to 20 percent. For 1991, many economists predict Italy will have one of the slowest-growing economies in Europe.
The French market, another popular one earlier in the year, also fell sharply as France's economy began to slow and it felt the backlash of the Persian Gulf crisis. The Paris Bourse was down 25.7 percent for the year in local terms and 15.7 percent in dollars, according to the Financial Times Index.
In Britain, despite the emerging recession, the market was one of the best performers of the year for dollar investors, with a rise of 4.6 percent. But for locals it was not that bad either, declining 12.2 percent in pounds, the eighth-best performance in the index. A key reason the market suffered less than others was North Sea oil production, which insulated Britain and its stock market from the impact of the sharp jump in oil prices.
Britain is also one of the markets of choice for many managers next year, partly because of the good values in the market.
 
Shipping Stocks Hurt
 Norway is another oil exporter whose stock market fared better than others. Unlike Britain's, Norway's market had a sharp decline after the invasion because the crisis hurt shipping stocks. The British market had most of its decline before the invasion because of its faltering economy and high interest rates. Norway's market finished fifth in local currency and dollars, declining 8.9 percent kroner and increasing 1.9 percent in dollar terms.
The Frankfurt market soared to a record high in March amid euphoria about Eastern Europe, only to succumb to the worries about the cost of German unificiation later in the spring.
Rallies after that were halted when economic worries came to the fore and Iraq invaded Kuwait. For the year, the market is down 20.1 percent in marks. The strong mark halved that loss to 9.7 percent for dollar investors.
Analysts are divided on the outlook for 1991, with some still worried about the negative consequences for equities of the cost of German unification and the potential for even another rise in German interest rates. But the longer-term benefits of German unification and the fact that the economy is expected to be one of the strongest performers in Europe make it attractive to some.
Tokyo's stock market was the worst performing stock market in the Financial Times index, falling 40.4 percent in yen terms, a notch worse than the 39.2 percent plunge in New Zealand's stock market.
The Japanese market's fall from a record high at the end of 1989 was swift, as the market was undermined by a weakening yen, rising interest rates, higher oil prices and politicial uncertainty.
As with Germany, there is a divided opinion over the Japanese outlook. Many managers prefer to stay away because of the high cost of Japanese stocks. But others, including Merrill Lynch, are betting that interest rates in Japan may finally be at their peak, given recent data showing the economy to be slowing.
 
Mexico Earns the Top Rank
 Mexico's market rose 97 percent in pesos and 79.2 percent in dollar terms, giving it the top ranking for the third year in a row. The Government's success in dealing with its debt and its effort to open the economy have made the stock market a great bet.
Hong Kong eked out a gain of 4.9 percent in local terms and 5 percent in dollars, making it the second- and third-ranked market, respectively. Its performance was based on the strong rally in the first half that finally brought it back from the low levels it hit after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989.
"Hong Kong is marching to a different tune than to what is going on in the rest of the world," said Mr. Harris of Lombard Odier Internatinal. The market, he added, is less affected by high interest rates and the Persian Gulf crisis than most other stock markets. Analysts still like it because its stocks are cheap and they are a little less worried about the impact from the takeover by China in 1997.
Austria, one of the smallest European markets, also did well relatively, falling only 4.4 percent in schillings and rising 7.7 percent in dollars, making it the second-best performer of the year. But part of the reason it held up so well was the cushion it gained from a huge rally at the beginning of the year on the back of Eastern Europe euphoria. While the German market was up just 5 percent in the first six months of the year, Austria's market jumped almost 33 percent.

HEADLINE: David Saperstein, 89, a Lawyer Who Helped to Create the S.E.C.

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
David Saperstein, a corporate lawyer who helped put together the Securities Exchange Commission and then fought questionable market practices as one of its top officials, died on Friday at Palisades General Hospital in North Bergen, N.J. He was 89 years old and lived in Weehawken.
Taking office at the height of the country's economic crisis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt demanded prompt action. The job to regulate the banks and stock exchanges fell to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency and its counsel, Ferdinand Pecora, named as his assistant, Mr. Saperstein, a young lawyer with experience in banking cases and municipal corporations. 
The committee set out to write the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that created the commission. Mr. Saperstein helped draft the legislation and was at the center of the hearings and investigations that occupied the Senators in 1933.
Mr. Saperstein's role for the Senate committee grew as the committee stepped up its inquiries into banking and stock market dealings. He supervised the committee staff members in collecting information until he joined the S.E.C. in 1934 as its trading and exchange division director.
 
Watched Trading Activities
 On Oct. 1 of that year, the S.E.C. took full control of the securities markets. To put bite into S.E.C. regulations, Mr. Pecora chose Mr. Saperstein for the broad knowledge he had gained of the stock exchanges and their ways. Mr. Saperstein's division was charged with watching trading activities on the markets nationwide. His interpretations of S.E.C. rules and regulations deeply affected those activities.
By 1935, Mr. Saperstein posted a "rogues' gallery" of some 30,000 names to weed out fake stock salesmen and get-rich-quick promoters accused of preying on unwitting clients during the boom days. His division examined applications for registration as securities traders and held hearings on those suspected of shady practices.
It also drafted the rules for over-the-counter markets and, in general, was a linchpin of the S.E.C. apparatus.
In 1937, Mr. Saperstein was prominently mentioned as a candidate for Commissioner. But he said consideration for his family convinced him to leave Government service, and he returned to private practice.
He continued as a corporate lawyer until he retired in 1982 from what was then the firm of Silver, Saperstein, Barnett & Solomon in Manhattan.
Mr. Saperstein is survived by his wife, the former Louise Lederer; a daughter, Sue Bernstein of Torrance, Calif.; a son, Roy, of Harbor City, Calif.; a sister, Shirley Weinstein of Chicago; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

He died of a brain hemorrhage, a company spokesman said. 
 With his brother Thomas, Mr. Long founded the retail drug company in Oakland, Calif., in 1938. The Longs chain, now based in Walnut Creek, employs 14,000 people in 257 retail drug stores in six Western states and did $2 billion in business last year.
Several years ago, Mr. Long's son Robert was named president and chief executive officer of the company, but the father continued to oversee operations. Thomas Long is retired but continues as a member of the board.
Joseph Long was also a former director of Safeway Stores, Western Department Stores, Cutter Laboratories and several other companies.
 
Education and Environment
 An advocate of educational and environmental causes, Mr. Long donated millions of dollars to the University of California and wildlife institutions. Among his contributions was $3.2 million to the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center.
He also established the Foundation for Excellence at the School of Pharmacy at the University of California at San Francisco and set up a marine laboratory at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Mr. Long served as chairman and co-founder of the California State Parks Foundation and was co-founder and president of the California Waterfowl Association.
A native of Covelo, Calif., he graduated in 1933 from the University of California at Berkeley and stayed on for three years of graduate studies in economics and public administration.
He is survived by two sons: Robert M. of Lafayette, Calif., and Kirk, who lives in Spain; two daughters, Nancy Fink of Berkeley and Marion Souyoultzis of Piedmont, Calif.; two brothers, Thomas J. of Alamo and Ralph of Millbrae, Calif.; two sisters, Sarah Sweeney of El Sobrante, Calif., and Leta Lowry of Walnut Creek, and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: ON YOUR OWN;
Even Weekend Skiers Are Off to the Races

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
RECREATIONAL ski racing is exploding, not only in the number of skiers running gates, but also in the quantity and variety of races available. Practically on any weekend skiers can find downhill races, either as part of a sponsored series or as individual events staged by ski areas for clubs, corporations or just for fun. There are even national programs specifically for bartenders and chefs.
"As people get to be better skiers, they want more challenge," said Steve Lathrop, an organizer of the Corporate Challenge team races and former member of the United States Ski Team. "At the same time, with the gas prices and economic problems, people are skiing closer to home, which means they are on smaller hills. When that gets boring, they set up some poles to create more challenge." 
 Organized ski racing for amateurs began 22 years ago when the National Standard Race (Nastar) was created by Ski magazine. Through a handicapping system, skiers of all ages and abilities could compete, win medals and compare themselves to other skiers, as well as measure their own improvement from race to race.
When Nastar started in 1968, eight ski areas held races and about 2,000 skiers competed. Last season 180 ski areas held Nastar races for more than 250,000 adults and children. "Every year we set new growth goals," said Lisa Kaye, director of public relations for World Wide Ski Corporation, which runs the Nastar program. "And every year, we exceed those goals."
One factor that has contributed to the growth of recreational racing is sponsor financing of elaborate races and national finals for top finishers. Usually there is an entry fee for competitors that may include lift tickets, parties and merchandise.
"A lot of sponsors are targeting programs to recreactional racers because they are people who spend money," said Cindy Kaiser-Stark, who runs the Ski Club Challenge, a nationwide series for club teams.
 Prizes and awards as well as expense-paid trips to national finals inspire many amateurs to train every weekend and attend racing clinics and camps. This makes the events more exciting to watch with time differentials in hundredths of seconds, but also eliminates less-skilled and less-dedicated skiers from the top spots.
"Over the years, the quality of the skiers has been improving," said Lathrop. "Sometimes recreational skiers get on a course and they don't do so well. This humbles them and they try to improve their skiing."
Here are the major race series and events with telephone contacts for schedules, locations, eligibility requirements and entry forms.
Nastar
Races are held at 180 ski areas, usually on a daily basis. Entry fees range from $3 to $5. Racers are handicapped according to age, sex and ability for gold, silver and bronze medals.
