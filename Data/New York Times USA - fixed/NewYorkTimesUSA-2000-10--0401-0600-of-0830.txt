DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As global leaders move toward welcoming Serbia into the community of Western nations, the White House is considering the issue of aid to Belgrade's fledgling democratic government. The urgent question, as Congress heads toward adjournment, is whether to tie such aid to the prosecution of Serbia's war criminals.
Both the European Union and the United States have moved swiftly to reward the Serbian people for their ouster of Slobodan Milosevic by taking steps to recognize President Vojislav Kostunica and resume normal diplomatic relations with Belgrade. Steps have also been taken to lift the embargoes on oil and civilian flights and to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Yugoslavia. 
 The Serbian people -- exhausted by war, corruption, inflation and unemployment -- deserve such political and economic rewards. But further support, directly or through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, should hinge on Belgrade's willingness to surrender war criminals harbored in Serbia to the International Tribunal at The Hague. Those indicted -- including Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Milan Milutinovic -- must be held accountable for the atrocities that scar lives and landscapes from Srebenica to Suva Reka.
The European Union and the Clinton administration are equivocating on whether further aid should be linked to Belgrade's surrendering these men to the tribunal. They are wrong to do so. The failure to hand over these suspected war criminals will decapitate the tribunal's efforts and set back the cause of international humanitarian law. The extradition of Mr. Milosevic and his cronies is also crucial to building trust in Serbia's neighboring governments.
Indeed, such trust is fundamental to stability in the region -- and the only sure basis for an exit strategy for American troops. Kosovars, Montenegrins, Albanians and Macedonians have ample reason to be concerned about the durability of any agreements with Belgrade as long as Mr. Milosevic lurks in the shadows.
Serbia must soon come to terms with these neighbors: Belgrade must end its support of those who have undermined the full integration of Bosnia Herzegovina. Mr. Kostunica's government must also assure regional leaders, especially in Kosovo, that it will respect the aspirations and political rights of minorities.
If Mr. Kostunica and his coalition partners advance on such a course and comply with the war crimes tribunal, the United States and Europe should be generous with aid to help rebuild Serbia's tattered economy. Serbia's membership in international and regional organizations should also be on the agenda.
History will be unkind and unforgiving in judging us if we fail to support the work of the war crimes tribunal at this critical time. The European Union, the Clinton administration and Congress should set a course that brings a democratic Serbia into Europe while affirming a collective commitment to international law and justice.

I.B.M. Invests to Profit From Latest Chips

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Last week, I.B.M. announced a plan to pour $2.5 billion into constructing a new microchip factory in East Fishkill, N.Y., the biggest investment in I.B.M.'s history. It then underscored its intent to be a superpower in semiconductors well into the 21st century by committing an additional $2.5 billion to modernize chip plants in Burlington, Vt., and overseas.
Despite the huge sums, I.B.M.'s risks seem remarkably modest. 
 The East Fishkill factory is not scheduled to be ready before 2003, putting I.B.M. up to a year behind rivals like Intel and NEC in the industry's transition to making chips on 12-inch silicon wafers instead of today's 8-inch wafers. The bigger format should bolster profitability by yielding hundreds more chips per wafer. But I.B.M. says it is content to lag behind a bit -- so that others bear the brunt of any kinks in new machinery being designed for handling the bigger sizes.
As for the rest of the modernizing, it is a drive to capitalize on a recent burst of I.B.M. design and manufacturing innovations before competitors catch up.
The innovations might seem obscure to those outside semiconductor circles -- techniques for replacing aluminum connectors with more efficient copper wire, novel insulating designs that allow processors to run faster while consuming less power and so forth. But the new wrinkles are cropping up in electronic devices from the largest mainframes to the slenderest cellular phones as well as communications routers, switches and countless other components that drive the growth of the Internet.
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive of I.B.M., said last week that demand for the kinds of chips I.B.M. makes for itself and other electronics companies was "white hot." With most of that demand stemming from the growth of the Internet and telecommunications, no end is in sight.
"We've strapped ourselves to a rocket," said John Kelly III, the senior vice president for the I.B.M. microelectronics unit. "The $5 billion is just to keep fueling it."
Chip making is a small piece of I.B.M.'s balance sheet. The company does not break out results for its microelectronics group, but analysts estimate it will contribute about $4.2 billion, or just under 5 percent, of I.B.M.'s projected revenues of around $90 billion this year. Thomas Kraemer, a Merrill Lynch analyst, estimates the unit is growing at a 30 percent clip and that profits are climbing almost as fast.
No wonder longtime I.B.M. watchers like Sam O. Albert, an information technology consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., said the $5 billion plan "wasn't a tough call."
But the decision does reflect a tough call Mr. Gerstner made seven years ago, shortly after he arrived at I.B.M. to confront the task of turning around what was then a loss-ridden company. After studying the work in I.B.M.'s laboratories and the cost structure of its manufacturing, Mr. Gerstner decreed that I.B.M. would no longer make electronic components like disk drives and microchips solely for its own use.
That order freed executives in the components groups to produce as much as they could sell, even if some of those customers were outsiders who could use I.B.M. innovations to compete with other parts of I.B.M. To reinforce the mandate, Mr. Kelly moved researchers from the company's Yorktown Heights, N.Y., lab, as well as application developers from its chip plants, into a development center in East Fishkill with the assignment of rapidly pushing the most promising technology into production.
Since then, more than $1 billion has been invested in the development center, which currently employs 1,400 workers in East Fishkill and 300 more technicians at other I.B.M. sites; some 200 technical experts dispatched from various customers and partners are also working at the center.
The new strategy goaded the rest of I.B.M. to race ahead with products incorporating those components before I.B.M.'s competitors did.
"Putting it in the marketplace put pressure on the rest of the company to adapt new technology rapidly," said Stephen C. Dube, an analyst who follows I.B.M. for Wasserstein Perella Securities.
For much of the last decade, the strategy's perils were more prominent than its payoffs. I.B.M.'s microelectronics group invested heavily in joint ventures to design new memory chips and expand its dynamic random access -- or D-RAM -- memory chip production, then paid dearly for it when the market for such commodity chips crashed in 1996. Unwinding that mistake has taken years. The last step was I.B.M.'s pending sale of its share of a memory chip plant in Manassas, Va., to Toshiba, its partner.
Nor has Mr. Gerstner's open-door strategy always helped I.B.M.'s product groups. The EMC Corporation, for instance, is using I.B.M.-made disk drives to battle I.B.M. for the data storage market. And I.B.M.'s agreement to sell Dell Computer $16 billion of components over seven years is strengthening one of the toughest competitors of I.B.M.'s struggling PC group.
Mr. Kelly said, "1999 was a key year. That's when outside customers stopped asking me whether I.B.M. would get preferential treatment."
I.B.M. says that its hardware units are generally making better use of its chip innovations than any rivals are. The latest example, scheduled to be announced today, is a new line of large I.B.M. servers with a base price of $420,000 that run the Unix operating system.
I.B.M. said the new computers used copper circuitry and chips with an innovative I.B.M. insulation design that allows transistors to work more quickly. It said its tests showed that the new server, using just 24 processors, performed transactions 40 percent faster than the more expensive "flagship" computer with 64 processors from Sun Microsystems, the Unix market leader.
Such developments signal how the microelectronics unit hopes it can help I.B.M. far beyond the sales and profit it generates directly. But the unit's success is measured by more specific benchmarks, like whether the development center churns out enough leading-edge technology that the royalties, licensing and outside joint development contributions more than cover the center's costs.
"The second guy pays the first guy," said Bijan Divari, vice president for technology and emerging products at the microelectronics unit. "If you're not first, the whole thing unravels."
Lately, I.B.M. has been first or nearly so with an impressive number of microchip developments. The hit parade began in 1997 with I.B.M.'s announcement that it devised an economical method of laying copper circuits on microchips, a much more efficient conductor than aluminum. So far, I.B.M. is the only microchip maker mass-producing such chips, though Motorola and some others are striving to catch up.
In 1998, in a similar breakthrough, I.B.M. said it had overcome the longstanding challenge of efficiently laying a very thin layer of silicon under the transistors on chips and insulating them from the thick substrate below. The technology, known as S.O.I. for silicon on insulator, bolsters chip performance up to 35 percent by allowing chips to handle power much more efficiently.
I.B.M. also figured out how to use a soft insulating polymer from Dow Chemical to cram copper circuits more closely together, allowing chip designers to increase processor speed and reliability. Another series of innovations gave I.B.M. the technology lead in handling silicon germanium, a material especially suited for making the kind of compact, high-performance chips for handling radio signals used in cell phones and other wireless communications devices.
But I.B.M.'s real advantage, according to analysts like Trevor Yancey at IC Insights in Scottsdale, Ariz., is coming from aggressively integrating so many of the new technologies. If things pan out as I.B.M. plans, that process will reach a new pinnacle at the new factory in East Fishkill.

Chart: "Minute Differences"
I.B.M. will manufacture computer chips in its new factory planned for East Fishkill, N.Y., which will incorporate numerous advances in chip design within the same chip. Here are the main components of a microprocessor and two major developments that the plant's chips will feature.

1. COPPER WIRING -- Provides a better electrical conductor than the aluminum now widely used. I.B.M. developed a practical method for making chips with copper.
 
2. SILICON OXIDE INSULATOR -- Makes it possible for chips to operate faster while using less power by keeping electrical current from leaking downward.
 
SILICON WAFER -- The substrate, or structure, that the chip is built on.
 
SILICON -- A thin layer of silicon in which the current flows when allowed to by the transistor.
 
TRANSISTORS -- Essentially on-off switches for the current, millions of which are on a typical chip.

Soldier of Fortune Toughs Out Changing Times

BYLINE: By JIM MOSCOU 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Robert K. Brown, a retired Army colonel, snatches a ringing phone while sitting amid strewn manuscripts, laundry, defused ordnance, plaques, pictures and a mock human brain in a clear bucket of bubbling water.
"Maximus!" he snaps. 
 He is fielding a barrage of telephone assaults in his Boulder, Colo., office on a busy Saturday morning. The founder, editor and publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine is not a patient man.
Slam. The receiver goes down and Maximus -- Mr. Brown's self-assigned nickname, a reference to the Russell Crowe character in "Gladiator" who cheats death only to rise again and fight the Roman establishment -- spits a round of tobacco juice into an aging coffee mug.
He is brash, cantankerous, egotistical, intelligent and always in your face. He never sees gray on an issue.
This week, Mr. Brown celebrated his magazine's 25th anniversary at its annual Las Vegas convention. That makes him a survivor. But the convention drew only 250 people, half the number it did in the early 1980's. It was further confirmation that though the world's first and only supermarket tabloid for mercenaries, mercenary-wannabes and anyone fascinated by combat and conflict remains one of the most identifiable military brands around, it no longer carries the impact it once did.
Time and the world have caught up to the 67-year-old Mr. Brown. At the heart of his success was the magazine's unusual, but popular, editorial mission: Soldier of Fortune's foreign correspondents often do not simply report from trouble spots, they join the fight. And the magazine has consistently been one of the greatest media advocates for disgruntled Vietnam veterans. It was anger over their treatment that led Mr. Brown to start the magazine in 1975 after returning from two tours of duty.
But times have changed. "Now, the cold war is over," he said. "You don't have the interest in those countries. And, the Vietnam veteran is older, more mellow. He's gotten a certain amount of acceptance and the recognition that he didn't have 25 years ago."
The changes have left the magazine searching for its editorial place in face of a new world order and declining profits. While a steady base of 20,000 subscribers "keeps the engines running," Mr. Brown said (the magazine's circulation is not independently audited), he acknowledges, and others at Soldier of Fortune confirm, his newsstand sales have plummeted the last 10 years to around 40,000 in a good month, far from its high of 150,000 during the cold war.
"Soldier of Fortune has become an oxymoron," said Samir Husni, a professor of media studies at the University of Mississippi, who follows the magazine industry. "There was once a fortune to be made in being a soldier. There is no place where those folks can go and fight the good fight and make some money."
Dan Goure, deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a public policy research institution, said modern trends were not in the magazine's favor. A politically muddled world, job-producing economies, a fading romance with Rambo and a generation of young adults who were never drafted and never trained in war have inevitably whittled away Soldier of Fortune's market.
"Today, America's image of war is an F-16 at 20,000 feet dropping a precision bomb," Mr. Goure said. "High-tech conflicts and Soldier of Fortune are just incompatible."
But people who follow the magazine say Soldier of Fortune is likely to survive. Mr. Brown has already shifted its tone in light of bottom-line realities. Traditionally, the magazine practiced a particularly bloody form of "participatory journalism." When he had the cash, Mr. Brown dispatched not just a reporter but small mercenary "teams" to deliver supplies, train, write and fight. In 1981, Mr. Brown and the magazine spent $350,000 in a failed search for prisoners of war in Vietnam. In 1992, he sent fighters and writers to support Croatian forces.
But those efforts came when "we had the luxury of money," Mr. Brown said. With revenue shrinking -- Soldier of Fortune grossed about $2 million last year, down from $7 million in the early 1980's, he said -- the magazine's teams are grounded. Its emphasis has often shifted to domestic, less expensive, somewhat wonkier topics, like opposition to gun control; columns like the "Slick Willie Watch"; open-seas piracy; and warnings of Vietnam-like quagmires ("Colombia Burning: The Dark Future of Narco-Wars").
"Instead of shooting from the hip, they are shooting from the brain," Mr. Husni said.
Mr. Brown has also hedged his financial woes by licensing Soldier of Fortune's identity -- first to Hollywood in 1995 for a one-hour television action drama and earlier this year to Activision, which developed a Soldier of Fortune computer game. The series was canceled, but the game has grossed more than $5 million, according to PC Data, a market research firm.
Still, the magazine will have trouble shaking its reputation. "If you want to go find the mercenary to kill someone for you, you pick up a copy of Soldier of Fortune," Mr. Husni said. And that might be unfair: the magazine changed its policy regarding mercenary ads 15 years ago.
In 1993, the magazine and the Omega Group, its corporate entity, were held negligently liable after an assassin hired through a classified ad in Soldier of Fortune murdered a Georgia man in 1985. Mr. Brown lost a $4.3 million judgment. He settled the case for $200,000, and Soldier of Fortune has not run a similar classified ad since the murder.
Through it all, Mr. Brown says, he has been waiting patiently for the next big war or conflict to lift sales. In the meantime, back in his office, Mr. Brown's thoughts are on Sierra Leone and a September feature story in which his reporter (a South African mercenary) mans a machine gun on a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter for the government. Sierra Leone is battling a notoriously brutal rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, which killed one of the magazine's reporters in 1995. Like an old coach reminiscing of his playing days, he ponders his comeback.
"I still may go to Sierra Leone," he said.
To help fight or do a story?
"Both," he said. "I'm not going to bring a team. I'm just thinking of doing my memoirs and I can see that as an opener: The last hurrah! I'm too old to bust through the bush with a 60-pound pack, but I sure as hell can operate a machine gun out of an Mi-24. And nothing would give me more pleasure than some pay back for my guy."

Chevron to Acquire Texaco In a $36 Billion Stock Deal
Chevron, the nation's third-largest oil company, has agreed to buy Texaco for $36 billion in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil concern. The company's boards approved the deal, which is expected to be announced today.
The acquisition is likely to come under intense scrutiny by regulators, who could force the combined company to divest itself of certain assets, especially in states like California where the company would dominate the retail gas station business. Page A1. 

Judge Allows EBay Suit to Continue
A California judge has allowed six people to proceed with a lawsuit that strikes at the core of how eBay runs its business. The lawsuit, filed by people who say they bought autographed sports memorabilia later found to be fake, contends that eBay has a responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the sports memorabilia sold on its site. EBay counters that it merely operates a venue for sales and cannot be held liable for fraudulent goods. C6.
 
New Mission for Soldier of Fortune
The end of the cold war has left Soldier of Fortune magazine searching for its editorial place in the face of a new world order and declining profits. A steady base of 20,000 subscribers "keeps the engines running," says Robert K. Brown, its editor, but newsstand sales have plummeted over the last 10 years to about 40,000 in a good month, far from its high of 150,000 during the cold war. C16.
 
Exchange-Traded Security Planned
Epoch Partners, an investment bank in San Francisco, wants to create exchange-traded baskets of stocks for sale to customers of Charles Schwab and the Ameritrade online brokerage firm. The baskets would be called New Era Trust Securities, or Nets. C8.
 
Bringing E-Commerce Into the Fold
For large companies made up of disparate business units, the most difficult task often is creating a structure that can weave e-commerce through the various divisions smoothly. Two of the more popular approaches are either to appoint an e-business czar with the authority and budget to foist change on the entire organization or to create a team of e-business evangelists who can spread the Internet religion one corporate division at a time.

Apple Faces Future With Part of Past
At the heart of the new Apple Macintosh OS X operating system, expected to reach the market early next year, is Steven Jobs's 11-year-old Nextstep operating system. The fact that Mac users will be asked to move into the future by stepping into the past underscores the largest difficulty for Mr. Jobs since he returned to run Apple in 1997. A crucial question for Apple is whether it can successfully move its millions of customers from their current software systems to its yet-to-be-finished operating system. New Economy. C5.
 
Checking That Bow Tie for a Camera
The Plus Guard, a hand-held gadget the size of a makeup compact, lets users scan their surroundings for hidden audio bugs or wireless cameras that may be capturing sounds or pictures. When such a surveillance device is in the area, a red light goes on and an alarm on the device sounds. In the two months since the device has been distributed in the United States, 100 of the gadgets have been sold. But so far, there have been no reports of customers' uncovering hidden cameras or bugs. C5.

A Biography
By James Atlas
Illustrated. 686 pages. Random House. $35.
"I write from about 8 o'clock in the morning until 1," Saul Bellow once told an interviewer. "Then I go out and make my mistakes." As James Atlas makes clear in this exhaustively researched biography, Mr. Bellow's literary output and his mistakes have been equally prodigious. 
 He has produced one of the most remarkable bodies of work by an American novelist: most notably "Dangling Man" (1944), "The Adventures of Augie March" (1953), "Seize the Day" (1956), "Henderson the Rain King" (1959), "Herzog" (1964) and "Humboldt's Gift" (1975). He has also racked up most major literary awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, three National Book Awards and in 1976 the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Viewed in retrospect Mr. Bellow's long reign near the top of the American literary scene seems inevitable, almost preordained. Yet Mr. Atlas shows that it was anything but. He offers us glimpses of Mr. Bellow, unemployed and unpublished, writing at his mother-in-law's house while his young wife went off to work. At 25 he had yet to sell a story.
Fifteen years later, though a National Book Award winner, Mr. Bellow was disappointed that his fourth novel, the much admired "Seize the Day," had barely sold 5,000 copies, and was still accepting money from a father who was contemptuous of his literary aspirations. Mr. Bellow himself, Mr. Atlas shows, was never in doubt about his talent.
Because each of his novels reaches deeply into his past, offering "a bulletin on his own condition" invariably distorted by nostalgia and spite, Mr. Bellow has long had misgivings about anyone's relying on his fiction to get an accurate fix on his life. "Biography," he warned, "is a specter viewed by a specter."
"Bellow" isn't an authorized biography, but, as Mr. Atlas tells us, Mr. Bellow didn't refuse him, as he has refused others, permission to quote freely from letters, manuscripts and unpublished work. Mr. Bellow, who turned 85 last summer, was eventually won over by Mr. Atlas's dogged persistence. When Mr. Atlas asked Mr. Bellow's son Dan, "Why did he let me do it?," Dan explained, "He realized that you weren't going to go away."
For Mr. Atlas the central dynamic in Mr. Bellow's career has been his tendency "to tear up his life to feed his art": it "was as if he needed some obstacle, some impediment, to define himself against." Mr. Atlas's primary interest, then, is less Mr. Bellow's ideas or philosophy (which leave him cold) than the stormy marriages and literary friendships that became fodder for his fiction. Much of this hefty biography is taken up with the fallout of Mr. Bellow's failed marriages. (He is now with a fifth wife, 44 years his junior, with whom he had a daughter last year.)
Like the women in Mr. Bellow's novels, Mr. Atlas argues, the "women in his life remained for him secondary figures who served his own fantasies of them as providers, entrappers, sexual predators." For Mr. Atlas, Mr. Bellow's philandering and sexism were "still well within the normal range of male chauvinism for his day"; he is more persuasive in tracing Mr. Bellow's trouble with women back to the central trauma of his life: the death of his mother when he was a teenager, a loss Mr. Bellow never properly mourned. The men in his life haven't fared much better: Mr. Bellow regularly missed the funerals of close friends, reviled his enemies and never forgave a negative reviewer. "Bellow wasn't a nurturing person," Mr. Atlas suggests, because "he wanted the nurturing."
Weaving together the artistic triumphs and personal crises, Mr. Atlas captures the enormous excitement that greeted each of Mr. Bellow's groundbreaking novels of the 1950's and early 60's. He also shows how challenges to the establishment in the 1960's and early 70's upended Mr. Bellow's familiar role as outsider and victim. Where Mr. Bellow, the youngest son of poor Jewish immigrants, had long struggled to gain a foothold within "the WASP literary establishment," he now found himself defending the high culture that had finally embraced him and was now under siege.
As Mr. Bellow grew older, Mr. Atlas writes, "the bones of a deeply conservative, xenophobic vision of life emerged more clearly." The low point was Mr. Bellow's unfortunate remark: "Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus? The Proust of the Papuans? I'd be glad to read him."
Because Mr. Atlas's approach depends on discovering chunks of Mr. Bellow's life in his art, he tends to underestimate the extent to which Mr. Bellow has utterly transformed events from his life in his fiction, even when surface similarities teasingly remain. Mr. Bellow himself has chastised Mr. Atlas for "confusing fact with fiction."
In practice this means that Mr. Atlas can confidently declare that a character's first sight of his wife in "Herzog" "faithfully reproduces" Mr. Bellow's own experience, and he can insist, over Mr. Bellow's objections, that "Humboldt's Gift" is really a portrait of Delmore Schwartz (the subject of Mr. Atlas's previous biography) and then accuse Mr. Bellow of failing to get Schwartz right.
At the heart of this book is an unanswered question: Do the many unsettling facts Mr. Atlas unearths about Mr. Bellow's personal life devalue the novels, which he sees as emerging directly from Mr. Bellow's experiences? Or, alternatively, does Mr. Bellow's art somehow transcend the life, in which case why bother writing (or reading) literary biography? It is hard to understand why Mr. Atlas would spend more than a decade amassing the facts of Mr. Bellow's life and then sidestep the question of how they affect how he -- and by extension we -- now judge the novels and Mr. Bellow's place in the pantheon of American writers. It is the only serious flaw in a biography unlikely to be surpassed for some time.
The most melancholy page in "Bellow" appears in the acknowledgments, where Mr. Atlas lists those who have helped him who have since died, including Ralph Ellison, Leon Edel, Irving Howe, Saul Steinberg and Diana and Lionel Trilling. The list underscores the extent to which Mr. Atlas's "Bellow" is not only a compelling story of a great and flawed writer, one who continues to demand our attention, but also a portrait of an extraordinary (and now rapidly receding) epoch in the history of American letters.

HEADLINE: Stunts and Thrills at Daybreak;
Competitive Hysteria Drives the Morning News Programs

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
Dakota, a dog, was mad as hell and wasn't going to take it anymore.
It was hard enough to tolerate all the morning news-show producers crowding into his Silicon Valley town house at 2:30 a.m., maneuvering to get the first interview with his owner. Dakota was big news: just a few days earlier, he had been saved from a dangerously cold airplane cargo hold. 
 But the 10-year-old Basenji really lost it when CBS producers became angry at being bumped to last in the interview line and descended on Mike Bell, the dog's owner, during a live CNN appearance, taking off his microphone and cutting the interview short.
"The dog starts growling," Mr. Bell said. "He freaks out the guy who does the sound, who falls back into my refrigerator and my dog attacks him and tries to bite him. I just couldn't believe how cutthroat the morning news was."
But, he recalled: "The calmest people there were with NBC. They were just sitting back and enjoying it."
The story sums up the state of the morning news shows. Despite massive assaults by CBS and ABC the last two years, NBC's "Today" still stands confidently at the top of the heap. In the meantime, rest assured, America: while you sleep, network producers are conniving hard to serve up your first jolt of information and perky chat each morning.
In fact, the competition behind the scenes is the fiercest in morning-show history, longtime producers say. Accusations and counteraccusations are flying -- about stolen guests, outright sabotage and petty thievery. In essence, it's similar to the great old newspaper movies like "The Front Page."
"There's an air of hysteria," said Steve Friedman, executive producer of the CBS "Early Show," who previously ran "Today." "I've never seen this before, and I've been doing this a long time."
This is a profit-driven hysteria. The morning is the only time when the audience for network news is actually growing. The three morning programs pulled in nearly $400 million in revenue just through July -- nearly $100 million more than the three major evening network newscasts, according to estimates by Nielsen Monitor-Plus. What's more, though there is a difference of less than $20 million in revenue between NBC's first place "Nightly News" and CBS's third-place "Evening News," there was a difference of nearly $150 million in revenue between the first-place "Today" and the third-place "Early Show." And, by the end of July, "Today" had taken in nearly $80 million more than its closest competitor, "Good Morning America," according to Nielsen.
The main reason given for the growth in audience is the strong economy. More people are up and about before 9 a.m. because more people are working. Whatever the reason, with so much at stake, the networks are plowing more resources than ever into the shows. In fact, NBC extended the length of its show this month from two hours to three, taking on ABC's vaunted "Live with Regis."
The entrance of CBS's "Early Show" -- a year ago Nov. 1 -- and changes to ABC's "Good Morning America" clearly raised the intensity of the fighting. "Early Show's" Bryant Gumbel, Jane Clayson and their $30 million new glass studio off Central Park added a whole new team of competitors. Things had already begun heating up the previous January, when ABC brought in Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson to be co-hosts of a sagging "Good Morning America."
But neither show has cut much into Katie Couric and Matt Lauer's very significant lead on "Today." Though "Early Show" has gained on "Good Morning America" among young women, it is doing only as well as the third-place show it replaced, "CBS This Morning," in the overall ratings. And though Ms. Sawyer and Mr. Gibson have raised the profile and ratings of "Good Morning America," its audience still falls as much as two million viewers below that of "Today," which stands at six million. Last week, the audience of "Today" was the equivalent of those of its competitors combined.
Even his competitors give Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of "Today," credit for keeping the NBC show fresh. But, to some degree, the continued success is based on simple inertia: groggy morning viewers are a notoriously intransigent lot. It is difficult to lure them from a program they have come to watch as they throw on their clothes, brush their teeth and prepare children for school.
And there is only so much the programs can do to lure viewers from the enemy. The morning format is believed to be rigid by necessity, leaving little room for ingenuity. The prevailing wisdom is that in the first half hour of the shows, which begin at 7 a.m., most viewers are heading to work and want hard news and traffic and weather information. As time ticks by, the stay-at-home crowd becomes dominant and so the shows gradually switch to softer segments about health, cooking, dieting and preening.
But just because segments are softer, does not mean the competition is any less fierce.
The programs, for example, duel over bookings for their Friday outdoor concert series. On a Friday morning in June, Dionne Warwick was singing to an audience of hundreds in Manhattan's Bryant Park for "Good Morning America." A few blocks away, at Rockefeller Center, Sting sang to an audience of thousands for "Today."
In the middle of a song, Ms. Warwick was drowned out by a "Today" show helicopter, which hovered low overhead panning the crowd and Ms. Couric said, "We're looking at Bryant Park, where I understand some kind of concert is going on."
Mr. Zucker said he had sent the helicopter in the spirit of fun.
But Shelley Ross, the "Good Morning America" executive producer, called the stunt "shameful." She also accused "Today" of sending interns to the Bryant Park concert to persuade people to leave and see Sting, an accusation Mr. Zucker denies.
Another way to draw viewers, of course, is the old-fashioned way: landing exclusives, at which "Today" has a distinct advantage. Because of its large audience, "Today" is often the first stop on the media publicity train for celebrities and news makers. When it comes to morning bookings, "You start with 'Today,' period," said one prominent entertainment publicist.
Mr. Zucker said that sentiment allowed him to avoid much of the sniping in which his competitors must engage.
"By and large, we've tried to stay out of that fray," he said.
His competitors beg to differ.
Ms. Ross has charged Mr. Zucker with spitefully holding guests who are making the rounds of all the shows for too long, throwing off her schedule. A "Today" representative said the program would never intentionally hold a guest to hurt a competitor.
Ms. Ross, however, is in no way considered an angel. In fact, her competitors say she is a key ingredient in the morning war flambe.
Ms. Ross came to "Good Morning America" with a reputation as a tough and aggressive producer. She cut her teeth as a young woman at The Miami Herald and The National Enquirer, where she was a reporter and editor. Later, she led ABC's news magazine coverage of the O. J. Simpson case.
In February, "Today" accused Ms. Ross of throwing off its schedule by keeping Darva Conger, the bride in the Fox show, "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" in its studio too long for her to make an appearance on NBC.
"Good Morning America" further rankled "Today" last month when it publicly ribbed it for showing taped programs during its first week in Sydney, Australia, where it was based for the Olympics. Australia is 15 hours ahead of New York and the "Today" producers wanted to show Mr. Lauer and Ms. Couric in daylight.
During live reports from Sydney, "Good Morning America" flashed messages on the screen like "Really Live" and "Hey, it's really dark now!"
Citing that example, Mr. Friedman, a morning producer for 21 years, said he blamed "Good Morning America" in general, and Ms. Ross in particular, for causing an unprecedented level of distrust between the programs.
"It's a mean-spirited show," he said, echoing words Ms. Ross has used to describe "Today." "They are worse than I've ever seen. When these people tell you something, you check your wallet."
Mr. Friedman is no wallflower (he sometimes carries a Louisville slugger to meetings). But he pointed to the case last month of a Pittsburgh skydiving student who was caught on a plane's landing gear during a jump. He dangled for more than 40 minutes before the plane was safely landed.
"Early Show" producers jumped on the story and paid for the pilot, the student and the man who owned the skydiving school to fly to New York. They were put up in the Plaza Hotel the day before their appearance.
ABC producers found out they were staying at the Plaza and asked them to come to tape an interview for their morning show.
"I said it didn't feel right to me morally for me to do that," said Don Bick, who owns the skydiving school.
Mr. Bick said he relented after "Good Morning America" agreed to pay for another night in the city, and promised, in writing, not to show its taped interview until after the live interview with the "Early Show" was complete.
In the written promise, "Good Morning America" said it would tape the interview "with the full intention" of showing it after the live one was shown on CBS. The guests were driven to the "Good Morning America" studios and interviewed around midnight.
The next morning, Mr. Friedman said, he nearly exploded when he noticed on a control room monitor that "Good Morning America" had begun showing its taped segment about the skydiver as his program's live interview was still taking place.
Mr. Bick said, "I felt like somebody's whore at that point."
Ms. Ross said the men had participated in her program happily. And she said: "We really did honor the spirit of the commitment that we made to them. We had an agreement that CBS would go first and they went first."
She also said the taped interview was not seen until 45 seconds into her skydiving segment, leaving only about 40 seconds of actual interview overlap.
Ms. Ross denied she is mean-spirited.
"There is nothing mean-spirited; This is about journalism," she said. "I think that we operate within the time-honored journalism traditions of competition."
She added, "I think competition is healthy."

HEADLINE: In a Democratic Europe, Belarus Stays Authoritarian

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 15

 BODY:
If Europe's only remaining strongman of any note was shaken by the specter of Slobodan Milosevic's sudden fall from power in Yugoslavia, he showed no signs of it at the polls in his own country today.
Aleksandr Lukashenko, the autocratic president of Belarus, all but mocked his critics as he cast his vote this morning in a parliamentary election that the United States and other Western nations have called meaningless and that he insisted mirrors the will of his subjects. 
 "Now let us see the reaction by Western observers, and what kind of motivation they will have not to recognize the outcome of the election," he said on state television. "Over 70 percent of voters will turn up at polling places, and this will be our victory."
And in fact, there was no doubt that Mr. Lukashenko's backers would sweep the contest for 110 seats in the Belarussian Parliament, even though preliminary results were not expected before Monday.
Belarus's small democratic opposition, some of whose members sat in the Parliament before Mr. Lukashenko packed it in a 1996 constitutional referendum that outsiders say was rigged, has boycotted the election as a sham.
Even if opponents had not staged a boycott, it is doubtful whether they would have mustered much at the polls. Despite a stagnant economy and a growing reputation as Eastern Europe's backwater, Belarus has remained mostly loyal to Mr. Lukashenko and his charismatic, vaguely Soviet style of rule.
Opinion surveys indicated that only about 1 in 10 voters favored any sort of boycott of the elections.
In the opposition daily Narodnaya Volya, Anatoly Lebedko, a leading opposition figure, sarcastically challenged voters to shed apathy. "If you feel no need for change -- if you want Belarus to remain an enclave of lawlessness and poverty at the center of a fast-developing Europe -- then you are free to give your vote to those in power," wrote Mr. Lebedko, who heads the United Civic Party.
Opponents staged rallies this weekend in a score of cities, but an anti-Lukashenko protest in downtown Minsk on Saturday drew only about 3,000 marchers, far below the turnout organizers had hoped for. Mr. Lukashenko called the protesters "a bunch of windbags" and said that "the people will not let them get anywhere near power."
He said earlier this week that his government had taken all steps necessary to make the elections conform to the highest European standards of fairness. But the Minsk government has a history of suppressing dissent, including beatings of dissidents. In the last year, two prominent democratic activists have disappeared.
Among more recent measures, the police are enforcing an administrative rule that prohibits protesters from advocating an election boycott. Anti-Lukashenko activists said this week that more than 100 persons had been detained for violating it.
On Thursday, the Minsk correspondent for the English-language newspaper Moscow News was beaten in the stairwell of his apartment house, suffering a concussion. Newspaper officials said they believe that his critical reporting on Mr. Lukashenko was a factor in the attack.
The European Union sent a small delegation to observe the voting, but stressed beforehand that the presence of the group should not be interpreted as blessing the results.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes, a Budget Expert Distills Details

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
In the wee hours every weeknight, Alan Cohen sits hunched over his computer in his cluttered third-floor Treasury Department office, tapping out what many in his trade consider to be the daily bible of the budget wars in Washington.
Mr. Cohen is a revered if slightly eccentric budget analyst extraordinaire who works for Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. 
 Overnight, he puts out a snappy summary of the day's budget highlights that is a must-read for senior Treasury officials before their 8:30 a.m. senior staff meeting at the White House.
With administration and Congressional negotiators hoping to put the finishing touches on budget and tax deals later this week, this is Mr. Cohen's season to shine. As a consummate senior aide toiling in the trenches -- and every Cabinet secretary has at least one -- Mr. Cohen arms his bosses with the facts, figures and inside information they need to wage the bureaucratic battles of the day.
"He's one of the real insightful guys behind the scenes," Mr. Summers said. "And because he is insightful, he's influential."
Mr. Cohen's summary, usually two to four pages long and prosaically titled "Today's Update," typically contains a pithy status of spending bills, remarks from top officials and Mr. Cohen's succinct analysis of arcane budget issues and processes that he has mastered over two decades in government.
He has been writing them since early last year.
Mr. Cohen said he collected items for his summary throughout the day, poring over several publications and the Internet, and then filling in gaps with phone calls to budget sources around town. "It's a combination of policy, process and the political world," he said.
Treasury officials say they rely on Mr. Cohen to interpret everything from the latest Congressional Budget Office surplus estimates to a new proposal for Social Security to political infighting among key members of the Senate and House Appropriations committees.
Mr. Cohen sends his summary by electronic mail to about 30 top Treasury officials (except Mr. Summers, who has his report faxed to his home), but bootleg printouts enjoy a surprising circulation inside the department.
There's nothing confidential in his memos (Mr. Cohen sends his most sensitive remarks in a separate eyes-only memo to Mr. Summers or Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat). Nonetheless, Mr. Cohen expressed disappointment that an outsider had learned of their existence, and agreed to let a reporter view a few recent copies only on the condition that their contents would not be published.
For this reason it's no wonder that Mr. Cohen is virtually anonymous outside the budget cognoscenti in the administration and on Capitol Hill.
"Alan is a budget genius," said Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, who recalled at least one time when Mr. Cohen bailed him out of a tricky budget problem hours before he had to testify before Congress.
Rubbing shoulders with cabinet secretaries aside, Mr. Cohen, a heavyset, bespectacled, 50-year-old bachelor, is hardly your typical civil servant.
His marathon work hours are legendary. "Because I'm often up late, I'm often the receiver of a midnight call from Alan Cohen, who's realized a major flaw in a Republican budget document or a major procedural move that we'd missed at an earlier meeting," said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy director.
Legendary, too, is Mr. Cohen's office, which colleagues say is stacked with mountains of papers, books and other detritus of a self-proclaimed "budget wonk" who hates to throw anything away. (Mr. Cohen refused to show a visitor his office, just down the hall from Mr. Summers's suite, saying he was "too embarrassed. It's a total mess.")
Born and raised in Manhattan, Mr. Cohen earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Grinnell College in Iowa, followed soon after by a master's degree in public policy from the University of Michigan and a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin.
He spent four years at the Health and Human Services Department working on anti-poverty programs before moving in 1983 to Capitol Hill, where he was a staffer for nine years on the Senate Budget and Finance committees.
When President Clinton tapped Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Finance Committee chairman, to be treasury secretary in 1993, Mr. Bentsen brought Mr. Cohen with him.
Now serving his third secretary, Mr. Cohen said his insider's job has given him the perfect perch from which to negotiate official Washington: "One thing I've learned here is that it's hard to be successful in the policy world unless you understand and work in the political dimension."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE WISCONSIN ELECTORATE;
An Enclave of Undecideds Stays a Campaign Battleground in a Swing State

SERIES: BATTLEGROUNDS/Wisconsin

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: APPLETON, Wis., Oct. 14

 BODY:
The leaves have turned cranberry red and mustard yellow in the Fox River Valley, and people are obsessing as usual about the Packers, the community-owned football team up in Green Bay.
But something new has been added to the usual seasonal mix: Appleton, a pleasant city of 85,000 at the northern end of Lake Winnebago, finds itself squarely in the cross-hairs of the 2000 presidential campaign. This is the swing region in one of the handful of swing states in the neck-and-neck battle between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. 
 The region in eastern Wisconsin is rich in undecided voters. The candidates know it. They apparently think that women hold the key to the valley vote and that women care most about education. Mr. Bush came to Appleton on Oct. 5 for an event at McKinley Elementary, a public school with a charter school on the second floor; he favors charter schools, which are independently run institutions paid for with public funds. Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, is due here on Monday for a visit to an all-public school.
And when the candidates and their surrogates are off campaigning somewhere else, there are endless commercials on Green Bay television stations to ensure that Appleton does not forget the campaign and its role. Mr. Gore alone ran 2,322 spots in this region between June 1 and September 30, and one of Mr. Bush's education commercials appears several dozen times every week.
"It goes on and on," said Donald Koteki, who runs the survey center at St. Norbert College in Green Bay. "It's nonstop. We had a furious campaign about whether to renovate Lambeau Field, where the Packers play, and just as that was ending, the presidential stuff started. People here are numb."
Numb they may be, but they, like other people in Wisconsin, are expected to vote heavily next month. New registrations are up, and crowds -- like the throng of 6,000 to 8,000 that turned out for Mr. Gore in Milwaukee on Thursday -- are full of enthusiasm.
The state still seems there for the taking. Jeff Mayers, a veteran political reporter in Madison, Wisconsin's capital, said the last month had "seen a lot of action but not much change." The most recent statewide public poll, showing Mr. Gore up by five percentage points, was completed for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 20 -- more than three weeks ago, and well before the two presidential debates and the recent intensification of violence in the Middle East.
"We haven't gone up, they haven't gone up, we haven't gone down, they haven't gone down," said Teresa Vilmain, Mr. Gore's manager in the state. "It's a struggle to the death here."
Republican strategists say they sense movement in their direction, and private polls taken by Democrats here before Wednesday night's debate showed Mr. Bush taking the lead in the Fox River Valley and cutting into Mr. Gore's lead in Milwaukee. Two additional factors cheer the Republicans: they have more money for the stretch drive, and Mr. Bush seems to many in Wisconsin to have bested Mr. Gore in the second debate.
Appleton's and the Fox River Valley's pivotal role stems from some rough-and-ready electoral arithmetic. Democrats usually win Milwaukee, Republicans, the Milwaukee suburbs; Democrats usually win Madison, Republicans, the rural parts of the state. That leaves this region with a balancing role -- although such calculations are imprecise, omitting other cities like Racine and Kenosha.
Though tucked away in a relatively remote corner of the United States, Appleton has had its share of famous citizens. There was Joseph R. McCarthy, the Red-hunting senator whose bust stands in the Outagamie County Courthouse; there was Harry Houdini, the illusionist, who grew up here; and there were two presidents of little Lawrence College (now Lawrence University) who moved on to major national educational roles -- Henry M. Wriston, who became president of Brown University, and Nathan M. Pusey, who became president of Harvard.
But by and large, Green Bay and the valley are blue-collar places, good customers for the overalls made just south of here in Oshkosh. Big paper mills (like the ones in Appleton and Neenah owned by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which makes Kleenex and Scott tissues) remain important employers, as do food packers.
This district is "the district of the pro-life, pro-family, Catholic deer hunter," said Mark Green, a Republican who represents it in Congress.
"If you don't hunt, you don't fish and you don't milk cows in northern Wisconsin, what are you doing here?" asked Susan Squires, a political reporter for The Post-Crescent in Appleton.
Ms. Squires offered to bet that Mr. Bush would carry this area. Why was she so sure?
"George Bush is the kind of guy you want to sit down and have a few beers with, and talk for an hour or so," she said. "Gore isn't, not even the new, remodeled Gore. He's too much of an egghead for these people up here."
This region and Wisconsin as a whole do seem to have a certain affinity for low-key, not particularly electric politicians. Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democrat, both have reputations as unpretentious men of the people. Senator Herb Kohl, a multimillionaire and a Democrat, puts on fewer airs than many of his colleagues on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Green argued that Mr. Bush, a governor preaching compassionate conservatism, would benefit from Mr. Thompson's innovative style of politics, which voters have grown accustomed to in electing him to four four-year terms. It is not that Mr. Thompson can deliver the state, Mr. Green said, but that he has made it receptive to Mr. Bush's ideas.
By no means everyone buys his or Ms. Squires's analysis of this area.
"This state votes on issues, not personality," said Bill Dixon, a Madison Democrat who runs a weekly political panel on a statewide public-broadcasting television program. "It's a political junkie's show. But people come up to me in the True Value hardware, or on the sidewalk downtown, and tell me what they think. Issues count in Wisconsin. They count in the Fox River Valley."
The valley has prospered during the Clinton-Gore years, others note, and there seems to be no particular reason for people here to want to change administrations. Taken together, the three area counties -- Brown (Green Bay), Outagamie (Appleton) and Winnebago (Oshkosh, Neenah and Menasha) -- voted for Mr. Bush's father in 1988, but supported Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
In fact, a woman asked Mr. Bush at McKinley school why an undecided voter should opt to switch parties in the White House, given current prosperity.
"I'm groping for the right answer, as you can tell," he replied, stumbling over his words and syntax for four minutes or more until he finally managed to say, "The economy's done more for this administration than the administration has done for the economy."
Ken Harwood, the mayor of Neenah, listened to Mr. Bush struggling and said: "He has to be prepared to answer that question over and over again. He needs to say, I understand business and industry, and I can create a balance that will sustain this economy."
Mr. Gore never forgets to talk up the administration's economic achievements. But in his speech to the labor-dominated crowd in Milwaukee on Thursday, he pledged to create "a better, fairer, stronger economy" if elected.
"Too many have been left behind," the vice president declared.
So far, however, no issue has taken a dominant role, and a number of imponderables remain. One of the most important is Ralph Nader, the nominee of the Green Party, whose Wisconsin headquarters are prominently located on State Street, the funky pedestrian mall in Madison that links the State Capitol and the University of Wisconsin. Most politicians here thought that Mr. Nader would begin to lose strength as the campaign progressed, but he has held steady at 4 percent to 5 percent, which could cost Mr. Gore the state if it holds up at the polls.
And what of the situation in the Middle East? Will it help Mr. Gore, who has more experience in international affairs, or Mr. Bush, whose party is trusted by more people, generally speaking, on foreign policy issues?
Few here will risk a guess, and the candidates are taking nothing for granted. Mr. Bush will return to the state next week, on the day after the final debate, probably to visit La Crosse, on the Mississippi River, and Eau Claire in western Wisconsin. Mr. Gore is expected again, too, well before the end of the campaign. It's quite a lot of fuss over 11 electoral votes.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Exuding Confidence, Avoiding Complacency

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 15

 BODY:
Only an hour or so after Gov. George W. Bush's well-reviewed performance in Wednesday night's presidential debate, one of his top aides called to tell him that he "just became the president of the United States."
The next morning, as his campaign plane flew low over Washington, the pilot publicly announced, "If you look over to your left, Governor, there's your new home." 
 And throughout that day, at rallies in Langhorne, Pa., and Grand Rapids, Mich., politicians essentially jumped to the same celebratory conclusion, with Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania proclaiming, "I know a blowout when I saw one, and I saw one last night during the debates."
Small wonder that by late Friday afternoon, as Mr. Bush's week on the campaign trail ended, he jittered across the tarmac in Pontiac, Mich., like a human pinball machine, juiced by electricity, lit from within, beaming and bopping.
With little more than three weeks until Election Day, Mr. Bush and his aides are exuding a mood as helium-buoyant as at any other point in the 16 months of his campaign.
They feel that he aced last week's debate and turned the tide of polls decidedly in his favor, and they seem to be operating in a zone of comfort and joy, or at least are successfully projecting that image.
And there is some wisdom and potential benefit in that: many political scientists say that late-deciding voters often break in favor of the candidate who is perceived to be on the surest path to victory. But there is danger, too, in all of the Austin ebullience, because the Bush campaign has fallen prey to overconfidence in the past.
In the days immediately before the Republican primary in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush went sledding, bowling and snowmobile riding, obviously unprepared for the landslide victory Senator John McCain of Arizona ended up posting. Just weeks later, the Bush campaign was surprised again when Mr. McCain beat the Texas governor in the Michigan primary.
One senior Republican official who advises the Bush campaign said he did not believe that Mr. Bush and his aides, for all their brio, were letting themselves be lulled into a false sense of security this time around.
"I don't think they're anywhere near overconfident," he said. "I think they're confident, but they're also being careful."
Indeed, the Bush campaign is in some ways beginning to pull out all the stops. This week, it is sending Mr. Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, out to campaign in the crucial swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania, and next week, it is putting 28 fellow Republican governors in four airplanes to spend several days crisscrossing the country for Mr. Bush.
But the adviser acknowledged that Mr. Bush has a tendency toward excessive optimism, citing as an example his selection in July of Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary and a longtime Bush family friend, as a running mate.
Many Republican officials still see that choice as an indication that Mr. Bush felt so serene atop the polls that he put emotional preference before political strategy. Mr. Cheney, after all, is from Wyoming, a solidly Republican state with only three electoral votes, and his conservative voting record in Congress would seem to have little appeal to moderate swing voters.
But several political analysts said that what Mr. Bush and his campaign may be doing now, with their constant trumpeting of recent polls that show Mr. Bush edging ahead of Mr. Gore, is trying to weave an aura of imminent triumph. It could make a difference.
"There's a mild bandwagon effect for the leader," said Michael Lewis-Beck, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, referring to what often happens in the electorate in a campaign's waning days. "Success breeds more success, and people like to back winners."
Mr. Lewis-Beck said he thought Mr. Gore would prevail, based on a predictive formula that weighs factors like the health of the economy and the approval ratings for the incumbent administration.
But he noted that the candidate who voters believe will win is often the one who does, so campaigns have a powerful interest late in the game in portraying themselves as being ahead.
Still, Mr. Bush and his allies might be accused of pushing it a bit far.
On Saturday, the Bush campaign produced a news release with the headline that Mr. Bush was "leading Al Gore among the next generation of women voters," and Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, drew reporters' attention to this development in a conference call today.
The surveys Ms. Tucker was referring to were either commissioned by or conducted among the Girl Scouts, and the respondents were 11 to 17 years old.
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the Bush campaign was "gloating," while Mr. Gore and his aides have "always had a gloat-free zone."
"I think it shows a degree of hubris," Mr. Lehane said, "and my guess is voters are not going to react to it very well."
But even as Mr. Bush's supporters flash broad smiles, their language suggests an awareness that the Republican presidential nominee still has to work to convince hesitant, ambivalent voters that he is adequately prepared to run the affairs of the country.
The word Mr. Ridge used on Thursday afternoon to sum up Mr. Bush's debate performance was "presidential," and he made a point of saying it twice.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, insisted on NBC's "Meet the Press" this morning that Mr. Bush was "ready" for the presidency, which happened to be the same locution Gov. John Engler of Michigan repeated several times at a Bush rally on Thursday night.
That same evening, aboard his campaign plane, Mr. Bush had an exchange with the press corps that revealed a keen awareness of the disparaging questions about the depth of his knowledge and a keen interest in putting that chatter to rest.
A reporter jokingly asked Mr. Bush if she could leave the plane through the less crowded front door, which Mr. Bush uses, instead of the back door, noting that the rear exit was "separate" but not "equal."
"Plessy v. Ferguson!" Mr. Bush exclaimed, showing off his familiarity with the 1896 Supreme Court decision that instituted a separate-but-equal doctrine to permit racial segregation in public facilities. His grin was gargantuan.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: RUNNING TEXAS;
A Master of Bipartisanship With No Taste for Details

SERIES: GOVERNOR BUSH'S JOURNEY/Running Texas

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush has written that "by far the most profound" decision he or any governor can make is whether to proceed with an execution.
"I get the facts, weigh them thoughtfully and carefully, and decide," Mr. Bush wrote in his autobiography. What he did not say is that he normally does this in 15 minutes. 
 A review of Mr. Bush's daily schedules, correspondence and other documents, obtained after requests made under public-information laws in Texas, underscores that he has devoted himself remarkably little to policy details -- including whether to go ahead with executions -- and instead spent most of his time wooing legislators, the public and the news media.
Yet this may have made him more effective as governor, not less. Even many Democrats in Texas praise Mr. Bush, saying he has appointed unusually well-qualified people, avoided disabling scandals or controversies and succeeded in getting a popular agenda passed into law.
It is impossible to know clearly what a Bush presidency would be like from his years as governor, in part because Mr. Bush has held office for just five years and has never been tested by a recession or other crisis. But his experience here in Austin can help form some tentative ideas about how he might operate as president.
The 900-page stack of Mr. Bush's schedules and correspondence obtained from the governor's office portrays a governor who works short hours and spends little time studying specific issues or working on executive matters. The schedules show that Mr. Bush typically had his first office meeting about 9 a.m., took two hours of "private time" at lunch for a run, and then wrapped up his last meeting by about 5 p.m.
A large portion of the officially scheduled meetings were "photo opportunities," interviews with reporters, or meetings with school groups or other ceremonial occasions. Relatively little of the day was devoted to hard-core examination of the issues.
Aides acknowledge Mr. Bush's impatience with long meetings and briefing papers. But they praise this as a Reagan-style assertion of a chief executive's responsibility to dictate broad principles and then delegate minor matters.
The detachment from policy details may arise in part because Texas law gives a governor very limited powers -- he cannot commute a death sentence, for example, but only delay its implementation for 30 days. And it may partly arise because Mr. Bush shows great trust in those to whom he delegates authority, such as the people he appoints to the board of pardons and paroles. He almost always follows the board's recommendations.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Linda Edwards, said he might spend more than 15 minutes reviewing a death penalty case -- the meeting might go longer than scheduled, or he might make a follow-up call later -- and that the time schedule reflected Mr. Bush's confidence in his legal advisers. Ms. Edwards said the advisers might have spent hours reviewing a death penalty case before discussing it with the governor.
The schedules examined were for 1997, because that was a year in which the Texas Legislature met (there is no legislative session in even years) and thus gave Mr. Bush the chance to be more involved in policy, and he had not yet begun traveling widely in pursuit of the presidency. These days, Mr. Bush is rarely in the governor's office.
The schedules do not, of course, tell the full story. Long chunks of time were left blank, and just because nothing was scheduled does not mean that Mr. Bush was playing solitaire on his computer (although he sometimes did). Aides say that during periods when his schedule was blank, Mr. Bush made phone calls, read and answered correspondence, talked to staff members, met visitors and dropped in on legislators.
These visits with legislators -- which Mr. Bush made much more frequently than past governors had -- have generated enormous good will for him and helped increase his effectiveness in getting legislation passed.
 
An Unusual Partnership
It was a quiet morning in October 1994, three weeks before Election Day, as a car pulled up at 3001 Gilbert Street in a residential area of Austin. The unlikeliest of visitors got out, stepped quickly up the walk and rang the bell of the ranch-style home.
It was George W. Bush, then the Republican candidate for governor, and he was making a secret visit to a legendary Democratic kingmaker, Bob Bullock. They had never met, and even their aides did not know of that first meeting.
It would have been natural for them to sit down together after the election, but it was extraordinary for Mr. Bush to reach out in this way in the middle of a campaign that many thought he would lose. Yet Mr. Bullock, a craggy, explosive man, a Rodin statue come to life, invited Mr. Bush into the kitchen and sat down at the table.
Jan Bullock, Mr. Bullock's widow (he died last year), recalled that Mr. Bush first walked to the counter and, without invitation, poured himself a mug of coffee. Then he sat down at the small table and made a plea for a truce instead of a political war.
"He just explained that if he was elected he had no intention of playing the political game," she recalled. "He said, 'I'm here to tell you that I want to work with you.' "
"Of course, my husband was wary and skeptical, but he liked him," Mrs. Bullock said, adding that the two men talked for three or four hours about their ideas for state government.
That meeting, recounted by Mr. Bush's aides as well as by Mrs. Bullock, helped lay the groundwork for one of Mr. Bush's proudest achievements as governor -- the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that hugely multiplied his effectiveness. Many politicians and consultants say that so far, at least, Mr. Bush has not left any fundamentally new imprint or legacy in Texas, but that he did succeed in uniting Republicans and Democrats behind an agenda that took Texas several steps toward bolstering schools and creating a more pro-business environment.
One of Mr. Bush's campaign themes has been his boast, which many Texas Democrats say is justified, that as governor he worked particularly closely with Democrats. Thus a central question about Mr. Bush is simply how transferable his style would be to Washington.
Many here in Austin say the bipartisanship was possible largely because of a special circumstance: Democrats in Texas are like Republicans anywhere else. Democrats from rural Texas, in particular, tend to be fiscally conservative, supportive of the death penalty, very tough on crime and suspicious of environmental regulation.
As a result, the two parties were divided by rivalry and distrust in Texas, but not by their positions on the issues, as is true in most of the nation. Mrs. Bullock, for example, says there were no ideological differences between her husband and Mr. Bush.
"Texas politics has been based more on friendship than party lines," she mused as she sat in her living room here. "Texas must be extremely unique in that respect."
Yet while there are doubts about whether Mr. Bush could achieve a similarly harmonious relationship in Washington, this bipartisanship remains a real and unexpected achievement in Texas. No one would have anticipated his partnership with Mr. Bullock, and the two men's cooperation became a reason Mr. Bush could get things done and a source of his tremendous popularity.
His critics accuse him of being a terrible governor on the issues -- keeping poor children off the health insurance rolls, backing polluters as they destroy the air and water, doing little to improve the quasi-third world conditions in the communities known as "colonias" close to the Mexican border. But few critics try to argue that Mr. Bush has been ineffective or unpopular.
"On his own terms, taking his goals to measure him against, he's been a successful governor," said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist and presidential scholar at the University of Texas at Austin.
Professor Buchanan said Mr. Bush would be remembered as an incrementalist who had achieved modest progress on his own limited agenda -- more progress than his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards -- but that he would leave a much smaller imprint on Texas than such predecessors as John B. Connally, who helped build the state's university system, or Mark White, who worked with Ross Perot to begin an overhaul of the state's education system.
 
Holding His Temper
Back when Mr. Bush began his campaign for governor, just about everybody thought he was crazy. Ms. Richards was a national figure and media star with high popularity ratings. Even Mr. Bush's own mother, Barbara, urged him not to run against her.
Yet Mr. Bush was determined, and he ran a shrewd race while keeping his hot temper in check. Ms. Richards tried to aggravate Mr. Bush into self-destruction by needling him and belittling him as a dull-witted daddy's boy who had never accomplished anything on his own.
If Mr. Bush had detonated in front of a television camera, such an explosion would have been particularly costly because it might have been seen as confirmation of what many Texans suspected: that he was running against Ms. Richards partly for personal reasons, to seek revenge. Ms. Richards had made a famous speech to the Democratic National Convention in 1988, ridiculing Mr. Bush's father as "born with a silver foot in his mouth."
Yet Mr. Bush, whose temperament in the past had resembled a string of firecrackers popping, simply grinned amicably when Ms. Richards goaded him over the course of the campaign as a "shrub" and a "jerk."
His cousin Elsie Walker said she watched Mr. Bush and Ms. Richards debate on television, periodically cowering behind a bathroom door as she waited for Mr. Bush to blow up. But he had matured, and he came across as the cooler candidate.
"As I watched, she was needling him and he wasn't needling back," Ms. Walker recalled. "So I sent a telegram to Barbara, something like 'What's he on, animal tranquilizers?' And then I realized he'd really developed a lot of discipline."
One of Mr. Bush's insights was that while Texans liked Ms. Richards, they did not much agree with her and regarded her as too liberal. And so he ran an exceptionally focused, tight campaign that hammered home his themes day after day: better schools, a tougher juvenile justice system, tighter restrictions on welfare and new limits on tort lawsuits.
Mr. Bush's greatest asset in life, with the possible exception of his name and connections, has been a winning personality, and he used it to great effect in the campaign. On the opening day of dove season, Sept. 1, Mr. Bush went out -- with 30-odd reporters in tow -- to shoot a dove. A bird flew up, he blasted away with his shotgun, he held up the bird proudly for the news photographers. Then the reporters pointed out that he had shot not a dove, but a protected songbird known as the killdeer.
Mr. Bush promptly confessed, paid a $130 fine and began a news conference that afternoon by saying: "Thank goodness it wasn't deer season. I might have shot a cow."
The humor and discipline of the campaign worked: Mr. Bush defeated Ms. Richards with a healthy 54 percent of the vote.
 
A Lesson From Billy Graham
During the campaign, Mr. Bush had told a reporter of his belief that the path to heaven comes from acceptance of Jesus as one's personal savior. Mr. Bush later recalled: "It was, of course, picked up and politicized -- you know, 'Bush to Jews: Go to Hell.' It was very ugly. It hurt my feelings."
So one of the first things he did after becoming governor, he recalled, was to meet a group of Jewish leaders in Houston and give a speech that he remembers this way: "I know, really, why you all are here. You're here to know whether this governor condemns you to hell. I can tell."
"It hurt me," Mr. Bush recalled saying. "It hurt to think that you think I've condemned you to hell, because I would never do that. That's not my role in life."
Mr. Bush later explained that the Rev. Billy Graham had helped him reach this position. As he recalled in a 1998 interview, the issue arose when he was visiting his parents in the White House and the discussion turned to religion: he argued that only Christians had a place in heaven, while his mother disagreed.
"I said, 'Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New Testament says,' " Mr. Bush recounted. "And she said, 'Well, surely God will accept others.' And I said, 'Mom, here's what the New Testament says.' And she said, 'O.K.,' and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to the White House operator, 'Get me Billy Graham.'
"I said, 'Mother, what are you doing?' " Mr. Bush said. "Seriously. And about two minutes later, the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy says: 'From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is saying; the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?' "
The issue reflects Mr. Bush's penchant for holding to views whose implications some might find offensive, while doing all he can to avoid giving any offense. The logical conclusion of Mr. Bush's theology may be that non-Christians cannot enter heaven, but he consciously steps aside before reaching that conclusion and insists that it is not his role to be gatekeeper.
A similar pattern arises on gay issues. While campaigning in 1994, Mr. Bush opposed an effort to repeal an anti-sodomy law making homosexual acts a crime in Texas. The effort to repeal the bill failed very narrowly, and it remains on the books, apparently with Mr. Bush's support.
The sodomy law is rarely enforced. But in 1998 police officers entered a home in Houston after getting a report of an armed intruder, and arrested a gay couple they said were having sex. The couple appealed, and in June an appeals court agreed that the law violated the Texas Equal Rights Amendment. The state has appealed.
Yet Mr. Bush has avoided trumpeting his views about homosexuality.
Glen Maxey, a gay Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives, recalled an occasion when Governor Bush was visiting the House floor to support a bill that would have banned adoption by gay couples. "We had a short talk on the House floor," Mr. Maxey said. "He said, 'Glen, I value you as a friend, and what I say about gay people doesn't apply to you personally.' And I said: 'Governor, when you say you're against gay adoption, you're talking about me. And I take that very personally.' "
"George Bush was totally comfortable with me," Mr. Maxey added. "But it's all those other gay people out there. I think that mentality runs through him, whether it's race or sexual orientation. Up front, he's a great guy. But when you move to policy things, it's a great danger."
 
Friendly Headlocks
Elliott Naishtat, a Democratic member of the state House of Representatives, was walking down the steps of the Texas Capitol one day. Suddenly, a man seized him from behind and put him in a headlock.
Mr. Naishtat looked through the tangle of arms and identified the mugger.
"It's Bush, and he's very friendly," recalled Mr. Naishtat, a liberal who is the chairman of the House committee that was then considering welfare legislation. Some Capitol police officers were nearby, and Mr. Naishtat jokingly called out to them for help, but they did not interfere. So the governor walked Mr. Naishtat down the steps, keeping him bent over and in the headlock.
"And he said, 'Elliott, I hear we're hung up on welfare,' " Mr. Naishtat recalled. " 'You know how important this is, I hope we can work it out.' "
This aggressive bonhomie is very much Mr. Bush's style, and it has been very effective in Texas. Mr. Naishtat, for example, admits that it was "seductive" to be mugged by the governor, although he quickly adds that this aggressive approach did not work: he did not allow the welfare bills out of committee.
Still, what is striking in talking to Texas politicians, even Democrats, is how much they like Mr. Bush. He invites them to the governor's mansion, he drops by their offices, he praises them in the press, he puts them in friendly headlocks.
"His strength is not policy, not details," said Paul Sadler, a Democrat who is chairman of the House education committee. "His strength is that you like him and you want him to succeed."
Mr. Sadler worked very closely with Mr. Bush on changes in the education system, and when the new school law was signed in June 1995, Mr. Bush scheduled the ceremony in Mr. Sadler's hometown, Henderson, and then praised him for his work. It would be difficult to imagine such an event at the federal level, with a president traveling to the hometown of the other party's congressman to thank him for his work on a bill.
One result of this gesture is that Mr. Sadler describes himself as a friend of Mr. Bush and is not taking sides in the presidential race. That is remarkably common: many Texas Democrats are steering clear of Vice President Al Gore and remaining on the sidelines.
Yet the Texas Democrats are sometimes also a bit irritated that all the credit for bipartisanship goes to Mr. Bush. They emphasize that Mr. Bush's success was in large part a consequence of his extraordinary partnership with Mr. Bullock, who was the lieutenant governor and arguably held more power under the Texas system than Mr. Bush. The two men developed almost a father-son relationship, with Mr. Bullock doing much of Mr. Bush's heavy legislative lifting. And while it was Mr. Bush who reached out, Mr. Bullock responded with equal enthusiasm.
Likewise, Democrats say Mr. Bush's agenda was partly drawn from measures that were already bubbling up in the Legislature, which would have been passed even under a different governor.
"Was he significant?" Mr. Sadler said, referring to Mr. Bush's role on the education bill. "Absolutely. But were the ideas his? No, that's not the way it happened. There were a whole bunch of people, Democrats and Republicans alike, working to get it done, and he was a part of that team. He was no more significant than any member of my committee or of the Senate committee."
 
'He's Looking for Perfection'
A Texas governor's main powers lie in making appointments and using the bully pulpit. On both counts, Mr. Bush gets high marks from many Democrats as well as Republicans.
State records show that Mr. Bush has appointed many fewer members of minority groups than Ms. Richards -- 80 percent of his appointees have been white, compared with 66 percent of Ms. Richards's and 55 percent of the Texas population as a whole. In addition, 63 percent of Mr. Bush's appointees have been men.
While Mr. Bush's appointments have been less diverse over all, his choices have mostly been well-respected moderates rather than hard-line ideologues (although a couple of appointees have aroused criticism because of their remarks about blacks and Hispanics). And Mr. Bush's judicial appointees say they were never asked about their positions on issues like abortion.
"It's the toughest appointment process I've ever seen," said George Christian, a former aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson and now a Texas political consultant. "He's looking for perfection. I handled appointments for two governors, and the way we did it was we checked with local campaign people and state Democratic Party folks. It was a much more political process."
In contrast to this traditionally political approach, Mr. Bush appointed an old friend from the business world, Clay Johnson, to head the appointment process. Many of his appointees are financial contributors or cronies, but many others are simply experts in their field who are not politically active, or even Democrats.
"I have clients who want appointments," said Bill Miller, a prominent lobbyist in Austin who works with Democrats and Republicans. "And one of the gripes I hear from them is 'What the hell, these guys are trying to get somebody right for the job.' "
Mr. Bush's one effort to leave a major legacy in Texas showed just the kind of vision that critics often said his father lacked in the White House. It was a far-reaching tax proposal that would have addressed weaknesses in public finance in Texas by reducing property taxes, raising the sales tax and levying a new tax on partnerships of professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants.
It was a bold move that reflected a measure of political courage: Mr. Bush, not surprisingly, was promptly denounced for trying to raise new taxes. The proposal failed ignominiously, for while there was widespread agreement that Texas' emphasis on property taxes was outdated, reflecting an era when most wealth came from the land, Mr. Bush could not build a consensus on how to replace the lost revenue.
Mr. Bush never mentions the proposal these days, perhaps because it failed, or perhaps because it could remind voters that he had once favored raising the sales tax. He said afterward that the failure demonstrated how hard it was to achieve dramatic change without a crisis to force it.
Since then, he has concentrated on less sweeping proposals but has not seemed chastened by the failure. On the contrary, he comes across as exuberant simply at waking up each morning as governor, and at times he seems surprised that his wandering course through life has led him to the governor's mansion and, perhaps, on a path to the White House.
An old friend and high school roommate, John Kidde, recalled visiting Mr. Bush for a 50th-birthday celebration in July 1996.
"All of a sudden he comes over, and he's dripping wet," Mr. Kidde recalled. "I thought he'd been dunked in a pool, but it turned out that he'd just come back from jogging. So he comes over and gives us hugs.
"And then he stands up and throws up his hands at the governor's mansion behind him, as if to say: 'What's this? How could this have happened to us?' "

HEADLINE: Lease Deal Helps Pave Way for Fourth New Tower in Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Arthur Andersen, the world's largest accounting firm, has signed a lease with Boston Properties that would enable the developer to build the last of four office towers at the core of an 18-year-old plan to transform Times Square from a dowdy and foreboding crossroads into a vibrant, neon-drenched entertainment and commercial district.
The 47-story, $600 million skyscraper would sit on an island at the south end of Times Square, bounded by Seventh Avenue and Broadway, between 42nd and 41st Streets. Designed by David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the tower would offer a distinctively different face to Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street. 
The site is now occupied by the Times Square Brewery and a nearly vacant office building, both of which would be demolished.
Executives on both sides of the deal said that the lease, signed late Friday night, commits Arthur Andersen to taking more than 500,000 square feet in the 1.2 million-square-foot tower. The deal is dependent on Boston Properties' obtaining full control of the site from Prudential Insurance Company and on Arthur Andersen's completing its negotiations for about $10 million in tax breaks from city officials.
Some officials have questioned the wisdom of providing subsidies to the company to go into what has become one of the most desirable locations in the city.
But Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said: "You couldn't get a better example of a public-private partnership than what's happened in Times Square. That's the role government should play, and it works."
The office of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
The accountants from Arthur Andersen would be the latest in a wave of corporate employees to move to an area that less than a decade ago was populated mainly by pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers and wary tourists.
The old denizens of Times Square have been replaced by investment bankers from Morgan Stanley, entertainment executives from Viacom and Bertelsmann AG, boisterous teenagers who flock to the MTV music studios and millions of visitors to Broadway theaters, the new movie palaces and other entertainment sites.
Later this month, Madame Tussaud's plans to open its wax and audioanimatronic museum on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
"It's both the end and the beginning," said Rebecca Robertson, the former president of the state's 42nd Street Development Project, who oversaw the development for a decade ending in 1997. "Forty-second Street and Times Square has become E-squared. It's amazing how in tune it is with this new world. It's business, it's entertainment and it's quintessentially New York."
Executives from Arthur Andersen and Boston Properties said neither side expected problems in moving forward with the deal. And with the vacancy rate in Midtown office buildings at a barely perceptible 3 percent, real estate brokers say they do not expect Boston Properties to have any trouble filling the rest of the building.
Both sides expect construction to begin early next year.
"It came together very quickly," one person involved in the negotiations said. "It's the last piece of the puzzle in Times Square."
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties and the publisher of The Daily News, has told friends he hoped that Times Square Tower, the name he has given the skyscraper, would become an international icon. It would loom over One Times Square, home of the New Year's Eve ball drop, and dominate the southern view of the "crossroads of the world," the subject of millions of tourist photographs every year.
According to one real estate broker who has been briefed on the project, Boston Properties plans to hold space at the top of the skyscraper off the market for a while and then rent its panoramic view for a premium, more than $100 a square foot annually. Brokers said that Arthur Andersen would be paying about $70 a square foot.
Taxpayers have also had a stake in the revival of Times Square since state and city officials have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to developers and tenants. The incentives continued even after corporations began migrating to the area in the late 1990's.
Boston Properties has already received an incentive package valued at $236 million over 20 years for the site where Arthur Andersen plans to move. In asking for additional tax breaks, Andersen has threatened to move some workers to Roseland, N.J., where it has offices.
Boston Properties' project would cap a redevelopment plan that began in 1982, when city and state officials announced that they would offer developers huge tax breaks and the opportunity to build four office towers in the once vibrant neighborhood, which had fallen on hard times. In return, the developers were to restore a half-dozen live theaters on 42nd Street and improve the huge Times Square subway station.
The developer George Klein and later, Prudential Insurance, were chosen, but progress was slow as the state's effort to gain control of 13 acres along 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues ran into 47 separate lawsuits and a devastating recession in the early 1990's.
Because the city was littered with vacant office towers in 1991, Prudential, which had put up more than $400 million to acquire the land, did not want to go forward. That provided the state with an opportunity to redesign the project. Instead of wiping out the bustling, brightly lighted past of Times Square and replacing it with something akin to a suburban office park, a new plan called for restoring the district's "razzmatazz," with large illuminated billboards, entertainment venues and office towers that reflected the street life of the area. Prudential ultimately decided to sell the development rights for the four office sites.
It was a huge gamble, Ms. Robertson said, and no one knew if it would work. Suddenly, the redevelopment project took off in 1995, as the the city's economy was starting to boom. First, the Walt Disney Company renovated the dilapidated New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street.
In 1996, the developer Douglas Durst signed a deal to build the first of the four towers, a 48-story, 1.6-million-square-foot skyscraper that is now home to Conde Nast Publications and the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The next year, Reuters and the Rudin real estate family began work on the Reuters Building, a 32-story, 855,000-square-foot tower that is nearing completion on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets.
Boston Properties started demolition last year for what is known as Five Times Square Tower, a 37-story, 1.1-million-square-foot headquarters for Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, at the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, next door to the New Amsterdam Theater. And now Arthur Andersen, plans to move onto the street that hustlers once called the Deuce.
Along with the office towers, multiplex theaters, game rooms, a Hilton hotel, the B. B. King nightclub, the MTV music studios and the largest video screen in the world have gone up along 42nd Street and elsewhere in Times Square.
"It was a wonderful coincidence of planning and market," Ms. Robertson said.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Visits Harlem as Lazio Courts Upstate Vote

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Bronx and Harlem churchgoers yesterday to pray for peace in the Middle East, while her opponent, Rick A. Lazio, stumped for votes in western New York, visiting tailgaters assembled for a Buffalo Bills game and Italian-Americans gathered in Geneva for a lasagna dinner in his honor.
The contrasting schedules illustrated once again the two campaigns' strategies. Mrs. Clinton has spent four of the last five Sundays at predominantly black churches, working to generate a large turnout among black voters. Mr. Lazio, meanwhile, invested his seventh day in upstate and western New York, seeking to shore up his support in the state's more conservative, and predominantly white, corners. 
 Mrs. Clinton, in discussing Middle East affairs yesterday, was careful not to interject herself too much into her husband's dealings. Yes, she said, she had spoken with President Clinton yesterday morning, wishing him well before he left for a summit meeting with Middle East leaders.
But no, she said, she did not offer him any particular advice. Instead, she asked the congregations she visited yesterday to pray for him.
"It is a time of peril and danger," Mrs. Clinton said to the congregation at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where she was joined by prominent black leaders, including Representative Charles B. Rangel and the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall.
In her church visits, Mrs. Clinton has offered a relatively consistent message. Despite the economic growth in recent years, too many people do not have health insurance, too many schools are overcrowded or poorly equipped and too many of the elderly and their families cannot afford medication or specialized care, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly says.
By using techniques common to ministers -- carefully modifying her cadence, raising and lowering her voice, repeating certain refrains that seem almost designed to evoke cries of "amen" from the congregations -- she generally succeeds in workingthe crowds into a fervor.
"No matter what, keep going," Mrs. Clinton said yesterday, recalling the advice she said the freed slave Harriet Tubman offered as she helped other slaves escape to the North. "If you hear gunshots, keep going. If you hear footsteps and shouts behind you, keep going. If you hear the barking of the dogs that are trying to hunt you down, keep going."
Her 13 minutes of remarks at Goodwill Baptist Church in the Bronx elicited applause 17 times. At Abyssinian, applause came 15 times, along with two standing ovations. And at Emmanuel Baptist Church in the Bronx, the congregation sang a hymn with the words "Victory is mine, victory is mine. Yes, I told Lazio, get thee behind," substituting Mr. Lazio's name where the traditional lyric calls for a reference to Satan. Mrs. Clinton, at least for this song, did not appear to sing along.
Mr. Lazio encountered his own share of enthusiastic crowds at stops his campaign bus made in Buffalo, Geneva, Auburn, Skaneateles and Tully yesterday, a journey in which he was joined by his wife, Patricia, and their two daughters.
At the "Lasagna with Lazio" dinner in Geneva, held by the Sons of Italy Post 2397, Mr. Lazio spoke of his grandmother, an immigrant from Italy, and the values she instilled in the family. Then he turned to his campaign.
"Nobody from Washington, D.C., or Little Rock or Hollywood is going to tell us New Yorkers who's going to represent us in the United States Senate," he said, echoing the theme of two new television advertisements his campaign is running, emphasizing Mrs. Clinton's newcomer status.
In an interview yesterday morning on Fox News, Mr. Lazio asserted that during his upstate campaign stops "75 percent of the people were Democrats," a claim that Mrs. Clinton's aides challenged, noting that a large portion of upstate residents are Republicans.
Mr. Lazio visited the Ukrainian National Club in Auburn and a bowling alley in Skaneateles, and spent about two hours in the parking lot of Ralph Wilson Stadium greeting people on their way to the Buffalo Bills game.
The reaction to Mr. Lazio was characterized as much by apparent disdain for Mrs. Clinton as by genuine support for Mr. Lazio.
"You've got to stop her," several Bills fans yelled to Mr. Lazio. He responded generally by smiling and asking for the support of voters.
In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Mr. Lazio defended the tone of his campaign literature, which describes Mrs. Clinton as "extreme" and "radical."
"I stand by that language," Mr. Lazio said. "Anytime somebody puts forth proposals that would spend $2.5 trillion over 10 years," a figure that a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign called inaccurate, "that's not exactly a fiscal conservative."

BUFFALO: RURAL ECONOMY STRENGTHENING
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York report that rural areas of the state grew in population from 1990 to 1999 compared with urban areas, which shrank or remained the same, and that nonfarm employment from 1975 to 1999 rose 41 percent, compared with 32 percent in urban areas. Economists in the Buffalo office said businesses may be moving to rural areas in search of less expensive labor, land and housing. (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: STRICTER FUEL STANDARDS URGED
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, yesterday announced a plan to encourage nationwide energy conservation, including reclassifying what he called gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles as cars instead of trucks. He noted that sales of the vehicles had more than tripled to 3.1 million in 1999 from 976,000 in 1989 and that their fuel efficiency had dropped to 19.6 miles per gallon from 20.9 during the same period. Reclassifying them as cars would force them to adhere to a standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. He also proposed $1 billion in tax credits to encourage the development of energy sources other than petroleum. (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: THE CASE OF THE SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE
The hustle and bustle of the 26th Street flea market was interrupted yesterday morning by the sort of find no one wants -- a suitcase left unattended long enough for the Police Department's bomb squad to be called. The black case, which turned out to be empty save for three AA batteries, had been left on the sidewalk in front of one of the market's busiest sites, on the Avenue of the Americas between 25th and 26th Streets. According to the police, an anonymous man called to report a "suspicious suitcase, standing upright and unattended" at 10:23 a.m. The police evacuated the 26th Street site and cordoned off the Avenue of the Americas between 23rd and 27th Streets for about an hour.

HAUPPAUGE: SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANT LABORERS
Just before dusk yesterday, a crowd waving a multinational sea of flags gathered outside a Suffolk County office building here to urge county leaders and other officials to address the problems faced by day laborers, most of whom are immigrants from Mexico and Central America. About 3,000 people attended the rally, the police said. Organized by the Suffolk County Human Rights Commission and Paul J. Tonna, the presiding officer of the Suffolk Legislature, the candlelight rally came a month after an attack on two day laborers in Farmingville, and the day after a town hall meeting in Centereach, where 200 Suffolk residents demanded tougher enforcement of immigration laws. Shaila K. Dewan (NYT)
 
ALBANY: FEWER HUNTING LICENSES ISSUED
Sales of hunting licenses in New York have dropped every year since 1991 before rebounding slightly last year. A common lament from hunters is that young people are more interested in video games than the outdoors. Charles Mowatt, who encourages deer hunting in his woods in Cattaraugus County, said hunters are getting old and "they're like me -- they don't shoot so straight." It is too early to draw a link between fewer hunters and the thriving deer population, estimated at one million in New York, said William Porter, a wildlife biologist at the State College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. But he warned that there might be trouble if hunting continues to decline. (AP)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: PHARMACIST SHORTAGE
A shortage of pharmacists in Connecticut has forced many drugstores to close during regular business hours because Connecticut laws require drugstores to close when there is no pharmacist working. The University of Connecticut, home of the state's only pharmacy program, usually graduates more than 90 new pharmacists annually. But it has extended its pharmacy training to six years from five, so no pharmacy students graduated from its program this year. (AP)
 
BLOOMFIELD: LATINO EPISCOPAL BISHOP INSTALLED
The Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut has consecrated its first Latino bishop. The ceremony in Bloomfield on Saturday for the bishop, Wilfrido Ramos-Orench, was delivered in English, Spanish and French Creole. Bishop Ramos, 60, has served in a regional ministry in Hartford as well as in the Spanish-speaking congregation in New Britain. (AP)
 
BRISTOL: EMISSIONS CLEANUP
Taxpayers in 14 central Connecticut towns will have to share the more than $3 million cost of altering a Bristol incinerator to make it less polluting. Leaders of the towns whose trash flows into the Odgen Martin incinerator are negotiating a contractual change that will pass the cleanup cost plus $55,000 annually on to taxpayers. The 13-year-old plant needs updated scrubbers and equipment that strips poisonous mercury from its emissions. (AP)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
PISCATAWAY: NADER SPEECH DISRUPTED
Reports of a suspicious package at Rutgers University's Busch Campus Center yesterday disrupted the campaign speech of Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, officials said. Sgt. Ron Brown of the state police said the agency's bomb squad was called to the campus center around 3:30 p.m. Sergeant Brown had little additional information about the package, and the university police declined to release information about the incident. (AP)
 
TRENTON: SLAVERY REPARATIONS FRAUD
Almost 600 people in New Jersey have been bilked by con artists who tell black residents they can receive money for a phony "slave reparations" tax credit. Although the Internal Revenue Service has issued warnings nationwide, regional officials worry that many New Jersey residents are still unaware of the fraud. The number of claims sent from state residents to the I.R.S. dropped from 512 in July to 30 in August. But the filings increased to 51 in September, despite a summer campaign to warn people. The hoax usually involves con artists posing as tax preparers who tell blacks they can receive credit for slavery reparations in exchange for a fee of $30 to $50. (AP)

HEADLINE: An Oil Merger That Assumes That Bigger Is Not Just Better, It's Necessary

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
With violence raging in the Middle East and lofty oil prices drawing harsh criticism of petroleum companies, it might seem an inopportune time for Chevron and Texaco to announce a merger that opens them to the scrutiny of the federal government and the jittery stock market.
But the timing has less to do with the high price of oil over the last several months and more to do with the trend toward larger oil concerns that has radically reshaped the industry in the last two years. In fact, the two companies tried to merge more than a year ago but were unable to work out the terms. 
 As for the tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, Chevron and Texaco do not have a presence in the region, and so are unaffected by the turmoil there. In fact, some of the largest new oil fields in the world have been discovered far from the Middle East, mainly in the deep waters off Brazil and West Africa and in the Caspian Sea.
The wide geographical range of the projects and their location below the sea reflect how high the stakes have become in the oil industry. Older fields like those in the United States are drying up, and the number of wells that are easy to drill and operate is winnowing.
To feed the world's powerful demand for oil, companies in search of the "elephant fields" that contain hundreds of millions of barrels of oil must now take on new political and technical perils, from the spasmodic civil war in Angola to the depths of the Caspian. Those conditions, in turn, require oil companies to have far greater revenues than were necessary only a few years ago.
"What all the oil companies have found out is that as you go deeper and deeper into the offshore projects, that you are a pioneer and, therefore, mistakes will be made," said Mehdi Varzi, director of research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank. "To exploit those reserves, you need the acreage and you need the money."
While Chevron and Texaco already have projects in the waters off West Africa and Brazil, their merger is largely motivated by the need to either pool their assets and expertise or risk being pushed aside by the biggest players in the industry: Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco.
"On a combined basis, especially in exploration and production, we'll really be in a league with those other companies," said a senior executive involved in the talks.
Certainly, when the price of oil hovers above $30 a barrel as it has for much of this year, companies have greater resources for a merger and can use their income to go after sprawling projects. But much of the money companies expect to see from a merger will be in the savings they extract from cutting jobs, jettisoning less-profitable units and streamlining some operations, a process that oil experts say has been going on industrywide, in one form or another, since 1980. In creating a new, unified company, Chevron and Texaco expect to save $1.2 billion annually and to eliminate at least 4,000 jobs, senior executives said.
"The hidden value in mergers is that you cut people and inventory," said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "Companies have realized that they may not have control over the price of crude oil, but they do have control over costs."
Those cuts, in turn, have profoundly changed the main business of oil companies. The market giants now focus much more heavily on exploration and production rather than refining and selling gasoline, which they do primarily through joint ventures. Even now, for example, Texaco-brand gasoline is sold at filling stations in the United States through a joint venture with the Shell Oil Company called Equilon.
High gasoline prices this summer may have unleashed accusations of profiteering against gas stations and refiners. But oil companies make most of their money at the well-head, where it might cost about $3 to $4 to pump out a barrel of oil that, on the world market, may sell for $35.
"One of the dynamics happening in the oil industry is that the old vertically integrated structure is breaking down," said Dave Wilson, a recently retired partner in energy strategic consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "There's not so much balance between production and refining any more. The merged companies sold off much of their refining and marketing to joint ventures, because refining and marketing usually perform so poorly."
Senior executives involved in the negotiations said that Chevron and Texaco had traditionally placed great emphasis on exploration of new fields, but the merger would make it more economical for them to continue such projects. Most of the $1.2 billion savings from the deal, for example, are expected to come from streamlining projects each company has in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, Angola, Britain and Kazakhstan.
As with any merger, Chevron and Texaco will be playing up the hand-in-glove way they will fit together as they go about creating a new company. Indeed, the two have worked together for about 65 years through Caltex, a joint venture that sells petroleum products in Asia.
For all their similarities in strategy, their corporate cultures are said to be quite different. Chevron is considered by some to be buttoned-up and staid, while Texaco is thought of as more free-wheeling.
But it may be Chevron's culture that prevails. The new corporate headquarters will be in San Francisco, where Chevron is now based, and the combined company's chairman and chief executive will be David J. O'Reilly, now Chevron's chief. Texaco's chief executive, Peter I. Bijur, will become a vice chairman, with few operational duties.
"I don't expect there to be much of a corporate clash," one analyst said. "I think Chevron will be the surviving company and Peter Bijur and the others will be happy to take their money and sit on the board."

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about Chevron's acquisition of Texaco misstated the companies' relationship to the Middle East. Both companies indeed have operations there.
Articles on Oct. 14 and 16 and a front-page chart on Oct. 16 about the acquisition of Texaco Inc. by the Chevron Corporation misstated the total 1999 revenue for the companies. Including their Caltex joint venture, which sells petroleum products in Asia, the combined revenue for the companies was $85 billion, not $66.5 billion.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: Joan Roughgarden;
A Theorist With Personal Experience Of the Divide Between the Sexes

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Speaking to a standing room only crowd at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Snowbird, Utah, Dr. Joan Roughgarden, one of the world's most influential theoretical ecologists, is methodically taking apart the way that biologists think about sex.
Providing details that make some titter and shift nervously in their seats, she is re-thinking orgasms and the architecture of female genitals, making arguments for the existence of more than two genders and presenting evidence for widespread homosexual copulation in the wild. 
 "What's coming out now is to the rest of the species what the Kinsey Report was to humans," she says later, discussing recent research.
Described as a visionary and iconoclast who consistently ignores disciplinary and conceptual boundaries, Dr. Roughgarden always draws a good crowd. But on this August day the room is packed, in part because this is not just more talk about science, but the outgrowth of a personal experience that two years ago riveted this entire community of scientists.
That was when Dr. Roughgarden crossed the most rigidly enforced boundary of all, the divide between the sexes. Born Jonathan Roughgarden, she became Joan in the spring of 1998 -- a profound transformation that has led her not only onto new paths in science but into San Francisco politics as well.
"People are wrapping their minds around this," said Dr. Roughgarden of re-meeting colleagues. "They don't quite know what to say."
Whatever they may have been thinking about Dr. Roughgarden herself, the ecologists at the meeting seemed to welcome the new work, though it remains to be seen whether her radically different views of sex and mating will take hold, or be dismissed.
"This is the usual sort of mold-breaking creativity that she brings to a problem, not just this problem," said Dr. Steve Pacala, an ecologist at Princeton. "Just because she broke her own mold it's particularly applicable here, but the kind of thing she always does with a problem is think about it afresh."
For those who knew Dr. Jonathan Roughgarden well, and the many more who knew him only through his prolific production of scientific papers and books, it came as a much-discussed surprise when this Stanford professor, then 52, announced on his Web site that he was a transsexual, posting pictures of himself as Joan.
"It became clear to me that I wasn't ever going to figure out how to do the guy thing," Dr. Roughgarden said. She believes that gender is a matter of cognition, an instinctive ability and desire to learn a certain way of being, she said. "Imagine as a woman if you'd set out to be a man, to learn how to live as a man. Could you do it? I couldn't. It's like asking a fish to fly."
She said the light dawned on her one day as she sat in a department faculty meeting. "There were all these guys around this table, staking out their territories and going at one another," she said. "After a while I said, you know, this is not a battle you want to win. You don't want to be like them."
But as Jonathan, Dr. Roughgarden, who in her own mind has always identified herself as female, was universally regarded as the quintessential macho academic: aggressive, abrasive and competitive.
"Aggressiveness is the easiest male trait to emulate," she explained in a recent interview at her apartment in San Francisco, where she has taken the unusual step for a high-powered academic of running for a public office. "It's easy to duplicate."
Such behavior, along with the talent to back it up, can play well in the male-dominated world of theoretical ecology, in which scientists study ecology using mathematical models, and in which Jonathan Roughgarden was at the top of his game.
"I don't think there are a lot of people who have been so influential or sweeping in their approach," said Dr. Ted Case, a theoretical ecologist at University of California at San Diego.
The transformation to Joan, Dr. Case said, appears not to have diminished Dr. Roughgarden's status in the field. Her gift, he said, is "to look at the natural world and convert it to math." He added, "I've looked forward to a new paper by Joan or Jon the way the world looks forward to the next Harry Potter book."
Known for her itinerant interests, Dr. Roughgarden has boiled down into mathematical expression complex ecological phenomena, including what drives some species to produce many offspring and others to produce just a few, and how predators decide which prey to chase and which to let scramble away.
And, unlike most theoreticians, Dr. Roughgarden has gotten her hands dirty doing field studies, looking, for example, at competition between lizards on the Caribbean islands. Even now, in addition to her work on sex and gender, she continues work on very different projects, including developing a theory on the relationship between economics and ecology.
In many ways, Dr. Roughgarden's transition to life as a woman mirrors that of other transsexuals. Tall, slender and somewhat androgynous looking, she has spent two years preoccupied with her physical appearance as she made the transition from one gender to another. Over the same period, she also settled into a softer, more traditionally feminine demeanor.
Moderating a discussion at the meetings in Snowbird, she operated as colleagues said Jonathan never would have: seeking out consensus, affirming others' opinions, welcoming dialogue.
Other scientists universally describe Joan as friendlier, more nurturing and significantly happier-seeming than Jon.
"I've seen Joan smile more in two years than I saw Jon smile in the last 20," said Dr. Paul Ehrlich, an ecologist and longtime colleague of Dr. Roughgarden's at Stanford.
Dr. Roughgarden insists she is in many ways entirely unchanged. She acknowledges, however, that life as a woman is quite different.
"At first I was amused," Dr. Roughgarden said, describing how she is now much more frequently interrupted, ignored and condescended to by men, particularly those who did not know her as Jonathan. "I thought, if women are discriminated against, then I'm darn well going to be discriminated against the same way. Well, the thrill of that's worn off, I can tell you."
Dr. Roughgarden's transformation is leading toward what she hopes will be a change in how biologists think about gender, courtship and reproduction.
In the world view of nearly all biologists, there are males and there are females and they mate only with one another. Dr. Roughgarden likewise had not questioned these most basic of premises. But that began to change when, seeking to understand what science could tell her about herself as a transsexual, she began reviewing the literature. She presents her results in "Evolution's Rainbow," a book to be published by Princeton University Press.
What she found, she said, was that biologists have been unsuccessfully trying to cram the immense variation in nature -- the rainbows, as she calls them, both in gender and mating -- into overly simple, outdated categories.
"There are two sexes," she said, meaning females that produce large reproductive cells like eggs and males that produce small ones, like sperm. "But how you package those sexes is all over the waterfront."
Hermaphrodites, for example, which can produce both eggs and sperm, do not fit the standard male or female definitions, yet they are widespread in nature. In some species, male-female lines are blurred where sexual identities are flexible.
In fish known as wrasses, for example, some large females change into males later in life and have harems of females, while small males remain male for life, mating with females under the large males' control. Some females remain female for life.
Curiously, Dr. Roughgarden noted, biologists consider females that turn into large males to be the standard males while the life-long males are considered "sneakers" and are described as having an alternative mating strategy.
In Dr. Roughgarden's framework, rather than designate any type as the normal or alternative, scientists would recognize the fundamental difference between these three differently sexed, shaped, sized and behaving fish and designate them as different genders.
Dr. Roughgarden said scientists had also been shockingly blind to same-sex mating.
"There are 303 published examples of species with same-sex courtship," she said of behaviors typically discounted as anomalies. "We know examples are suppressed. No one wants to say the organism they work on is gay."
Rather than view mating through the conventional lens of sexual selection, in which competing males vie for choosy females and in which same-sex courtship becomes invisible, she suggests biologists think instead in terms of the evolution of courtship and mating in general -- between males, between females as well as between females and males. In fact, Dr. Roughgarden argues that same-sex copulation is so widespread that scientists must test the idea that, rather than being a mistake, homosexual behaviors may have some advantages in an evolutionary sense.
Just as she hopes the work of gay and transsexual scientists will improve the scientific understanding of sex and mating, Dr. Roughgarden said she believed a wide diversity of perspectives would lead to better governance. For that reason, she is running for the half-time, city council-like position of district supervisor for District 6, which includes some of the poorest parts of San Francisco.
"I got tired of people saying we need to convince the politicians," she said, referring to the common lament of scientists who feel their perspective is lost or misunderstood by politicians and the public. "Instead of trying to convince them, let's just do it."
Walking through the district with Dr. Roughgarden, one sees the beginnings of what is promised to be a upscale new development, called Mission Bay, which includes a new University of California campus. It sits alongside neighborhoods where homeless people sleep in doorways and others pick through the trash.
"Some ecological thinking could really help," said Dr. Roughgarden, who has promised to use her expertise in the analyses of complex systems to rethink the growth of District 6. She has already crunched the numbers.
"The displacement of people will be enormous," she said."And they're not going to go quietly."
To create more of a sense of community between the new campus and the rest of the district, Dr. Roughgarden is proposing that two large piers extending into the bay near the university be developed as Diversity Plaza, home to a statue celebrating diversity. "I imagine it as the West Coast's equivalent to the Statue of Liberty," she said.
Hank Wilson, a longtime community activist and a friendly competitor running for the same office, said Dr. Roughgarden, a political novice, and Diversity Plaza had captured people's imagination. "Joan is on people's radar screen," he said.
Always mathematically minded, Dr. Roughgarden notes that with 17 candidates vying for the position and no incumbent, everyone theoretically has a chance. Still, considered a dark horse, she remains philosophical about where she has come from and where she is going.
"One thing I've learned is that almost all professional women have had a very nonlinear path to get where they are," said Dr. Roughgarden, who said she intended to pursue her science whatever the outcome on Nov. 7. "It's taken me a while to get here, but we've all got a story."

HEADLINE: As Greenland's Seal Population Surges Its Fishermen Look to Revive the Hunt

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: KAPISILLIT, Greenland

 BODY:
Over a bowl of caribou stew in his wooden house overlooking a fjord here, Kaaleeraq Ringsted, an Inuit hunter and fisherman, remarked on a new arrival in his timeless world of glaciers and icebergs: seals, seals and more seals.
"When I was young, you would rarely see seals here," the wiry 48-year-old recalled through a Greenlandic-speaking interpreter. "Now, when spring comes, the big seals come in and eat all the fish. Because of the number of seals in the fjord now, I have to go farther and farther out to fish." 
 In decades past, his father would hunt seals, earning a tidy profit catering to tastes for fashionable fur coats in Europe and the United States.
But anti-fur campaigners, particularly opponents of the annual Canadian baby seal hunt, have virtually destroyed the sealskin fur market, so today Mr. Ringsted hunts harp seals only for meat for his family; usually, he throws the pelts away.
But as fisheries suffer and Greenlanders seek a way to stay on the land, people here argue that prices would rise if the United States would lift a ban imposed almost 30 years ago on imports of seal products.
With an estimated 5.5 million harp seals swimming off the western shores of Greenland -- about 100 for each Greenlander -- no government argues that harp seals are endangered or even threatened. And by the time seals make the 1,200-mile swim from Atlantic Canada to Greenland, they are considered adult seals.
"Greenlanders do not kill baby seals," Jonathan Motzfeldt, the island's premier, said, speaking slowly for effect. "Because we do not have baby seals."
But imports of seal products into the United States are banned by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, a law that was drawn up partly out of revulsion over the clubbing of seal pups in Canada. (That hunt itself is on the decline. Last spring, about 80,000 pups were killed, 40 percent of the levels of the late 1990's, according to the Canadian government.)
In 1998, Greenlanders hunting off their western coast in what they call "the ranch of the sea," killed 82,500 harp seals, about 1.5 percent of the estimated population.
Biologists and government officials here say the seal population is expanding so rapidly that many more could be hunted without threatening the species.
"We have two legs for our economy to stand on: seals and fish," said Mikaela Engel, a foreign affairs spokesman for Greenland's home rule government. But with the decline of seal hunting, he said, "there are a gazillion seals swimming around, and they are eating our fish."
There is widespread agreement with this view. "The seals are very numerous," said Klaus Nygaard, director of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. "They are actually creating problems with the fishing industry."
In Newfoundland, many fishermen blame seals, at least in part, for the collapse of the Grand Banks cod fishery. A Canadian government study in 1994 calculated that each year 4.5 million harp seals eat 140,000 tons of cod, or 2 billion fish.
In Nunavut, Canada's new Arctic territory, Inuit living across the Davis Strait from Greenland also complain about seals. "There are too many harp seals," said Peter Kilabuk, a former national park ranger who is now the territory's minister for sustainable development. "The fishermen are concerned about them eating up the char," a popular food fish.
But not everyone agrees.
"Fewer seals means more fish -- that is the simple-minded view," said Dr. David Lavigne of Guelph, Ontario, a marine biologist who advises the International Fund for Animal Welfare, an animal protection group. "We have a population that swims across international borders and is hunted by two countries with no joint agreement for a sustainable hunt."
Dr. Lavigne, a lifelong seal specialist, estimates that as many as half a million seals are killed each year between Canada and Greenland, including seals caught in fishing nets, seals shot but not reported by Inuit and hunted seals that escape and drown. If the United States ever lifted the ban on seal products, he warned, numbers would spiral upward.
Though market prices for seal pelts remain low, partly because of the American ban, there are signs of change.
The royal family of Denmark, the colonial power here, has helped touch off a minor sealskin revival by wearing stylishly cut seal fur coats in Copenhagen.
With Europeans allowed to buy seal products, shops in Greenland's larger towns and airport merchants display racks of sealskin fur coats, jackets, scarves, hats, gloves and boots.
"Some Americans are morally upset that we sell them here," said Bodil Nielsen, a Danish saleswoman at a fur shop at Kangerlussuaq, Greenland's international air hub. "Other Americans say it is a shame they can't buy."
For a people who have survived for generations on the forbidding fringes of this landmass covered with ice and snow, the lectures from environmental groups about seal hunting are often taken as intrusive -- yet another example of meddling from a long line of outsiders.
This colonialist history, they say, began with 18th century Danish missionaries and merchants, continued with European and North American whalers who almost wiped out seal and whale populations and appeared most recently in the form of American military officers dotting this island with cold war bases.
The talk is particularly galling given that, according to the Greenland National Museum, Greenlanders have hunted seals as their primary food supply for roughly 4,400 years, and hunting seals is deeply imbedded in their culture.
In Nuuk, the capital, the premier's waiting room is decorated with four harpoons on a wall.
In an interview in his office, Premier Motzfeldt noted that he had been seal hunting several days earlier. "I got three seals -- enough for me and my three friends to have enough meat for 14 days," he said through a Danish interpreter.
Mr. Motzfeldt, who has been premier for most of the years since Greenland won home rule from Denmark in 1979, said that selling furs was one of a few economic activities that would anchor people like Mr. Ringsted to small villages like Kapisillit as Greenland's urbanization rate has soared, from 25 percent in 1950 to 81 percent today.
"Twenty years ago, a lot of people in small settlements made a good living, partly by hunting seals, partly by fishing," said Jorge Waever Johansen, minister of social welfare and employment. "Now one of those legs has collapsed."
The collapse in economic value of hunting has debilitated native societies across the Arctic, according to Aqqaluk Lynge, president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, an international group that represents 150,000 Inuit in Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia.
Noting high native suicide rates in Greenland and northern Canada, Mr. Lynge said: "If a man doesn't hunt, he isn't man enough to be husband to anyone. It has a devastating impact."
In recent years, some American critics of the seal hunt have suggested that Greenlanders try cattle ranching instead. But, Greenland's climate and geography do not allow much animal husbandry beyond a few sheep farms near the island's southern tip.
"I suppose we could play the indigenous card," Ms. Engel, the diplomat, mused sardonically. "People will want to watch us row up and strangle animals with our bare hands. Then, they will pay us with mirrors and shiny beads."
Mr. Lynge, who once had his sealskin vest confiscated by American customs agents as he entered the United States to attend an Inuit congress in Alaska, put it another way. "Save the seals, O.K.," he said. "But how about saving the Eskimos?"

HEADLINE: The Mixed Prospects of Indonesia

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The Indonesian government, which presides over the weakest of Southeast Asia's economies, is rebuffing criticism from international donors even as it approaches them for $4.8 billion in assistance.
The Consultative Group on Indonesia, an umbrella organization headed by the World Bank and including roughly 30 foreign governments, will meet Indonesian officials in Tokyo this week to decide how much the group will lend to Indonesia and under what conditions. 
 The meeting, which begins on Tuesday, comes against the backdrop of further decline in Indonesian political stability. President Abdurrahman Wahid, hobbled by two strokes and blindness in one eye, has largely failed to contain ethnic violence in far-flung areas or to prevent attacks on aid workers in West Timor. A series of bombings, most notably a blast last month under the Jakarta Stock Exchange, has unnerved investors further and left many wondering if the government is able to salvage what has become the worst-performing economy in the region.
At the same time, questions from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank about a government plan to take over the country's largest corporate debtor have provoked angry remarks from Indonesian officials, who accuse the international lenders of favoritism and interference. Jakarta officials have also rebuffed some United Nations demands on West Timor despite warnings from Britain and the United States that lending could be held up over this matter.
The nation's chief economics minister, Rizal Ramli, was in Tokyo last week to seek assurances from Japan, Indonesia's biggest lender, that it would not let political issues stand in the way of aid. Japanese finance ministry officials reportedly favor keeping noneconomic issues out of the discussions.
The consultative group's pledges are an important gauge of international support for economic recovery, and any sign that support is wavering could batter Indonesia's already fragile financial markets.
Nonetheless, some economists and analysts say that the group has lost much of its leverage over Indonesian policy because members have too much riding on economic recovery to deny the country further funds.
"Indonesia at the end of the day has a very big strategic importance in the region," said Vincent Low, first vice president for fixed-income research and strategy at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. "From a geopolitical point of view, it's too big to fail."
Moreover, Indonesia's government owes the rest of the world more than $60 billion, so much of the donor group's pledges go toward servicing existing debt. Indonesian annual foreign debt payments are the equivalent of about two-thirds of the group's pledge, said David G. Fernandez, a J. P. Morgan economist.
Indonesia is counting on the international loans to offset roughly 40 percent of its expected budget deficit next year. High prices for Indonesian oil, however, may reduce the country's need for some of the aid. The proposed budget prices crude oil at $22 a barrel, while oil is now trading around $35 a barrel. Conservative estimates of that sort enabled Indonesia to finance its budget deficit this year without drawing on the credit line from the consultative group's lenders.
And despite continued separatist violence, religious strife and political instability, Indonesia's economic recovery still appears to be on track. Many economists predict growth of at least 4 percent in 2001, with the World Bank noting that wages, adjusted for inflation, are rising, and demand for cars, electricity and building materials like cement are increasing, as well.
That is good news to Indonesian creditors, especially Japan. Lenders there account for more than 30 percent of the Indonesian government's foreign debt, according to the World Bank, and Japan is offering to contribute more than $1.5 billion of the group's total pledge this week.
Indonesia's bargaining position in Tokyo may, therefore, seem strong, but economists warn that its financial situation is still precarious. "Financial markets remain unconvinced by developments in the real economy," said the World Bank's regional vice president, Jemaluddin Kassum, who will preside at the meeting in Tokyo. Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has fallen about 20 percent since the start of the year and stock prices, down 40 percent in local-currency terms, are at their lowest level in a year and a half.
Unlike in the United States, though, falling markets here have little impact on consumer confidence; most Indonesians do not own stocks. But such developments make it harder for Indonesia to hold up its end of financing the budget deficit.
The country's bank restructuring agency, which controls assets equivalent to more than half the economy, is also responsible for plugging roughly half the budget deficit by selling some of those assets. The agency recently postponed plans to sell one of its most highly prized assets, Bank Central Asia, citing poor market conditions.
The delay upset the I.M.F., which had set the bank's sale this year as one of the terms for its own, separate $5 billion assistance program. The I.M.F. and foreign investors say the orderly sale of the agency's repossessed assets is important in reviving investor interest in Indonesia. But concerns that foreigners would be able to purchase national assets at fire-sale prices arouse nationalist furor here.
The latest source of disillusionment among investors was a deal late last month by the bank restructuring agency to take over a textile and engineering company, Texmaco, to recover $2.7 billion in debts the company owes it. Because the deal eventually puts the company's politically connected management back in charge, critics are calling it a bailout.
The Texmaco controversy opened a rift between the government and the World Bank and I.M.F., after the leak of a letter to Mr. Ramli from the two organizations urging Indonesia to obtain a second opinion. Mr. Ramli, who before his appointment as economics minister this year was a prominent critic of the I.M.F., accused it and the World Bank of discriminating against President Wahid's government.
Many Indonesian politicians suspect that other conglomerates were given unduly favorable treatment under the administration of Mr. Wahid's predecessor, B. J. Habibie, when the bank restructuring agency had a much closer relationship with the I.M.F. and Western financial advisers.
Despite the rancor, the World Bank has taken pains to emphasize Indonesia's progress and explain the country's turmoil as an inevitable side effect of its newly minted democracy. Analysts here say that with so much at stake, little rebuke in practical terms is to be expected from the donors' meeting in Tokyo.
"Nobody's going to sink Indonesia's first democratic government in 50 years," a Western banking official said. "Not in its first year."

Earthquake Threat
 Residents of the Central Mississippi Valley are on something of a roller coaster ride -- a slow roller coaster ride -- when it comes to the threat of large earthquakes.
The New Madrid fault zone, a 100-mile stretch along the Mississippi River from Missouri to Arkansas, has been the site of several large earthquakes over the past 1,500 years, including three powerful ones in 1811-1812 when, fortunately, there were comparatively few people around. The question has been whether the area, which now includes St. Louis and Memphis, can expect another strong earthquake anytime soon. 
 The issue appeared to have been resolved last year, when a study by a Northwestern University geologist showed almost no ground movement in the fault zone, suggesting that it would take at least 1,000 years, and possibly much longer, for enough strain to build up for a devastating earthquake to occur.
But a new study in the journal Science by researchers at the California Institute of Technology and Stanford suggests that a quake could occur much sooner. The surface may not be moving much, these researchers say, but stress is building up below.
The researchers say that the earlier study applied the ground-movement data to a fault model similar to that found at the edges of tectonic plates, while the New Madrid zone is in the middle of one. The scientists developed a new model for such a region, called an intraplate zone, suggesting that strain builds up in a weak area below the surface and eventually shifts to the surface, where it causes a rupture in the fault.
The scientists put the time between such ruptures at 250 to 4,000 years, meaning a strong quake could occur as early as the middle of this century.

Land of Sprawl
Earthquakes are more certain in California, and the joke has been that someday half the state will slide into the ocean. But California is already losing land in a different way.
A new report by the state's Department of Conservation says about 70,000 acres of open space was lost to urban and suburban sprawl over a two-year period ending in 1998 -- a 25 percent increase over the previous two years. The state's booming economy and population growth are to blame, officials said.
Southern California, the region that put sprawl on the map, lost the most open space, nearly half the state total, followed by the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay area.
Of the acreage lost (an area about five times the size of Manhattan), about 60 percent was farmland. Since California now supplies more than 50 percent of the country's fruits and vegetables, loss of farmland is cause for some concern nationally. The report did, however, show an increase in the amount of irrigated farmland in some areas. But this was mostly in form of vineyards.

Salt of Antarctica
There is still plenty of open space in Antarctica, including the Dry Valleys, landforms curiously devoid of the ice and snow that smothers the rest of continent.
In addition to being dry, the valleys, which are near McMurdo Sound, are very salty. Researchers have long debated where the salts, including sulfates, came from. Some believe it was sea salt blown from the oceans; others hold it was the legacy of an ancient sea that covered the region.
A report in Nature offers convincing evidence that the salt does originate in the oceans around Antarctica, but not largely from sea salt. Instead, by examining the composition of oxygen isotopes in the sulfates, researchers from the University of California at San Diego discovered that they come from sulfur-belching marine algae. The sulfur gas is oxidized in the atmosphere and deposited as sulfates in the valleys.
Since the Dry Valleys are about the closest thing to Mars on Earth, the researchers say their findings could have implications for the search for signs of life on Mars, to see how similar phenomena may have occurred there.

HEADLINE: China Says Its Economy Grew At 8.2% Rate in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Strong exports and a mild rebound in domestic spending drove China's economic growth rate to 8.2 percent in the third quarter, the government reported today. The rate was faster than expected and virtually ensured that a seven-year slide in the country's growth rate has ended.
The rebound is important in preparing China's economy for World Trade Organization membership, which is expected to subject some sectors of the country's economy to strong foreign competition. But the numbers gloss over enduring economic weaknesses, particularly in the countryside. 
 "In general, so far this year, economic development was better than expected," the State Statistical Bureau spokesman, Ye Zhen, told a news conference.
China's gross domestic product expansion of 8.2 percent in the quarter was less than the 8.3 percent rise in the second quarter but was still better than the widespread expectations that third-quarter growth would slip below 8 percent. The third-quarter performance puts the economy on track to beat the 7.1 percent growth posted in 1999, reversing seven years of slowing growth.
While even 7.1 percent growth sounds high by international standards, it is considered near the danger zone in China, where economic development is spread unevenly across the huge country. Many areas were in recession last year with unemployment reaching as high as 30 percent in some towns.
Government officials worried that a further slide in economic growth could fuel political unrest.
China sneaked through Asia's economic crisis despite a sharp slowdown in exports and a drop in foreign investment by pumping up its economy with heavy government spending. That spending has slowed, but export growth is again strong, driving the economy. The country's exports increased 33.1 percent in the January-to-September period after gaining 38 percent in the first half of the year. Exports account for about one-fifth of China's G.D.P. and the United States takes about a fifth of all China's exports.
But rural incomes in the first nine months of the year rose just 2.5 percent compared with an 8.4 percent increase in urban incomes. That gap has widened from a year ago. China's farmers, hit this year by a severe drought, are among the most vulnerable to changes that will flow from the country's membership in the W.T.O., which will open China's markets to higher-quality, lower-priced agricultural products.
And domestic spending remains weak despite signs of a mild recovery. The government has extended national holidays and sharply cut interest rates on bank deposits to get people to use some of their savings. Retail sales grew 9.9 percent in the nine-month period, while consumer prices edged 0.2 percent higher in the period compared with a year earlier.
Financial insecurity over the impact of China's membership in the W.T.O., which could be completed within months, is likely to keep many Chinese consumers in a saving mood. "In the long run, I think that we still have to face the problem of insufficient demand," Mr. Ye of the statistical bureau said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCIES;
Euro Falls as Central Banker Discourages Intervention Talk

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Euro bears pushed the common currency down yesterday to a level just above its low against the dollar, emboldened after Europe's chief central banker made comments that appeared to play down chances of further market intervention.
In an interview with The Times of London, the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, was quoted as saying that it would be inappropriate for the central bank or the Group of 7 leading industrial nations to support the currency in times of market turmoil caused by external events, like a war in the Middle East. 
 Traders said the remarks, just three weeks after a joint intervention in the currency markets to bolster the ailing euro, provided yet another reason to sell the unpopular currency.
In New York, the euro settled late yesterday at 85.05 cents, down from 85.44 cents on Friday. The euro reached an end-of-session low of 84.72 cents in New York on Sept. 20.
"We saw euro sellers start to come out in force late last week as U.S. equity markets and oil stabilized a little," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets. "Today, the market construed Duisenberg's latest comments as a license to sell."
Dennis Heidt, chief dealer at BNP Paribas in New York, said: "The market is very nervous. We've reached some critical levels in the euro on the support side," adding that thin trading was exaggerating speculative market moves.
A flurry of comments from European officials also lent some late-day support.
A European Central Bank executive board member, Sirkka Hamalainen, said in Dublin that policy makers were concerned that the weak euro posed a potential risk to the world economy.
France's finance minister, Laurent Fabius, attending a euro group meeting in Luxembourg, said euro zone central bankers and finance ministers agreed that the equilibrium value of the euro should be markedly higher than its current trading level.
Earlier, the president of the Bundesbank, Ernst Welteke, also kept the idea of intervention in circulation, telling journalists that currency market interventions are a tool of every central bank.

HEADLINE: 2 Banks Post Their Profits: One Gains, One Declines

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that third-quarter profits fell 15 percent because of severance costs and a drop in value of auto leases, while the Bank of New York Company, a commercial bank active in the securities servicing business, posted higher profits, helped by transaction processing and foreign exchange revenues.
Shares of Bank of America fell $1.38, to $45.19, and Bank of New York shares rose $2.19 cents, to $53.31. 
 Net income at Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. and has about $680 billion in assets and nearly 4,500 branches in 21 states, fell to $1.83 billion, or $1.10 a share, in the quarter, down from $2.15 billion or $1.23 a share. The latest results include a large revamping charge for layoffs, as the bank struggles to cut costs, and a charge from a drop in auto lease values, it said.
"Bank of America in the third quarter faced the same headwind of higher interest rates and a slowing economy as other banks," Hugh McColl Jr., the bank's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May of this year, to keep inflation under control.
Bank of America is also trying to iron out wrinkles left over from its merger two years ago. In July, it announced plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs, or around 7 percent of its work force, to scale back costs.
Without a $346 million after-tax charge and a $257 million pretax reduction in income for auto lease problems, Bank of America's third-quarter profits rose to $2.18 billion, or $1.31 a share, in the quarter, topping Wall Street expectations.
Other regional banks were also helped by relatively stable credit quality in the quarter.
Bank of New York, the parent of one of the nation's oldest commercial banks, said its third-quarter profit rose 16 percent, to $363 million, or 49 cents a share, aided by fees from keeping securities in safekeeping and helping foreign companies offer shares in the United States. That compared with third-quarter 1999 net income, excluding one-time items, of $313 million, or 42 cents a share.
Including a $1.02 billion pretax gain from the sale of BNY Financial and a liquidity charge for the sale of loans, the company booked a third-quarter profit last year of $773 million, or $1.02 a share. Wall Street had expected the bank to earn 49 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' profit forecasts.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Briefer Settlement Period on Stock Trades

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The securities industry must shorten the time it takes to complete stock trades because lengthy delays are posing risks to the financial system, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today.
Mr. Greenspan said rising volumes of stock trading were "straining the capacity" of brokerage firms to settle trades in a timely fashion. 
 He said "an increasing number of transactions are failing to settle as scheduled on the third business day" after the trade is executed.
Mr. Greenspan said delays between the purchase of a stock and the completion of the paperwork increases risks to the financial system, including to banks that make loans to help finance purchases of stock.
"Errors and delays in settling trades imply greater operational risks," Mr. Greenspan said at a financial markets conference sponsored by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Mr. Greenspan noted that the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, has been working to shorten the settlement cycle with the aim of having all trades completed the day after the stock sale instead of within the current three-day period.
The Fed chief, whose agency is a principal regulator of banks, said that a shorter time for the completion of stock sales would lower the risk of defaults on any one trade.
When stock prices plunge, the Fed worries that large banks may be vulnerable if investors to whom they have lent money are unable to come up with more collateral for those loans as stock prices plummet.
In his remarks, Mr. Greenspan made no mention of the recent volatility of the stock market, or of what the Fed's next move might be on interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks today echoed testimony he gave last April to the Senate Banking Committee in which he called for a limited role by government regulators in the rapid changes in stock trading as a result of computers and the Internet.
"Government authorities are poorly suited to picking winners and losers among competing technologies and market structures," Mr. Greenspan said. "Innovations have to be tested by the marketplace -- ultimately by consumer choice."

HEADLINE: The Crisis That Maybe Cried Wolf;
Heating Oil Supplies Might Exceed Official Estimates

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Despite the recent turmoil in the Mideast that has raised the specter of higher oil prices and supply disruptions that could make for a precarious winter, there is growing evidence that the shortfall of home heating fuel in the Northeast may not be as dire as earlier feared.
A large number of homeowners and businesses, worried that oil prices would continue to increase, appear to have stocked up earlier than in past years. And many utilities and businesses in New York and New Jersey are for the first time required to build at least a seven-day supply of heating oil before winter. As a result, there appears to be more heating oil in reserve than the official figures show, industry experts say. 
 For some time, supplies of crude oil have been rising, and refineries in the United States have been running nearly flat-out. Yet the price of heating oil has climbed to lofty heights, largely because the officially reported volumes in storage that serve as a buffer against events like an early cold snap or a pipeline explosion remained so low. That set off alarms among policy makers and led to a White House decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help bolster supplies.
Where has the heating oil been going? A lot more than usual at this time of year is probably already in the tanks of thousands of homeowners and in the storage sites of heating oil dealers and businesses whose stockpiles fall below the radar of the weekly statistics, according to many industry officials.
"The news stories have alerted people to the problem of high prices and low supplies, and they're filling their tanks," said John Kilduff, senior vice president for risk management at Fimat, the commodities trading unit of Societe Generale. "A lot of oil may be working its way into storage that goes unmeasured."
On a morning that still felt like the ebbing summer, for example, Ray Moss walked down his driveway in shirt sleeves and house slippers to prepare for winter. For months, he had heard that heating oil prices would rise much higher than last year and that supplies would dip much lower. So this September day, Mr. Moss led a heating oil deliveryman behind his house in East Orange, N.J., to fill the 1,000-gallon tank buried under his napkin-sized backyard.
"I bought a thousand gallons ahead of time to make sure I had enough oil," he said, with a satisfied smile. "I purchased this oil just before prices went up."
To be sure, prices this winter are expected to average roughly 25 percent higher than last year and unusually harsh weather could make the situation worse. Last week, after reports of a dip in official inventories, the wholesale price for heating oil closed at $1.0161 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, compared with 59.61 cents a year ago and a peak during the past winter of 95.2 cents on Jan. 31. The price closed yesterday at 97.23 cents.
"This is an issue of affordability, not availability," said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "The government should be concentrating on protecting those who can least afford high fuel prices."
Though the lag in oil stockpiles has swept into public consciousness only recently, the problem has been building over the last three years. It started with a decision taken by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in late 1997 to increase supply, followed quickly by a sharp cutback when prices collapsed. That unleashed months of seesaw prices, fluctuating oil supplies and market jitters that, together, have left the Northeast and Midwest with the lowest levels of official heating oil reserves in four years.
As of last week, official inventories were about 35 percent below last year's levels. And problems at the edges of the supply-and-demand equation are likely to keep stockpiles low. Many refineries plan to shut down for a few weeks in October and November to carry out necessary maintenance. Higher prices for heating oil in Europe had also been drawing fuel overseas.
But absent an unexpected supply interruption from the Persian Gulf or an unusually severe winter, the uncounted extra supplies in the hands of businesses and homeowners, together with the newly refined oil now working its way through the system, should be enough to allow the Northeast region, where heating oil use is concentrated, to squeak through without a major disruption, economists say. Indeed, only about 10 percent to 15 percent of heating oil consumed in winter comes from industry inventories, with the bulk of fuel moving to consumers straight from refinery production.
The weekly statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, which is a trade association, and the federal Energy Information Administration measure inventories held at major refining and storage operations, but not the oil stockpiled by heating oil retailers and consumers.
In the manicured villages and fraying industrial hubs of northeastern New Jersey, every twist and turn of the heating oil market is followed closely these days. As he makes his rounds delivering oil for the J. W. Pierson Company of East Orange, Paul Smith, a burly man with a graying goatee, serves as a cross between town crier and Wall Street forecaster.
One morning, Mr. Smith climbed down from the cab of a truck carrying 3,000 gallons of heating fuel, and two scruffy young men in a pick-up stopped to ask, as others would throughout the day, which way oil prices were moving. His employer has schooled him and the 11 other drivers to handle pointed questions from customers. "They told us what we might expect. You know: 'Why is the oil so high?' and 'What's the matter with you people?' " Mr. Smith shouted over his truck's grinding engine. "Mainly, I tell them it has to do with low oil reserves."
While far from panicking, customers have been calling heating oil dealers more often, arranging to prepay for fuel and asking for deliveries earlier than in past years. Many view the price jumps as temporary.
"Things go up and things go down, and that's where my faith in the situation comes from," said Nat Testa, as Mr. Smith filled the tank behind the two-story building that houses his advertising agency in Montclair, N.J.
Low-income consumers suffer most from high fuel prices. On Sept. 23, the White House released an additional $400 million in federal money to help low-income people with heating bills.
And before it tapped the reserve for up to 30 million barrels of government-owned oil, the White House dealt with this year's rising prices by prodding OPEC to increase production. The cartel has raised exports by about three million barrels a day since March.
The larger supply of oil should normally have dampened prices more by now. But even operating flat-out, refineries have not managed to build extra inventory. "The problem is not from what OPEC is producing now, but what it cut a few years ago," Mr. Goldstein said.
Lower supplies meant less oil entered refineries. When a barrel of crude is refined, about half the yield is gasoline and about a quarter of it is middle distillate, a category that includes diesel and heating oil. Refineries can tweak the proportions only slightly, increasing one product at the expense of another by about 3 to 5 percentage points. This year, refiners configured crude runs to maximize gasoline production, which crimped middle distillate. Moreover, much of the middle distillate was diesel, which was quickly consumed by factories and businesses.
Since late summer, refineries have been playing catch-up. High heating oil prices make it attractive for them to stretch middle distillate output. Refineries are now producing more heating oil every week than they did last year.
Traders and refiners have little incentive to hold on to inventories, however, because heating oil prices are expected to fall in the future. As a result, they are eager to sell the heating oil now at a good price rather than wait for a better price.
Heating oil distributors in the Northeast have been buying the oil and either storing it themselves or selling it to business and residential customers. "I'm grabbing the oil as quickly as I can get it because my customers want it," said John Depken, an owner of the Keller-Depken Oil Company in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. "They're afraid if they call next week, I won't have any oil and that's not true. I have firm contracts and am kind of oversupplied because I thought this would be a problem."
Among the biggest purchasers are industrial and commercial operations with interruptible natural gas contracts, which permit them to buy gas at a discounted price in return for allowing their utility to shut off the supply when demand is high. The enterprises then switch to generators often powered by heating oil.
New York and New Jersey now require companies with interruptible contracts to build a seven-day supply of heating oil before winter. The states want to avoid the panic that occurred last February, when companies rushed to the oil market after their gas was shut off during a cold snap. Coupled with the demand from homeowners, heating oil prices doubled last winter.
The College of New Jersey, like many large buyers that suffered gas supply interruptions and heating oil price spikes last winter, acted even before it received the state mandate. When its natural gas is turned off, the college near Trenton requires 10,000 gallons of heating oil daily. Concerned about high prices, it locked in three to four weeks' supply over the summer at 91 cents a gallon.
To meet the strong demand for oil products, refineries have been operating at close to full capacity. But some will have to shut down this fall for routine but crucial maintenance. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that about 5 percent of the country's refining capacity will be affected by such breaks over the next month, further limiting the flow of heating oil.
"We're running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the wear-and-tear gets to a point that we can't run our equipment safely," said Jefferson F. Allen, president of the Tosco Corporation, which supplies about 15 percent of the Northeast's heating oil.
Another factor that has limited supplies is the export of fuel to Europe, where lower inventories in countries like Germany have pushed prices even higher than in the United States. But several refiners, at the request of the Energy Department, agreed last week not to export heating oil for a while, according to Platts, an oil industry newsletter.
And higher prices will ultimately replenish supplies. Fuel will move to where it commands the most money. When prices rocketed during last February's cold snap, heating oil rushed into the Northeast, as companies took advantage of steep prices. High crude prices have encouraged oil-producing countries and petroleum companies to increase exploration and production. When that new oil starts to flow next year, crude prices will most likely decline.
And as high prices lead to greater production, they also cool demand, easing the pressure further. "High prices will reduce demand over the long run," said Jerry Taylor, director of natural resources at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group in Washington. "Today's price bubble will burst of its own accord."

HEADLINE: Philippine Leader Tries to Withstand Buffeting From Scandal

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Joseph E. Estrada, the embattled president of the Philippines, stood firm today in a widening scandal involving reported kickbacks from gambling rackets.
Although Mr. Estrada talked tough -- sounding for all the world like one of the action heroes whom he used to play in the movies -- support for the actor-turned-politician continued to crumble. 
 On Tuesday, a coalition of business groups is widely expected to issue a statement withdrawing its support for Mr. Estrada and suggesting that he be removed from office, through resignation or impeachment. That follows demands for his resignation from opposition leaders, as well as from Cardinal Jaime Sin and the Catholic Bishops Conference.
Last week, Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo broke with Mr. Estrada by resigning from his cabinet. Ms. Arroyo remains vice president and would succeed him.
The loss of support from business leaders could cripple Mr. Estrada because it underscores the economic damage of the scandal. The Philippine peso fell to another low against the United States dollar today, before recovering slightly after the central bank intervened.
"It's becoming a foregone conclusion that the president must go," the executive director of the influential Makati Business Club, Guillermo M. Luz, said. "If he stays on, the economy will not perform well."
Opposition leaders plan to file impeachment charges against Mr. Estrada on Wednesday in the House of Representatives. But with the president's allies in control, that effort could drag on for months.
Mr. Estrada has denied the central allegation of the scandal, that he received more than $10 million in payoffs from operators of illegal gambling rings. Today, he told reporters that his political enemies were planning an arson and bombing campaign to hound him out of office.
"They are planning to burn and throw bombs in the street to cause chaos in our nation," Mr. Estrada said. "That is what we are on watch for. I am warning our people and our country."
In a televised address on Sunday, Mr. Estrada sounded a different note when he apologized for the scandal's having paralyzed the country. He pledged to remove the government from all forms of gambling.
The numbers game that Mr. Estrada is accused of profiting from is illegal, though people here say it is pervasive. The kingpins who control the games funnel some of the proceeds to local politicians to buy protection from the police. Experts say drug dealing is also involved.
"We've barely scratched the tip of the iceberg in this scandal," said Alexander R. Magno, a political expert.
Mr. Estrada's troubles began last week when one of his close friends, Luis Singson, a provincial governor, said he had delivered 500 million pesos, or $10.3 million, to the president. That represented Mr. Estrada's cut of profits from gambling in Governor Singson's province, Illocos Sur.
In testimony before the Senate, Mr. Singson produced a ledger that listed the names of recipients of payoffs. One entry had the initials A. S., which he said was a code for Mr. Estrada. Other people listed in the ledger, including senators, admitted receiving payments.
"In some ways, this is even worse than Marcos, because at least he had the legal skills to disguise his activities," said Ronaldo M. Llamas, an opposition leader, referring to the ousted dictator.
Like Marcos, Mr. Estrada shows no sign of leaving without a struggle. The difference is that Mr. Estrada was elected on a tide of support from poor voters. Most experts said it would be extremely hard to stampede the president out of office unless those supporters abandoned him.
That is why people here are fixated on the plunging peso. A weak currency could hobble the already fragile economy. It would hit poor people in the form of more costly food and fuel.
For now, polls about Mr. Estrada's conduct have yielded widely divergent views of sentiment. Opposition leaders are organizing a rally on the main commercial boulevard of Manila on Wednesday, hoping to rekindle the spirit of the People Power movement that swept out Marcos.
Another wild card is the military. Mr. Estrada has won the favor of top generals by giving them latitude to wage war on Muslim separatists in strife-torn Mindanao Province. But some analysts said the army could become restive if the country descended into chaos.
"This is a race between a democratic uprising on the street and a military coup," said Walden F. Bello, a professor at the University of the Philippines and an outspoken critic of Mr. Estrada.

A Reassuring Scorecard for Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Affirmative action -- preferential treatment toward women and minority applicants as practiced by employers, university admissions officers and government contractors -- remains under attack 32 years after President Johnson ordered federal contractors to seek female and minority employees. Two states have voted to wipe out the use of race- and gender-based preferences by state agencies. Parents have challenged the race-based admissions policies of public schools. Even Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president, once opposed policies "based on group preference instead of individual merit."
Some of affirmative action's critics contend that preferential hiring and admissions are always wrong in principle no matter how attractive the consequences. But other critics focus on affirmative action's alleged failings. According to this argument, the policy creates divisive workplaces, breeds cynicism and corruption and hurts many of the individuals it is supposed to help. That debate should turn on the facts. Instead it has been fueled almost entirely by anecdotes -- until now. 
 In the most recent issue of the Journal of Economic Literature, a publication of the American Economic Association, two respected economists provide an 85-page review of over 200 serious scientific studies of affirmative action. Harry Holzer of Georgetown University and David Neumark of Michigan State University ferret out every statistic from the studies to measure the effects of affirmative action. Harsh critics of affirmative action will not find much comfort.
The authors concede the evidence is sometimes murky. Yet they find that affirmative action produces tangible benefits for women, for minority entrepreneurs, students and workers and for the overall economy. Employers adopting the policy increase the relative number of women and minority employees by an average of between 10 and 15 percent. Affirmative action has helped boost the percentage of blacks attending college by a factor of three and the percentage of blacks enrolled in medical school by a factor of four since the early 1960's. Between 1982 and 1991 the number of federal contracts going to black-owned businesses rose by 125 percent, even though the total number of federal contracts rose by less than 25 percent during the period.
To no one's surprise, the two economists rivet on economic performance. Here, the survey is interesting for what it does not find. There is, the authors say, little credible evidence that affirmative action appointees perform badly or diminish the overall performance of the economy.
Women hired under affirmative action, they say, largely match their male counterparts in credentials and performance. Blacks and Hispanics hired under affirmative action generally lag behind on credentials, such as education, but usually perform about as well as non-minority employees.
In a separate study, Mr. Holzer and Mr. Neumark interviewed thousands of supervisors and showed that they ranked most affirmative-action hires roughly the same as ordinary hires. The authors find that companies undertaking affirmative action use extensive recruitment and training to bring workers who fall a notch below average on credentials up to the performance level of other workers.
Critics have often pointed to the wide gap between SAT scores of black and white students admitted to selective universities as proof that they are lowering standards for minority students and putting them in settings they cannot handle. But the use of a test gap as a measure of reverse discrimination is misleading. Much of the gap would exist even if admissions were race-blind. Colleges pull applicants from a population that includes many more high-scoring whites than blacks.
A discrimination-free procedure would start by tapping the pool, largely white, of high scorers and then turn to the pool of lower-scoring whites and blacks. The average test scores for whites admitted to the college would thus exceed that of the blacks admitted.
To be sure, some selective universities add to the test gap by giving preference to minority applicants. But, the data shows, black students at elite colleges graduate at greater rates than blacks at less demanding colleges, disproving claims that affirmative action disserves minority students.
The Holzer-Neumark survey shows that affirmative action in admissions has produced significant social benefits. For example, black doctors choose more often than their white medical school classmates to serve indigent or minority patients in inner cities and rural areas.
Though favorable, these findings hardly end the debate on affirmative action. The critics who refuse to accept government-sanctioned racial or gender preferences no matter what the benefit will continue to object. Affirmative action can be misused, as when whites running a company create a fiction of black ownership to qualify for credits in seeking government contracts. But the evidence marshaled by the authors largely vindicates affirmative action and should provide the ammunition for rebutting those critics who refuse to take facts into account.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: MARKET PLACE;
A candidate weighs in on an accounting rule change.

BYLINE: By Reed Abelson 

 BODY:
SIX years ago, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was instrumental in derailing stricter accounting rules on stock options. And with businesses facing new accounting rules on acquisitions that could hurt their bottom line, Senator Lieberman, now the Democratic vice presidential candidate, joined 12 other senators earlier this year in pushing for a delay of the new rules.
The musings of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private-sector body based in Norwalk, Conn., that sets the nation's accounting standards, are rarely of interest to the movers and shakers in Washington -- except when influential executives start complaining. Investors clearly do not have friends in such high places. 
 The board is considering the elimination of a popular accounting technique that allows companies to avoid good-will charges that reduce reported profits. The technique, known as pooling of interests, is frequently used by large technology companies, which argue that the elimination of this method would hurt their ability to make acquisitions that fuel their growth. But the technique has also been criticized for not giving investors information about these acquisitions.
Concerned about the effect of new rules, Mr. Lieberman joined 12 other senators in writing a letter in late September to the accounting board. "As United States senators concerned about the continued innovation and growth of the U.S. technology sector, we urge F.A.S.B. to postpone any final decision regarding the pooling accounting method until the various alternatives to improve financial reporting have been fully considered," the senators wrote.
Although the board had already said it would delay its decision until early next year, the senators asked the board for "assurance that F.A.S.B. will take no conclusive action on its current project on business combinations until Congress has reconvened in 2001 and had the opportunity to review the economic impact of F.A.S.B.'s plans at that time."
These senators are not the only ones getting into the act. Two California representatives, Christopher Cox, a Republican, and Cal Dooley, a Democrat, introduced a bill this month that would allow companies to use pooling for a year while there is further study of the issue.
Washington's rush to protect the high-technology industry has met with criticism from those who believe the work of the accounting board should remain out of the political fray. The current efforts by Congress represent "blatant government intervention in the private sector to serve the selfish interests of the technology industries," argued Jack T. Ciesielski, an analyst in Baltimore who specializes in accounting issues. What concerns him is the possibility that the board's decisions will become more about politics than good accounting. Whenever the board tackles a controversial accounting issue, "companies are going to go to Congress," he said.
The last political victory took place six years ago, on the accounting board's proposed rule on stock options. Mr. Lieberman is credited with derailing the board's plans to require companies to expense the value of stock options by proposing legislation that would have virtually put the accounting board out of business.
The board eventually backed down, choosing instead to require companies to disclose more information about the options they were handing out. "The board elected to come up with a second-best answer in order to live to fight another day," said Dennis R. Beresford, an accounting professor at the University of Georgia who was then chairman of the accounting board.
But businesses were emboldened by their success and are now quick to lobby politicians when they are faced with accounting standards they dislike, said Edmund L. Jenkins, its current chairman. Businesses, he said, "are using the political process to try to achieve their desires;I think that is unfortunate."
Mr. Jenkins is opposed to the proposed legislation to retain pooling for a year. While the bill does not call for a specific solution, the enforced delay in rules that would provide investors with better information "is interfering with the private-sector standard-setting process," he argued.
He is now in the position of trying to persuade Congress that the accounting board is doing nothing in haste. Noting that the board has been reviewing merger accounting for four years and has held dozens of public meetings, as well as four days of public hearings, Mr. Jenkins wrote the senators recently that "we are certainly not rushing to any final conclusions."
And four representatives, all of them accountants, including E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican, and Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, have also come out against the proposed legislation. "It is critical that accounting standard setting remains insulated from the influence of special interest groups and politics to ensure that accounting standards, and the resulting financial reporting, continue to provide investors with an unbiased and informative picture of a company's activities," the four wrote in a letter to their colleagues.
Unlike the stock-option debate, where business opposition to the new rules was nearly universal, opinion is much more divided about merger accounting. What is more, the board is considering rules that in some cases would allow companies to avoid expensing good will, which would address the major concern over the elimination of pooling.
As for Mr. Lieberman, he is unlikely to push for legislation in the case of merger accounting, said Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for the senator. The senator's decision to propose legislation as a way of blocking new rules concerning stock options was a "last resort," Mr. Gerstein explained, because the rule would have had such dire consequences for the economy -- at least if one listened to the rule's critics.
The real question is whether Mr. Lieberman and others will allow the accounting board to come to its own conclusions next year -- far away from this year's elections and from Washington.

HEADLINE: Inventories Grew 0.7% In August

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Inventories at businesses rose solidly in August as sales of goods increased, the government said today in a report consistent with a picture of slowing economic growth.
The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.7 percent in August, to $1.206 trillion, after a 0.4 percent increase in July. The August gain was the largest since a 0.9 percent gain in June. Business inventories typically rise in response to a slowing economy as companies are left with higher levels of stocks in warehouses as sales slow. 
 The gain was larger than the 0.4 percent gain forecast by economists and followed a 0.4 percent rise in July. The August gain was driven by a 0.9 percent increase in stocks of durable goods.
Inventories at auto dealers rose a strong 2.8 percent, after falling 0.2 percent in July. Economists said part of that gain could be because of the volatility related to the model year changeover.
"This is more of a response to disappointing retail sales rather than the buildup in inventories for anticipated future sales," said David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast in New York. "The underlying momentum still seems to be some sort of modest slowdown in the economy."
Mr. Sloan said he expected the August buildup would not be repeated in the months ahead, noting that even with the August gains, inventory levels were trending lower.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, was among those who said the buildup was partly caused by buying for the holiday season.
"The primary reason for August's increase is that businesses are getting ready for the holiday season. They still expect it to be healthy, so they have stocked up," Mr. Sohn said.
The inventories to sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to deplete stocks totally at the current sales pace, rose modestly, to 1.34 months, up from 1.33 months in July.
Sales rose 0.5 percent in August, to $902.34 billion, after a 0.6 percent drop in July.

HEADLINE: Farmers Cite Scarce Data In Corn Mixing

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Some farmers who planted a variety of bioengineered corn unapproved for human consumption say they were not adequately warned about restrictions on how it was to be planted, stored and sold, despite suppliers' claims to have done so.
Farmers in several Midwestern states have said they were not told that the corn, known as StarLink, must be kept separate from other crops until reports emerged last month that it had been detected in a brand of taco shells. And others said that while they were told last spring that the corn had not been approved by federal regulators for human consumption, they were also told that they need not worry because approval was expected shortly. 
 Like a number of other genetically engineered crops, StarLink has been altered with a bacterial gene to make a protein that kills the corn borer caterpillar. But unlike the others, StarLink was limited to use in animal feed and industrial products pending further testing because the Environmental Protection Agency could not rule out a link between the StarLink protein and food allergies.
"The farmers calling in, to a man, said they had never been told it wasn't fit for human consumption," said Kenneth Root, host of "Agritalk," a program carried on many rural radio stations. Callers also questioned how widely publicized the recommended planting restrictions for the crop had been.
StarLink's inventor, Aventis Crop-Science, a subsidiary of Aventis S.A. of France, and the seed companies that sold StarLink varieties say they told farmers that the corn had not been approved for food use and that they should keep a 660-foot buffer strip to prevent StarLink from spreading its genes to other corn during pollination.
Senior officials of Aventis and the Garst Seed Company, the largest StarLink vendor, did not respond yesterday to repeated requests for comment on the farmers' assertions of insufficient warning and on the companies' efforts to contain the StarLink crops.
Last week, food and grain industry officials working to track down the StarLink corn said millions of bushels of possibly tainted grain might have found their way into food production channels.
Just what farmers knew and when they knew it could end up playing a role in lawsuits growing out of the affair, according to lawyers who handle agriculture cases. Aventis and the seed companies might have a hard time fending off liability for the expenses of farmers, grain elevators, millers and food companies in sorting out the mess if they did not do enough to head off foreseeable risks that mixing would occur.
Because farmers have widely varying levels of sophistication in record-keeping and attention to documentation, it takes more than a policy set at some distant corporate headquarters to control the rollout of new technology. Seed sales may be overseen by full-time seed company managers, but the distribution often relies on farmer representatives selling to neighbors. How rigorously corporate policies are pushed down the network can vary.
"I missed the meeting where they talked about restrictions," Rollin Smith, a farmer in Columbus Junction, Iowa, who is also a local distributor for Garst, said in an interview. Mr. Smith was identified by Keith Forbes, who owns a local grain elevator, as one of at least two sources of StarLink corn that contaminated the 700,000 bushels in Mr. Forbes's storage bins. Mr. Forbes said he believed that Mr. Smith was unaware of any problems that might arise from bringing the corn in.
"I'll be damned if we know what to do with it," he said.
So far, Aventis has said it will buy segregated StarLink crops from farmers and elevators at a premium of 25 cents a bushel, though there is confusion over the price on which that will be based. Farmers say the company has refused to buy the far larger quantities of corn that may have been mixed with StarLink strains.
"You have to wonder what people assumed would happen," said Neil D. Hamilton, an agricultural law expert at Drake University in Des Moines.
Indeed, even the full-court press in the last few weeks by Aventis and Garst to reach farmers may not have brought all of those involved up to date.
"Some of these guys are going 6 a.m. to midnight on the harvest," said Steven Cummings, grain operations manager at Oakville Feed and Grain in Oakville, Iowa. "They probably haven't even had time to read their mail."
No one knows yet whether just a small number or many hundreds have mixed harvested StarLink corn with the rest of their crop in storage bins or have shipped it to grain elevators, which could vastly complicate the effort to isolate the crop. But a number of farmers have begun to complain publicly.
"We never found out until two weeks ago," said Fred Rosenberger, who grew 40 acres of StarLink corn in Rineyville, Ky., this year. Mr. Rosenberger said that because he stored the corn before realizing that it should be segregated, some 8,000 bushels of StarLink corn were mixed in with about 42,000 bushels of other varieties. Mr. Rosenberger said that some neighbors, whom he declined to name, had unwittingly shipped it to local elevators.
Duane Adams, who farms 1,500 acres in Cosmos, Minn., and is vice president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, said that none of the papers that came with StarLink seed he purchased from Garst last spring carried a warning about the crop's limited use or the notice that it should be planted at least 660 feet from any other corn.
Mr. Adams said he had not harvested his StarLink crop or the corn within the buffer zone yet and expected Aventis to buy it from him when he does. He said that he was surprised to hear in recent conversations with a Garst district manager that both Garst and Aventis sent out "regular letters" regarding the status of the crop.
"I guess I fell through the cracks," he said, noting that his purchase had been relatively small.
The Garst district manager, Duane Hickler, said he believed Mr. Adams's account, but was surprised to hear it because there had been numerous mailings.
The big elevator operators and millers say they have been testing for StarLink in recent weeks and have found little or none of it coming in. Farmers that try to sell them contaminated loads are generally directed to find cattle feedlots or ethanol producers.
The effort to avoid further problems continues to ripple through the farm economy. ConAgra said yesterday that it did not know when it would reopen its large mill in Atcheson, Kan., which it closed last Wednesday. Conagra received information from a source it would not identify that the plant might have been contaminated by StarLink, according to Karen Savinski, a spokeswoman.
"We are still awaiting test results, and we are cleaning the plant," Ms. Savinski said.
One looming problem for farmers with affected corn is that many have contracts to deliver corn to elevators or processors that they can no longer fill with the crops they harvested. Mr. Rosenberger, for instance, said he would have to buy 3,000 bushels of corn on the open market to fulfill a contract with Owensboro Grain. With corn prices rising, uncertainty about how they will fill their obligations or what Aventis will pay for their crop is agonizing to many.
"I'm sick of it," Mr. Smith said, vowing to never plant another Aventis product. Not that StarLink itself is likely to be an option any time soon. Aventis last week withdrew its registration with the E.P.A., ending any effort to sell the crop for any use. An E.P.A. official said that unless Aventis or someone else submitted new information, the question of whether StarLink ever posed a health risk would not be pursued.

HEADLINE: A Day for Families and Farrakhan in a Capital Gathering

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Heeding the call of Minister Louis Farrakhan, tens of thousands of people converged on the national Mall today in a daylong commitment to renewing family solidarity as a force in American life.
"If all this is is a march for feeling good, then this is vanity," said Mr. Farrakhan who dominated the day with a two-hour speech, a mass renewal of wedding vows and a proposal to create an "economic development bank" primed by $100 contributions from families across the nation. 
While Mr. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, extended an invitation to families of all ethnic and religious backgrounds, the vast majority of participants were African-Americans enjoying a sunny day given over to the happy display of thousands of family circles. Babies and youngsters slept, crawled or cried while their parents listened to dozens of speakers endorse a raft of causes, from ending the death penalty to granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.
"This won't happen for another 20 years," said John Lone, a black father who watched the proceedings with his wife, Joanne, and their four children.
"I want the kids to see black people coming together in a spirit of family and fun so they'll be able to pass it on to their kids," he said, emphasizing that he was less interested in the sometimes controversial views of Mr. Farrakhan, whom critics denounce as a race-baiter and anti-Semite.
The day's proclaimed Million Family March fell well short of that total and clearly seemed less than half the estimated 400,000 people who attended Mr. Farrakhan's highly successful Million Man March five years ago. People tended to gather in clusters around separate giant television screens along the Mall rather than in a single flowing throng.
"We're so spread out, we can't meet people from other places," said 27-year-old Deborah Kirk who drove from Charlotte, N.C., with her two children and husband. "In family, you're supposed to be connected, but it's not happening here," she complained, saying that the 1997 Million Woman March was far more energized and interactive.
Further down the Mall, Richard Oben, the 48-year-old director of facilities at The Washington Times, said that the day was well worth it for him, his family and a group of schoolchildren he shepherded from Landover, Md. Like other whites in the crowd, Mr. Oben said he was a follower of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church and founder of the company that publishes The Washington Times.
"Mr. Farrakhan is going in a more universal direction," Mr. Oben said of past controversy as he emphasized the day's larger message of family strength and solidarity.
Indeed, Mr. Farrakhan was far more playful than controversial in his typically rambling, exuberant speech. The day seemed designed around him as much as the idea of family. His speech was preceded by a video biography worthy of a political convention, replete with orchestral crescendos and encomiums about his "life, character and strength."
Speakers praised him as a visionary and "the most courageous man in America today," in the words of Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois.
With the Capitol as his backdrop, Mr. Farrakhan delighted much of the crowd by describing the coming election as "almost like a choice between Beelzebub and the Devil -- you lose with either one."
The crowd responded with a chant: "Farrakhan for President!" And the audience laughed when he instantly responded, "I'm not a politician; I like to be able to speak the truth."
Like other speakers, Mr. Farrakhan called for an end to economic embargoes of Cuba and Iraq. He called for "justice for the Palestinians" among other troubled groups, but he avoided the accusations of other speakers that Israel was largely to blame for the renewal of Middle East violence.
He warned women against abortion: "Choice? Choose well the man you're giving yourself to," he advised to the applause of the crowd. And he warned men against rap lyrics that denigrate women: "Don't call your woman a 'ho!' " he angrily advised to cheers. "Pick up a hoe -- H-O-E -- and start cultivating."
No less did he denounce the government and Congress as being preoccupied with the middle class over the poor. "Help me clean up that gangsta-rap!" he shouted to the crowed's laughter and applause.
The day's speakers included Ayanna Muhammad, an articulate, crowd-stirring, 11-year-old ("Power concedes nothing without demand!") and Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's former Sandinista president ("You are giving an example to the world.").
With obvious pleasure, Mr. Farrakhan greeted an assortment of religious and foreign political figures, including a contingent of Jews from the Neturei Karta International in Monsey, N.Y.
"We've had discussions with Minister Farrakhan and find him to be a very warm person," said Yisroel Dovid Weiss, an associate rabbi with the group, which denounces atheistic "Zionists in the Holy Land" for the renewed fighting there. Asked about Mr. Farrakhan's past denunciations of Jews, Rabbi Weiss said that those comments "clearly were taken out of context."
The day ended with the television screens flashing the contribution address for Mr. Farrakhan's proposed economic development bank to create neighborhood businesses. He said that he hoped for as much as $1 billion from families, which he pledged to protect and use to seek matching funds from government and the private sector.
"Corporate America is buying your political leaders," he told the crowd. "Who will balance the greed of corporate America?"

HEADLINE: Westchester County Frets Over What the Loss of Texaco Would Mean to the Region

BYLINE: By ROBERT WORTH 

DATELINE: HARRISON, N.Y., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Texaco's corporate headquarters, on a vast rolling campus just outside White Plains, has been an important source of employment and a strong philanthropic presence in Westchester County since the company moved here in 1977.
But after Chevron announced on Sunday that it would acquire Texaco and consolidate the headquarters staff in San Francisco, where Chevron is based, a number of local officials and businesspeople expressed concern about how the move would affect the community. 
 "They've been a very good corporate citizen," said Harold Vogt, president of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce. "If Texaco were to depart from the county entirely, it would certainly have an impact."
The company has not determined how many of the 800 employees based here will be laid off, said Andy Norman, a spokesman for Texaco. The new company, to be called Chevron Texaco, plans to eliminate 4,000 positions out of its combined worldwide work force of 57,000, saving $1.2 billion a year.
The company would not allow reporters to speak to employees about potential moves or layoffs, Mr. Norman said. There were no visible signs of distress at the Texaco headquarters, a low-lying stone and glass structure surrounded by lush lawns.
The loss in taxes alone will be significant if the company moves out entirely, said Ronald Bianchi, the Harrison town supervisor. This year Texaco has paid $1,756,000 in school taxes, $410,800 to the town and $866,000 to the county, said Nancy Masi, the Harrison town receiver.
But losing Texaco entirely would not be a devastating blow, said Sal Carrera, the county's director of economic development and real estate. The loss in taxes could easily be regained if another company moved into Texaco's Harrison headquarters. A number of corporations have moved into the county or expanded their operations here in the last year, and those gains have more than offset the losses from other companies that have left or announced plans to leave, like International Paper. Altogether, the county has gained 3,000 employees, and the vacancy rate has dropped from 30 percent to 13 percent in the last 18 months, he said.
In addition, a number of local people said the company's philanthropic impact has been more important than its employment base. Westchester, after all, has suffered the departure or downsizing of a number of corporate giants, starting with I.B.M. in 1993. Texaco has been gradually reducing its Harrison work force since 1983, when it reached a peak of 1,800, said Keelin Molloy, a spokeswoman. The company, which once occupied all of its 770,000-square-foot headquarters, now uses about 650,000. Last spring it rented 120,000 to Atlas Air, an air cargo carrier.
The company has, however, been a strong philanthropic presence here, contributing to a number of schools and nonprofit organizations.
"I would hate to see them go," said Donald Howard, superintendent of schools in Harrison. "They've been a very good neighbor."
Texaco has contributed materials and services worth more than $200,000 a year, Mr. Howard said. They help publish the school newspaper; provide annual grants for technology, the sciences, and multicultural activities; and helped finance a variety of special programs.
Texaco provides similar services for the neighboring Port Chester school district, said the superintendent, Dr. Charles Coletti, including a mentoring program to which Texaco employees have contributed some 15,000 hours of volunteering time.
"It will be a great loss to the community; I can't quite imagine it," said Laura Calzolari, executive director of the Music Conservatory of Westchester, based in White Plains.
Over the last decade, Texaco has provided a number of grants to the conservatory, including a recent three-year grant for $75,000, she said.
Texaco has been calling all the organizations to which it has contributed and reassuring them that it will honor its commitments regardless of what happens to its operations in Westchester, said Anne Dowling, president of the Texaco Foundation and director of corporate contributions and community relations.

HEADLINE: Colleges Post Average Rise In Tuition Of 5 Percent

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

 BODY:
The nation's colleges and universities raised tuition and fees for students by roughly 5 percent this year, capping a decade of price increases that are steadily outpacing family income.
In a report released yesterday, the president of the College Board, Gaston Caperton, portrayed the increases in tuition, which ranged from 3.4 percent at two-year community colleges to 7 percent at two-year private colleges, as moderate, and said universities were making efforts to contain expenses. 
 The costs of attending private four-year colleges grew by 5.2 percent, while those at public four-year colleges rose by 4.4 percent. The average increase, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, ran 5 percent.
The tuition increases, partly offset by a 4 percent rise in total financial aid from government and private sources, come at a moment of unusual bounty for some universities. Last week's Chronicle of Higher Education reported record returns on investments from endowments for some universities, led by Harvard, while noncompetitive congressional research grants to them, so-called pork barrel projects, totaled more than a $1 billion this year for the first time.
University presidents blamed the tuition increases, which ran higher than the 3.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index over the last year, on soaring costs of energy and health care, of updating computer equipment and outfitting dormitories for high-speed Internet access.
"The consumer expects to come in here and find a state-of-the-art environment," said Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity College in Washington. Her school spends heavily to update computer equipment every three years or so, and has struggled to limit tuition increases to 3 percent. But others contend that colleges, by consistently raising prices, are responding to the laws of supply and the seemingly inexhaustible demand for access to higher education.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, noted that health care costs and transportation had risen less than tuition, while other expenses, such as communication, actually shrank over the last year.
In the 1970's, a college degree meant earning a third more than high school graduates. Now that premium is 80 percent. "That allowed colleges through the 1980's and '90's to charge ever higher tuitions and still fill all the desks in their classrooms," Mr. Burtless said.
Despite outlays for technology, he said other indicators suggested a decline in the quality of higher education: over time, fewer undergraduate classes are being taught by senior faculty.
In the last decade, the median family income has risen 8 percent, to $49,012 from $45,552, after adjusting for inflation. In the same period, the cost of attending a four-year public college has gone up about 28 percent, to $8,086 a year from $6,302. A four-year education at a private college has increased 27 percent, to $21,339 a year from $16,823.
Over that period, financial aid has gone up as well, mostly in the form of loans. Twenty years ago, loans covered 41 percent of a college education. Today, they typically pay for 59 percent. The average student now graduates nearly $18,000 in debt, and over the last decade, the share of all aid set aside for merit scholarships has doubled.
"The institutions, particularly the selective private ones, are engaged in a rat race of competitive spending to attract the best students," said Ron Ehrenberg, director of Cornell University's Higher Education Research Institute. Despite the recent high-flying returns on endowments at some universities, most do not enjoy such vast financial cushions, he said.
"State support for public institutions has not kept up with inflation, even over long periods of time," he said.
Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said he still considered higher education, particularly at state universities, a bargain for the middle class and a gateway for social mobility. But he noted that poorer students at the University of Texas struggled under the expense.
"Even though the prices of fancy private schools are skyrocketing, the queues are getting longer and longer," Mr. Hamermesh said. "The question is how do you ration a scarce commodity, which is space at universities."

HEADLINE: Continental Airlines Profit Is Up Despite Higher Oil Costs

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Cashing in on a seemingly insatiable demand for business travel, Continental Airlines said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 32 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.
Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, was the first large carrier to report earnings for the quarter. But some analysts warned that profits for the industry over all would not be as strong as in the last quarter because of the rise in oil prices. 
 Continental said that it earned $137 million, or $2.24 a diluted share, excluding a $2 million charge, compared with $104 million, or $1.44 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $2.62 billion from $2.26 billion. Analysts had expected Continental to earn $2.19 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Continental executives estimated that the airline got a boost of about $20 million, or 20 cents a share, from this summer's disruption at United Airlines, whose on-time performance plunged and cancellations soared because of bad weather and protests by its pilots. United announced last month that it would lose money in the third and fourth quarters.
Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman, said that most of the gains came from the demand for seats by high-paying business travelers, which did not flag in the quarter despite five fare increases so far this year. Continental's load factor, or the percentage of its seats that were filled, rose to a record 77.5 percent, while the average fare the company received rose 8.8 percent.
"Maybe we are not charging enough," Mr. Bethune said after being asked whether he saw any weakness in the demand for seats.
But Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York, said, "Continental's solid profit growth in the quarter is not representative of industry results for the period." He estimated that overall airline profits fell 11 percent to 12 percent in the quarter compared with results in the quarter a year earlier.
Continental not only benefited from turmoil at United, it also successfully hedged itself against the rise in oil prices. American Airlines, which is the second-largest carrier after United and its chief rival, is also expected to beat earnings estimates for the quarter. Southwest Airlines, the low-fare king, is also expected to exceed forecasts because of its strong hedging strategy and cost controls.
Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said he had raised his revenue estimates for many airlines over the summer because the strong economy was fueling demand for business travel. But at the same time, he was raising his cost estimates as oil prices rose.
"The question for airline analysts is which will come down more quickly, fuel or the economy?" he said. "Three months ago, I would have said fuel will come down quicker. Today, I am not so sure."
Because business travelers pay the highest fares but also book their tickets at the last minute, it is difficult to forecast airline earnings. A softening economy could quickly translate into a decline in corporate travel.
"As profit growth slows, intuitively one would expect corporations to exert stronger cost controls than they have in recent years," Mr. Buttrick said. "Travel often makes the short list of discretionary items to be curtailed."
Though he does not yet see any evidence of such cutbacks, Mr. Buttrick thinks that most earnings estimates for the fourth quarter are too high.
A new tentative contract reached by United with its pilots also promises to add to rising cost pressures in the industry. Delta Air Lines' 10,000 pilots announced on Friday that they were seeking salary increases that would surpass the generous increases at United.
Such concerns have driven down the price of airline stocks to levels that frustrate many executives who feel that they are not getting credit from investors for maintaining profits.
Shares of Continental rose 19 cents yesterday, to $42.69. Shares of UAL, the parent of United, fell 50 cents, to $37.88 AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 50 cents, to $30.38.
"Five years ago, I would have never believed that Continental would have a record quarter with oil at $35 a barrel," Mr. Engel said. "The next test is an economic downturn. Until they get through that, people are going to always look for another reason why airline earnings can't stay high."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Team Encourages Gore to Be Himself in the Final Debate

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: INNSBROOK, Mo., Oct. 16

 BODY:
After being criticized as too pushy in the first debate and too subdued in the next, Vice President Al Gore turned to average citizens again today to help him prepare for his third and final encounter with Gov. George W. Bush.
Their message to him was pretty simple: be yourself. 
 Secluded at a sprawling wooded resort 50 miles west of St. Louis, Mr. Gore brought together 10 of the average citizens who helped prepare him on his first two debates and 13 other citizens from Missouri as he sought to repeat the best of his earlier performances and eliminate the worst.
The final debate, at 9 p.m. on Tuesday -- the candidates' last sure-fire way of reaching millions of voters in what may be the closest election in four decades -- will be in the style of a town meeting, in which citizens selected by the Gallup organization will ask the questions. A third of the participants are undecided; a third favor Mr. Gore and a third prefer Mr. Bush.
The vice president also had on hand his paid consultants, including Carter Eskew and Bob Shrum, two of his daughters, Karenna Gore Schiff and Sarah Gore, as well as policy experts like Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser in the vice president's office, and Robert O. Boorstin, a former official in the Clinton White House with an expertise in mental health policy.
William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said the vice president's goal was to combine "the intensity of the first debate with the genuineness of the second." Mr. Daley also said that the vice president "seems much more determined in the last 36 hours" than he had been before the previous debates.
Gore advisers said that he would return to themes he emphasized in the first debate, including the role of the Clinton administration in the current economic expansion.
"His best line in Boston," one adviser said, "came when he made the point that there were a lot of innovative entrepreneurs in America in the 1980's, too, but without the right policies they couldn't get the economy started. He wants to hit that again."
Mr. Daley also said that Mr. Bush's Texas record was fair game. And the vice president can be expected, as he did in the second debate, to play down his views on gun control. Mr. Daley said that the National Rifle Association had effectively spent millions of dollars on television commercials scaring sportsmen and hunters into believing that Mr. Gore wanted to take away their guns.
"He has to reiterate that he's in favor of sportsmen having guns because the N.R.A. is saying in Pennsylvania and Michigan that he wants to take your guns away," Mr. Daley said. "He's got to reassure people that this isn't true."
But there seemed to be general agreement -- among the ordinary people, the professional consultants and independent analysts -- that Mr. Gore's chief challenge was to unify and stabilize the shifting personalities he has displayed throughout the campaign and particularly during the first two debates.
"He needs to be himself and be explicit about his beliefs," said Claudia Amboyer, a sixth-grade teacher in Macomb, Mich., and one of the original group of citizen-advisers. Dr. Miller William Boyd, a psychologist from St. Louis, who is among the new group, said, "Be yourself, no matter what people tell you," adding: "He should appear not to be so conciliatory because he looks like he's trying to appease everyone and he doesn't have to do that."
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster in Washington, said that Mr. Gore needed to be the candidate he was at the Democratic National Convention. "For Al Gore, what it comes down to is going back and finding the inner voice he had at the convention," he said.
"Voters have seen too many Al Gores in the last two debates," he added. "He's got to be the person he's going to be in the next four years." Leaving aside the question of whether Mr. Gore knew who he was, Mr. Hart said of the differing personas he had presented in the debates: "The voter gets confused."
Mr. Hart added: "When everything is said and done about George W. Bush, he may be wearing the dunce's hat but the voter senses that he's comfortable with himself and they perceive him to be engaging and likable and straightforward and honest, and those aren't inconsiderable traits."
Mr. Gore found his first session this morning with the real people so valuable that instead of rehearse in the afternoon with his political advisers, he held a second session with the unpaid advisers.
At the opening of the first, which reporters were allowed to attend for just a few minutes, Mr. Gore said that if he is elected president, "I will have regular open meetings all across the country with citizens from all walks of life to help shape the agenda of the Gore-Lieberman administration."
The original group of citizen-advisers were voters whom Mr. Gore met along the campaign trail. The campaign brought them to Sarasota, Fla., for three days while he prepared for the first debate, then talked with him by conference call before the second debate in North Carolina.
Unusually for a presidential candidate just three weeks before an election, Mr. Gore is spending three full days out of the public eye, with no campaign events Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Some of this is in deference to the Middle East crisis, which is dominating the news. And Mr. Gore does not plan to travel Wednesday until after the memorial service for the American sailors killed in Yemen is conducted.
But it also gives him a chance to focus intently on how to repair the damage he seems to have done to himself in the first two debates. One senior adviser said the consensus within the Gore circle was that Mr. Gore did more harm when he muzzled himself in the second debate, than when he forcefully argued with Mr. Bush in the first.
Mr. Daley said that because the election appeared so close, he did not expect anything dramatic from either candidate. "I think both of these candidates are going to be cautious about doing something really bold or out of the box that blows up in their face," he said.
Still, Mr. Daley said, "I don't think you play it safe. I think you try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling reasons for the election to go in your way."
Mr. Hart agreed that seeking the advice of ordinary people seemed to be a useful strategy. "The debate strategy is to get rid of all the strategists and all the people who teach you how to think tactically and just stop and decide how you connect with the American people," he said. "You've spent a lifetime thinking about running for president of the United States. This is your last chance to connect. Feel comfortable to reach inside yourself and say, 'You know, I can answer that question and not parse it 14 different ways.' "
When the debate is over, just three weeks will remain until Election Day. "It's coming to a close," Mr. Daley mused. "So I think both campaigns would have a lot of urgency and a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety going on right now because this is getting onto the final in a race that, according to the vast majority of polls, private and public, is a horse race."

HEADLINE: Lazio and Mrs. Clinton Trade Charges Upstate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS and ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton battled for votes in upstate New York today, with Mr. Lazio charging that Mrs. Clinton would bring a return of Mario M. Cuomo's economic policies, and Mrs. Clinton asserting that her opponent had "turned his back completely on upstate New York" by failing to offer a plan to stimulate its economy.
With Gov. George E. Pataki at his side, Mr. Lazio invoked the memory of Mr. Cuomo, the former Democratic governor, in the calculation that the animosity that contributed to Mr. Cuomo's defeat, particularly in this part of New York, remains fresh six years later. 
 Mr. Pataki repeatedly likened Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Cuomo, suggesting that Mr. Lazio would enjoy the the same kind of victory he did over a well-known Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
"It's 1994 all over again," Mr. Pataki said. "When you look at Mrs. Clinton, when you think of her policies, it is Mario Cuomo redux."
Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton's proposal for targeted tax cuts was a reprise of economic policies pushed by Mr. Cuomo that, Mr. Lazio said, had undercut the region's economy.
"We are not going back to the old ways, the old Cuomo ways," Mr. Lazio said. "Targeted tax relief for him was another way of trying to mask the fact that he was for tax increases. We don't want to go back on that path. We want to march forward."
Hours later, Mrs. Clinton visited a steel plant here and then offered one of her toughest attacks on her Republican opponent to date, asserting that he had failed to offer a plan to help this part of the state.
"I really don't know what he sees when he comes upstate, or who he talks to, or what he knows about the economy here, because he has turned his back completely on western New York and the rest of upstate New York," she said. "And instead, my opponent is trying very hard to run a campaign of insults and attacks against me."
"My opponent wants to talk about me, but I'm going to talk about you," Mrs. Clinton told a cheering crowd at a rally for Hispanic supporters at a gymnasium in the Father Belle Community Center.
The exchange today marked a notable escalation in the campaign, and it reflected the calculation on both sides that competing news events -- in particular, the prospect of a Subway Series and unrest in the Middle East -- may overshadow the final days of this race. Although a number of polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with a slight lead over Mr. Lazio, her aides believe the contest remains volatile.
Accordingly, her aides said, she will give a speech in New York on Tuesday on foreign policy, a topic chosen largely because her aides think the sight of the first lady giving a speech on international affairs could serve to stir doubts among some voters about whether Mr. Lazio has the experience and stature to be a member of the Senate.
The subject and venue of today's events reflected the unusual extent to which this part of New York seems to be in play. That is not good news for Mr. Lazio, considering that this is historically a solidly Republican part of the state. But Mrs. Clinton has put in an unusual amount of time here, for a Democrat, and Mr. Lazio came under criticism from even some upstate Republicans for suggesting at the candidates' first debate that the economy had turned a corner.
Ideally, Mr. Lazio should be a able to spend these last few weeks of the race in places that are considered more up for grabs -- like the suburbs. Today was his eighth day in a row of campaigning upstate. Mrs. Clinton is returning upstate Tuesday and again on Wednesday.
Mrs. Clinton released a new advertisement tonight that she distributed only to television stations in upstate. "Hillary has a serious plan to create 200,000 new jobs upstate," the ad said. The announcer, citing remarks Mr. Lazio made here today, said that Mr. Lazio "thinks upstate doesn't need targeted economic help."
For his part, Mr. Lazio attached himself firmly to Mr. Pataki, a popular figure upstate who has, until now, played a relatively low-key role in Mr. Lazio's campaign. In the process, he seemed to be adopting some of the folklore of Mr. Pataki's campaign of 1994, in which the little-known state senator from Peekskill came from behind to defeat Mr. Cuomo.
Several of Mr. Lazio's supporters have drawn implicit comparisons in recent weeks to that campaign, arguing that Mrs. Clinton will prove as disliked today as Mr. Cuomo was then, and that Mr. Lazio will be the same kind of deceptively strong candidate that Mr. Pataki was.
The comparisons seemed quite explicit today, and it was often Mr. Pataki who sounded as if he were back on the campaign trail. "Well, Mrs. Clinton, just as I said to Mario Cuomo, you can't do it but I can when it comes to cutting taxes in 1994," Mr. Pataki said. "You can't do across-the-board tax cuts; Rick Lazio can and will when he's the U.S. senator."
Mr. Pataki continued: "If any of you doubt the differences between Rick Lazio and Mrs. Clinton and similarities between Mrs. Clinton and Mario Cuomo, it comes to government spending. The era of big government could be back. The era of Cuomonomics would be back. The era of tax cuts and job creation would be over."
At her own news conference, Mrs. Clinton did not offer a defense of Mr. Cuomo to the attacks on the former governor, a reflection of her own campaign's concern about Mr. Cuomo's popularity here. "That's laughable and desperate," she said. "They don't want to talk about the issues. My opponent doesn't want to tell us what he would do in the Senate.
"I've come forth with specific ideas about what I would do in the Senate. My opponent has ignored upstate New York. He has refused to come forward with specific plans."
In fact, Mr. Lazio has proposed a larger, and more general tax cut, that includes the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty and making the payroll tax deductible from the income tax. Mr. Lazio argued that his plan would lead to increased prosperity in the state, and thus provide a lift for upstate New York. He has given a speech laying out his tax cut plan and another talking about proposals to improve education.
In his comments to the crowd here, Mr. Lazio repeated many of the themes he has discussed throughout his campaign, namely about the need to offer an across-the-board tax cut.
As is often the case in Mr. Lazio's campaign events, as much emphasis was placed on Mrs. Clinton than on Mr. Lazio's proposals, with each speaker at the rally assailing the Democratic nominee. While some, like Mr. Pataki and Mr. Lazio, criticized her directly, not all would utter the first lady's name. One was Joel Giambra, the Erie County executive, a Republican, who offered a sharp critique of the economic policies of "the president, and that woman."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE SWING STATES;
Oregon and Washington in Anyone's Guess Column

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Having awarded their electoral votes to Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and to Bill Clinton in the next two presidential elections, Washington and Oregon would seem to be immensely hospitable terrain for a Democratic aspirant to the White House -- perhaps so much so that neither major party candidate would worry much about bothering with campaigning here.
But not this year. 
 For several reasons, the contests here between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are being fiercely fought and are ranked as tossups right now. To some degree, of course, the closeness of the race in the Pacific Northwest reflects the same dynamics at play in much of the rest of the nation. But other factors are more specific to the region, such as the relatively high popularity here of Ralph Nader and perhaps even the resentment widely felt in the Seattle area over the Clinton administration's antitrust case against Microsoft.
In any event, "both of these states are close, desperately close," says Tim Hibbitts, an independent pollster in Portland. "That's the only way I can describe it."
Aside from several recent polls that suggest how tight the race is, there is another sign of how competitive the two major-party candidates consider it to be -- evidence that can perhaps be found principally on television screens here.
In Seattle, more television advertisements have been run for the candidates than in any other metropolitan market in the nation, except for Philadelphia -- a total of 5,921 (3,037 for the Gore campaign, 2,884 for the Bush campaign) from June 1 through Oct. 8, according to a tracking survey conducted by the Brennan Center at the New York University School of Law. The survey ranks the Portland metropolitan area No. 7.
For Mr. Gore, who has made 16 visits here since 1997, the targeting of so many resources in two states worth a combined 18 electoral votes, and once considered relatively safe, is clearly not a good sign.
"It's not that there is any great shift of political ideology going on this year" in the region, said Robert E. Gogerty, a political strategist in Seattle who generally works for Democrats. "It's that Gore has just not bonded with people in the Northwest, at least not yet. And if he can't do it here, he's going to have trouble in a lot of places."
Were Mr. Nader not in the race, it is possible that the Gore-Lieberman campaign might, if not take the Northwest for granted, at least not have to worry so much about it. But Mr. Gore seems to be suffering from political leanings among many here that are so solidly on the left that discontent with him runs very strong in some places.
Some polls suggest that Mr. Nader may pull a higher vote in Oregon than in any other state -- as much as 8 percent. And the Seattle area, famously the site of last year's anti-globalization protests at the World Trade Organization meeting, may contribute to almost as strong a showing in Washington state.
Whether such numbers will bear up on Election Day is, of course, a different matter. Mr. Hibbitts, the Portland pollster, calculated that about half of the pro-Nader vote is "not accessible to either major party -- whom these voters view as two peas in a very corrupt pod." Such people, if they vote Nov. 7, will be "rock-solid for Ralph Nader. They will not switch their vote."
The other half, he added, might well decide in the end that the race between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore is so close that they want to have an impact on it. But even here, Mr. Hibbitts added, those voters will not necessarily vote uniformly for Mr. Gore, though he should claim the lion's share. In interviews, some pro-Nader voters have suggested that they would prefer Mr. Bush to Mr. Gore because they believe a Bush presidency is more likely to inspire the kind of anger and opposition that truly ignite what they describe as a progressive, third-party movement for future years.
And of course, Mr. Nader may well keep many of those voters or even add to their totals by Election Day, especially if they remain disenchanted with Mr. Gore. Thousands have paid for tickets to cheer on Mr. Nader at boisterous rallies in both Seattle and Portland in recent weeks.
Other factors include the bitter contentiousness over proposals to help endangered salmon by removing dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington. Such an approach is favored by many environmentalists, but is anathema to many of the people in the region. They fear it will hurt the agricultural economy, curtail recreational use of the river and drive up the cost of electricity.
Mr. Bush has taken a stand opposing plans to breach the dams.
"People have been able to make a living off rivers and at the same time coexist with nature," he said at a rally in Spokane last month at which he vowed: "If George W. Bush becomes president, the dams will not be breached."
And, he added, to more applause, as if he were addressing Mr. Gore directly: "These dams are important to a way of life, Mr. Vice President."
Such a stance, at a minimum, has strengthened Mr. Bush's support in a conservative region that would be likely to side with him regardless and that Mr. Gore has visited just once in recent years. It may even bring out some voters who otherwise might not make it to the polls, analysts say.
But on the western side of the Cascades, where far more people live and which should be much friendlier territory to the vice president, Mr. Gore's decision to straddle the issue has had a much murkier fallout. Earlier this year he endorsed the administration's plan to put off any such decision for at least several years while other methods of helping the fish were tried and more scientific studies conducted.
In doing so, he angered some conservation groups who argue that breaching is by far the best and perhaps the only way to save the salmon, and some people who care about the issue may gravitate toward Mr. Nader.
In many ways, the debate crystallizes the region's tensions between economic development and "livability" concerns such as sprawl and stronger environmental protection. But as energy costs have mounted and the specter of electricity shortages looms, the idea of doing away with dams supplying about 4 percent of the region's electric power has become more controversial, and Mr. Gore is trying hard not to alienate anyone on the matter. Still, some voters here may simply be irritated at their perception that he is waffling.
He even faces the wrath of a group called "Environmentalists Against Gore," though most mainstream environmentalist groups now support him.
"The dams are one of those issues that kind of adds to a cumulative level of frustration with Gore, and continues to cause people to look at Nader," said Bill Arthur, the Northwest/Alaska regional director of the Sierra Club. "On the other hand, as an organization, we certainly have endorsed Gore. Our members recognize there's a Grand Canyon's worth of difference between Gore and Bush on the environment."
And then there is the Microsoft case. Many people who work in the high-tech industry region in the Seattle area classify themselves as politically liberal. But lingering anger over the Microsoft case seems to have blunted some of the potential enthusiasm for Mr. Gore. (Microsoft itself and its employees have given more to Mr. Bush and the Republican National Committee than to Mr. Gore and the Democratic committee, finance records show.)
Several pollsters said some voters here are perturbed over the case, though, of course, some who work for Microsoft's competitors are delighted to see the company taken down a peg. Whether this will be enough to sway votes is a hard question.
"There is a 'Microsoft factor,' but I can't quantify it for you," said Mr. Hibbitts. "But you know what? If one of every 200 votes is being impacted by that, that's a potential switch of half a percentage point. And the way this election is going, that could make the difference. That's the level we're at right now."

HEADLINE: Seamen Recall a Day When Quiet Turned to Chaos

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, Va., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Everything in the harbor at Aden looked normal to Andrew A. Nemeth as he stood on the deck of the destroyer Cole last Thursday, chatting in the morning sun with a buddy who was helping refuel the ship.
"We had our typical security, armed watches up on the quarter-deck and everything," he said today at the Naval Medical Center here. In fact, he said, the crew members were more apprehensive about their crossing through the Suez Canal than about what had begun as a routine refueling at Aden, Yemen, before entering the Persian Gulf on patrol. 
 Seaman Apprentice Nemeth, 19, in the Navy for 16 months and on board the Cole for 10, went to the engine room, where he worked, and took a quick tour, looking for leaks and sweeping up debris. Then he went to the chow line a little early, just before lunch began at 11:15 a.m.
"I went to grab my tray and get my food, and the blast happened," Seaman Nemeth said. "I didn't hear really anything. I remember just being up in the air, falling to the ground and having fuel spray all over me.
"My first instinct was to look around for any of my friends I could find, which I didn't see, because it was real smoky and everything," he said, fingering the plastic hospital ID bracelet on his left wrist, as his parents and grandmother looked on tearfully.
Seaman Nemeth wore a crisp new Navy T-shirt and blue sweat pants, given to him by the U.S.O. at a hospital in Germany; the clothes he wore at the time of the attack were seized as evidence, he said.
The seaman, from Amherst, Ohio, had volunteered to speak to reporters today just after he was discharged from the hospital. He made the rounds of a conference room, over and over telling the story of the explosion that injured 39 crew members and left 17 dead or missing.
Seaman Nemeth said his first thought that day was that a fuel line had exploded. He heard that the explosion was being described as a terrorist bombing only when he was in a hospital in Aden, where the doctors stitched up his right cheek.
He said he had made it out of the dark, smoke-filled mess hall only because he had been trained to find his way out of the ship blindfolded. "It came in perfect," he said.
He groped his way to the medical area, but it had been evacuated, so he continued toward the deck and was found by another crewman. He said he did not realize he was injured until he looked down and saw blood streaming from his face, which today was still taped in an octopus pattern over a row of stitches and small cuts.
When Seaman Nemeth was found, the crew was going about its job of closing doors to stop the flooding, putting out fires and looking for the injured, he said.
Ship schedulers allow 10 hours for refueling, he said, but the crew expected that this one would be completed in 2 hours. Seaman Nemeth echoed suspicions voiced by more senior Navy personnel that the attackers must have had intelligence about the layout and schedule of the Cole, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer -- or have been incredibly lucky.
"They hit us perfectly, at lunch time, right in the middle of the galley, near the chiefs' mess," Seaman Nemeth said in an interview with ABC News.
Seaman Nemeth made a circuit of four network interviews in different corners of the hospital conference room, each set up to look like a different location, as print reporters strained to hear. The interviews appeared to drain him; when they were over, he left quickly with his family.
Asked by one interviewer whether officers had warned the crew about security risks in the Middle East, he said, "They didn't have to really tell us; we knew from experience," which he said had come mostly from watching television reports.
The crew was accustomed to the idea that it might face combat but not that it would be "snuck-up on," he said. He called the two suspected suicide bombers cowardly.
"I'm just angry for the way they did it, that we had no idea," he said. Seaman Nemeth said he was determined to go back to his ship. That, he said, would deny victory to the attackers.
Another sailor aboard the Cole, Kesha Stidham, had evidently been a few steps ahead of Seaman Nemeth in line for lunch and had just finished eating some fajitas and left the mess hall when the blast hit.
In a brief telephone interview today, Seaman Stidham said that she, too, had heard nothing at the time of the explosion. Seaman Stidman, whose face was cut and bruised in the explosion, said it was lucky that it did not happen later in the lunch period, when more sailors would have been eating not far from where the bomb went off.
Capt. Martin Snyder, the senior attending physician at the hospital here, said that of the six more seriously injured crew members still in Germany, four would arrive here on Tuesday, all with broken bones and one with "pulmonary complications."
Navy officials said 20 of the 33 sailors who arrived here by Air Force transport plane on Sunday evening would be discharged by tonight. Some might go home, but many, like Seaman Nemeth, plan to stay for a service on Wednesday at the Norfolk naval station, at which President Clinton is expected to speak in memory of the dead. The naval station is the home port of the Cole, which left on Aug. 8.
In addition to the injured and their families, John and Lorina Clodfelter, of Mechanicsville, Va., also spent the day at the hospital in the section given over to the Cole crew. Their son Kenneth, a hull technician, has not been found; the Pentagon has now listed those still missing as among the dead.
But the Clodfelters say they have not given up hope. They have another son, a daughter and a son-in-law in the military, and they spent today with the other families "because it helps us to get through it," said Mr. Clodfelter, who works in the state unemployment office.
Kenneth, 21, known as "Cooter" after a character on the "Dukes of Hazzard" television program, could still be trapped in one of the parts of the destroyer sealed off to limit flooding, Mr. Clodfelter said.
"I'm not kissing my son off, just like you wouldn't kiss off one of your children," Mr. Clodfelter said, "until the Navy tells me, this is his situation, his condition."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Campaigns Set a Brisk, Focused TV Pace

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
On television in Tampa, the Democrats are starting to aim poison-tipped arrows at Gov. George W. Bush. "Two million more pounds of toxic chemicals dumped into Texas waterways," the commercial's voice-over intones, adding, "Now imagine Bush's Texas record in Florida's Everglades."
On stations in Columbus, Ohio, meanwhile, Republicans are warning that Vice President Al Gore is a profligate caretaker of America's budget surpluses. "Al Gore plans to spend it all and more," the announcer declares. "Gore's big-government spending plan threatens American prosperity." 
 It is axiomatic in political life that a close campaign in the fall leads to a mean season on the screen. And while the presidential race remains, in a marketing sense, one of the more polite in memory, the tone of new advertising in the last week has been noticeably more confrontational, on issues if not personalties, as strategists home in on states they believe are up for grabs -- or at least want the other side to think they consider winnable.
The cash outlays, too, are intensifying. In just the last week of September and the first week of October, the campaigns, the parties and outside groups spent a total of $18.5 million on television, evenly split between the parties. The bulk of it, $14.5 million, was spent in six highly contested states: Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest figures available, a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.
Expanding beyond the 17 states that have been the focus of the media campaign for months, Republicans are now also spending television money in California, Minnesota and West Virginia, states that have been thought of as long shots for Mr. Bush.
The Democratic Party, with much smaller cash reserves, is less concerned with expansion than with refining its strategy, fashioning television and radio attack advertisements for specific states and specific issues: the Everglades piece in Florida, for example; a pollution spot directed at voters in Washington State; an advertisement about the minimum wage in West Virginia; and a radio spot about children in Iowa asserting that "George Bush's priorities are wrong for Iowa's kids."
Overall, said Ken Goldstein, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, who studies political advertising, the latest data suggest that the campaigns are concentrating more on some states in the Northwest and upper Midwest that have gone to the Democrats in recent presidential elections. At this late stage, analysts say, candidates certainly do not want to have to devote resources in their customary strongholds.
"The movement seems to be into states Gore needs to win," Mr. Goldstein said. "In Mr. Gore's favor, he still hasn't had to spend money in California and he's competitive in Florida. But he's spending money in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Iowa, which should all be pretty safe for him if he's going to win this."
In recent weeks, Mr. Gore has been outspending Mr. Bush in Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Mr. Bush has poured new millions into Florida.
The Bush and Gore advertising campaigns, waged in tandem with their national party organizations, have been so tactically selective that they are in essence regional rather than national efforts. In his most recent analysis of the data compiled by Campaign Media Analysis Group, a company that tracks advertising spending, Mr. Goldstein found that virtually no presidential spots have run in 32 of the top 75 media markets.
Other markets are being inundated: Philadelphia is now the No. 1 city in the nation for political commercials, Mr. Goldstein said; since June 1, presidential spots have run on the airwaves there 6,078 times. The other markets in the top 10 are Seattle; Cleveland; Detroit; Albuquerque; St. Louis; Portland, Ore.; Kansas City, Mo.; Green Bay, Wis.; and Grand Rapids, Mich.
By contrast, Mr. Goldstein said, the nation's largest media market, New York, has had no more than five or six advertisements.
The careful carving out of battleground markets has led to the television equivalent of hand-to-hand combat. In Tampa, for example, the Everglades spot by the Democrats forced the Republicans to quickly put a response on the local airwaves.
"We upped our buy in the Tampa media, to re-air a spot concerning Gore's record on the environment," explained Terry Holt, a spokesman for Victory 2000, the campaign arm of the Republican National Committee. The spot, unveiled in August, depicts an aerial photograph of land owned by Mr. Gore in Tennessee and includes the claim that Mr. Gore "has allowed mining companies to mine zinc from his property."
Both sides are, for the moment,steering clear of the kinds of video disparagements of personality that voters profess to abhor. Patterned after the Republican assaults on the governorships of Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 campaign and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Democrats are hitting hard on Mr. Bush's Texas record.
"After 17 years in the oil business, George W. Bush ran for governor," says a new Democratic commercial running in Missouri, Washington, Oregon and Michigan, "then passed laws to let big polluters regulate themselves."
In a television spot directed at Iowa voters, an announcer warns of dire consequences for Iowa's schoolchildren: "Under Bush, Texas SAT scores have fallen to 47th, while Iowa ranks second. Iowa doesn't need a Texas plan for our schools."
In earlier spots, the Republicans took swipes at Mr. Gore's reputation for exaggerating his accomplishments. Now they have shifted to a critical analysis of the candidates' budget plans. "Al Gore's plan: three times the new spending President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire surplus and creates a deficit again," says a new advertisement running in the battleground states.
And in a ubiquitous new commercial by the Bush campaign, Mr. Bush stares squarely into the camera and observes: "I believe in government that is responsible to the people. That's the difference in philosophy between my opponent and me. He trusts government. I trust you."
Mr. Holt said: "Our advertising at this stage is fairly straightforward in states where we've had ads up for some time. We've moved from health care and education to economic plans and whose is better."
The Brennan Center study showed that as of Oct. 8, the Bush campaign and the Republican Party had spent $47 million on television in the general election, while the Gore campaign and the Democratic Party had spent $42 million.
However, some $5 million that has been spent on behalf of Mr. Gore by outside groups like the Sierra Club, Handgun Control and Planned Parenthood has brought the two sides to temporary parity. In fact, the study found in the two weeks that ended on Oct. 8, Planned Parenthood's expenditure of $1.46 million actually exceeded the amount paid out for commercials by the Democratic National Committee. Groups allied with the Republicans, like the National Rife Association, have only just begun advertising.
The presidential candidates, their parties and surrogates are expected to spend $160 million, but could lay out as much as $200 million for commercials by Election Day. Still, the Republicans have a vast financial advantage in the final weeks. Fund-raising reports showed that as of the end of September the Republicans had $45 million in cash, while the Democrats had $26 million, much of that unrestricted donations from corporations and wealthy individuals. (By law, the parties can pay a only a part of their advertising costs with that so-called soft money.)
Up to now the Democratic National Committee has been slightly outspending its Republican counterpart, Mr. Goldstein said. But that is about to change.
"With $20 million to $25 million to put on television in the last month of the campaign, and $40 million to $50 million committed already, we feel we're in a pretty good position," Mr. Holt said. He added that despite Mr. Gore's lead in California, the party had decided to make an investment in the nation's most expensive media state. "We added $1 million per week to our campaign there on Tuesday, with 90 percent of that money going into the Los Angeles TV market, where 40 percent of the voters reside," Mr. Holt said.
Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, replied, "That's great. I would hope they would spend more money in California. Some of that is just literally psychological warfare."
Mr. Andrew asserted that the strategy of challenging Mr. Bush's Texas record in a handful of states was not a function of limited resources, but the long-planned final phase of an effort to "make the issue landscape our home turf."
On both sides, issues do turn out to be what the advertising campaigns this year are about. William Benoit, a professor of communication at the University of Missouri-Columbia, who studies the negative and positive messages in political commercials, said that there has been a decline in attacks this year in the presidential spots and an increased emphasis on differences in policy rather than in character.
"The 2000 campaign so far is more positive than 1996 was," said Mr. Benoit, who analyzed the statements in 61 commercials that have run through Saturday. He found that while the number of statements in the spots attacking the opposing side have been rising in recent weeks, the level of vitriol remains relatively mild. About 29 percent of the statements in Mr. Gore's spots and 17 percent in Mr. Bush's could be interpreted as attacks, Mr. Benoit said.
While attacks have been more plentiful in candidate spots by the Democratic and Republican Parties, Mr. Benoit said they have overwhelmingly concentrated on the opponents' stands on the issues, an area that polls show most voters view as fair game.
"These ads strike me as more comparative, and actually based on the record and not based on personalities," said Lynn Vavreck, a Dartmouth College political scientist who analyzes campaign advertising. "This is not a Willie Horton year, although with the election so tight, the conditions are certainly ripe for Willie Horton to make a comeback."

HEADLINE: A River Town Makes Amends;
After 175 Years, Schenectady Honors All Erie Canal Wrought

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y., Oct. 16

 BODY:
When the Erie Canal opened in 1825, it was a triumph of human invention heralded from Buffalo to New York City. Cannons saluted passing boats. Fireworks and bonfires lighted the sky. And drinking, dancing and merrymaking overflowed its banks.
But in this trading city along the Mohawk River, there were no cannon salutes or fireworks. Schenectady officials feared the canal would allow barges to float by their city and take away their prosperous riverfront business, so it was left to the students from Union College to fire off their muskets in welcome. 
 Now, 175 years later, Union College is again making sure the Erie Canal is not forgotten with an ambitious retrospective of survey and engineering drawings, paintings, models and pottery at its campus in downtown Schenectady through Oct. 29. The college is also sponsoring a series of nine lectures, symposiums and concerts for the community, as well as trolley tours of local canal sites. And a banquet for state and local officials on Oct. 26 will showcase canal boats carved out of maple sugar and aqueducts made from New York cheddar cheese.
"Some might think we're overdoing it," said Roger H. Hull, the president of Union College, as he greeted 120 students and local residents who gathered here last Tuesday to hear folklore and music about the Erie Canal. "In fact, we're simply making up for Schenectady's fatal mistake in 1825."
It is difficult to overstate the importance of the man-made waterway that once linked Lake Erie to the Hudson River through 360 miles of bridges, aqueducts and locks that raised and lowered boats to adjust for changing elevations. Just 4 feet deep and 40 feet wide, it took eight years to build and was derided as a "ditch" by its opponents.
But when it was finished, the Erie Canal ushered in an era of trade and travel that transformed western New York. DeWitt Clinton, then the governor, personally made the inaugural trip on the canal with a barrel of Lake Erie water that he carried down the Hudson and poured into the Atlantic Ocean.
Schenectady officials need not have worried, though, since the bustling canal traffic filled their warehouses with goods and brought more visitors to their banks. Local families made their living on the canal, steering tugboats and operating the locks in a tradition that was handed down from father to son. And the city thrived as a major transportation hub into the next century.
Although the Erie Canal was later enlarged to accommodate more barges, it was replaced in 1918 by a modern canal system that followed parts of its old route. That system, the New York State Barge Canal, is still in use.
Today, Union College's celebration of the Erie Canal is belatedly drawing together residents and officials alike in this fading industrial city of 65,000 northwest of Albany. Mayor Al Jurczynski of Schenectady, for one, hopes to make amends for the earlier slight. "I don't think history is destined to repeat itself as far as city fathers are concerned, at least not this city father, anyway," he said.
And how did he explain Schenectady's long-ago mistake? The mayor was at a loss.
"My grandparents came over here 90 years ago from Poland," he said. "I wasn't even part of the Schenectady scene then, not even in spirit. But I'm here now, I love Schenectady, and I'll try to correct the error of our ways."
Unlike the city, Union College can proudly claim a long association with the Erie Canal. The private college, which has an enrollment of 2,042 students, was founded in 1795 by a group of Schenectady citizens. An 1830 graduate, Squire Whipple, designed many of the canal's bridges while still a student, and a Union professor, Jonathan Pearson, kept a diary of his trip on the canal in 1833 that is now part of the exhibit.
After Union started its engineering program in 1845, at least 30 more alumni oversaw or worked on the enlargement of the canal.
But it is a legacy that some of its students know little about. In half a dozen interviews around campus last week, students had to struggle to remember the Erie Canal, let alone its importance to Union. "Didn't it go from Albany to another place, a city maybe?" asked Charles Tuthill, 20, who is majoring in French and political science. "I don't know where."
The Erie Canal exhibit, which opened on Sept. 4, fills two floors of the Nott Memorial, an ornate 16-sided atrium in the center of campus, and overflows into a gallery at the nearby Schenectady Museum. It took $40,000 and nearly 18 months for Union faculty and staff to assemble. No fewer than 125 artifacts are on loan from the college's permanent collection and a dozen cultural and historical institutions across the state.
The most valuable artifacts are 30 hand-drawn survey maps and engineering plans that have rarely, if ever, been seen outside the New York State Archives. Just to borrow them, the college had to order custom-made display cases that would shield the parchment from humidity and light.
Four Union professors and a dozen students labored over those engineering plans for 1,500 hours to recreate scaled-down versions of a lock, aqueduct and two bridges that are also on display. They had to redraw the plans on a computer and figure out how to cut the parts and fit them together.
Jeane Whittington, 20, a civil engineering major, said she learned so much about the Erie Canal in the process that she had lectured her parents about it and dragged 45 of her friends to see the models. "I feel important," she said. "I actually know what I'm talking about."
Another conversation-stopper in the exhibit is a 1,200-pound marble tombstone with an intricate carving of a packet boat crossing an aqueduct. It once marked the grave of Luke Hitchcock, a stonemason who worked on the Erie Canal and died in 1860, but somehow found its way to the front lawn of the Madison County Historical Society. The college borrowed it for the exhibit. "This was one of the fun things we were able to include," said Rachel Seligman, the exhibit's curator. "And we did not -- and I repeat, did not -- remove it from the man's grave."
Craig Williams, a curator at the New York State Museum and an expert on New York's canals, said the broad scope of the Union exhibit, along with authentic touches like the maps and tombstone, set it apart from other Erie Canal collections around the state. "This is the real material," Mr. Williams said. "Short of spending weeks walking along the towpath, I can't think of a better way to capture the spirit of the canal."
By Union College's count, more than 5,000 people have seen the free exhibit and indulged in a bit of canal nostalgia at its community events. There has been a symposium on the design of the canal, a lecture on its social, cultural and economic impacts, and even a concert by George Ward, a folk singer whose 1982 album "Oh! That Low Bridge!" is devoted to the Erie Canal.
Union professors are also leading three tours of nearby canal sites for $10 a person. Sixty-six people have signed up, and 60 more are on the waiting list.
As canal lovers milled around the displays at the Nott Memorial on Tuesday night, they tittered at Mr. Hull's spirited recounting of how Union College students saved the day in 1825. Then they tapped their feet as a trio of folk artists regaled them with songs and jokes about the canal.
Tom Wadsworth, a folk musician from Cobleskill, N.Y., confided that he had been reading up on the Erie Canal ever since landing the unusual assignment. He ripped through a poem he had come across in a book: "We're digging a ditch through the gravel, through the gravel and mud and slime by gawd, so the people in freight can travel, and the packets can move on time by gawd."
Not long after that, Mr. Wadsworth had nearly everyone singing along to that fourth-grade standard "15 Miles on the Erie Canal." With a strum of his guitar, he started with, "I've got a mule and her name is Sal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal. She's a good old worker, she's a good old pal . . ."
And the audience chimed in, "15 miles on the Erie Canal."
Marie Costello, 75, who married into a family with three generations of tugboat captains, knew those words by heart. And she even brought her own traveling exhibit of Erie Canal memorabilia -- a tote bag crammed with 20 pounds of newspaper clippings, books, videotapes and photographs.
"Do you realize what the Erie Canal did for this community?" she asked. "It isn't possible for any of us to give you firsthand information about that. But I can tell you that it was our family's livelihood. Everything revolved around that work."

TRENTON: ABSTINENCE BILL ADVANCES
A committee of the New Jersey State Assembly yesterday approved legislation that would require schools to teach abstinence as a form of birth control. By a vote of 5 to 1, with one abstention, the Assembly education committee sent the measure to the full Assembly. Different versions of the bill have been defeated in other sessions. Separately, the Assembly judicial committee heard public testimony on whether to require parents to be notified before minors could seek an abortion. Proponents said notification would strengthen families; opponents said in cases of incest or abuse, getting such approval would be difficult or impossible. (NYT) 

ENGLEWOOD: ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD OPPOSED
Opposition appeared to be growing against a November ballot measure that would change the Englewood school board to an elected board from one appointed by the mayor. A group calling itself the Englewood Citizens for Education announced yesterday it would work with Mayor Paul T. Fader against the measure. The parents' group said it would try to convince voters that an appointed board helps maintain diverse ethnic and economic representation. Earlier, another parents' group forced the city to put the measure on the ballot because it believed an elected board would help raise some of the lowest test scores in Bergen County.

TRENTON: STATE TO COMBAT INTERNET HATE
The New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education, a state-sponsored agency, yesterday announced a curriculum guide to help teachers combat expressions of hate, especially on the Internet. The guide, which will be sent to teachers in grades 6 to 12 by January, includes material that helps identify hate speech, said Paul B. Winkler, the commission's executive director.

ALBANY: STATE REVENUE UP BY $400 MILLION
The state took in just under $400 million more in revenues during the first six months of the current fiscal year than its financial plan had anticipated, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday. The bulk of the greater-than-expected revenues -- $299.5 million -- came through strong collections of the state's personal income tax, Mr. McCall said. Business tax collections also exceeded expectations by $84.6 million, and total spending by the state was $67.3 million lower than projected. During the period from April 1 to Sept. 30, the first half of the state's fiscal year, personal income tax withholding grew by 12.2 percent to $8.9 billion over the previous fiscal year. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: BLACK HISTORIC DISTRICT APPROVED
The City Council has given final approval to a new historic district in western Harlem, which will be known as the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Historic District. The new district, approved by a unanimous vote Thursday, contains about 185 buildings from the north side of 145th Street to the south side of 149th Street, along jagged east-west borders from Convent to Edgecombe Avenues. It is part of a plan to designate an even larger swath of western Harlem up to 155th Street as a historic district, commemorating the social, cultural and architectural history of the neighborhood, which contains many turn-of-the-century row houses. (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: DEVELOPMENT OF BROOKLYN WATERFRONT
In a bid to help increase freight-handling business on long-dormant sections of Brooklyn's waterfront, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is holding a forum today on how to expand the use of rail cars that would be carried on barges from the New Jersey docks to Brooklyn. The forum, to be held at the World Trade Center, will also look at how to expand use of other underused freight routes that come into the borough from the north and east. Chris Ward, chief of strategic planning for the authority, said establishing that there is a demand for such freight operations -- which would not worsen truck traffic on narrow streets -- would help spur development on Brooklyn's waterfront.

WATERBURY: JURY MISTAKEN IN MURDER TRIAL
An apparent mistake on a jury form yesterday resulted in confusion over the sentence to be given to a man convicted of killing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter. The jury sent in a form that would have required a judge to sentence the defendant, Ivo Colon, to life in prison. But jurors said they meant to recommend a death sentence for Mr. Colon. Defense lawyers argued that the original form, in which jurors indicated that mitigating factors outweighed aggravating factors, was signed and valid. The trial judge ordered more testimony. (AP)
 
SHELTON: SCATTERED PUMPKIN SHORTAGES
The cool, wet weather last summer has led to a pumpkin shortage in some parts of southwestern Connecticut. Last year, the pumpkin crop throughout New England suffered because of hot, dry conditions, said Hugh Wiberg, the president of the New England Pumpkin Growers Association. But this year, the southwestern corner of Connecticut got more rain than farmers needed, he said. Farther north, growing conditions were better. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)

HEADLINE: Inquiry on Moneymaking at Dominican Consulate

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
At the Dominican Republic's consulate in New York, there seemed to be fees for everything. And for Dominicans, the city's largest and poorest immigrant group, almost all of the fees seemed excessive.
Cartas de ruta, common travel documents, cost $75. The fee for the right to transport a body back to the Dominican Republic for burial was as much as $150. Shipping high-end items like appliances required an administrative charge of $190. If it was a car, there was a $200 authorization fee. There were special stamps needed on documents and photographs that could only be taken by the consulate. 
 The scene at the consulate in Times Square had never rested easy with New York's booming Dominican population, but by last year the levies had become so varied and expensive that a certain outrage began to take hold.
There were, after all, by then more than 50 fees for assorted services and some of the highest prices anywhere for necessities like passports -- $200, more than double what other countries in the Americas charged. (A United States passport, for example, costs $60 for Americans 16 and older and $40 for those under 16.) The consulate even required its officials to fill out forms for certain services -- forms that applicants could have filled out themselves -- and then charged for it.
For decades, the Dominican consulate had served as an unusual, highly effective kind of moneymaking machine, one that could, in a good month, take in $600,000.
"The consulate was supposed to be there to serve us," said Juan Abreu, a bodega owner who faced mounds of paperwork and high fees when he tried to transport the body of a friend back home for burial. "That's what it was created for. But everything there was money, money, money."
The suspicion that the consulate's ever-escalating fees were improperly abusive -- long the belief among the hundreds of immigrants who filed through the office at 1501 Broadway six days a week -- is the focus of a formal investigation by the newly elected Dominican government. Federal prosecutors in Santo Domingo, the capital, are looking into how the consulate's revenues were spent and whether Bienvenido Perez, the consul general from 1996 to 1999, manipulated prices to benefit himself.
The Dominican government official now in charge of the country's consular affairs division summed up his appraisal of the consulate's recent conduct with scorn: "The idea," said the official, Jose Alejandro Ayuso, "was that anyone entering the consulate would go out without a cent in their pockets."
According to current and former consulate officials, as well as Dominican politicians both here and in Santo Domingo, the revenues generated at the office went not only to the central government, but also to the country's president and various senior political party officials. The consul general, too, was allowed to keep a percentage of the fees taken in by his office. The arrangement, while perhaps not known to the public, was widely accepted as customary and appropriate in Dominican political and governmental circles.
State Department officials in the United States say it is impossible to say whether the practices of the Dominican office are, in whole or part, carried out in the consulates of other countries. But interviews with knowledgeable American diplomatic officials suggest that the Dominican operation in New York, one of 17 Dominican consular offices in the United States and Puerto Rico, was hardly typical. Now, though, the Dominican government's inquiry is seeking to determine whether Mr. Perez's operation of the consulate, and the money he took from it, went beyond what was proper.
"It is evident that the consul general's office has been a fountain of wealth," Virgilio Bello Rosa, the new federal prosecutor in the Dominican Republic, said in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo. "It's evident the consul has a right to take some of that money. What we need to do is see if it was done legally or outside the law."
Already, the new Dominican government has pledged to clean up its New York consulate, with plans including random inspections and a computer system that will allow the foreign ministry to track revenues, said Mr. Ayuso, who has been named by President Hipolito Mejia to take charge of consular affairs.
The government also says it plans to lower some fees and control the power of the consul general, ensuring that a larger percentage of revenues do not simply wind up with top party officials.
"Now the consul doesn't have to give to the president of the republic, nor to the vice president, nor to the secretaries, nor to the financing of campaigns," President Mejia said in an interview. "Now the consul does not have to siphon money off from his countrymen."
Mr. Perez, 44, who was removed from the consulate last January but has not been formally charged, denied any wrongdoing or that he enriched himself during his tenure. He has since moved back to the Dominican Republic.
"If you look at all the consulates, the one that was most open, most transparent, was ours," Mr. Perez said in a telephone interview. "We are at peace because we know we acted openly and honestly."
However the government's investigation turns out, the role of the consulate, both historically and under Mr. Perez, provides a window into how its importance to central government leaders grew markedly as the Dominican immigrant enclave in New York, long centered in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, ballooned from 70,000 people in 1970 to an estimated 600,000 today.
For the ruling party in Santo Domingo, recognizing the financial benefits of its consulate in New York was not hard given that the Dominican community, perhaps more so than any of the city's myriad immigrant groups, is characterized by an undying devotion to the homeland.
Dominicans, for example, follow politics back home so closely that candidates frequently visit New York to raise money and generate support. Dominicans here also maintain strong economic ties, sending hundreds of millions of dollars home each year, and return there in striking numbers to conduct business, vacation and scout for retirement homes.
The consulate thus found itself with a great degree of importance and money. With a nonstop clientele -- the consulate serves, on average, 300 people a day, six days a week -- daily revenues under Mr. Perez ranged from $25,000 to $75,000, according to the consulate's daily audits, copies of which were shown to a reporter. Anywhere from a fifth to a third of that would be under the consul general's control.
Mr. Perez was installed in the post after successfully running Leonel Fernandez's 1996 presidential campaign in New York. The two had met back in the Dominican Republic through the Dominican Liberation Party, known as P.L.D., where Mr. Perez had been a young devotee and Mr. Fernandez a rising star.
When Mr. Perez took office in 1996, the money-generating operation at the consulate had been in place for more than 30 years. But Mr. Perez proved more adept than his predecessors at making the most of his opportunities, according to interviews with more than 40 former and current central government officials, consular employees and P.L.D. operatives.
Mr. Perez quickly increased fees, according to the consulate's financial records. Cartas de ruta, forms that allow Dominicans without passports to return home, went from $10.71 to $75. The fee for transporting a body for burial doubled to $150.
"Dominicans all feel the same about this, it's pure robbery," said Isidora Pina, a consultant for Rivas Travel in Washington Heights. "It's taking our money for no reason."
According to both the consulate's financial records and a number of its current and former officers, Mr. Perez had access to a range of fees. For every $200 passport, for example, $29 would go to the fund run by Mr. Perez, the officials said. For every $110 charged for power of attorney documents, $75 came under Mr. Perez's discretionary control, they said.
Take Sept. 24, 1996, when the consulate earned $27,323. A consulate official who worked under Mr. Perez said more than $6,000 of that went to pay the office's costs, including salaries; $16,548 went to the central government. The rest, $4,452, went to Mr. Perez, the official said.
Mr. Perez said those former consular officials who accused him of making thousands of dollars daily were either political enemies or ignorant of consular finances. He acknowledged receiving 25 percent of revenues, but only from the nine fees paid on items shipped to the Dominican Republic. He denied raising the fees at all.Mr. Perez said most of his income came from his $1,200-a-week salary.
But to the Dominicans in New York, who have a median household income of $20,000, the lowest of all major immigrant groups in New York, the costs hit hard. Among the most hated was a $100 parental authorization form, which was required for children to travel alone.
"I didn't like this abuse, and I did think it was abuse on the part of the authorities," said Lourdes Luciano de Valdez, who complained to American officials that the Dominican authorities prevented her daughter from returning to New York two summers ago because the authorization fee had not been paid.
Even Dominican government officials shared that view. "It was a consulate that ran by its own rules," recalled Maria Cristina Aguiar, the former Dominican ambassador to the United Nations. "They had their own code. And in the end, they had exorbitant power."
Whether Mr. Perez's management ultimately was merely typical or something worse, the former consul general clearly became a lightning rod for the anger of Dominicans in New York.
By mid-1999, the situation at the consulate had evolved into a scandal so glaring that it had become the subject of news coverage back home. The leading magazine in the Dominican Republic, Rumbo, had done an expose on the consulate, and an issue rarely addressed there became a campaign theme. Many in the P.L.D. think the controversy hurt the party's bid to retain the presidency.
"The campaign against the consulate had a lot of force with the Dominicans in New York, and they play an important role sustaining the Dominican economy," said Jimmy Sierra, an aide to former President Fernandez. "That caused the people to look badly at Bienvenido Perez and the party, and this clearly was one of the reasons for the P.L.D.'s showing in the last elections."
Officials in the new government say a preliminary audit has shown the consulate was left with a $61,000 debt and a $20,000 credit card bill in Mr. Perez's name.
President Mejia said in an interview that confidence can only be restored by curtailing the power of future consuls. "We're going to make sure he doesn't become a strongman," he said. "Right now, people don't believe in my consul, or in the last one or in the ones in the past. Why? The Dominican has lost credibility and faith in these officials."
Those who have long pushed for reforms say they are going to be carefully watching the consulate.
"They say, as it's expected, that the office will not be just for revenues but one that will offer services to the community," said Dinorah Cordero, who works with Dominican immigrants at the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights. "And we're expecting them to live up to the promises."
The new consul, Luis Eludis Perez, said the lower fees and fewer travel requirements will take hold starting in January. He said the new consul general will still have the power to withhold some of the fee money to pay wages and other costs, but insisted that the rest would go to the central government's coffers.
"We want to keep our word," said the new consul, who headed the Mejia campaign in New York. "We want people to know we're not just for revenues, but also an agency serving the people."

HEADLINE: Gus Hall, Unreconstructed American Communist of 7 Decades, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS 

 BODY:
Gus Hall, the zealous lifelong Communist who led the American branch of the party from the cold war through political oblivion in the post-Soviet era, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Yonkers.
The son of an impoverished Minnesota miner, Mr. Hall became radicalized early, beginning a career as a union and Communist Party organizer during the Depression. J. Edgar Hoover once described him as "a powerful, deceitful, dangerous foe of Americanism." 
 He served eight years in prison for his political views, ran for president four times and never apologized for or wavered from the increasingly marginalized ideology he championed.
By the end of his life he had become a lonely Communist stalwart in a post-Communist world. Those who sought him out for interviews at party headquarters on West 23rd Street in Manhattan found a genial white-haired man presiding over "a museum of history," as he put it. Pictures of his family shared space with a portrait of Lenin (a gift from Leonid I. Brezhnev); a wood sculpture from Fidel Castro and a tapestry of Karl Marx, courtesy of Erich Honecker, the former leader of East Germany.
"The struggle between those who own the wealth and those whose labor produces the wealth is one flaw in capitalism that will lead to socialism," Mr. Hall said in 1996, repeating the familiar Marxist formulation.
Mr. Hall was first elected general secretary of the Communist Party, U.S.A., in 1959, when the federal government considered the organization an outpost of the Kremlin and all its members potentially dangerous subversives.
Mr. Hall's message won few converts, and his four presidential campaigns, from 1972 to 1984, met with yawning indifference. In his best showing, the 1976 election, he amassed 58,992 votes, about 19,000 more than Lyndon H. LaRouche, the eccentric candidate who had accused Queen Elizabeth II and Henry A. Kissinger, among others, of having ties to drug traffickers.
Yet, in the Communist world, Mr. Hall remained an important figure. He enjoyed the patronage of every Soviet head of state, from Nikita S. Khrushchev to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was received as a dignitary on his yearly pilgrimages to Moscow. A high point came in 1981 when he addressed the 26th Party Congress, at the invitation of Mr. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader Mr. Hall most esteemed. He was less admiring of Mr. Gorbachev, whose reforms a few years later, Mr. Hall said, "literally destroyed the basis for socialism."
As long as the cold war raged, however, Mr. Hall's Soviet sponsors delighted in the presence of this unmistakably American comrade, an authentic product of the working class, nearer in spirit to Joe Sixpack, it seemed, than to Joe Stalin. A rock-jawed, barrel-chested six-footer, Mr. Hall weighed more than 200 pounds and had the powerful hands of the lumberjack and steelworker he had been in his youth. Simple in his tastes and habits, he was married to one woman, Elizabeth Turner, for 65 years, living with her in the three-bedroom house they bought in a middle-class neighborhood in Yonkers in 1962. She survives him, as do his two children, Barbara and Arvo, and three grandchildren.
To his adversaries, Mr. Hall's rough-and-ready manner was a cynical pose that concealed a dedicated apparatchik. Even political associates sometimes found Mr. Hall's obeisance to the Soviet Union excessive, and they grumbled, especially in his later years, that his inflexible views and dictatorial personality were hampering the party and isolating it from the wider political world.
"I told Gus 10 years ago that he should be grooming new leadership, but he would have none of it," Carl Bloice, a former colleague, said in 1993. "He sees himself as a man on a mission, the last holdout."
Although Mr. Hall insisted that the American Communist Party was an independent organization, in 1992 the Moscow daily Izvestia reported that Mr. Hall had been the recipient of $40 million in Soviet assistance between 1971 and 1990.
 
Radical Roots Lead From Logging to Lenin
Gus Hall was born Arvo Kusta Halberg on Oct. 8, 1910, in Iron, Minn., one of 10 children reared by Matt Halberg, a miner, and his wife, Susannah. His parents were Finnish immigrants who belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World, the militant labor organization. Their son said that after Mr. Halberg was blacklisted from the mines for joining an I.W.W. strike the family grew up "in semi-starvation," in a log cabin Mr. Halberg built with his own hands.
Mr. Hall left school after the eighth grade and found work in a logging camp. His parents' radical teachings were reinforced, he later recalled, by the hardships of that experience, which once included bunking alongside the corpse of a man who had died on the job.
"When you work in the woods literally from sunup to sundown and it's 50 degrees below zero and you eat slop and you make $30 a month, then what was said at home begins to make sense," Mr. Hall once said.
In 1927, he was recruited into the American Communist Party by his father, a member of the organization since its inception in 1919. An apprenticeship in the Young Communist League qualified him to attend the Lenin Institute in Moscow, where he was trained for two years in sabotage and guerrilla tactics. He returned, in 1933, to a country devastated by the Great Depression. A growing number of Americans, convinced that the existing political and economic structures had become outmoded, were attracted to the Communist Party's promise of a workers' state. One of many who plunged into the labor movement, Mr. Hall made his name organizing union locals in the Midwest.
Militant and bold, he drew on some of the conspiratorial tactics he had learned in Moscow. One such tactic was the adoption of a sequence of aliases, all variations on his given name, before he settled on Gus Hall. He took the name legally in the mid-1930's.
At the same time he employed the attention-getting methods of militant leaders like William Haywood -- Big Bill -- of the I.W.W. Mr. Hall was arrested at least twice in the 1930's. In a Teamsters' strike in Minneapolis, in 1934, he was accused of inciting a riot and spent six months in jail. And in 1937, in a strike against the Republic Steel Corporation in Youngstown, Ohio, he was charged with plotting to dynamite company property. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was fined $500.
Thereafter Mr. Hall became a full-time functionary of the Communist Party, beginning with a $20-a-week position as the party leader in Youngstown. He ran on the Communist ticket for city councilman and also for governor of Ohio, but his vote totals were low, even in these years of comparative success for the Communist Party.
 
A Veteran, a Convict, A Fugitive, a Comrade
He was living in Cleveland with his wife and children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. The party had opposed the war after Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939 but changed its line in June 1941, when Germany violated the pact and invaded Russia.
Mr. Hall enlisted in the Navy and became a mechanic, stationed in the Pacific. He was repairing motors in Guam when a bitter ideological fight roiled the American Communist Party and caused the downfall of the general secretary, Earl Browder, in 1945. Elections were held the next year, and Mr. Hall, freshly discharged from the Navy and unscarred by factional combat, was elevated to the national executive board under the new general secretary, Eugene Dennis.
By this time, American attitudes toward Communists were hardening because of cold war tensions. In 1948, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Hall and 11 other party leaders under the Alien Registration Act, popularly called the Smith Act, for conspiring to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government by force. The dramatic 10-month trial, marked by loud confrontations between the defendants, their lawyers and the judge, Harold R. Medina, was held in the United States courthouse on Foley Square in downtown Manhattan and shared headlines with another celebrated trial under way in the same building: the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, a former State Department official accused of having spied for the Soviets.
In October 1949, Mr. Hall and 10 others were found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. While the verdict was being appealed, Mr. Hall was elected to the party's second-highest position, national secretary, but after the Supreme Court upheld the convictions in 1951 he and three others jumped bail and crossed the border into Mexico, only to be captured three months later by Mexican Secret Service agents. Mr. Hall, his sentence lengthened to eight years, was confined to the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. There he distributed party leaflets and also lifted weights, adding bulk to his already stocky frame. He was especially proud of the time he spent in a cell adjacent to that of George (Machine Gun) Kelly, one of the most notorious gangsters of the 1920's and 30's.
 
Wresting Reins of Party, Or What Was Left of It
Imprisonment had made Mr. Hall something of a hero in party circles, and when he was released in 1957, he crisscrossed the country, visiting party members and calling for a new, more democratic regime. His plan was to wrest the party leadership from Eugene Dennis.
Though neither a galvanizing speaker nor a penetrating theorist, Mr. Hall could be persuasive face to face, with a hearty, unpretentious manner and a willingness to listen. And he did not shy from hardball tactics. He accused Mr. Dennis of cowardice and of violating party discipline because he had failed to join Mr. Hall and other Smith Act defendants in 1951 when they tried to go underground.
He also said Mr. Dennis had misappropriated funds meant for Mr. Hall and the other fugitives. At the party convention in 1959, Mr. Dennis backed down from Mr. Hall's challenge rather than force another factional fight.
Some wondered why Mr. Hall was so eager to assume the leadership of the party at a time when its morale had sunk to an all-time low. The "Red hunts" led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in the early 1950's left many members demoralized. So did a report from Moscow, in February 1956, that the new Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, had accused Stalin, who was still revered by many Communists, of brutal crimes.
Furthermore, the United States had achieved unparalleled prosperity, and more Americans were streaming into the middle class than ever before. It was hardly a propitious moment to call for a new socialist state. Indeed, party enrollment had dwindled to about 3,000 from its peak of about 66,000 in 1939. It would never rise appreciably again.
And yet Mr. Hall remained a contentious figure, thanks in part to actions by the United States government, which continued to pursue the Communist Party. In 1961, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of the Smith Act along with the Internal Security Act of 1950, known as the McCarran Act, which required "Communist action" organizations to register with the government. Party members were barred from applying for United States passports and from holding government jobs. The State of New York even revoked Mr. Hall's driver's license. Thereafter he commuted between his Manhattan office and his home in the suburbs in a chauffeured car, always American-made, because Mr. Hall was an ardent union man.
 
A Doomed Effort to Ally With the 'New Left'
By the early 1960's, few Americans believed the party posed a serious danger, especially after Mr. Hall had jettisoned the fiery language and militant tactics of his youth and spoke now of peaceful protest. Critics of the Supreme Court's anti-Communist rulings included the members of a new generation whose political conscience had been fired by the sit-ins and freedom rides of the civil rights movement. When Mr. Hall lectured at Cornell University in December 1961, 1,950 people, nearly all of them students, filled the auditorium, and an additional 2,000 were turned away.
Trying to pick up on the new wave of youth protest, Mr. Hall envisioned what he called a "broad people's political movement." The phrasing was not very different from that used by radical campus groups like Students for a Democratic Society. In fact, there were points of convergence between the Old Left, as it came to be called, and the New Left. Both called for an immediate end to the Vietnam War, sympathized with Fidel Castro's rule in Cuba, denounced American foreign policy in Latin America and opposed the nuclear arms race. The party also allied itself with the civil rights movement and in 1966 issued a statement of solidarity with two militant organizations, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Black Panthers.
But Mr. Hall never was able to forge a durable alliance with the New Left. While younger radicals like Tom Hayden styled themselves "grass roots" revolutionaries and patterned themselves on Che Guevara and other third world icons, Mr. Hall stayed faithful to the Soviet Union and to the ideal of an ascendant working class firmly rooted in the dislocations of the early 20th century.
Dorothy Healey, a leader of the California Communist Party, who had been an early supporter of Mr. Hall's but later turned against him, observed: "Gus has only the narrowest concept of class: the worker at the point of production. The world may change, not his vision of it."
In the 1970's and 1980's, as the radical agenda became defined increasingly by feminism, the gay and lesbian movements and environmentalism, Mr. Hall was as nonplused as others of his generation.
In 1991, as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Mr. Hall conducted a news conference at the party's Manhattan office, warning of a new wave of witch hunts and McCarthyism, but this time in the Soviet Union, which he had visited only a few months earlier.
Asked if he had plans to visit again in the near future, he said no. Instead, he pointed to the world's last bastion of Stalinism.
"The world should see what North Korea has done," Mr. Hall said. "In some ways it's a miracle.
"If you want to take a nice vacation, take it in North Korea."

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Tuesday about Gus Hall, longtime chairman of the American Communist Party, misstated the title held by Nikita S. Khrushchev when he was the Soviet leader. Khrushchev became premier in 1958; he was not premier in 1956 and he never held the title head of state.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Taxes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Senseless Health Deduction" (editorial, Oct. 14): 
 Income tax deductibility of health insurance for self-employed people would benefit everyone.
With 43 million people uninsured, there is a flaw in the system that cries out for correction. Most of the insured have plans of limited flexibility that their employers provide. These plans usually offer a full range of benefits that come at a very high premium. This leaves self-employed and unemployed people a limited number of plans to choose from, almost all with high premiums.
If the tax treatment is made more equitable, people employed by corporations would have no tax incentive to accept the plan provided by their employers. This would open up an entirely new market with a variety of plans at varying prices that would give consumers an extensive choice of health insurance options.

HEADLINE: WORLD BUSINESS: When Greenland Exports, It's Ice;
Bottled Water and Cube Sales to Seekers of Boutique Purity

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: NUUK, Greenland

 BODY:
For Greenland's 55,000 people, the defining fact of life has always been the ice sheet, a mammoth expanse nearly three times the size of Texas that blankets 85 percent of their island. Now, entrepreneurs on this Arctic frontier think they have figured out how to capitalize on the icecap.
Three companies are drawing up business plans to export to Europe and the United States the No. 1 resource of Greenland: pure water. Building on one company's pioneering sales in Europe of Greenland ice, they hope romantics will want to sip drinks mixed with water or chilled with ice cubes that first fell as snow when Cleopatra made eyes at Marc Antony. Health buffs, they hope, will want to drink crystalline water that has been locked in the icecap for thousands of years, long before humans started pumping pollutants into the atmosphere. 
 Here in Greenland's capital, a Scandinavian-style town of 14,000, people have watched enviously as Canada, 350 miles away, supplanted France in 1998 to become the leading exporter of bottled water to the United States. With world bottled-water consumption increasing by 10 percent annually in recent years, Greenlanders say they believe that there is plenty of room for their premium-price offerings.
"The purity of our water is perfect," Vagn Andersen, a 30-year veteran of Greenland's business scene, said over breakfast here recently. "Now we have a real possibility to help the country."
Mr. Andersen is the managing director of one of the new enterprises, Greenland Water Production, which has an ambitious goal of bottling near here as much as 500 million liters of water a year, or 132 million gallons, the equivalent of Canada's water exports to the United States last year.
On Aug. 24, a new Canadian-Greenlandic joint venture, Aquapolaris, announced that it had been granted a license to export glacial meltwater by tanker from a waterfall a few miles east of here.
A third company, Greenland Ice Cap Production, started exporting ice to Europe in 1997. "Put the bright, sparkling ice diamonds in your glass, and hear the soft whispering sound of the past," says an advertisement in Britain for "Greenland icecap rocks."
It continues, "You will be fascinated by the sound of past millenniums, and your thoughts will flow lightly." The company expects to complete negotiations with an American investor by the end of October to start exporting glacial meltwater.
Greenland's home-rule Parliament is expected early in November to approve a framework for long-term licenses of water exports. Treating water like oil, Greenland legislators may impose royalties on bulk water exports or may favor operations that create jobs by bottling water locally.
In Canada, most provinces have banned bulk water sales, largely from fear of causing environmental damage for relatively little economic gain. Maurice J. Murphy, chief operating officer of Aquapolaris, works out of an office in Newfoundland, where such a ban was imposed last year.
Under the Aquapolaris plan, tankers that can hold as much as 150,000 tons would steam up Nuuk's fjord and take water by pipe from the waterfall. The venture, Mr. Murphy said, would invest up to $2 million for mooring facilities and "will create a fair bit of employment."
In contrast, Mr. Andersen, whose company is backed by a Copenhagen entrepreneur and a former Danish interior minister, proposes that Greenland Water Production be granted a 25-year monopoly for the export of drinking water from Greenland, with share ownership widely held by Greenlanders.
"We are definitely working against bulk water exports," he said of his company's lobbying efforts. "There is no money in that for Greenland. This is Greenland water. It should be bottled here, and sold as made in Greenland."
Mr. Andersen's project would draw water from a lake seven miles southeast of here that is fed by three glaciers. Using a maximum of 5 percent of the lake's intake, Greenland Water Production would send water by pipe to a bottling plant in Nuuk.
High shipping costs routinely present obstacles for business projects in Greenland, 2,000 miles west of Denmark, the island's colonial and economic power.
But Mr. Andersen said that a new technology would allow one-liter plastic bottles to be shipped collapsed into the size of salt shakers. Filled bottles would go to Denmark weekly in a Royal Arctic Line freighter that brings food and supplies to Nuuk and that generally leaves here nearly empty, often taking on seawater as ballast. Bottles of Greenland water could be delivered to supermarkets in Northern Europe for about 25 cents a liter, he calculated, about 95 cents a gallon. Delivery to North America is also possible, he said.
Greenland Ice Cap Production, a privately held company run by a prominent local businessman, Kaj Egede, is planning both bottled and bulk water exports. The company has been mining two-ton blocks of ice from a glacier near Narsaq, about 15 miles southeast of Nuuk, and plans to start selling the water obtained as a byproduct of its icecap rock operations.
Some people may have environmental concerns about using the water from ancient ice. But the entrepreneurs note that there is plenty to go around. For starters, the ice sheet is thick, two miles deep in some places and shrinking by 11 cubic miles a year -- not much considering its magnitude, with an estimated weight of 2.5 quadrillion tons.
By such measures, the amount of water the three companies expect to take is minuscule. Greenland Ice Cap Production mines about 2,000 tons of ice a year near Narsaq.
Aquapolaris, the joint venture that wants to export the waterfall's water, is partly owned by Allan Idd Jensen, a Nuuk shipping company executive, and the Iceberg Corporation of America, which is based in Newfoundland. The Canadian company has been taking ice from icebergs floating south from Greenland, and hopes to triple its water production next year to 10,000 tons.
"There are approximately 2,000 icebergs that come past Newfoundland each year," said Mr. Murphy, who is also the Iceberg corporation's vice president for engineering. A single iceberg, he said, is sufficient for the Canadian operation for several years.
According to Mr. Murphy, once icebergs are in international waters, they are fair game. His company and its affiliates have used the ice for more than three years to produce bottled water, or as an ingredient for alcohol. Its beer and vodka are sold in North America under the Borealis Iceberg label. Aquapolaris plans to sell bulk water from the waterfall in new markets yet to be determined.
In Scandinavia and Britain, bags of Greenland icecap rocks are marketed as luxury products, according to Philip Hughes, proprietor of the Ice Box Ltd., a major London supplier.
The cachet? "It is the aesthetics," he said. "Sometimes, restaurant-produced ice is murky. This is clearer. You get this sparkling effect as it releases oxygen."
But now, only seven months after Greenland Ice introduced its products in Britain, London shops are cutting retail prices in half, to the equivalent of about $1.25 a pound -- still a premium price.
Mr. Hughes is undeterred. "We remember when Perrier came to the U.K., and no one in England would drink mineral water," he said. "Now, the industry is moving billions of liters a year."

HEADLINE: Production In September Rose, but Pace Was Slower

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production slowed in September from a month earlier, closing out the weakest quarterly performance for manufacturers since early last year, Federal Reserve statistics showed today.
Output rose 0.2 percent last month, mainly reflecting increased production of cars and replacement tires for the Explorer sport utility vehicles, made by the Ford Motor Company. That followed a 0.4 percent rise in August. Production in the third quarter rose at a 2.8 percent annual rate, the slowest three-month pace since a 2 percent rise in the first quarter of 1999, when Asian economies were starting to emerge from recession. 
 Higher interest rates, weaker global demand and a resulting buildup of inventories have contributed to a slower pace of growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about one-fifth of the nation's economic output.
"Manufacturing is providing far less support for the economy than earlier in the year," in part reflecting more restrained consumer spending, said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
The report backs up an industry survey released on Oct. 2 that showed manufacturing contracted in September for the second consecutive month. That drop reflected the biggest drop in new orders in almost two years, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management.
Analysts expect the manufacturing slowdown to persist in the months ahead because larger inventories and a drop in consumer spending mean fewer goods will need to be produced. Business inventories rose 2 percent in the three months ended in August, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer spending slowed in the second quarter to a 3.1 percent annual rate after rising 7.6 percent in the first three months of the year.
The Fed's production report also pointed to restrained inflation. "There's little inflationary threat from manufacturing," said Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.

HEADLINE: Judge Rules That Tax Shelter Worth $6 Billion Is a Sham

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Delaware, in a decision made public yesterday, held that one company's corporate tax shelter was a sham and noted that 85 other large corporations used the same deduction to avoid paying $6 billion in corporate income taxes.
Judge Murray Schwartz of United States District Court in Wilmington, Del., ruled that Camelot Music could not deduct interest on loans it took out against life insurance on its 1,430 employees in 1990 through 1993. 
 The decision could affect many of the other 85 companies, which the judge did not identify by name, because his ruling applies to every company organized in Delaware, whose corporate-governance laws have made it a leading center for the nominal headquarters of large companies.
American Electric Power, an electric utility in Columbus, Ohio, has a case involving almost identical issues scheduled to go to trial in two weeks. Pat D. Hemlepp, a spokesman for the company, said that $240 million in taxes were at issue.
The case in which the ruling was issued Monday, and made public yesterday, involved Camelot Music, which was bought by the Trans World Entertainment Corporation of Albany last year for $451.9 million.
Camelot took out life insurance from the Hartford Group beginning in 1990 on its 1,430 workers. The company paid for the insurance, taking a deduction for this expense, and then borrowed back the premium through a loan against the insurance policy. On its corporate income tax returns the company took $13.8 million of deductions in 1990 through 1993 tax returns for interest it paid on the loans.
Judge Schwartz said that there was no buildup in the cash value of the insurance policies and because of the way the loans were structured there was no reasonable prospect that the company would profit from buying the insurance.
He called the arrangement "a factual sham" that "lacked objective economic substance and a subjective business purpose other than the tax benefits flowing from the interest deductions."
The judge said the deal "crossed the line" on permissible deductions by such a wide margin that the Internal Revenue Service was right to impose penalties for filing an inaccurate tax return.
John Sullivan, Trans World Entertainment's chief financial officer, said that if the decision stood it would cost the company about $8 million plus interest. "I'm surprised by the ruling," Mr. Sullivan said, adding that he expected the company would appeal the decision.
The Camelot Music and American Electric Power cases are similar to the corporate-owned life insurance policy tax shelter of Winn-Dixie Stores, a big supermarket chain, that a tax court judge demolished last year in an 81-page opinion.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Getting Religion On Corporate Ethics;
A Scourge of Scandals Leaves Its Mark

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN 

 BODY:
Archer Daniels Midland pleaded guilty to a price-fixing conspiracy that cost consumers millions of dollars a year in higher prices for soft drinks and detergents. It agreed to pay a $100 million fine.
Royal Dutch/Shell scrapped plans for sinking a North Sea oil rig that environmentalists contended was contaminated. Later, Shell was accused of colluding with the Nigerian government in the oppression of the Ogoni people and failing to speak out against the execution of one of their leaders. 
 And now, Bridgestone/Firestone and the Ford Motor Company are apologizing to American consumers for a pattern of deadly tire failures, while blaming each other for the debacle.
Almost every year, it seems, some scandal envelops a Fortune 500 company and causes a new spasm of public distrust of big corporations. This year's occurrence probably should not be surprising; in the competitive marketplace, the temptation to cut ethical corners can be hard to resist.
Lately, however, corporate America seems to be doing more than just paying lip service to standards of management behavior. For all the controversy surrounding the Firestone/Ford tire recall, and the questions it raises about the potential for corporate wrongdoing, a growing number of big companies are enacting strict ethical guidelines and backing them up with internal mechanisms to enforce them. While some consider the changes little more than window dressing, there is no doubt that change is afoot.
The corporate title of ethics officer, for example, almost unknown a decade ago, has become almost as familiar as chief information officer. The Ethics Officer Association, a trade group in Belmont, Mass., says membership has soared to 706 today from 12 in 1992.
Moreover, the job description of ethics officers has expanded from ombudsman to policy maker, corporate governance experts say. "Instead of being a corporate policeman, ethics officers are becoming corporate coaches for ethical decision making," said Martin Taylor, vice president for corporate services at the Institute for Global Ethics in Camden, Me.
And ethical matters are now debated at much higher levels. A 1999 Conference Board study of 124 companies in 22 countries found that directors are now much more involved in the creation of ethical standards. While only 21 percent of the policies in existence in 1987 showed board involvement, participation had increased to 41 percent in 1991 and now is up to 78 percent of the cases.
Critics say, however, that the rush by corporations to portray themselves as exemplary citizens often leads nowhere. A strongly written ethics policy "will be acknowledged as positive simply by its being there," said Barbara Ley Toffler, a management consultant who has written about ethics.
Skeptics also say the ethics movement has a dark side: intrusion into the private lives of employees. In their zeal to discourage workplace misbehavior -- from using company e-mail for personal purposes to sexual harassment -- some companies are snooping on employee's e-mail and telephone use and even installing video cameras.
"When American workers go to work they lose almost all of their personal privacy," said Charles J. Sykes, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif.
Nobody doubts that companies are motivated to join the ethics crusade partly to polish their image. But the commitment goes deeper than that for a very practical reason, corporate governance experts say: taking a strong ethical stand helps shield senior officers from legal troubles.
First came the publication in 1991 of the Justice Department's sentencing guidelines, which in effect promised more lenient treatment for convicted corporate executives if their companies had established good-citizenship ethics programs. Then in 1995, the Delaware Court of Chancery warned that corporate directors could be held personally liable for subordinates' wrongdoing if they had failed to establish programs to ensure compliance with the law.
In addition to legal considerations, public opinion is prodding corporations to be more vigilant about their social and environmental responsibilities. "There's a feeling corporations are more powerful and larger all the time, using the power for their own narrow selfish concerns," said Daniel Yankelovich, the chairman of DYG Inc., a market research firm. "For the last 15 years, business has had a respite from mistrust and suspicion because there's a great deal of growth in the economy, but that's beginning to change. There's a yellow light flashing."
An increasing number of companies are conducting so-called social audits of their policies and practices. In these studies, they try to identify ethical lapses committed in the past and set directives for avoiding similar missteps in the future.
In response to criticisms of its actions in Nigeria and elsewhere, for example, Shell has issued "The Shell Report." The paper opens with a pledge by its chairman, Mark Moody-Stuart, to pursue a business strategy "that generates profits while contributing to the well-being of the planet and its people."
The report, which Shell has posted on the Internet, identifies initiatives that it is taking to prevent wrongdoing by employees. For example, it said enforcement of its policy against bribe-taking had resulted in four dismissals and one resignation, though it did not provide details.
And Shell says it has hired the accounting and consulting firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers to verify the steps it is taking to ensure the health and safety of its workers and to protect the environment, like cleaning up oil spills.
"There was no book on this. We had to invent it for ourselves and looked at business principles line by line, clause by clause," said Mark Wade, a founding member of the task force that developed the company's environmental and social policies and issued the report.
Mattel Inc., the toy maker, embarked on a social audit three years ago that it named the Mattel Independent Monitoring Council. An advisory panel, made up entirely of company outsiders, including Murray Weidenbaum, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, spent a year creating 200 workplace standards, including the length of breaks and the number of restrooms for workers at its plants.
Mattel said it especially wanted to make sure none of its overseas plants were exploiting workers. While the company said that it found none that were, it did uncover accounting infractions and air-quality abuses at some factories and made sure the local managers corrected them. The panel detailed those incidents in its report.
Elsewhere, companies are requiring employees to take ethics classes. Lockheed Martin, for example, has created a newspaper called Ethics Daily that runs articles based on ethical problems people at the company have faced, then uses those accounts as grist for its training programs. When employee feedback showed more than half the employees surveyed did not report misconduct that they had observed because they feared retaliation, management used the information to create a program on trust.
The Boeing Company requires its rank and file to undergo at least one hour of ethical training a year, and senior managers five hours. Participants must decide the best way to respond to a moral problem, like an outside vendor's offer of free baseball tickets. (The correct answer, even in late October: refuse them.)
"The perception of favoritism is bad in the company," said Gale C. Andrews, Boeing's vice president of ethics and business conduct. "It's important to have a conversation about why employees can't go."
At the McMurray Publishing Company in Phoenix, all 75 employees attend a mandatory meeting every other Monday on workplace ethics. Recently, they discussed their views on how to handle a vendor who had mistakenly delivered real rather than simulated wood and who was requesting an additional $200 to meet the cost. Some said the company should pay the extra money in accordance with its stated principle to "do the right thing," while others argued that it should refuse, to live up to its dictum to "make a reasonable profit." After a split vote, the conversation turned to the topic of resolving conflicting values.
Nonprofit advocacy groups, meantime, are leaning on corporations to make ethics a higher boardroom priority. The Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies in Boston, whose members include environmental, public-interest, labor and religious organizations, spent 18 months developing guidelines and spun off a separate group called the Global Reporting Initiative.
Forty-eight companies volunteered to respond to the guidelines, and 21 -- including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ford, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Shell -- were selected to analyze and refine them.
The United Nations started a campaign to instill ethical values in the global marketplace. In July, it completed a nine-point Global Compact for protecting the environment, abolishing child labor and supporting free-trade unions, and invited corporations to support it. So far, 44 have.
There is even a movement afoot to make corporations' ethical behavior subject to the same disclosure rules as their financial dealings. The Corporate Sunshine Working Group, made up of social investors, environmentalists and labor unions, is pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to require companies to release more information about their social and environmental practices to the public.
The two-year-old group says it has held low-level talks with the S.E.C., though so far the discussions have been mostly exploratory. Some experts doubt they will go much beyond that. After all, said Lynn S. Paine, an ethics professor at Harvard Business School, "it took 300 years to develop financial standards."
Even so, ethical standards may be the wave of the future, if only because the right thing to do can also be the profitable thing to do. A 1999 DePaul University study found that companies that publicly proclaimed their commitment to ethical principles did better financially than companies that did not.
"Companies believe social and environmental groups are still outside the mainstream and are looked upon as tree-hugging radicals or aging hippies, but it's a myth," said Curtis C. Verschoor, the accounting professor who wrote the study. "Companies are slow to realize that good ethics is good business."

HEADLINE: Medicare Bill That Favors H.M.O.'s Faces a Veto

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Clinton would veto the latest version of a bill restoring money to Medicare because it gave too much money to health maintenance organizations.
The Clinton administration insisted that Congress shift money from H.M.O.'s to hospitals, home health care agencies and other health care providers. 
 Hospitals would presumably be the chief beneficiaries of the administration's veto threat.
But Richard H. Wade, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said tonight, "We are not supporting the veto threat."
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the association, said a veto could imperil billions of dollars in relief for health care providers and the patients they serve.
"We would hope there could be a bipartisan approach to resolve the differences here," Mr. Pollack said. "A veto threat does not engender the bipartisan cooperation needed to enact this important legislation."
If no bill becomes law this year, elderly people could still receive health care under Medicare, but payments to providers would be cut by a 1997 law.
President Clinton contends that many H.M.O.'s are already overpaid by Medicare.
John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said today, "Instead of passing an enforceable patients' bill of rights, Congress is on the verge of giving billions of dollars of Medicare money to the same H.M.O.'s that have fought tooth and nail to defeat patient protections."
Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Jacob J. Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said they would recommend that President Clinton veto the Medicare bill unless Congress reduced the increases in payments to H.M.O.'s. White House officials said Mr. Clinton would follow that advice.
In a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, the administration demanded that Congress require H.M.O.'s to stay in the Medicare program and preserve existing benefits for three years.
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said: "We insist on accountability. H.M.O.'s say they need more money so they won't have to drop coverage or benefits. We want an assurance that, if they receive more money, they will continue to provide coverage and benefits."
In recent years, many health plans have pulled out of Medicare or reduced benefits, saying their costs outstripped the payments they received from the government. By increasing those payments, Congress hopes to reverse the exodus.
The Medicare bill would raise payments to health care providers by $26 billion to $28 billion over five years. Mr. Podesta said that H.M.O.'s would get "well over a third" of the money.
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, who is chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, rejected the administration's veto threat as so much bluster.
"A veto of the Medicare relief bill would deny millions of seniors critical access to the health care they need," Mr. Thomas said. "Nearly one million Medicare beneficiaries were dropped from their current health plans last year through no choice or fault of their own."
Medicare provides health care to 39 million elderly or disabled people. To slow the program's growth, Congress in 1997 cut payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. The savings far exceeded what Congress intended.
Members of Congress from both parties have drafted numerous proposals to restore some money cut from Medicare. Payments to hospitals are increased each year to reflect changes in the cost of the goods and services they use. In 1997, Congress ordered that the annual inflation update be cut 1.1 percentage points in 2001 and again in 2002.
Republicans have decided to pay the full update in 2001 and to restore half of the money cut in 2002. The White House said that this was not enough, and that hospitals should receive the full inflation allowance for both years.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: A FLORIDA RACE;
2 Senate Candidates Eagerly Woo Moderates

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The nominees for United States Senate here in Florida are grappling for votes from the ideological center by trying to shove each other away from it, the Democrat pushing the Republican farther to the right, the Republican nudging the Democrat toward the left.
It has made for a sometimes nasty contest in one of the year's most closely watched races, where two political veterans seek to fill the vacancy opened by the retirement of a two-term Republican incumbent, Senator Connie Mack. 
 The Democratic nominee, Bill Nelson, former six-term member of the House and now state insurance commissioner, often labels the Republican, Representative Bill McCollum, who has served in the House for 20 years, an extremist who would sacrifice the elderly, the poor and the working class to coddle the rich.
Mr. McCollum, in turn, paints Mr. Nelson as a liberal who would "tax everything that moves, and some things that don't."
In this hardly unique strategy of digging for votes in the middle, Mr. Nelson may have the advantage, because, political experts say, he has much less distance to cover along the spectrum.
As a congressman, "he was known as a fairly moderate Democrat," said Aubrey Jewitt, a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, "and right now that's a good ideological place to be."
Mr. McCollum, by contrast, has consistently won approval mostly from conservative Republicans, on issues like abortion and gun control.
The race here is crucial to national Democrats' hopes of narrowing the margin of the Republican advantage in the Senate, or perhaps even regaining control there. And a recent statewide survey conducted for The St. Petersburg Times by Schroth & Associates, a polling firm based in Washington, found Mr. Nelson ahead of Mr. McCollum, 45 percent to 34 percent.
Mr. Nelson, of Melbourne, enjoys name recognition around Florida, having run for statewide office four times, unlike Mr. McCollum, of Longwood, near Orlando, who is in his first statewide race.
Mr. McCollum did gain attention as one of the House impeachment prosecutors who made the case for conviction of President Clinton before the Senate. And at one point he was expected to receive a lift from the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, brother of Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, and initially considered the solid favorite to lay claim to the state's 25 electoral votes. But the Bush campaign has had to fight hard to try to hold off a strong Florida effort by Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. McCollum concedes that he would have been helped had Mr. Bush led strongly throughout the race and then gone on to win here "by 10 or 12 points." But, he adds, he never planned to run on Mr. Bush's momentum.
"We're running our own race," he said. "We have to educate the voters on who I am," and on the difference between himself and Mr. Nelson.
"I believe in better government, not bigger government," Mr. McCollum continued. "He believes in bigger government, more taxation and control over people's lives."
Mr. Nelson readily acknowledges that he has been helped, and his opponent hurt, by Mr. Gore's good fortunes here.
"This was going to be a walk for Bush," Mr. Nelson said, and if that had happened, "I knew it was going to be difficult. It makes me a little more comfortable knowing Al Gore is doing so well."
Mr. Nelson said that his opponent had no choice but to paint him as "liberal, liberal, liberal" but that "that's not my record." At the same time, Mr. Nelson said, "he's trying to make himself into a raging moderate."
Television advertisements do show Mr. McCollum appealing to moderates, saying he is much closer than Mr. Nelson to their ideals.
Those commercials show the candidate tieless. "He's trying to portray a more casual image," Dario Moreno, a professor of political science at Florida International University, said of Mr. McCollum, whom voters have described as too stiff, too brittle, too judgmental.
The two combatants represented neighboring districts as young congressmen back in the 1980's, and voted alike more than half the time.
But by the time Mr. Nelson left the House in 1990 to run for governor, unsuccessfully, Mr. McCollum had long been compiling a solidly conservative record, and not just on social issues. As a member of a committee that investigated the Iran-contra affair, he found nothing wrong in the actions of the Reagan administration. He would go on to harshly criticize the Clinton administration's handling of the attack on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., and to vigorously seek the impeachment and removal of Mr. Clinton, an outcome that, polls found, a majority of Florida voters did not want.
"I played a role I was assigned," Mr. McCollum says now of his task as an impeachment prosecutor, "and I'm proud of the role I was assigned. Character, integrity and principles do matter."
But nether he nor Mr. Nelson has talked much about impeachment during the campaign; polls have also shown that people are tired of hearing about it.
Mr. Nelson and Mr. McCollum side with their parties' presidential nominees on most issues: the environment, the economy, education, abortion and more. Mr. McCollum backs Mr. Bush's plan to apply a big part of the federal budget surplus to a $1.3 trillion tax cut; Mr. Nelson favors a $500 billion cut similar to the one proposed by Mr. Gore.
Although both men say they like to talk about the issues, they spend a great deal of time talking about each other. Mr. McCollum has accused Mr. Nelson, as insurance commissioner, of allowing premiums in Florida to skyrocket in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, and Mr. Nelson has shot back, noting that an arbitration panel created by the Republican-controlled Legislature has final say on insurance-rate increases.
"Mr. McCollum's friends insist on an arbitration panel," Mr. Nelson said in a debate in Delray Beach, "and what they're doing is sticking it to the consumers."
And although talk of impeachment has been set aside, that is not to say Mr. Clinton's name never emerges. In recent e-mail to his supporters, Mr. McCollum wrote that "with the exception of Hillary's New York race, my defeat is Bill Clinton's highest political priority."
Mr. Clinton has in fact raised money for Mr. Nelson, and stumped for him against Mr. McCollum. Campaign experts say it is not personal. Just politics.

We're Not Responsible

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
However this election turns out, future historians are likely to see this as the year that America failed a big political test.
After decades of bipartisan irresponsibility, by the 1990's the United States had, miraculously, started to look like a grown-up nation -- a nation able to plan ahead, to take advantage of good times to prepare for the rainier days to come. But it was an illusion: We were, it turns out, just playing at being grown-up. 
 The basic rule of fiscal responsibility for a national government is pretty much the same as the rule for a family: Pay off your debts and build up financial reserves when things are good, so that you can draw on those reserves later. And these are the best of times for America's government, in at least three ways.
First, we are at peace, with no significant military rivals. You don't have to believe in a new cold war to think that things are unlikely to stay this easy, that one way or another defense spending will eventually have to rise from its current low.
Second, our demography is as good as it's going to be for the foreseeable future. The modern U.S. government is in large part in the business of insuring the income and medical expenses of older citizens. Starting just 10 years from now, the population eligible for Medicare and Social Security will start rising, and rising, and rising, with no end in sight. And so will the bills. If taxes on the diminishing fraction of our population that isn't retired are to stay tolerable, we'd better start saving now.
Finally, right now the U.S. economy -- and indirectly the federal budget -- benefits from the perception in the rest of the world that America is the place to invest your money. Huge inflows of foreign capital have been keeping U.S. interest rates down and stock prices up, both of which also keep the money flowing into federal coffers. Some economists think that these capital inflows, like the similar inflows into Asian nations before 1997, are only setting us up for a future crisis -- and I won't say that I'm not worried. But even without a crisis we know that foreigners (and American investors too) will eventually discover more opportunities outside the United States, that the inflows will someday become outflows, and that we will be sorry if we haven't prepared for that day.
So the responsible, sensible thing for the U.S. government to do is to run very big surpluses right now. Indeed, budget analysts who take the long view argue that even without the tax cuts and spending initiatives proposed by the presidential candidates we would not be running as large a surplus over the next decade as we should -- that if anything we should be raising taxes and cutting spending.
But how do you explain that long view to the public? The truth is that our leaders never really tried. Instead, even politicians who were trying to be responsible resorted to half-truths. All that business about putting Social Security and Medicare in "lockboxes" is an attempt to sell fiscal responsibility to the voters without really trying to explain why it is necessary. So maybe we should not be surprised that we have ended up with the worst of all worlds. On one side the public feels, correctly, that politicians like Al Gore, who use those half-truths to push for half-responsible policies, are talking down to them. On the other side the public feels, quite wrongly, that politicians like George W. Bush, who tell them that they can have their cake and eat it too, are men of the people.
Mr. Bush's willingness to trust in the public's innumeracy continues to boggle the mind. In the second debate he offered possibly the biggest misrepresentation yet, this time declaring about his tax plan that "most of tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder." (That sound you hear is the giggling of millionaires and the guffawing of multimillionaires.)
But the gleefulness of the crowds who picked up that Orwellian chant of "no fuzzy numbers" (Orwellian because what it really meant was "no clear numbers -- we don't want to know") suggests that this country just wasn't ready for the hard thinking that would have let us act responsibly. Maybe better politicians could have made a better case for the right policies. Or maybe the fault is not in our politicians but in ourselves.

HEADLINE: New Advice for Parents: Saying 'That's Great!' May Not Be

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: MONROE, Iowa

 BODY:
Five-year-old Cristina bounced up to her preschool teacher in this quiet Iowa farm town, waved her crayon drawing dotted with brightly colored stickers and asked, "What do you think of my picture?"
The teacher, Sharon Doolittle, looked enthusiastically, but was careful not to offer praise. 
 Instead, she said: "I see you drew a black wagon. What are you going to put in that black wagon?"
In a classroom in Moorpark, Calif., when the preschoolers successfully clean up the play kitchen, Jennifer Parker does not tell them, "good job," she said. "I say, 'I notice you put all of the dishes and all of the food back where it belongs. Next time you want to play with those, you'll be able to find them.' "
And in Manhattan, Fran Spector, a first-grade teacher at the Ethical Culture School, took a similar tack on a bus trip to the Central Park conservatory garden. After a couple of her students offered their seats to people who were standing, Ms. Spector said, "I did not say 'That was great.' I said, 'Did you notice how appreciative the people were?' "
For years, parents and teachers got the message that children should be praised at almost any opportunity, that saying "good job" for everything from sharing snacks to sliding down a slide raises self-esteem. Some guides said praise encouraged desirable behavior, like buckling a seat belt or cleaning one's room. Some schools displayed posters saying "Praise every child every day."
But in a sea change from the gestalt of recent decades, many educators and child psychologists are concluding that less praise is often better and frequent praise for unexceptional actions can actually have a negative impact on children.
"Praising every time lowers a child's motivation," said Dr. Ron Taffel, a Manhattan psychologist and author of "Nurturing Good Children Now." "It cheapens the praise, and children become dependent on praise."
For example, Dr. Taffel said, he sees children sledding in Central Park with parents "screaming at the top of their lungs: 'great job, phenomenal sledding, that was the best I've ever seen.' The children were being praised for responding to the laws of gravity."
Some child-rearing experts say a steady stream of praise can turn children into praise addicts who lack confidence because they dismiss the value of the compliments. They say praise intended to reinforce good behavior can make children feel manipulated and less likely to keep up good habits in the long run. And they say sometimes children praised for a creative or academic task become less motivated to pursue it, because they feel pressure or are afraid they will not live up to expectations.
"In the effort to help children feel good about themselves, parents will praise more than is appropriate," said Fretta Reitzes, director of the Goldman Center for Youth and Family at the 92nd Street Y.M.-Y.W.H.A., who thinks praise caught on partly because working mothers want their time with their children "to be full of smiles and hugs," she said. "Being a whole human being means having strengths, but also realizing that others may be better tennis players or better clarinetists. When kids begin to really experience their own frailty, parents are often disappointed -- 'What did I do wrong? I praised you and praised you. I told you you were wonderful and you're falling apart.' "
These experts do not advocate more criticism, and say genuine praise for noteworthy effort or accomplishment is good. But often, they say, it is better to give encouragement, offering descriptions or asking questions in a way that shows interest, yet allows children to judge themselves. Avoid praise that evaluates the child ("You're so smart") or injects the speaker ("I like the way you behaved").
"What is helpful is when something they've actually done is recognized and acknowledged -- and the particulars are mentioned," said Dr. Richard M. Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of Rochester. "Less good and even harmful is praise that feels to the child evaluative and controlling. If a parent says, 'I love the way your room is so clean right now,' it has this feeling like 'you're controlling me.' "
In addition to anecdotal experience, a smattering of studies suggest that children praised for doing well at something were less interested in pursuing it, or did less well at subsequent tasks. One study found that when science teachers gave less praise, children spent more time figuring out experiments on their own. Dr. Joan Grusec, a University of Toronto psychology professor, found that children praised for making charitable donations were less likely to be generous than children told that they seemed to like helping others, a descriptive response.
The shift toward less praise is related to the booming economy and tragedies like the Columbine massacre, said Sally Lee, editor in chief of Parents Magazine, which recently published an article on praise.
"In the last two or three years, there's a sense of let's start raising kids who are not so individualistic," Ms. Lee said. "In a bad economy, everyone wants to raise this Horatio Alger. Now we want to raise kids who are good citizens who will help people."
Ms. Lee said her own tendency to praise her daughter, 3, had become almost "a nervous tic: saying 'good job' when she went down the slide, when she picked herself up from the playground. So when I said 'good job' when she did something big like set the table by herself for the first time, I guess there wasn't much difference."
Alfie Kohn, an author and a strong critic of routine praise, calls it a "verbal doggie biscuit," similar to tangible rewards, like stickers or gold stars, which he considers disrespectful, manipulative and only temporarily effective.
Some psychologists and teachers disagree.
Dr. Barry Lubetkin, director of the Institute for Behavior Therapy in Manhattan, believes that while some parents overpraise, "most parents don't praise enough. Praise is extremely important in building up a sense of children's own abilities. For psychologists to suggest that you should limit praise really undermines the idea of how we encourage children to feel good about themselves."
Kim Hunt, a second-grade teacher in Des Moines, often praises children to convince others to behave, saying things like, "Oh, do I like the way Emily has already started solving those math problems. She's using her brain," Ms. Hunt said.
"Praise is almost a contagious virus in a classroom because if you can catch one child doing something good and if you can verbally praise that child in front of his or her peers, it's going to spread like wildfire and the rest of the children are going to automatically do exactly what that model student is doing because they want the positive attention," she said.
But proponents say substituting questions or descriptions for praise stimulates children to think, create and feel good about their own work.
"This recurring, high-octane level of praise sometimes gets in the way" of learning, said Teresa Rosegrant, a preschool teacher in Arlington, Va. Saying something like "I see you're figuring out how to turn the pieces to put that puzzle together," she said, encourages and motivates a child, while "allowing them to feel happy about their own accomplishments."
At Monroe Elementary School in this community about 30 miles southeast of Des Moines, some parents are impressed by Mrs. Doolittle's approach.
Renae Tool routinely praised her son Jacob because "you want to tell them they did a good job on everything," she said. But when he started preschool two years ago, she noticed he "would hurry through art projects. As soon as a buddy of his was done, he would just sort of scribble through or just paste it down."
What helped was that instead of praise, Mrs. Doolittle would say, "Jacob, is that your best work?" Mrs. Tool said.
"I really think after Jacob came here he had more self-confidence," said Mrs. Tool, who was so impressed she enrolled her daughter, Dani Sue, 5, and became a classroom aide.
Mrs. Tool is also glad Mrs. Doolittle rejects the school's practice of giving children yellow slips for good behavior and blue for bad, and was uncomfortable this year when Jacob's first grade teacher gave him a yellow slip praising him for playing with a disabled boy.
Some parents, however, have not been pleased.
Last year, Mrs. Doolittle said, a mother said her son's behavior problems were caused by Mrs. Doolittle's not praising him enough. He ultimately left the class.
And, Mrs. Doolittle said: "If we've had a really good day, I still resort to, probably more for the parents than the children, giving them a 'we had a good day' badge. If you never bring home any positive things, the parents start to wonder."

HEADLINE: Profit Declines at Bank One And Rises at Wells and Fleet

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company and the FleetBoston Financial Corporation posted third-quarter earnings yesterday that were in line with Wall Street estimates, while the Bank One Corporation, still reeling from problems with its credit unit and poor commercial loans, met reduced expectations despite a 37 percent drop in profit.
At Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, third-quarter profit rose 11 percent, to $1.07 billion, or 64 cents a share, from $962 million, or 57 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial.
The performance continued a string of solid results posted by Wells Fargo since its sale to Norwest in November 1998. As the largest bank based in the West, Wells Fargo continued to benefit from the region's economic boom, particularly in California.
Still, the bank's loan losses climbed during the quarter, but Wells Fargo said its volume of problem assets remained at levels below normal. In the third quarter, the bank wrote off $267 million in loans, a 9 percent increase compared with the period a year earlier.
Ross Kari, the chief financial officer, warned that loan losses would probably continue to climb in the next few months, but only by a small amount.
Shares of Wells Fargo fell $1.88, to $41.69.
FleetBoston Financial reported that its net income rose to $841 million, or 90 cents a share, from $711 million, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Excluding special items -- a gain for a divestiture and integration charges -- earnings were up 10 percent, to $782 million, or 84 cents a share. That was in line with analysts' estimates, according to First Call.
The company said profit was lifted by higher levels of capital markets and revenue from investment services.
Shares of Fleet fell $1.88, to $25.
Bank One, which is based in Chicago, reported its fourth consecutive quarterly decline as fees from its credit card unit fell and the company set aside more money to cover the possibility of bad loans. Net income was $581 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $925 million, or 79 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The earnings met analysts' estimates, according to First Call.
James Dimon, the company's chief executive, called the earnings performance unacceptable. But he said Bank One remained on target to reach its goal for the second half of this year and 2001.
Shares of Bank One fell $1.81, or more than 5 percent, to $32.81.

HEADLINE: Thomas Labrecque, 62, Dies; Ex-Chief of Chase Manhattan

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Thomas G. Labrecque, the former chairman and chief executive of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, died Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
Mr. Labrecque died of lung cancer, which was diagnosed in early September, a spokesman for his family said. He was 62 and lived in Fair Haven, N.J. 
 Mr. Labrecque joined Chase's management training program in 1964 and rose quickly through the ranks. In 1976, he was appointed to Chase's management committee, where, at age 38, he was 10 years younger than any other member. Mr. Labrecque also served at the request of David Rockefeller, then Chase's chief executive, on the committee to resolve New York City's fiscal crisis.
He was named president and chief operating officer of Chase in 1981.
By 1990, Chase was ailing from losses on loans to real estate developers and less-developed countries. Chase's board turned to Mr. Labrecque, naming him chairman and chief executive.
He sold underperforming businesses and increased the profits of such core areas as credit cards, trust and custody, and mortgage banking. But Chase's stock still lagged, prodding an activist shareholder, Michael F. Price, who then headed the Mutual Series mutual fund company, to purchase 6.1 percent of Chase in April 1995, and urge the bank to "increase shareholder value."
Four months later, the Chemical Bank Corporation announced an $11 billion merger with Chase. Mr. Price said yesterday that he appreciated Mr. Labrecque's abilities. "Of all the companies we've ever invested in, he was by far the best C.E.O.," Mr. Price said.
Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, which advised Chase on its merger with Chemical, said: "He probably doesn't get enough credit for turning the bank around. He put Chase in a position where it could attract a strong partner."
As part of the merger agreement, Mr. Labrecque relinquished the top spot of chairman and chief executive to Chemical's chairman and chief executive, Walter V. Shipley. Mr. Labrecque took the No. 2 position of president and chief operating officer of the combined company, which took the Chase name. Nor did the merger agreement provide for Mr. Labrecque to succeed Mr. Shipley.
"There were other possible partners at that time where he could have been guaranteed succession," Mr. Cohen said of Mr. Labrecque. "He did what was best for the bank."
Unlike many executives who vacate the top slot after a merger, Mr. Labrecque stuck around, and not merely as a figurehead. During the financial crisis in the fall of 1998, he was the bank's main person in coping with Russia's loan default. He also represented Chase in negotiations to restructure the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.
Mr. Labrecque was known for his quiet competence and modesty, traits that may have led him to be underappreciated by Wall Street. He was also noted for his patrician good looks and appropriate traits at a bank that was for years controlled by the Rockefeller family. But in fact, he came from humbler beginnings.
Mr. Labrecque was born on Sept. 17, 1938, in Long Branch, N.J. He was the third of eight children born to New Jersey Superior Court Judge Theodore J. Labrecque, who was of French Canadian descent. Mr. Labrecque graduated from Villanova University in 1960. He attended the Graduate School of Business at American University and the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration.
Mr. Labrecque spent four years in the United States Navy, rising to the rank of full lieutenant. He served on a destroyer at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 1960 and in the Mediterranean and the Baltic during the building of the Berlin Wall. During the Cuban missile crisis, he headed a section of the Office of Naval Intelligence, deploying ships in the blockade off Cuba.
After his retirement from Chase in June 1999, Mr. Labrecque served as chairman of Chase's International Advisory Council. He also served on the board of trustees of the University of Notre Dame. Mr. Labrecque was a director of Pfizer Inc. and Delphi Automotive Systems and a trustee of the Hospital for Special Surgery.
He is survived by his wife, Sheila; four children, Thomas Jr., Douglas, Karen Shea and Barbara Corbin; five grandchildren; three brothers; and four sisters.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
CAMPAIGN BRIEFING

BYLINE: Compiled by B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

 BODY:

THE GREEN PARTY
 
SHUNNED CANDIDATE SPEAKS OUT -- Just as Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, was not permitted to join the two major-party candidates in last night's presidential debate in Missouri, so Jeff Gates, also a Green Party candidate, was not permitted to join the two major-party candidates in the Senate debate in Georgia on Monday.
But unlike Mr. Nader, Mr. Gates decided not merely to grumble and sue.
At the beginning of the debate in Albany between Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, and former Senator Mack Mattingly, a Republican, Mr. Gates stood up and demanded to be included, shouting: "This is what democracy looks like. This is what democracy feels like."
The outburst, broadcast on statewide television, prompted a police officer to handcuff Mr. Gates and hustle him out of Albany Municipal Auditorium. He was charged with disorderly conduct and spent much of the rest of the night in jail before being released after posting a $181 bond. David Firestone (NYT)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY POLITICS -- Both parties have aggressively courted the computer industry this year, with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman arguing that they are the ticket with the best understanding of the new, high-technology economy and its needs. Mr. Gore even took some controversial credit at one point for helping develop the Internet.
Whatever the case, he and Mr. Lieberman got some solid support yesterday when 400 of the industry's leaders endorsed them.
"I wouldn't be here without Al Gore having done everything he's done in the last 25 years," said one of the most prominent in the group, Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT)
 
THE BALLOT QUESTIONS
 
DEVELOPMENT ON COLORADO BALLOT -- Among all the choices Colorado voters have next month, nothing has stirred passions more than a ballot initiative that would require local governments to put development plans before voters each year.
Recent polls show that a majority of Coloradans favor the measure. But record amounts of money are pouring in to fight it, with the opposition group, Coloradans for Responsible Reform, raising $5.1 million. That is more than eight times the $633,000 that initiative supporters have raised.
The bankers, builders and real estate developers who oppose the initiative say it would curb the supply of affordable housing units and stunt a booming economy. But the Sierra Club and other environmental groups contend that without stricter oversight, new development will overwhelm roads, schools and other government services. Michael Janofsky (NYT)
 
THE ELECTORATE
 
THE VOTERS ARE CHATTING -- Maybe the voters have not really vanished. Maybe they were just a bit slow to take interest.
Harvard University's Vanishing Voter research project, which seeks to understand how to get more of the American electorate involved in politics, got some encouraging results in its latest poll, conducted last week. Nearly half of adults reported having discussed the campaign with someone within the past 24 hours.
The project had previously found that, on average, only about 22 percent of adults said they had talked with someone about the campaign within the past 24 hours. But once the presidential debates started, that figure quickly more than doubled. Carey Goldberg (NYT)

HEADLINE: Resolved: That High School Debate Is Back

BYLINE: By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
Standing at a school desk, wearing shiny high-heel boots, Stacey Martin, 17 years old, rapped her fist on the table, looked straight into the judge's eyes and spoke with the aplomb of a seasoned lawyer and the dizzying speed of an auctioneer.
The words flowed in rapid-fire succession -- drug use, suspicion, probable cause -- but they were part of a coherent, well-researched argument. She and her teammate at a national-level tournament at the Bronx High School of Science last weekend were arguing in favor of the United States Coast Guard's participation in the war on drugs. 
 High school debate teams like Ms. Martin's, which won several rounds before being eliminated last weekend, have long trained the nation's elite in critical thinking and public presentation. Although aides to Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who debated on national television last night, said the candidates had not been on their high school teams, many politicians and public speakers cut their oratorical teeth in high school tournaments.
But in the early 1980's, as urban schools faced budget cuts, debate teams were one of the first casualties. By the 1990's, only four public schools in New York City had teams, and only two -- Stuyvesant and Bronx High School of Science -- competed in policy debate, the most rigorous form.
But in New York and other big cities, debate is making a comeback, and its newest participants are coming from nontraditional quarters. With long hours of research and often prohibitive entry fees for competitions, debate was for many years a bastion of financially comfortable white males. But in New York City, debaters are as likely to be low-income, nonwhite and female. Ms. Martin, who was raised by a single mother after her father died, attends Franklin K. Lane High School, a largely black and Hispanic school in Woodhaven, Queens, where 43 percent of students receive free lunches and 39 percent graduate in four years.
Franklin K. Lane, Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, Wadleigh Secondary School in Harlem, Ralph McKee Vocational High School in Staten Island and the High School for Legal Studies in Brooklyn are among 34 New York City public high schools that recently started debate teams. All are members of the Urban Debate League, a pilot program financed by George Soros's Open Society Institute to help introduce debate into inner-city public schools.
The program, which is based on a similar one in Atlanta, started its first teams in New York City in 1997 and has since branched out to 12 cities. Of a $2 million annual budget, about $500,000 goes to New York schools.
Coming in, the students knew little about debate. Some were lured by the prospect of travel; one freshman said he attended his first meeting after a scary-looking older student cornered him and ordered him to go. One attraction was the prospect of challenging top-level schools to do intellectual battle.
"We went to New York and said, 'Before the year is out you will have beaten Bronx Science or Stuyvesant at least once,' " said Melissa Maxcy Wade, who founded the original Atlanta league and is director of forensics at Emory University there.
That happened the second semester. By the second year, an Urban Debate League school, Grace H. Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx, was the junior varsity state champion. Last year, Franklin K. Lane High School came in third all around in the state, with the fourth and fifth positions also taken by Urban Debate League schools.
"Once that happens, the self-esteem they get, you can't buy that in a store," Ms. Wade said. "Because these kids are basically led to believe they cannot compete with those schools."
Urban Debate League debaters have also seen their grades rise and discipline problems fall. Many report an increased sense of confidence, an ease with the world beyond the neighborhoods they grew up in.
"You get familiarized with what's going on in your society," said Daymean Lewis, 15, a member of Lane's junior varsity team. "And you just get this tone in your voice, you feel more forceful, that you can do anything." Many league debaters say they would like to use their debate skills to become lawyers or teachers.
For some, public speaking comes naturally. "In the African-American tradition, oratory is taught in the church," Ms. Wade noted. "You're supposed to be eloquent; your job is to be Martin Luther King." As a result, she said, "kids can speak well, but they're content-light." So coaches focus on research skills as well as teaching the foreign language of argumentation.
The league teaches the most difficult form of debate, policy debate, which draws on fields like history, politics, economics and science. Policy debaters nationwide focus on a different topic each year. This year it is privacy, with students tackling issues like Internet privacy and a favorite of the presidential candidates: racial profiling.
Some students drop out, daunted by the hours of research and meticulous organization of evidence into wash-basin-size plastic tubs that have to be lugged to each tournament. But for those who stay, the payoffs are many. Socially, they say they are more confident, and many find themselves resolving personal conflicts through logic and argument rather than force.
Debate helps with schoolwork, too. "I've learned a lot of big words lately," said Julia Monegro, a Lane student who immigrated from the Dominican Republic 5 years ago and had failed two classes before she started debating. "I got a 91 on my report card in English, and I'm not that good at it."
Ms. Wade credits the Internet with opening debate to less affluent students who can now do the needed research. "Computers have been a profound way to level the playing field," she said. So have scholarships for intensive summer training programs, which can run $3,000 to $4,000 for a 3-week session.
By senior year, many urban debaters are hotly pursued by universities. "I have college coaches coming up to me, saying, 'Who's graduating?' " said the Lane coach, Shawn Robertson, who is also an English teacher at the school. Noting that past students have gone on to Middlebury, Brandeis and State University of New York at Stony Brook, he said, "It's a good feeling as a coach to know that your students are wanted."
It also feels good, he added, "to see students go from concerns about their sneakers to concerns about 'Is this missile defense something we should do?' "
League debaters are not the only beneficiaries. When tournaments and camps throw together the affluent with less affluent, both sides learn, Ms. Wade said.
Ms. Martin recalled students she met at a debate camp at Northwestern University last summer. "They tried to do things that they thought we would like," she said. "One girl, because I'm black, she thought I'd like rap. I said 'Blink 182's cool,' " referring to a white alternative rock band, "and she's like 'Oh my God, you like Blink 182?' "
Ms. Martin's teammate, Patricia Socorro, said interactions with suburban students had opened her mind. "The way I used to think about them and they used to think about me, once you get together, that's abolished," she said. "At first I thought, 'they're so snotty.' But they weren't snotty, they were cool."
Rafael Bruno, 14, recently spent his first night away from home when local debaters' families in suburban Monticello, N.Y., played host to the team. "I was scared," he admitted. "There was nothing but forest around there." But after his host started asking him about how debate works, he said, he forgot his fears.
"Debate is like a link to different places," he explained. "Half my family didn't graduate high school. I don't want to take the easy way; I wanted to take the hard way."

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Beats Lowered Expectations

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the maker of earth-moving equipment, said today that its third-quarter profit narrowly beat recently lowered estimates after softness in important markets, higher costs and unfavorable currency translations took their toll.
Caterpillar said it expected revenue in 2000 and 2001 to rise 2 to 7 percent. Further increases in United States interest rates could, however, threaten that outlook. 
 "At the moment, we do not have anything plugged in for continued increases in interest rates, so you could say there would be a risk if rates started to rise again," Caterpillar's chief financial officer, F. Lynn McFeeters, said in an interview.
The company, which warned analysts two weeks ago that it would not meet third-quarter profit forecasts, said it earned $216 million, or 62 cents a share, on revenue of $4.78 billion in the latest quarter. That compares with $219 million, or 61 cents, on revenue of $4.72 billion in the period a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial, expected profit of 58cents a share. Analysts cut their estimates by 10 cents after the company issued its warning.

HEADLINE: Transportation Bond Act Gets Mixed Reviews From Fiscal Watchdog Groups

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
New York City's two most influential fiscal watchdog groups gave contrasting reviews yesterday on the $3.8 billion transportation bond act on the state's Nov. 7 ballot.
The separate reports, by the city-financed Independent Budget Office and the private Citizens Budget Commission, said the borrowing proposal would provide city residents with a windfall in transit financing, but would also push the state's debt load dangerously high. While the budget office took no position, it pointed out financial advantages for city residents. The commission, on the other hand, recommended voters reject the bond issue. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave the bond act a lukewarm endorsement last week, but it has been condemned by other officials, including the Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, who say it provides too few specifics on how the money would be spent.
If approved, the act would authorize state officials to raise $3.8 billion through general obligation bonds, with the proceeds to be divided almost evenly between state highway and bridge projects and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The money dedicated to the M.T.A. would reduce the amount of the agency's own borrowing, and would pay for several subway and commuter rail projects, including engineering work on the proposed Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.
The report yesterday by Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of city government that was created in 1996, said taxpayers in the city would pay 40 percent of the debt payments on the state bonds, but would directly benefit from 44 percent of the transportation projects that would be financed.
The Independent Budget Office estimated that city residents would pay 48 percent of the debt payments if the bond act is defeated.
The Independent Budget Office estimated that city residents would pay 48 percent of the debt payments if the bond act is defeated and the debt payments are assumed by the M.T.A. and the State Department of Transportation.
Although the Citizens Budget Commission did not provide detailed analysis of how money would be distributed under the bond act, it said voters should reject it on principle, citing what it called a "danger zone" in debt financing. It said the debts of both the city and state had more than doubled since 1990, and recommended that the state reduce its level of borrowing.
"It is often assumed that if government is not in danger of defaulting on its debt, then its debt is not too large," said Charles Brecher, the group's research director. "A jurisdiction's debt level, however, has a great impact on its competitiveness."
In an interview, Ronnie Lowenstein, the chief economist for the Independent Budget Office, said, "There is no question that the biggest reason to vote against the act would be concern over the state's debt position."
But if the act is rejected, she said, alternative financing would probably not be found for all the transportation improvements now contemplated by city and state agencies.
Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the Independent Budget Office's report "misses the point" in its comparison of benefits for city and state residents.
She added that "city taxpayers should be as worried as any other taxpayers in the state about a debt level that is just too high."

 BODY:

BLAME FOR HIGH BILLS -- A consultant to the Independent System Operator, a group that administers the wholesale energy markets in New York State, yesterday attributed much of the summer increase in electricity prices in the metropolitan area to the shutdown of a Con Edison generating plant. The consultant, David B. Patton of Capital Economics, challenged Con Edison's position that much of the increase resulted from the group's rules, which discourage economical imports of electricity. Mr. Patton said the shutdown of the Indian Point 2 power plant after an accident in February forced Con Ed to buy more expensive replacement power. A Con Ed spokesman, Joseph Petta, said the utility stood by its position. Joseph P. Fried (NYT) 

HEALTH CARE SPENDING RISES -- New York State had 6.7 percent of the nation's population in 1998 but 8.4 percent of its personal health care spending, a study by the state Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans says. The study, released Monday, said part of the difference could be attributed to nonresidents' coming into the state for health care services. The study found that per capita health care spending in New York rose to $4,720 in 1998 from $2,454 in 1988, a 92 percent increase, compared with a nationwide rise to $3,760 from $2,033, an 85 percent increase. Hospital care accounted for 35 percent of such spending in New York in 1998, the largest slice, while the services of doctors and other professionals accounted for 22 percent. Joseph P. Fried (NYT)
 
REFUNDS COMING -- Verizon Communications has agreed to reimburse $1.5 million to 34,000 long-distance customers in New York State and pay $250,000 to the government under a consent decree. In March, the company and the Federal Communications Commission investigated the improper handling of electronic records used to confirm that a consumer has asked to switch long-distance carriers. They found that in some cases, a third party used to verify orders was given incorrect information by the Verizon representative or entered wrong information into its databases. Verizon said it would reimburse the customers for calls made while it dealt with its record-keeping errors. (AP)

HEADLINE: Pataki Says a Tax Increase Is No Way to Help Nassau

BYLINE: By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, who in May offered a state bailout to help Nassau County out of its fiscal crisis, yesterday criticized Nassau Democrats' plans to raise the county portion of municipal property tax bills by 16.3 percent next year.
"I think a massive property tax increase is clearly the wrong way to go," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in the Capitol in Albany. "The state didn't come in to help Nassau County so that it could continue to spend too much and to tax too much; that is not the goal. I certainly would be personally opposed to any significant property tax increase." 
 But Mr. Pataki said he would reserve final judgment until the state board overseeing the bailout plan gave its opinion on the Democrats' tax proposal, part of its plan to balance the books through 2004.
His fellow Republican, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who has the power to veto any tax increase, said yesterday that the 16.3 percent figure proposed by the Democrats who control the County Legislature was too high. But he said he was willing to work with the Democrats before deciding whether to veto any part of their proposed budget.
Yesterday, the Democrats submitted a draft of their budget and a financial plan for the next three years to the state oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, and said that they, too, would heed the board before voting on the budget tomorrow.
In the meantime, they revealed other details about their plans, saying they would try to repair what they called years of financial mismanagement by raising $95 million in additional county property taxes on houses and businesses next year while cutting spending by about $145 million.
The Democrats said they would raise the county's share of the property tax -- which makes up just 19 percent of the overall property tax bill -- by 16.3 percent next year. That includes a 3.8 percent rise in taxes that Mr. Gulotta included in his 2001 budget proposal last month after years of resisting even minimal tax increases that would have kept pace with the rate of inflation.
For the average household, which now pays $1,050 annually in county property taxes, the tax increase would add $165 a year to the cost of living in one of the most expensive places in the nation.
The Democrats have accepted Mr. Gulotta's proposal for 3 percent property tax increases in each year from 2002 through 2004.
Aides to Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the legislature's presiding officer, said the 2001 budget totals $2.23 billion, slightly higher than the $2.21 billion budget proposed a month ago by Mr. Gulotta and slightly less than last year's adopted budget.
They also said the Democrats' budget would produce an $18.9 million surplus next year.
"The plan presented today sets forth a framework for Nassau County to emerge from a broken, fiscally mismanaged county into a vibrant, healthy county," Ms. Jacobs said. "We believe that in this time of World Series time, we have hit a home run with this budget."
She said she planned to brief Mr. Gulotta and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, yesterday on the budget, but added that the plan could still be modified after all sides, including the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, weigh in. The board expects to receive a separate budget plan from Mr. Schmitt by today.
In May, Mr. Pataki offered the county $100 million in aid and a restructuring of its crushing $2.6 billion debt if it cut hundreds of millions of dollars in costs through 2004.
Mr. Pataki said then that the county's financial problems could be resolved without a tax increase. Democrats agreed, until a projected shortfall of $233 million for 2001 grew by $66 million early last month and $19 million in unanticipated borrowing costs came to light in recent weeks. The governor's comments yesterday came in response to a reporter's question about the size of the proposed tax increase.
Mr. Gulotta said the proposed tax increase greatly exceeded the amount the county's 1.3 million residents should be asked to shoulder, even as the county teeters on the brink of bankruptcy and faces the threat of losing day-to-day fiscal authority to the state board.
"I submitted my budget on Sept. 15 and they have reviewed it backwards and forwards and inside out," Mr. Gulotta said of the Democrats. "They have critiqued it and commented on it, and here we are two days before NIFA expects a consensus document, and for the first time I have received the proposal of the Democratic majority. That is not right."
Although Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the state board, has warned the various factions of county government for weeks to drop the political bickering and work together, the bitterness and blame among them seemed only to intensify yesterday.
Mr. Gulotta said the Democrats had planned an even higher tax increase, citing a public notice they placed in Newsday that says their budget includes a 40 percent county property tax increase and a $184 million increase in overall spending. But Darren S. Bloch, the chief of staff to the Democratic lawmakers, said Mr. Gulotta was "completely misleading the public." He said such public notices have traditionally inflated the budget figures to allow room for possible increases in taxes and spending. He said the final budgets never come close to those figures.
Phoebe B. Goodman, the executive director of the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee and a longtime county budget critic, said she found the tax increase proposal refreshing. She said the Republicans' refusal to increase taxes incrementally in the past contributed to the county's current problems.
"I think it is probably realistic," Ms. Goodman said. "I assume it is more realistic than either Gulotta or the legislative Republicans trying to balance the budget without a tax increase. Sooner or later, you have to raise taxes; there is an increased cost of living. I just wish they had all come to agreement on a budget."

HEADLINE: Firestone Announces Production Cutbacks in 3 Plants and Layoffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Acknowledging that sales had fallen after reports of more than 100 deaths linked to the failure of Firestone tires now being recalled, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced today that it would lay off indefinitely 450 workers at its factory in Decatur, Ill., and would close the Decatur factory and two other plants for two to four weeks.
The Decatur factory has produced tires with some of the highest failure rates, according to the Ford Motor Company and Firestone. Today's layoffs amount to a quarter of the factory's work force. 
 While Firestone's parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, mentioned last month the possibility of closing the Decatur factory, John Lampe, Firestone's new chairman and chief executive, said today that the company had no plans to do so. But Mr. Lampe also raised the prospect today of further retrenchment if demand continued to erode, although he did not provide specifics.
"We will continue to inform our people at the earliest possible time if further cutbacks are necessary," he said.
Mr. Lampe said that although sales of Firestone-brand tires to automakers remained strong, sales of Firestone replacement tires to consumers had dropped. He declined to provide figures. Mr. Lampe said that the company was reducing its overall production by a fifth for the next two months, even though Firestone-brand tires only account for half the company's sales.
Firestone also sells Bridgestone tires, which go mainly on Japanese-brand automobiles, and other brands.
Firestone's inventory of unsold tires is 50 percent larger than usual now, partly because of the slower sales but also because the company stockpiled tires this summer in preparation for a possible strike by union workers that did not take place, Mr. Lampe said. In addition, the company has found itself with large numbers of tires in smaller sizes as more Americans choose vehicles that use larger tires.
The three factories cutting back production -- the Decatur factory plus factories in La Vergne, Tenn., and in Oklahoma City -- make a high proportion of Firestone-brand tires and tires in smaller sizes and had particularly large inventories accumulated before a labor agreement was reached on Sept. 4, Mr. Lampe said. All three factories will be closed for the second half of December, and the Oklahoma City and La Vergne factories will also be closed from Oct. 29 to Nov. 11.
Laid-off workers and workers furloughed for two to four weeks will be entitled to unemployment benefits. Unionized workers with at least two years of seniority will receive additional payments from the company for up to 6 to 12 months, raising their overall benefits to 80 percent of previous income.
Ford and Firestone dealers have been besieged by angry Ford Explorer owners, many of whom have been unable to find replacements for their tires since the recall was announced on Aug. 9. But Mr. Lampe said that Firestone and other tire makers had replaced 4.2 million of the 6.5 million recalled tires, and he predicted that all of the tires would be replaced by the end of next month. Firestone's production of replacement tires will not be affected by today's announcement, because most of the production is taking place at other factories, Mr. Lampe said.
Stephen Garman, the city manager in Decatur, said that many of the laid-off workers should be able to find other jobs, although some might not have skills that closely match the available openings. The local economy is at full employment and the city has just hired an advertising firm to try to attract people from other cities to fill vacancies in a wide range of occupations, he said.
"Our economy is in a position to absorb a great number of these employees," Mr. Garman said. "If you're going to have this kind of problem, now is the time to have it."
The layoffs and reductions in production came as regulators continued to be flooded with complaints about the recalled 15-inch Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that it had received more than 3,500 complaints linking the tires to 119 deaths and more than 500 injuries.
The previous time the agency provided figures on complaints, on Sept. 19, there were 2,200 complaints involving 103 deaths and more than 400 injuries. But the agency subsequently said that two of those deaths were a German shepherd dog and a black Persian cat, not people.
The agency, which is part of the Department of Transportation, accepts complaints from the public, lawyers and law enforcement officials but does little to check their veracity. Instead, regulators are focusing now on an engineering analysis of the tires to learn why they are failing, an agency official said.
The traffic safety agency recently opened a separate investigation into Firestone Steeltex tires after receiving 169 complaints about them, involving two deaths. The Steeltex tires are mounted on the largest sport utility vehicles and pickups, notably the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban.
An expert retained by Firestone to seek the cause of the problem, Sanjay Govindjee, said in a letter released by the company on Monday night that he was focusing on the materials that Firestone had used. The steel-belted tires slowly develop cracks inside between the rubber and the steel belts, and eventually fail as a result, he said.

HEADLINE: A High-Technology Festival Takes a High-Anxiety Turn

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 17

 BODY:
This year's theme for Agenda, a computer industry conference that annually draws some of high technology's best and brightest, is supposed to be "Who's got the juice?"
But for most participants, caught in the dreadful stock market downturn of an industry once thought to be the shining symbol of a long economic boom, the theme has instead become "Where did the juice go?" 
 The confusion and rancor has been evident in remarks by executives who were once the darlings of Wall Street and now feel under siege.
In the past, the conference has been a setting for the likes of William H. Gates of Microsoft, Steven P. Jobs of Apple Computer, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems and Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle to lay out broad and sometimes contentious visions of computing's future.
But this year, with many of the brightest Internet stocks down 50 percent or more from their highs a year ago -- and some e-commerce stocks off 90 percent -- the mood has been unusually subdued.
There was more bad news today, as Intel reported earnings and forecast a relatively soft holiday season, and I.B.M. told of a revenue shortfall. Pages C14 and C8.
And among the computer industry and Internet executives, venture capitalists and industry analysts at the conference here, there has been a sobering realization that the heady times of the past half-decade might not return any time soon.
"For many of these people, this is welcome to the N.F.L.," said John Shoch, an experienced venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif. "People are getting hurt and getting carried off the field, when many of them thought they were playing touch football."
In a keynote address to the invitation-only gathering of 400 executives this morning, Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, acknowledged that the downturn had hurt Microsoft's ability to keep some of its best programmers.
"I think the big problem is not where stock prices are," he said. "The big problem, from an employee perspective, is where stock prices were."
But for the software giant, whose stock peaked just short of $120 at the end of last year and now hovers around $50, the chastened Internet economy also holds a bit of good news. "I think that some of the mentality that existed six months ago," Mr. Ballmer said, "that said every start-up is going to be an I.P.O. and every start-up is going to have a minimum market cap of $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion -- I think some of that mentality is gone, which is good."
The changing mentality has definitely altered the landscape for Microsoft, which not long ago was one of Wall Street's gold standards, eagerly sought after as one of the two or three fixtures of the high-technology firmament.
That was underscored this morning in the announcement that Microsoft and Intel had fallen from the top 10 holdings of the nation's largest actively managed mutual fund, Fidelity Magellan, in the third quarter. On Monday alone, Microsoft's stock was off 6 percent, and Intel's almost 12 percent.
Intel's chief executive, Craig R. Barrett, was among those speaking at the conference here. But in an unusual reflection of the markets' sensitivity, he kept his remarks off the record, citing the company's impending earnings report.
Even executives of companies that have largely survived the downturn unscathed, like Sun, joked nervously that they were adjusting their strategies to allow for the steep declines of Internet and electronic commerce start-ups.
"We used to say we were the dot in dot-com," said Edward J. Zander, the president and chief operating officer of Sun. "Now we say we're the 'o' in the old economy."
For industry veterans like Steve Kirsch, who founded his first successful company in 1981 and more recently created Infoseek, an early Internet highflier, the rapid shift has created a new more charged atmosphere that is a painful shift from the go-go days of last fall.
"The downturn creates this tension in which people are asking, 'Am I going to be next?' " he said.
What was particularly troubling, he said, was that he knew of e-commerce companies that had doubled revenue month over month from $500,000 to $1 million but had nonetheless had been cut off by venture capitalists unwilling to continue to sustain losses over a long period.
"The pace has clearly slowed," said Richard A. Shaffer, a computer industry analyst at Technologic Partners, where he follows the venture capital industry. "I don't think there is fear and loathing, but there is growing concern that good companies may need private capital for quite a while."
In one panel discussion today, a group of leading Wall Street technology analysts squirmed on stage while their past recommendations were called into question.
Henry Blodgett, a Merrill Lynch analyst who made his name as one of the first Wall Street analysts to discover Amazon.com, defended his forecasts. "It's been awesome value creation," he said. "The only anomaly has been late 1999 and the first quarter of 2000."
At the same time, there was general uncertainty about where the downturn might end. "I don't know where the bottom is," said David Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment firm. "We need some stability to regain some confidence."
There were other signs of a slowdown in the hallways here this year. "This is the first year in some time I've been able to use a pay phone," said one executive, noting that in the past so many deals were being made that the phone banks were thronged.
Still, several venture capitalists attending the conference pointed out that the so-called Internet bubble applied most closely to the e-commerce market and that there were still technology segments -- they pointed today to wireless broadband and optical networking -- that were hot.
Indeed, the popular world view here seemed to be of a wave theory -- with another crest still ahead -- rather than of a bubble bursting. And many attendees said they still saw a lot of technology innovation just over the horizon.
At the same time they acknowledged that a growing atmosphere of caution was the order of the day, at least in the short run.
For example, Stewart Alsop, a partner at New Enterprise Associates in Menlo Park, Calif., said that although his firm had just closed a $2.2 billion investment round, the largest early-round investment fund ever raised, the partners had decided at a recent meeting to go slow in their investment strategy.
"We plan to wait three or four months because of all of the market turbulence," he said.
Still, Mr. Alsop insisted that he remained a big believer in the future of the Internet. "This is an immutable thing," he said. "There are still plenty of multibillion-dollar firms left in our future."

HEADLINE: The Final Presidential Debate

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush dropped the pleasantries of their previous debate last night and held their most spirited confrontation to date while outlining their disagreements over tax cuts, health care, schools, campaign finance and other subjects. Taking questions this time before a "town meeting" audience, both the candidates put in vigorous performances, but it was Mr. Gore who dominated their exchanges. He offered a tighter, more cogent presentation of his policies and for the first time in weeks recaptured some of the passion of his Democratic convention speech. The Texas governor responded by promising to bring a new tone of bipartisan cooperation to Washington, but he seemed less at ease than in last week's debate in engaging the budgetary and legislative details laid out by Mr. Gore.
Though most opinion polls show a close race, Mr. Bush has been running ahead of Mr. Gore in recent days. The difference has been magnified by their recent demeanor, with Mr. Bush looking more confident on the campaign trail and Mr. Gore seeming tentative and off his game. Last night, however, Mr. Gore dropped the almost phlegmatic manner he adopted last week, paced the large stage area and repeatedly challenged the governor directly with his answers. "All right, here we go again," he said before dissecting Mr. Bush's first answer on drug prices, and that set the style for an evening marked by Mr. Bush's complaints that Mr. Gore was not following the debate ground rules. 
 On education, Mr. Gore dismissed the governor's proposals for testing with a wave of the hand and added that Mr. Bush's voucher plan would drain the public schools. On health care, he pointed at Mr. Bush and declared that if the voters wanted a program embraced by the drug companies, "this is your man." Mr. Bush answered those thrusts with thematic responses depicting Mr. Gore as an exponent of big government. "If this were a spending contest," he said, "I'd come in second."
Over all, however, Mr. Gore was the aggressor and pace-setter. After last week's much-criticized performance he seemed willing, almost eager, to risk the possibility of some people's finding him unlikable. By being less reluctant to unleash a torrent of facts he seemed to throw Mr. Bush off balance, though the governor closed with a well-formed argument for sending a change agent to Washington.
Mr. Bush's principal theme once again was that the vice president wanted to exploit issues for political gain rather than solve problems. He played down the policy differences between their two health plans, saying simply that the real "difference is that I can get it done." But for the first time in their debates, Mr. Gore dwelled on the economic accomplishments of the last eight years and invited voters to ponder the risks of changing leadership.
The contrast between the two candidates on tax policy was especially sharp in an exchange over the estate tax. Mr. Gore said he favored removing the tax for most farm families and small businesses, but not the most wealthy. Mr. Bush was forced to argue for fairness for the very rich, and accused Mr. Gore of leaving 50 million Americans with no tax relief. Even on the issues of violence, pornography in popular culture and the death penalty -- traditional issues for Republicans -- Mr. Gore was more muscular in his response than Mr. Bush, who looked awkward when he gave a defensive answer about whether he was excessively keen on imposing the death penalty.
 It may take several days before voters evolve a firm sense of who won the debate, but Mr. Gore's forces were sure to be energized by his return to form. He laid the groundwork for a final campaign push on the issue of Social Security by getting Mr. Bush to acknowledge that the $1 trillion program for private investment accounts for young working people would be taken from the Social Security surplus in coming years. The vice president is sure to keep the issue alive by charging that this money will not then be available for future retirees.
But the biggest contrast could be seen in the way each candidate addressed the issue of trust. For Mr. Bush, trust was a question of who could end the bickering in Washington. Mr. Gore's more potent formulation was that Americans could trust him to "fight for you" against special interests. The next three weeks will determine which choice is preferred by voters.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
Big Spender, Bush Cries; Big Miser, Gore Counters

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush tried to paint Vice President Al Gore tonight as a traditional big-spending Democrat whose proposals would lead to a bigger, more intrusive federal government.
Mr. Gore's spending plans, Mr. Bush asserted, are far bigger than anything proposed by President Clinton when he was running for office, and put even Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis to shame. 
 As is often the case when it comes to fiscal policy, there are different ways of evaluating Mr. Bush's claims. Looking at it one way, Mr. Bush has a point. Looking at it another way, Mr. Gore's response that government would actually shrink under his leadership is also credible.
Campaigning against big government has long been a staple of conservative politics. Whether it still works in an era when the government expects to enjoy huge and growing budget surpluses for years is an open question.
"This is a big spender," Mr. Bush said of his rival, "and he ought to be proud of it."
Using his own figures, Mr. Gore has proposed about $1 trillion in new spending over the next decade. By the Bush campaign's estimate, Mr. Clinton's spending proposals when he first ran for president amounted to $800 billion over 10 years.
But Mr. Clinton was running when the federal budget deficit was hitting a record high, and both parties were constrained from proposing new programs. Mr. Gore is running against a backdrop of surpluses outside the Social Security system projected to be $2.2 trillion in the next decade.
In any case, Mr. Gore suggested that the better way to look at spending levels was relative to the size of the total economy. By that measure, he said, his proposals would put spending on a track that would leave it at its lowest level in 50 years.
His campaign said that by 2008, government outlays would be 17 percent of the gross domestic product, the lowest level since 1956 and down from 18.7 percent this year.
Mr. Gore also said that under the Clinton administration, civilian government employment had fallen by 300,000. The number is actually closer to 400,000. But according to figures in the administration's most recent budget documents, most of the reduction -- 286,000 -- has come from the Pentagon, and is associated with the slimming of the military following the end of the cold war.
"Absolutely not," Mr. Gore replied when asked whether he was a big spender.
The debate over spending tonight was part of the campaign-long debate over how best to allocate the projected surpluses. Mr. Gore pressed his attack that Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan would leave little or no money for other priorities, including increased financing for education.
"Because the governor has all this money for a tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else," Mr. Gore said.
Moreover, Mr. Gore said, Mr. Bush would not allocate as much money as he would to paying off the national debt. Mr. Gore has pledged to pay off the $3.4 trillion debt in a dozen years.
Mr. Bush said his tax cut would benefit the wealthy, since they pay the most taxes. But he said lower- and middle-income people would get proportionately more, a claim that is correct in percentage terms but not in dollar terms. And he suggested that the alternative to sending excess revenues back to taxpayers was to unleash a flood of new spending.
"If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second," Mr. Bush said. "I readily admit, I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
Exchanges Between the Candidates in the Third Presidential Debate

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the presidential debate last night at Washington University in St. Louis between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as recorded by The New York Times. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Good evening from the field house at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour on PBS. And I welcome you to this third and final Campaign 2000 debate between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Let's welcome the candidates now.
Before proceeding tonight, we would like to observe a moment of silence in memory of Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, who, along with his son and his former chief of staff, died in a private plane crash last night near St. Louis.
A reminder, as we continue now, that these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The formats and the rules were worked out by the commission and the two campaigns. Tonight's questions will be asked by St. Louis area voters who were identified as being uncommitted by the Gallup Organization. Earlier today, each of them wrote a question on a small card like this. Those cards were collected and then given to me this afternoon.
My job, under the rules of the evening, was to decide the order the questions will be asked and to call on the questioners accordingly. I also have the option of asking follow-ups, which in order to get to more of the panel's questions, for the record, I plan to do sparingly and mostly for clarifications.
The audience participants are bound by the following rule: They shall not ask follow-up questions or otherwise participate in the extended discussion. And the questioner's microphone will be turned off after he or she completes asking the question. Those are the rules. As in Winston-Salem last week, no single answer or response from a candidate can exceed two minutes.
There is an audience here in the hall and they have promised to remain absolutely quiet, as did their predecessors this year in Boston, Danville and Winston-Salem.
Before we begin, a correction from last week's debate. I was wrong when I said Vice President Gore's campaign commercials had called Governor Bush a bumbler. That specific charge was made in a press statement by Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani, not in a TV ad --
 
MR. BUSH -- I'm glad you clarified that.
 
MR. LEHRER -- In a TV, in a TV ad. Now, let's go to the first question of the over 130 questions we received from this panel.
We will begin with one of the 19 on health issues and it goes to you, Mr. Vice President and it will be asked by James Hankins. Mr. Hankins?
Q. -- How do you feel about H.M.O.'s and insurance companies making the critical decisions that affect people's lives instead of the medical professionals? And why are the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies not held accountable for their decisions?
 
MR. GORE -- Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patients' bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the H.M.O.'s and give them back to the doctors and the nurses. I want to come back and tell you why but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford. Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.
And I'd just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. His state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership, one of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the U.S.S. Cole is on our minds and hearts. And insofar as the memorial services tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing and the injured.
Now Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you described has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments and then their recommendations are being overruled by H.M.O.'s and insurance companies. That is unacceptable.
I support a strong national patient's bill of rights. It is actually a disagreement between us. The national law that is pending on this, the Dingell-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Time is up. Two minutes response, Governor Bush.
 
MR. BUSH -- I, too, want to extend my prayers to the -- and blessings, God's blessings, on the families whose lives were up -- overturned yesterday, last night. It was a tragic moment.
Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true. I do support a national patients' bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the state of Texas, to get a patients' bill of rights through.
It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside.
And that's what we did in my state. We got one of the most advanced patients' bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gatekeeper, can go to her gynecologist. It says that you can't gag a doctor. A doctor can advise you. The H.M.O., the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice. In this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.
But we did something else that was interesting. We're one of the first states that said you can sue an H.M.O. for denying you proper coverage. Now, there's what's called an independent review organization that you have to go through first. It says if you've got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. And if the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the I.R.O., then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.
It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people. And I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients' bill of rights, Mr. Vice President. And I want all people covered. I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas. I think --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor, time is up, sir.
 
MR. GORE -- Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Just a minute, Mr. Vice President, I wanted to --you know, the way the rules go here now, two minutes, two minutes and then I'll decide whether we go on. O.K.
 
MR. GORE -- Right.
 
MR. LEHRER -- So what I want to make sure is we understand here is before we go on to another question in the health area, would you agree that -- do you two agree on a national patients' bill of rights?
 
MR. GORE -- Absolutely not. I referred to the Dingell-Norwood bill. It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress. The H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward. They like it because it doesn't accomplish what, I think, really needs to be accomplished, to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and to give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the H.M.O. or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an H.M.O. before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to. And it has strong bipartisan support. It is being blocked by the Republican leadership
 
MR. LEHRER -- So
 
MR. GORE -- -- in the Congress. And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingell-Norwood bill which is the main one pending.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, you may answer that if you'd like. But also I'd like to know how you see the differences between the two of you, and we need to move on.
MR. BUSH -- Well, the difference is is that I can get it done, that I can get something positive done on behalf of the people. That's what the question in this campaign is about. It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done? And I believe I can.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right.
 
MR. GORE -- What about the Dingell-Norwood bill?
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right, we're going to go now to another --
 
MR. BUSH -- I'm not quite through. Let me --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Yes, go.
 
MR. BUSH -- I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patients' bill of rights. Now, there's this kind of Washington, D.C., focus -- well, it's in this committee, or it's got this sponsor.
If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going to have gag orders, women will have direct access to OB-GYN, people will be able to take their H.M.O. insurance company to court. That's what I've done in Texas, and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right, another -- the next question also on a health issue. It's from, it will be asked by Marie Payne Clepey and it goes to Governor Bush.
Q. -- Are either of you concerned with --
 
MR. BUSH -- Here you go.
 
MR. LEHRER -- I've got --
Q. -- O.K. Are either of you concerned with finding some feasible way to lower the price of pharmaceutical drugs, such as education on minimizing intake, a revamp of the F.D.A. process or streamlining the drug companies' procedures, instead of just finding more money to pay for them?
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, that's a great question. I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there's no prescription drug coverage in Medicare, and therefore when they have to try to purchase drugs, they do so on their own. There's no kind of collective bargaining, there's no power of purchasing among seniors.
So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.
The problem we have today is that, like the patients' bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing and come together and take care of our seniors with a prescription drug program that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs. In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called immediate helping hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine. That's part of an overall overhaul.
But purchasing power's important. I'm against price controls. I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development. Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. And one of the most important things is to continue the research and development component, and so I'm against price controls.
Expediting drugs through the F.D.A. makes sense, of course. Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back, in other countries, to come back into the United States. That makes sense. But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore, two minutes.
 
MR. GORE -- All right, here we go again. Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.
If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you. And you asked a great question, because it's not only seniors.
Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things, they've discovered great new cures and that's great, we want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion -- you see all these ads -- than they are on research and development. And they're trying to artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.
I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so that we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors. And here's how it works: You pick your own doctor and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If you're poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high costs, then they pay all over $4,000 out of pocket. And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right, another health question, it comes from Vicki French and it's for you, Vice President Gore. Vicki French, where are you? Oh there she is. Yes.
Q. -- We spend billions of dollars every year on taxes or pay billions of dollars in taxes. Would you be open to the ideal of a national health care plan for everybody? And if not, why? If so, is it something you would try to implement if you are elected into office and what would you do to implement this plan?
 
MR. GORE -- I think that we should move step by step toward universal health coverage. But I am not in favor of government doing it all. We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system -- partly private, partly public. And 85 percent of our people have health insurance; 15 percent don't. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it. And we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patients' bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingell-Norwood bill. And we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness because that's been left out. We've got to deal with long-term care.
Now here are the steps that I would take first of all: I will make a commitment to bring health coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit -- 25 percent -- to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are -- well, the near-elderly. I don't like that term because I'm just about in that category. But those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now.
Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending $3.7 billion -- or $4.7 billion on this.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Vice President --
 
MR. GORE -- O.K.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 
MR. BUSH -- I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan. I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers. I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993. They tried to have a national health care plan and fortunately it failed.
I trust people. I don't trust the federal government. It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight. I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.
There is an issue with the uninsured. There sure is. And we've got uninsured people in my state. Ours is a big state, fast-growing state. We share a common border with another nation. But we're providing health care for our people. It's one thing about insurance, that's a Washington term. The question is are people getting health care? And we've got a strong safety net.
And there needs to be a safety net in America. There needs to be more community health clinics where poor can go get health care. We need a program for the uninsured. They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.
The number of uninsured have now gone up for the past seven years. We need a $2,000 credit, rebate, for people, working people who don't have insurance. They can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance.
We need to have, allow small businesses to write across -- insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care. Small restaurants can afford health care. And so health care needs to be affordable and available.
But we've got to trust people to make decisions with their lives. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you're a senior you can stay in Medicare if you like it and that's fine but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so. Just like they do the federal employees. The people who work in Washington, D.C., for the U.S. Congress or the United States Senate get a variety of choices to make in their lives. And that's what we ought to do for all people in America.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Time.
 
MR. BUSH -- Yes, sir. Sorry. I'm not paying attention to my light --
 
MR. GORE -- Could I have a follow up Jim?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Not right now. Education.
 
MR. BUSH -- I've got to find my light.
 
MR. LEHRER -- These folks submitted 18 questions on education and the first one that will be asked on education will go to you, governor, and will be asked by Angie Pettig. Angie Pettig, where are you? There she is. Governor, right there.
 
MR. BUSH -- Oh, thanks. Hi, Angie.
Q. -- I've heard a lot about education and the need to hold teachers and schools accountable, and I certainly agree with that. But as an individual with an educational background and also a parent, I have seen a lot of instances where the parents are unresponsive to the teachers or flat-out uninvolved in their child's education. How do you intend to hold not only the teachers and schools accountable, but also hold parents accountable.
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another. I wish I knew the law, because I'd darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us should be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we're going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.
I happen to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want to do, and therefore become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.
That's why I'm so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot -- three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we've done in Texas is we've got strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know. You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.
I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level that says if a teacher or a principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline, they can't be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence, instead of just kind of the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can't continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences is to allow parents to have different choices.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- Yeah. We have a huge difference between us on this question. I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent; world-class; where there are no failing schools; where the classrooms are small enough in size -- number of students -- so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now, that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means, in my plan, hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school-age children outvoted on bond issues -- to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need to -- including the paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher and pick up some new skills.
I want to give every middle class family a $10,000-a-year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal preschool because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn -- kids learn more in the first few years of life than anywhere else.
Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers. And in his plan he proposes to drain more money -- more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers. And they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that's a mistake. I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we -- I think we should make it the No. 1 priority to make our schools the best in the world -- all of them.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor, what is your position on that?
 
MR. BUSH -- Yeah, I appreciate that. I think anytime we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond. Here's what I think. First of all, vouchers are up to states. If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. See I strongly believe in local control of schools. I'm a governor of a state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in local control of schools.
But here's what I've said. I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning. What's unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement. And if we find success, we'll praise it. But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach instead of saying, oh, this is O.K. in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence. And the consequence is that federal portion of federal money will go to the parent so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private -- or a private school. You see, there has to be a consequence. We've got a society that says, hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers?
 
MR. LEHRER -- What is the harm on that? What's the other side on that?
 
MR. GORE -- Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described. Under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers that the federal government would put up. Now, here's -- and the way it would happen is that, under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to -- to match those -- that money.
Under my plan if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turnaround team of specialists who know what they're doing. It's based on the plan of Gov. Jim Hunt in North Carolina and it works great.
 
MR. LEHRER -- So no vouchers under -- in a Gore administration?
 
MR. GORE -- If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently. But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools. We've got to turn around -- most schools are excellent but we've got to make sure that all of them are.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Andrew Kossberg has a related question on education that's right on this subject. Mr. Kossberg, where are you? There you are and it's for Vice President Gore.
Q. -- Mr. Vice President, in the school district in which I work and in countless others across the nation, we face crumbling school buildings, increased school violence, student apathy, overcrowding, lack of funding, lawsuits, the list goes on. I could mention low teacher pay but I won't. What can you tell me and my fellow American teachers today about your plans for our immediate future?
 
MR. GORE -- What grade do you teach?
 
MR. LEHRER -- That's a violation of your rule, Vice President Gore.
 
MR. GORE -- High school. I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote. It's ironic that there are now, there's now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population.
But at the same time, we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90 percent of America's children go to public schools. And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for 10 years running. We've got to do something about this.
And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. They're not able to do it. And our future depends upon it. Look, we're in an information age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that let's them go on to college. And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also.
And then, I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning. But it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed. Now, accountability? We basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't -- it requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.
We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching, because we need a lot more teachers.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 
MR. BUSH -- When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years, and there's just not going to be enough money.
I have been a governor of a big state, I've made education my No. 1 priority. That's what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6 percent of the money up. They put about -- you know, 60 percent of the strings where you got to fill out paperwork. I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.
What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I'd worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help; they need to fund Head Start. We need to have accountability. The vice president's plan does not have annual accountability -- third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results.
I believe strongly in teacher protection act, like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it's because you can't control the classroom. You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility. I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works -- phonics works, by the way. It needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.
The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there, because education is really funded at the local level -- 94 percent comes from the local level.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore, is the governor right when he says that you're proposing the largest federal spending in years?
 
MR. GORE -- Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I'm so glad that I have a chance to knock that down. Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy. Under his own budget numbers he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new money that he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.
Now, under my plan we will balance the budget every year. I'm not just saying this, I'm not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan in four years as a percentage of our gross domestic product federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know the third-biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt. We get nothing for it, we keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third-biggest intrusion of the federal government --
 
MR. LEHRER -- So --
 
MR. GORE -- -- in our economy.
Now because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over so schools get testing and lawsuit reform --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Time.
 
MR. GORE -- -- and not much else.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor, the vice president says you're wrong.
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, he's wrong. Just add up all the numbers. It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed. The Senate budget committee --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Three times -- excuse me -- three times --
 
MR. BUSH -- -- bigger than what President Clinton proposed.
 
MR. GORE -- That's in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.
 
MR. BUSH -- Wait a minute. May I answer --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Go ahead.
 
MR. BUSH -- My turn?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Yes, Sir.
 
MR. BUSH -- Forget the journalists. He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. You know, this is a big spender. He is. And he ought to be proud of it. It's part of his record. We just have a different philosophy. Let me talk about tax relief. If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. The vice president believes that only the right people ought to get tax relief. I don't think that's the role of the president, to pick, "You're right and you're not right." I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1 percent will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits. And that's because we structured the plan so that 6 million additional American families pay no taxes.
If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50 percent cut in your federal income taxes. What I've done is set priorities and funded them and there's extra money. And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back. It's a difference of opinion. He wants to grow the government. And I trust you with your own money.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Well, let --
 
MR. BUSH -- I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people. Is this the right position to take?
 
MR. GORE -- Can we extend the time?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Hold on one sec here, though. But Governor just to reverse the thing, what do you say specifically to what the vice president said tonight. He's said it many, many times, that your tax cut benefits the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans and you've heard --
 
MR. BUSH -- Of course it does. If you pay taxes, you're going to get a benefit. People who pay taxes will get tax relief.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right. Why shouldn't they --
 
MR. BUSH -- Let me finish, please. Under my plan, if you make -- the top, the wealthy people pay 62 percent of the taxes today. Afterwards they pay 64 percent. This is a fair plan. You know why? Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000. And it's not right. So I want to do something about that.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me. It is about you. And I want to come back to something I said before. If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.
If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man. I want to be.
Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year. I won't ask you. But if you do, you're in the top 1 percent. If you don't --
 
MR. LEHRER -- It would be a violation of the rules. They couldn't --
 
MR. GORE -- I'm not going to ask. But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1 percent.
Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Quick and then we're moving on.
 
MR. BUSH -- Good. Fifty million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.
 
MR. GORE -- That's not right.
 
MR. BUSH -- You may not be one of them. You're just not one of the right people.
And secondly, we've had enough fighting. It's time to unite. You talk about eight years. In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patients' bill of rights.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right.
 
MR. BUSH -- It's time to get something done.
 
MR. GORE -- Hey, hey. I've got to answer --
 
MR. LEHRER -- We're going to move on now.
 
MR. GORE -- -- that, Jim. Medicare --
 
MR. LEHRER -- What -- what --
 
MR. GORE -- -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Vice President --
 
MR. GORE -- -- to the life of Medicare. It was due to go bankrupt in 1999. And that 50 million figure, again --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore.
 
MR. GORE -- -- you said, forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the scorecard and whether or not you're --
 
MR. LEHRER -- O.K.
 
MR. GORE -- -- using facts that aren't right. And that fact is just not right.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Speaking of keepers of the scorecard, that's what I'm trying to do here, Mr. Vice President and Governor Bush.
 
MR. GORE -- Yeah.
 
MR. LEHRER -- We're going to -- we're going to move on, we're going to have to move on. All right, there were 12 questions on foreign and military matters and the first one that we're going to ask will be directed to -- to you, Governor Bush. And David Norwood is going to ask it. Mr. Norwood, where are you? There you are.
Q. -- What would you make -- what would make you the best candidate in office during the Middle East crisis?
 
MR. BUSH -- I've been a leader. I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. I got a strategy for the Middle East. And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.
Our nation needs to be credible and strong. When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody's got to believe it. Israel's our friend and we'll stand by Israel. We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well, to build coalitions to keep the peace.
I also need to -- the next leader needs to be patient. You can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable. It's got to be on the timetable of the people that are trying -- that we're trying to bring to the peace table. We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means we have to be steady, we can't worry about polls or focus groups. You've got to have a clear vision. That's what a leader does.
A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace. Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling, the sanctions are loosened. He's a man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction. We don't know because inspectors aren't in.
So to answer your question it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends and the credibility for people, both friend and foe, to understand when America says something, we mean it.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- I see a future when the world is at peace with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world. Even in Iran, they have had an election that began to bring about some change. We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.
Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.
Now, what can I bring to that challenge? When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War. When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that. I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didn't do the most or run the gravest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.
In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee. And I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can defuse these tensions and deal with nonproliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, we're going to face some serious new challenges in the next four years. I've worked on that long and hard.
When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there, I worked on a bipartisan basis -- as I did in the House; I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate, I was one of only 10 Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War resolution. And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Vice President --
 
MR. GORE -- Could I say just one other thing here?
 
MR. LEHRER -- No, sir. We'll get back. I'm going to -- the next question is to you.
 
MR. GORE -- Fine. I'll wait.
 
MR. LEHRER -- It's a related question and it's going to be asked by Kenneth Allen. Mr. Allen.
 
MR. GORE -- I think that he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right. Go ahead.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Allen, right there.
Q. -- Mr. Vice President, today our military forces are stretched thinner and doing more than they've ever done before during peacetime. I'd like to know what you -- I think we'd all like to know what you, as president, would do to ensure proper resourcing for the current mission and/or more selectively choosing the time and place that our forces will be used around the world.
 
MR. GORE -- Thank you, Sir. Just to finish briefly -- I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council and last week I broke off -- I suspended campaigning for two days or parts of two days to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the president's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job. It's a difficult situation.
The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military. But we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.
And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year. And I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor's proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that's -- I think that would be a mistake because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat -- a single American life in combat.
Now, readiness. The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline. The number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And I'm happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next -- for the next 10 years, I propose $100 billion for this purpose; the governor proposes 45 billion. I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.
 
MR. BUSH -- If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second. I readily admit, I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.
Your question was deployment. It must be in the national interests, it must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops. The mission must be clear. Soldiers must understand why we're going. The force must be strong enough so that they mission can be accomplished. And the exit strategy needs to be well defined.
I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world. See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy. Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war, and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often. The vice president mentioned my view of the long term for the military. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that our -- we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can make -- keep the peace. This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.
Spending money is one thing, but spending money without a strategic plan can often times be wasted. First thing I'm going to do is ask the secretary of defense to spell up a plan so we're making sure we're not spending our money on political projects but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well paid, well housed and have the best equipment in the world.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, another kind of gun question. It'll be asked by Robert Lutz. Mr. Lutz?
Q. -- Governor Bush.
 
MR. BUSH -- Yes, sir.
Q. -- We'd just like to know, what is your opposition to the Brady handgun bill?
 
MR. BUSH -- Could you -- I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
Q. -- We'd like to know why you object to the Brady handgun bill, if you do object to it, because on a recent TV ad it showed that the National Rifle Association says if you are elected that they will be working out of your office. I could just see Charlton Heston --
 
MR. BUSH -- I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad, but let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind --
 
MR. LEHRER -- I'm not -- excuse me, I'm not sure he's finished with his question, governor, I'm sorry.
 
MR. BUSH -- Oh, I'm sorry.
Q. -- So that kind of bothers me, you know, when I see that ad like that. I wonder if you can explain that ad to me?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Oh, that's fine.
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, I don't think I ran the ad. I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad. It's -- that wasn't my ad, and I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.
Here's what I believe, sir. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them; that's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows. I'm for trigger locks; I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the state of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.
But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books, that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we catch somebody, you know, illegally using the gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law.
And the federal government can help. There's a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Va., we focused federal taxpayers money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me, that's how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't. I'm a pretty independent thinker. But one thing I'm for is a safe society, and I'm for enforcing laws on the books and that's what's going to happen should I earn your confidence.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- Well, one of -- it was not one of my ads either, Governor. But I am familiar with the statement and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization. Let me tell you my position. I think that some common-sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem: gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters or sportsmen or people who use rifles. They are aimed at the real problem. Let's make our schools safe. Let's make our neighborhoods safe. Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.
But I'd like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to this -- to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, I'm not.
And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called re-inventing government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration. During the last five years, Texas' government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down; Texas' government has gone up.
Now my plan for the future -- I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services on line cheaper, better, faster. We can do that.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Steve Luker has a question and it is for Vice President Gore. Mr. Luker. There you are.
Q. -- Vice President Gore, the family farms are disappearing and having a hard time even in the current positive economic environment. What steps would you or your administration take on agricultural policy developments to protect the family farms for this multi-functional service they perform?
 
MR. GORE -- We've got a bumper crop this year, but that's the good news. You know what the bad news is that follows on that: the prices are low.
In the last several years, the so-called freedom to farm law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here will -- who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this so just forgive me because the 2 percent of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net.
And I think that you pointed the way in your comments because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And, yes, farmers are the first environmentalists, and when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money but it helps the environment.
I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you -- to make sensible choice in crop rotation and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.
Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focused rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.
So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 
MR. BUSH -- I'd like our farmers feeding the world. We're the best, best producers in the world. And I want the farmers feeding the world. We need to open up markets. Exports are down and every time an export number goes down it hurts the farmer.
I want the next president to have fast-track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world. We're the best. We're the most efficient, efficient farmers.
I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldn't be using food. It hurts the farmers. It's not the right thing to do.
I'm for value-added processing. We need to do more work on value-added processing. You take the raw product, you produce -- I assume you're a farmer -- off your farm and convert it. I think value-added process is important.
I'm for research and development. Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.
I'm for getting rid of the death tax. Completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The president shouldn't have vetoed that bill. It's a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer.
So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote -- I also under -- let them open up markets. But I also understand that farming is a part of our national security. I'm from a big farm state. We're the second biggest state, farming state in the country. And I hear my farmers, friends all the time.
The vice president's right. By the way, every day's Earth Day if you own the land. And I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put, set aside land as well for conservation purposes. Thank you.
 
MR. LEHRER -- A quick thing on the inheritance tax. There is a difference between the two of you on this. Vice President Gore.
 
MR. GORE -- Yeah, I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax. And under the plan that I've proposed, 80 percent of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax. And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt. And all of the others would have sharply reduced. So 80 percent --
Now, the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1 percent. The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes from middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra-heavy burden on middle-class families and so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.
 
MR. LEHRER -- What's the case for doing that, governor?
 
MR. BUSH -- Eliminating the death tax?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Completely, for everybody.
 
MR. BUSH -- Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets. It's either unfair for some or unfair for all. Again, this is just a difference of opinion. If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners. I don't think that's the role of the president. I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits. Secondly, I think your plan, there's a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, and all due respect it is -- I'm not sure 80 percent of the people get the death tax. I know this: 100 percent will get it if I'm the president. I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status. It's a fairness issue. It's an issue of principle, not politics.
 
MR. LEHRER -- New issue. And the question will be asked by Joyce Cleamer of Governor Bush. Joyce Cleamer, there you are.
 
MR. BUSH -- Hi, Joyce.
Q. -- Yes. Hi, Governor. I'm very concerned about the morality of our country now: TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, barraged with every day. And I want to know if there's anything that can be worked out with Hollywood or whoever to help get rid of some of this bad language and the whatever. You know, it's just bringing the country down and our children are very important to us and we're concerned about their education at school. We should be concerned about their education at home also. Thank you.
 
MR. BUSH -- Appreciate that question. Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying. Government ought to stand on the side of parents. Parents are teaching their children right from wrong. And the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture. You bet there's things the government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so that kids get on the Internet, there's not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood. But it does reinforce the values you're teaching. I would greatly expand character education funding so that public schools would teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. There's after-school money available. I think that after-school money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself. That'll help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. I -- ours is a great land. And one of the reasons why is because we're free. And so I don't support censorship but I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people that produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. And I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs that you don't want in your house. But I'm going to remind mothers and dads: the best weapon is the off-on button and paying attention to your children and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.
 
MR. LEHRER -- That's all right.
 
MR. BUSH -- Was on my peroration.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Yeah.
 
MR. GORE -- My turn.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore.
 
MR. GORE -- I care a lot about this. It's not just movies. Television, video games, music, the Internet. Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have. Tipper and I have four children and God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.
I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter. She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year and a half ago, and yet, if she'll forgive me, when she was little she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it. And Tipper hit the ceiling. And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents. And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.
I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95 percent of the pages come up, and a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately. You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you'll have to ask your kids how to put them on there. But if you can check up on them, then you're -- that's real power.
And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children. That is an outrage. Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act. And if they don't do it, we're going to ask for tougher authority in the hands of the F.T.C. on the false and deceptive advertising. I'll tell you this -- I want to do something about this -- respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right. Vice President Gore, the next question is for you and it will be asked by Steven Cusman. Mr. Cusman, where are you, sir? Right behind me as well. There we go.
 
MR. GORE -- Right next to the last one.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Yeah, got it. Good planning.
Q. -- It seems that when we hear about issues of this campaign, it's usually Medicare or Social Security or prescription drugs. As a college professor, I hear a lot of apathy amongst young people who feel that there are no issues directed to them and they don't plan to vote. How do you address that?
 
MR. GORE -- We've got to change it. I spend a good deal of time talking to young people and in my standard speech out there on the stump, I usually end my speech by saying I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience. And I want to tell you what I tell them. Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arms length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle. And if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're going to be let down and disappointed.
But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union. We're America and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.
Now we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy and that is the current campaign financing system. And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls. I don't believe that's a fair measure. I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.
Governor Bush opposes it. I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that. Because I think that the special interest have too much power and we need to give our democracy back to the American people. Let me tell you why. Those issues you mentioned -- Social Security, prescription drugs. The big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made. The H.M.O.'s are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingell-Norwood bill that I support and that Governor Bush does not support. The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuels.
They ought to have their voices heard. But they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people. We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are. And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be. We can.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Time. Governor Bush, two minutes.
 
MR. BUSH -- Um, I'll tell you what I hear. A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C., and therefore they don't want any part of politics. They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another. Heard a lot of young folks saying, you know, "Why do I want to be involved with this mess?" And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences and set an agenda that will make sense.
Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is -- is -- is relevant for all of us, young and old alike. We'd better get it right now. Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.
I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off. I think it's the tone. I think it's the attitude. I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way. Before I decided to run I -- I had to resolve two issues in my mind. One, could our family endure all this business? And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it. And the other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C.? And I believe the answer's yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote. That's what happened in Texas. We worked together. There's a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga, he's the chairman of the health committee. He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas. He's a Democrat. I didn't care whether he was Republican or Democrat, what cared about is could we work together. That's what Washington, D.C. needs.
And finally, sir, to answer your question, it needs somebody in office who'll tell the truth. That's the best way to get people back in the system.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, Norma Kirby has the next question and it's for you.
 
MR. BUSH -- O.K.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Norma Kirby, where are you?
Q -- Right here.
MR. BUSH -- Hi, Norma.
Q. -- Hi. How will your administration address diversity, inclusiveness and what role will affirmative action play in your overall plan?
 
MR. BUSH -- I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration and my administration is better off for it in Texas. I'm going to find people that want to serve their country. But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.
I've worked hard in the state of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state, with good smart policy, policy that rejects quotas. I don't like quotas. Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. It's not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our state of Texas, I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10 percent of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our, one of our higher institutions, higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do, I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.
I think the contracting business in government can help, not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be, you know, need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America's all about, which is equal opportunity and opportunity for people to realize their potential, so to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it is affirmative access. And I'll have an administration that'll make you proud.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- I believe in this goal and this effort with all my heart. I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group and bring our people together. How do you do it? Well, you establish respect for differences. You don't ignore differences. It's all to easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say "Ah, we're just all the same" without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.
Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit. I don't know what affirmative access means. I do know what affirmative action means. I know that the governor's against it and I know that I'm for it. I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death. I'm for that proposed law. The governor is against it. I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity. I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity -- and incidentally an excellent -- I mean I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it. Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before. And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity of any governor in the entire history of the state of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.
Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws. I'm against quotas. This is -- with all due respect, governor, that's a red herring. Affirmative action isn't quotas. I'm against quotas. They're illegal. They're against the American way. Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.
 
MR. LEHRER Governor, what is your -- are you opposed to affirmative action?
 
MR. BUSH -- No, if affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it. If affirmative action means what I just described, what I'm for, then I'm for it. You heard what I was for. Vice president keeps saying I'm against things. You heard what I was for and that's what I support.
 
MR. LEHRER -- What about -- Mr. Vice President, you heard what he said.
 
MR. GORE -- He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it. Affirmative action doesn't mean --
 
MR. BUSH -- Good.
 
MR. GORE -- -- quotas. Are you for it without quotas?
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I am for what I just described to the lady. She heard my answer.
 
MR. GORE -- Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?
 
MR. BUSH -- Jim --
 
MR. LEHRER -- Let's go onto another -- another
 
MR. GORE -- I think that speaks for itself.
 
MR. LEHRER -- It's a question
 
MR. BUSH -- No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President. It speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agreed to. But evidently rules don't mean anything.
 
MR. LEHRER -- The question is for you, Vice President Gore, and Lisa Key will ask it. Lisa Key, where are you? There we go, sorry.
Q. -- How will your tax proposals affect me as a middle-class, 24-year-old single person with no dependents?
 
MR. GORE -- If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit which means, in essence, that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.
If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1,500.
If you make more than $60,000 and up to $100,000, you'll still get a match, but not as generous.
You will get access to lifelong learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or -- or training. If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that. If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.
If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20 percent or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit. Now the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families. And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that, $3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush.
 
MR. BUSH -- Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully funded it's going to cost a whole lot of money, lot more than we have. You're going to get tax relief under my plan. You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out. Everybody who pays taxes is going to get tax relief. If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.
I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate but what about Medicare? You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options. Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines. If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare you don't get the new procedures. You're stuck in a time warp in many ways. So it'll be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.
You're going to live in a peaceful world. It'll be a world of peace because we're going to have a clearer, clear-sighted foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends, a mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people, a judicious use of the military which'll help keep the peace.
You'll be in a world hopefully that's more educated, so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood, seeing an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic. You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy: you know, the harder work -- the harder you work, the more you can keep. That's the American way. Government shouldn't be a heavy hand. That's what the federal government does to you. It should be a helping hand.
And tax relief in the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor, the next question is for you and Leo Anderson will ask it. Mr. Anderson?
 
MR. BUSH -- Hi Leo. You want a mike.
Q -- In one of the last debates held, the subject of capital punishment came up. And in your response to the question you seemed to overly enjoy, as a matter of fact, proud that Texas led the nation in execution of prisoners. Sir, did I misread your response and are you really, really proud of the fact that Texas is number one in executions?
 
MR. BUSH -- No, I'm not proud of that. The death penalty's very serious business, Leo. It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on. I take my job seriously. And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me. I do.
I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state. During the course of the campaign in 1994, I was asked do you support the death penalty? I said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do. I think if it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.
One of the things that happens when you're a governor, often times you have to make tough decisions. And you can't let public persuasion sway you because the job's to enforce the law. And that's what I did, sir. There've been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the state of Texas is to deal with those cases.
But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.
I'm not proud of any record. I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the state of Texas. I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable. But I'm not proud of any record, sir. No.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- I support the death penalty. I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like D.N.A. evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases. But also with very careful attention. If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody's waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say, wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy? If the wrong guy is put to death then that's a double tragedy -- not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it and in some cases may be still at large.
But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Do both of you believe that the death penalty actually deters crime? Governor?
 
MR. BUSH -- I do, it's the only reason to be for it. I don't -- let me finish. I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge. I don't think that's right. I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
 
MR. GORE -- I think it is a deterrence. I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrence.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right. Next question is for you, Vice President Gore. And Thomas Fisher will ask it. Mr. Fisher.
Q. -- Yes. My sixth-grade class at St. Claire's School wanted to ask of all these promises you guys are making and all the pledges, will you keep them when you're in office?
 
MR. GORE -- Yes. I am a person who keeps promises. And you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years as if the promises that I -- I made eight years ago have not been kept.
I think the record shows otherwise. We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today. Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured, 22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally. Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.
Here are some promises that I'll make to you now. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the debt every year. I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones. And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.
We both made promises in this campaign. I promise you I will keep mine. Let me tell you about one of the governor's. He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security trust fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own, but he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut. And he's promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is the Show Me State, reminds me of the line from the movie: "Show me the money." Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush?
 
MR. BUSH -- Thank you for your question. I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end. You asked about promises. You were promised that Medicare would be reformed and that Social Security'd be reformed. You were promised a middle-class tax cut, 1992. It didn't happen. There's too much bitterness in Washington. There's too much wrangling. It's time to have a fresh start.
One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people. When I campaigned in a race a lot of folks didn't think I could win -- including, by the way, my mother. I said I'd do four things: tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform. And I won, and I had the will of the people in my state behind me. And then I brought folks together to get it done. And that's what we need, I think, in this election. To me that's what it's all about.
I know, listen -- I'm sure your sixth grade kids are listening -- these guys'll say anything to get elected. But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at. And one of my promises is going to be Social Security reform and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollar -- trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus. Now, remember Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015. People are going to get paid. But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're going to be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. And you bet we're going to take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines to get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2 percent that the federal government gets for you today. That's one of my promises. But it's going to require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done. That's what it requires. There was a chance to get this done. There was bipartisan, bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected. I'm going to bring them together.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Both of you, to both of you on this subject. There are other questions that also go to this skepticism, not necessarily about you but all people in politics. Why is that?
 
MR. GORE -- Well, first of all, Jim, I'd like to respond to what the governor just said because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people and you cannot keep both promises. If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire if he takes it out of the Social Security trust fund. Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100. Now that is the difference. And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this: This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future. The reason Social Security, he says it gets 2 percent. You know, it's not a -- a bank account -- it -- that -- that just pays back money that's invested. It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on. If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security trust fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?
Now, let me come -- let me come directly to your question --
 
MR. LEHRER -- No, I think we're -- we have to go to the closing statements and --
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, could I answer that?
 
MR. LEHRER -- Sure.
 
MR. BUSH -- One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked. The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money. There's just a difference of opinion. I want workers to have their own assets. It's who you trust, the government or people.
 
MR. LEHRER -- All right, now we're going to go to closing statements.
 
MR. GORE -- Right.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore, you're first. You have two minutes.
 
MR. GORE -- Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions, your last question. I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country since the assassination of our best leaders in the 60s, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate. And because we need campaign finance reform.
I'd like to tell you something about me. I keep my word. I have kept the faith. I've kept the faith with my country. I volunteered for the Army, I served in Vietnam. I kept the faith with my family. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years. We have devoted ourselves to our children and now, our nearly 1 1/2-year-old grandson. I have kept the faith with our country. Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution. And I have never violated that oath.
I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth. I have spent the last quarter-century fighting for middle-class, working men and women in the United States of America. I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.
If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence. And your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America and be the better for it.
We've made some progress during the last eight years. We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States, lower crime rates for eight years in a row, highest private home ownership ever. But I'll make you one promise here: You ain't seen nothing yet. And I will keep that promise.
 
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 
MR. BUSH -- Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president. Appreciate the chance to have a good honest dialogue about our differences of opinion, and I think after three debates, good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion, it's the difference between big federal government and somebody who's coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.
I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country. It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. It's an agenda that says we're going to listen to the young voices in Social Security and so we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America -- a promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to be become your president.
I want to rebuild the military to keep the peace. I want to make sure the public school system in America fulfills its promise so that no child, not one child, is left behind. And after setting priorities, I want to give some of the -- some of your money back. See, I don't think the surplus is the government's money. I think it's the people's money. I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government. I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people, and you ought to have some of the surplus so you can save and dream and build.
I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign. I'm asking for your vote. For those of you for me, thanks for your help. For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once. But for those who've not made up their mind, I'd like to conclude by this promise, should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I had been elected, so help me God. Thank you very much.
 
MR. LEHRER -- A closing piece of business before we go. The debate commission wants reaction to the three kinds of formats used in the debates this year and you may register an opinion at their Web site, www.debates.org.
Thank you, Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. From St. Louis, I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
 
MR. BUSH -- Good luck, good luck.
 
MR. GORE -- And to you.

WARNING SIGNS IN SINGAPORE EXPORTS

BYLINE: By Wayne Arnold 

 BODY:
Falling demand for computer disk drives and chemicals offset rising demand for semiconductors to crimp Singapore's export growth last month, the government said. Nonoil exports rose 11.7 percent in September compared with the level for September 1999, below expectations, with slower shipments to the United States and Europe. Although economic growth in Singapore has been quickening this year, the data heightened concerns in financial markets that slumping global demand for electronics could mean trouble for Singapore and Southeast Asia's other export-dependent economies.

HEADLINE: Geeks, Proud of the Name, Start a Volunteer Corps

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN 

 BODY:
SARAH WUSTNER, a Seattle software engineer, thought about joining the Peace Corps when she graduated from the University of California at San Diego in 1998. But, she said, "they didn't have anything that really fit my skills."
Now, with a stint at Microsoft on her resume, she has taken a leave of absence from her job at Oxygen Media to live in Ghana for three months. Ms. Wustner is part of the pilot team of six volunteers for Geekcorps, a high-tech version of the Peace Corps. Instead of teaching math, as technologically adept Peace Corps workers often do, Ms. Wustner, 24, will help a Ghanaian software company teach its workers the Java and Unix programming languages. 
 "I want the satisfaction of feeling that all of the expensive education that I got helped someone in a really real way," she said.
Geekcorps was the idea of Ethan Zuckerman, 27, who made a modest fortune ("enough to buy myself time," he said) when the Internet company he helped start, Tripod, was bought by Lycos in 1998. Lacking economic expertise, he consulted with Elisa Korentayer, 25, who has been both an investment banker and a poverty relief worker; she became a co-founder of Geekcorps.
The idea for Geekcorps came when Mr. Zuckerman was in Ghana in 1993 on a Fulbright fellowship to study African music. Because of a strike at the University of Ghana, he spent a lot of time in the library and noticed that it did not have many books published later than 1957, when Ghana became independent from Britain.
"I thought, If there was just an Internet connection," he said, "you could more than double this library."
In 1999 he left Lycos and began looking for a way to harness the philanthropic urges of his newly rich friends. The budget for Geekcorps's first year, $350,000, was financed largely by Mr. Zuckerman and people he knew from Tripod. Geekcorps is based in North Adams, Mass., in the dot-com corridor of the Berkshires.
Geekcorps is not unique. Volunteer programs designed to bridge the "digital divide" have been proliferating. The term itself, once used primarily to describe the gulf between Internet haves and have-nots within Western countries, refers more and more frequently to the huge disparity in access between the world's economic giants and its fledgling economies. Nearly 400 of every 1,000 Americans are Internet users, according to the International Telecommunication Union, as opposed to 3.5 of every 1,000 Africans.
Since Aug. 1, the United Nations has sent 37 high-tech volunteers to countries like Benin, Botswana and Ecuador. The State Department's version, called the Global Technology Corps, began in late 1998 and has sponsored more than 20 projects in Kosovo, Nigeria, Poland and other far-flung locales. Still another project, Net Corps America, focuses only on Latin America and the Caribbean. And in August the Peace Corps began to include information technology among its specialties, sending 10 volunteers to Belize.
These programs reflect the idea, enunciated this summer by the United Nations and the Group of Eight, that the Internet can provide medical information, economic opportunities and online courses that will enable developing countries to leapfrog ahead. But there are an infinite number of ways to chip away at the obstacles to total connectivity, including putting computers in schools and rewriting telecommunications regulations.
Geekcorps, although tiny, has attracted the attention of people like Denis Gilhooly, the director of information and communications technology for the United Nations Development Program. "The key to information infrastructure is a dual approach of bottom-up development, exemplified by Geekcorps," he said, "and top-down efforts, which would be exemplified by the UNDP Global Network Readiness and Resource Initiative." What Geekcorps is doing, he continued, is "seeding the next generation of entrepreneurs, and that's invaluable in these countries."
Both Mr. Zuckerman and Ms. Korentayer, who is the Geekcorps program director, said they had been pleasantly surprised by the number of Ghanaian businesses -- including an art gallery, a graphic design firm and a software company -- that asked for help. "There were so many companies that were so well positioned to receive the kind of help that we can offer," Ms. Korentayer said.
In the future Mr. Zuckerman plans to pursue high-tech companies as donors and to persuade "venture philanthropists" like the Noaber Foundation, which gave Geekcorps a grant, to pump capital into Geekcorps's Ghanaian clients.
The main thing that sets Geekcorps apart from other volunteer efforts, Ms. Korentayer said, is the fact that it was started by dot-com insiders.
"Geekcorps is far better positioned to appeal to the techie sector in the U.S.," Ms. Korentayer said. "Our competitive advantage is that a lot of techies have heard of us."

HEADLINE: Public Theater's Uptown 'Party' Leaves a Hangover

SERIES: MUCH ADO ABOUT A VISION -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
On Jan. 26, just three weeks into rehearsals for the Broadway musical "The Wild Party," the Hollywood producer Scott Rudin wrote a letter to George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, to tell him that he was pulling his money out of the show.
"When we agreed to go forward together, I fully understood that you guys were going to be the lead producers on the venture, which I never had a problem with, provided that the criteria we agreed upon were put in place and adhered to," Mr. Rudin wrote. "To be told yesterday 'George is an artist and doesn't have time for producing issues' so contravenes the understanding, that I feel it is pointless to try and continue." 
 Mr. Rudin was ultimately persuaded to stay on, a decision he later said he regretted. Although the show opened in April and went on to receive nominations for seven Tony Awards, it won none and quickly closed.
The commercial failure of "The Wild Party" raised broad questions both about the Public and about Broadway's capacity to handle unorthodox fare. An examination of the musical's short, troubled life highlights those issues and the problems that can arise in the increasingly frequent partnerships between nonprofit theaters and commercial producers.
Although many say "The Wild Party" might have had an easier time starting at the Public rather than high-stakes Broadway, the Public Theater wanted to produce it uptown from the beginning. The production, which Mr. Wolfe wrote with the composer Michael John LaChiusa and also directed, was the season's second adaptation of the 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure March, which chronicles a debauched evening of orgies, shared misery and murder. Manhattan Theater Club did the first "Wild Party," written and composed by Andrew Lippa, in January.
The Public considered the Wolfe-LaChiusa version to be Broadway-caliber material, particularly because Vanessa Williams had initially agreed to star.
The Public's board chairman, Kenneth B. Lerer, said that going straight to Broadway also made economic sense because the Public planned to put up just $2.4 million, or half the cost of the show, only $900,000 more than it would have cost to produce it downtown at the Public on Lafayette Street.
And to do the show justice, Mr. Wolfe and Mr. LaChiusa said, they needed an orchestra pit and sizeable proscenium stage. (In addition, they said, their female star, Toni Collette, who replaced Ms. Williams when she became pregnant, would agree to appear only on Broadway. Ms. Collette's agent, Adam Isaacs, however, said this was "totally untrue.")
To help bring the show to Broadway, everyone working on it agreed to work for below-Broadway rates, said John Breglio, the Public's lawyer. The Public knew it could not afford to produce "Wild Party" on Broadway without outside financial help, given that musicals usually cost from $5 million to $10 million these days and that the Public spent $8 million on a failed revival of "On the Town" last year. So Mr. Wolfe approached Mr. Rudin, who in turn invited three other commercial producers to take part: Roger Berlind, Elizabeth Williams and Anita Waxman.
Mr. Rudin's team put up half of the show's $4.8 million cost while the Public provided the other half and agreed to cover any overruns, which ultimately amounted to more than $1 million. The Public agreed to split the profits almost evenly with the commercial producers.
Mr. Rudin said that he was initially enthusiastic about the project and that he expected Vanessa Williams's name to sell tickets. "I thought it had great artistic promise, although the subject matter made it a tough bet," he said.
Those present at the show's first rehearsal remember the excitement in the air. Still, board members say they were realistic about the show's financial prospects. "We never thought of 'The Wild Party' as another 'Chorus Line,' never thought it would be a commercial hit," Mr. Lerer said. "In my wildest dreams I thought it would break even."
Mr. Rudin saw the Public's attitude toward potential losses as cavalier, which is partly what soured him on the partnership. "George Wolfe invited me and my colleagues into this project because he said he wanted a partner in producing this show with the Public Theater," Mr. Rudin said. "In fact what he wanted was investors to hand over the money and walk away and not care where it was spent, how it was spent or whether there would ever be even the possibility of a return."
More than a clash of nonprofit and commercial cultures, Mr. Wolfe said, it was a clash of personalities. "The theater is fundamentally about collaboration," he said. "It was not a good collaboration with Scott because Scott is not a good collaborator. He needs to be in charge. If he is not in charge, it tends to color his passion and his generosity of spirit."
Mr. Rudin said that over time he came to feel that the show was badly managed because Mr. Wolfe closely guarded all decisions on elements like marketing, advertising and publicity, disregarding the commercial partners' expertise and stretching himself thin.
Mr. Rudin said he became exasperated with Mr. Wolfe's unavailability and wrote the letter after he tried to plan a promotional event for the show at Joe's Pub and was told over the phone by a Public executive that Mr. Wolfe did not have time for such things. . In response Mr. Lerer, a senior vice president of America Online, together with Michael Lynton, another board member, went to see Mr. Rudin and assured him that his concerns would be addressed.
Mr. Wolfe conceded that there were "unquestionably times when the artistic demands of the show were all-consuming," but he said he felt that it was important for the Public to hold the reins as part of its mandate.
"Ultimately the producer of 'The Wild Party' was the Public Theater," Mr. Wolfe said. "And we had agendas that are informed by fiscal realities. But we also have an unbelievable number of agendas that are about the mission of this institution, that are about our relationship with artists, that are about our sense of responsibility to the communities of this city."
Despite the assurances from Mr. Lerer and Mr. Lynton, Mr. Rudin said, the situation remained unchanged, and soon there were other flash points. High among them, he said, was the erratic behavior onstage of the show's male lead, Mandy Patinkin, who also regularly missed performances, more than 20 over all.
Mr. Rudin said that Mr. Wolfe abdicated responsibility. "Decisive action needed to be taken to make the other 15 actors onstage feel they were as important as Mr. Patinkin," Mr. Rudin said. Mr. Patinkin declined to comment. Mr. Wolfe would only say he believed he acted appropriately.
With conflicts far from resolved, "The Wild Party" opened on April 13 to mixed reviews. John Lahr wrote in The New Yorker, "The enormous energy that comes across the footlights feels more like theatrical hyperventilation than revelation." Linda Winer, in Newsday, described the show as "explosive and entertaining, if not completely satisfying." Ben Brantley of The New York Times, called it "a cause for sorrowful head-shaking," in a review that many at the Public blame for the show's demise, given the influence of the newspaper's chief theater critic.
Even though he was no longer obligated financially, Mr. Rudin said he felt that the producers should close the show. He said he sent a strong message to Mr. Lerer through a colleague. "I told him, every cent you spend two weeks after the show opened you're going to lose," Mr. Rudin said. "You're throwing money in the street."
But the Public's board said it had a duty to keep the show running until the Tony nominations were announced on May 8. After "Wild Party" received seven nominations, including one for best musical, the Public hunkered down to hang on until the awards ceremony on June 4.
To the extent that it is financially possible, Mr. Lerer and other board members say, a nonprofit theater must stick by its artists, particularly its leader. In deciding to keep the show open, the Public had the support of at least one of Mr. Rudin's fellow commercial producers.
"I thought we were all pretty unified in feeling -- after we received mixed reviews, some raves and some not good reviews -- to let word of mouth build," said Elizabeth Williams, who also produced "The Real Thing" and "A Moon for the Misbegotten" last season. "We needed to make the commitment, financial and otherwise, to stay open through the Tonys when we got so many nominations."
People involved in the show agreed to take salary cuts. Mr. LaChiusa, the composer, waived his royalty fee. And Mr. Lerer appointed a committee of three board members to oversee the show's finances: himself, Larry E. Condon and Ken Auletta.
The Public says it ultimately put up an additional $1.1 million to cover the costs of keeping the show open. That included $200,000 Mr. Lerer raised from private investors -- including Robert W. Pittman, the president of America Online and the Public's former board chairman -- and from Mr. Lerer himself.
The Public's board members say that the project fulfilled their artistic expectations. "I think George completely lived up to his side of the bargain," said Mr. Lynton, the president of AOL International. "He put on a good production. It was cast well, well produced. Whether people came or not is a separate issue."
As far as Mr. Rudin is concerned, however, whether people come or not is decisive. And they were not coming in large enough numbers; the show, which cost $450,000 a week to run, was losing $150,000 a week, he said.
On June 6, two days after "Wild Party" was shut out at the Tony Awards, the producers announced that the musical would close on June 11. Soon afterward Mr. Lerer invited Mr. LaChiusa down to the Public to meet with the board.
"He said, speaking for the board, how much they believed in this piece, that it was the type of show they wanted to do, and I always had a home there," Mr. LaChiusa recalled. "It was one of the most moving things I've ever been through in my life."
Mr. Wolfe said he had no regrets, that he believed in "The Wild Party" and felt it belonged on Broadway, although he said he was left asking himself, "Can challenging work happen in that landscape?"
Tonya Pinkins, one of the show's lead actors, said, "Sometimes you have to be taking an audience to the next level."
The comments point up the divide between the nonprofit theater world and many entrepreneurs.
Mr. Rudin, still irritated by the experience, said it was "childish and amateurish" to hold the notion that a show is "too good for Broadway."
"The Broadway environment raised an expectation for the show that the show simply did not deliver," he said. "And despite the fact that there was tremendous talent involved in it on- and offstage, audiences simply didn't like it in large enough numbers to keep it running."
In Mr. Wolfe's view, "The Wild Party" might have taken off had it had more time to find an audience. "We lost the commercial battle," he said. "But I firmly believe this show is going to have a future life because it's a good piece."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Utopia, and the Rest of All Possible Worlds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Why do we keep dreaming about utopia?
That's not exactly the question posed by "Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World," a pensive extravaganza, if one can imagine such a thing, at the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Hundreds of books, manuscripts, maps, prints, photographs, bits of music, film, Nazi paraphernalia, Soviet propaganda, 1960's antiwar buttons, rock album covers and other curiosities spill across galleries on two floors. 
 The show, a collaboration between the library and the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, begins with a gigantic subject and enlarges on it. It is an ambitious strategy: serious, stylish, amusing, charming even, but occasionally aggravating. French, in other words.
Like most library exhibitions, it is more of a reading event than a show about visual pleasure, and as a near free-for-all it touches on what seems like almost every vision in Western history of a better world, including what Hitler and Stalin imagined.
So a visitor gets Eden, Renaissance architecture, the discovery of America, Voltaire's "Candide," the Declaration of Independence, the Paris Commune, Quakers, Soviet gulags, streamlined ocean liners, Levittown, the gay rights movement and Woodstock. By the end I found myself wondering why "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" was included but not Beethoven's Ninth, before I came to my senses. If you make it that far, you may lose track, too.
But the show has its multiple pleasures and benefits. And as the exhibition makes clear, everyone's idea of utopia is different; so, too, presumably, is everyone's idea of a utopian exhibition.
The word, we are reminded, was coined in 1516 by Thomas More as a pun meaning both a good place and no place. No place is a perfectly good place. Utopia began from this pessimistic assumption, and one could argue that it has remained on some level a negative concept. As opposed to heaven, it is what people dream about when they have lost faith in the certainty of a paradise to come. It's what we imagine to be perfection in a fallen world, the best of a bad situation.
The worse the situation, the better. Bloodshed and war have been boons to the utopia industry. The show is full of books and treatises emerging from conflict and chaos.
Also urban blight. Hellish cities, rapidly expanding during the industrial 19th century and into the 20th, caused architects and civic philosophers to cook up utopian alternatives. Le Corbusier, Bruno Taut, Frank Lloyd Wright, Tony Garnier. Le Corbusier famously wanted to tear down and rebuild Europe from scratch, to remake central Paris as a gigantic housing project of widely spaced skyscrapers. Au revoir, Opera. Howdy, Co-Op City.
Utopian architecture in this respect has imagined itself to be a sublime engine of social change physically enforced; change the physical conditions of an imperfect thing, a city, and you will make it better. We might think about this for a moment.
Le Corbusier's vision of a clean, disease-free, perfectly regulated urban environment and Hitler's plan for Berlin as an ethnically cleansed, perfectly obedient capital are not the same thing, but the distinction may not be quite as vast we might want to think.
Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the planner of Washington, expressed this thought about the model that Jefferson proposed as a design for the capital of the new United States of America: such regular plans might look good on paper, he said, but on the ground they become "tiresome and insipid."
Or worse. Regularity carried to its logical conclusion is oppression. In the show's catalog, Lyman Tower Sargent of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, points out that some historians view Sparta as utopia's fountainhead. This is an alarming thought because it may be true. Sacrifice, labor and renunciation were Sparta's watchwords. They have been become part of utopia's vocabulary.
Later utopian writers usually promised personal satisfaction for those who stuck to the plan. But the plan still counted above all, which is why utopia and dystopia have not always been easy to tell apart.
Even exceptional 19th-century utopian reformers like Charles Fourier were basically control addicts, although in some ways Fourier was so odd that one might think he was making a mockery of the idea of utopia, not genuinely imagining it.
The show has a whole section on socialist thinkers like Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen and Fourier. Via a kind of private psychological calculus, almost unfathomable now, Fourier divided people into 810 personality types, differently combining what he considered 12 essential passions.
A Fourierist phalanx, or community, was to have one man and one woman of each type: 1,620 people walking around in uniforms with plumes and epaulettes that he designed to designate the different passions, with everyone trading jobs, sometimes several times a day, and bartering with other phalanxes for goods and living in a constant state of sexual stimulation. Before modern capitalists settled on the minimum wage, Fourier proposed a minimum of sexual pleasure as a condition of citizenship.
He remains best known as an economic reformer, but one wonders whether he most richly deserves our attention as a utopian speculator in human relations. His colorful legacy is to the vast history of utopian literature roughly what Plato's Retreat is to the history of social custom in New York, and also a reminder that utopia, any way you want to define it, is about desire of one sort or another.
Somehow, as Fourier illustrates, utopia seems inevitably to slouch toward dystopia. What began with the Garden of Eden and with fantasies of terrestrial paradise became, after the discovery of the New World, speculation about noble savagery and the land of opportunity. The Age of Exploration, which provoked an efflorescence of utopian writing, yielded to reality after the settlers started trying to split up the land. Reveries about perfection on earth soon devolved into colonialism. A clean slate, utopia's most essential component, became another market to exploit.
So the cycle has evolved. Now we have the Internet, a virtual society, the first real no place, speeding from its original state of infinite promise toward some indefinite commercial end. Cloning has also become reality. And we have become more cynical after a century of dystopian catastrophes.
But we still keep dreaming, not necessarily because we believe in the idea of a secular utopia's possible fulfillment but because, well, we seem to need to.
The show's catalog quotes Frederik L. Polak, the Dutch sociologist and utopian philosopher: "If Western man now stops thinking and dreaming the materials of new images of the future and attempts to shut himself up in the present, out of longing for security and for fear of the future, his civilization will come to an end.
"He has no choice but to dream or to die, condemning the whole of Western society to die with him."
There's an answer. Or maybe we keep dreaming up impossible schemes of perfection to remind ourselves that the real world, in its messiness, is the best thing after all.

HEADLINE: Modern Unveils Design for New Outpost in Queens

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
The Museum of Modern Art, which is to close in the summer of 2002 for a full architectural overhaul, unveiled the design for its temporary home in Long Island City, Queens, yesterday.
How long the museum will display its artworks at the provisional site, a former Swingline stapler factory, depends on how long it takes to finish its Midtown Manhattan renovation, designed by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi. That project, which won unanimous approval yesterday from the City Planning Commission, is scheduled to be completed in late 2004 or early 2005. 
 During the intervening years, the former factory will become a mini-museum, a kind of architectural understudy where part of the permanent collection will be displayed and temporary exhibitions housed. At 45-20 33rd Street, off Queens Boulevard, it is just outside the 33rd Street subway stop on the No. 7 line.
The Queens building is to open in the summer of 2002 with an exhibition of some of the Modern's best-known masterworks. Other shows planned include a major Matisse-Picasso show that is to run from mid-February 2003 through May of that year.
Designed by the Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan, the Queens building will provide 25,000 square feet of temporary galleries. Most of it will be almost raw warehouse space, with 20-foot ceilings and walls that will be rearranged on an exhibition-by-exhibition basis. The columns of the original factory will remain as echoes of the building's former life.
A mezzanine with a cafe and a gift shop will open out onto an airy foyer with 22-foot ceilings and a long, leisurely S-shaped ramp leading from the street entrance to the building's ticket booth.
But many visitors' first glimpse of the building will be a giant rooftop "MoMA" sign visible from the elevated No. 7 train as it nears the 33rd Street station from Manhattan.
"From the No. 7 train, the roof is the first facade," said Mr. Maltzan. "I was trying to create a museum space that is iconographically very different, very modern, that is not a destination but a threshold where the movement of the visitor doesn't stop until you come up to the art itself."
Once out of the subway station, visitors will cross Queens Boulevard and walk under a 150-foot-long canopy that will run above the sidewalk, leading to the temporary museum's entrance on 33rd Street.
Mr. Maltzan, 40, a Long Island native who was formerly a senior associate with the firm of the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry, said he wanted the building to reflect what he called the "middle landscape" between the urban and the suburban.
"I was trying to walk a fine line between the anonymous architecture of the area and the clear identity of the museum," he said.
The Modern's expansion project, the most ambitious by a New York museum in decades, will cost $650 million, 10 percent of it provided by the city.
The museum estimates the cost of the Swingline building conversion, including its purchase price, at $28.7 million.
When the artworks return to 53rd Street, the Swingline building will become a study and conservation center, office space and a storehouse for artworks now stored around the city.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS;
A Dialogue From Auschwitz

BYLINE: By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
Books are still man's greatest invention, despite the nonsense so often published between their covers. But their singular marvelousness, I guess, is that there will never be a Harry Potter movie that can reveal the wonder of the story the way the books do. Nor will there ever be a movie, no matter how skillful, that can capture the horror of the concentration camp the way a book can.
I am reminded of the power of this wondrous conception once again by the recent publication of yet another book that gives witness to life in the camps. It's a slim volume, but in reality it is one-half of a conversation across the decades between two men now dead who survived Auschwitz in quite different ways. The unfriendly partners in this dialogue are really discussing, in their separate books, a weighty, barbarous question: How much of one's humanity can a person give up to save his own life? And still be called human? 
 The new book is "Speak You Also: A Survivor's Reckoning" (Metropolitan Books) by Paul Steinberg, who in 1943, at 16, was gathered up in Paris and sent to Auschwitz. It is a disturbing, honest and unapologetic self-examination in response to those questions. This book would never have been written, and indeed no one would ever have heard of its author, had he not been written about by a fellow prisoner, Primo Levi, the Italian novelist, poet, nonfiction writer and chemist, and perhaps the most articulate and literate survivor of the camps.
Here is how he described Steinberg: "inhumanly cunning and incomprehensible like the Serpent in Genesis." That harsh declaration is in Levi's heroic book, "Survival in Auschwitz: The Nazi Assault on Humanity" (Collier, 1961), first published in the United States in 1959 as "If This Is a Man" (Orion Press).
Levi gives Steinberg the name Henri, a young man who was "eminently civilized and sane, and possesses a complete and organic theory on the ways to survive in Lager." Henri saw "three methods open to man to escape extermination which still allow him to retain the name of man: organization, pity and theft."
Henri, Levi wrote, practiced all three. He gained favors (food and cigarettes) from the relatively well-treated English P.O.W.'s. "Seducing" them (not sexually), Levi called it; "cultivating" was Henri's word. Levi explained: "In exchange for a single English cigarette you can make enough in Lager not to starve for a day. Henri was once seen in the act of eating a real hardboiled egg."
Levi wrote that Henri's ability to sympathize with and flatter a person who could help him, be it an English soldier or a German guard, was so natural a gift that "there is no heart so hardened that Henri cannot breach it."
So Henri's protectors were English soldiers, French, Ukrainian and Polish civilian workers, German "politicals," a cook, an SS man, inmate camp leaders, and doctors who, "immediately before selections, and in periods of most laborious work," take him in the hospital "whenever he wants and with the diagnosis he wants." Henri called these hospitalizations periods of "hibernation."
Levi conceded that "to speak with Henri is useful, and pleasant . . . even affection seems possible," but reminds himself that "the next moment his sad smile freezes into a cold grimace . . . and here he is again, intent on his hunt and his struggle; hard and distant, enclosed in armor, the enemy of all."
Now all this seemingly mundane characterization takes place within a world so horrific that among picture makers perhaps only Goya could have captured its charnel house essense.
In such conditions, what is a man's responsibility? To survive, Steinberg says in his own book. He was a tough teenager in that Lager who decided from the first that he was going to live. "I've withdrawn inside my shell; all the vital energy I have left is mobilized for my own survival," he wrote. "I'm at the age where one adjusts, and I economize on everything by getting rid of moral suffering, emotions, memories -- and regrets as well, a crucial imperative."
He goes on: "It's wasteful to give your affection to ghosts on reprieve. Why set yourself up for tears the next day?" Levi does not accuse Steinberg of betraying prisoners, but Steinberg tells of reaching his nadir when, at 18, he was made a camp trusty and one of his duties was to inspect a row of beds to see if they had been properly made up.
He records this scene: An elderly Polish Jew is lying on his bunk. Steinberg orders him out of the bed, but the man cannot move. Steinberg wrote: "Furious, I raise my hand without thinking and slap him. At the last moment, I hold back and my hand grazes his cheek. In that fraction of a second, I sound the abyss." He adds, "If only I could get rid of this memory, sweep it away with my hand."
Primo Levi died in 1987 at 67 in what is generally believed to be a suicide. Paul Steinberg died last December at 73, having lived to see his book published in French, German, Italian and Spanish but not in English. Levi had written: "I know that Henri is living today. I would give much to know his life as a free man, but I do not want to see him again."
Steinberg's editor, Riva Hocherman, said that the writer "actually started trying to write his story as fiction in the 60's, but couldn't do it."
"He underwent some sort of breakdown when he started to confront it," she said. It wasn't until later that he learned of Levi's book when another survivor directed him to it, she said. Ms. Hocherman said that Steinberg's family believes that finally there was correspondence between Levi and Steinberg. Either the family could not find it or has declined to make it public, she said.
It's an unsettling book, from the first page showing Steinberg's fierce will to survive. "He doesn't apologize," Ms. Hocherman said, "but then there's a line he did not cross. He did not betray his own people; he did not send anyone to their death."
In the end, Steinberg concedes that Levi was probably right about him, and says, "I'll never know whether I have the right to ask clemency of the jury." He asks, "Can one be so guilty for having survived?"

HEADLINE: Medicare Premiums and Social Security Will Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Medicare premiums will rise nearly 10 percent next year, to $50 a month, and Social Security checks will grow by 3.5 percent, to cover increases in the cost of living, the government said today.
The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security will be the largest since 1992. 
 For retired workers, the average Social Security benefit will increase next year by $29 a month, to $845 a month, from $816.
Medicare premiums, which are ordinarily deducted from Social Security checks, will rise $4.50 a month. The increase may jolt beneficiaries, who have become accustomed to stable premiums in recent years. The monthly premium is now $45.50, just as in 1999. It was $43.80 in 1997 and 1998.
Medicare provides health care for 39 million people who are 65 or older or disabled. The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security will raise benefits paid each month to 49.4 million people: 45.2 million in the old age, survivors and disability insurance programs, and 4.2 million with low incomes who receive Supplemental Security Income.
Social Security payments are increased to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Medicare premiums rise with spending in Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services, outpatient hospital care, medical equipment and some home health care.
Marilyn Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute, said the rise in Medicare premiums came as elderly people faced increases in many health care expenses.
Those costs, Ms. Moon said, include the patient's share of the bill for services covered by Medicare; premiums for private insurance to supplement Medicare, and prescription drugs, which are generally not covered outside a hospital stay.
Taken together, Ms. Moon said, the increase in Medicare premiums and other health care costs would eat up much of the increase in Social Security benefits.
But Thomas R. Saving, an economist at Texas A&M University, said, "Some Social Security recipients will be better off than they were before because the cost-of-living adjustment overcompensates for the actual rise in prices."

HEADLINE: Pace of Inflation Picks Up Even as Economy Seems to Slow

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Inflation is now on pace for its largest annual jump in a decade, the government reported yesterday, although the price increases remain largely confined to energy costs.
The report further complicates the picture of an economy that seems to be slowing even as inflation, one of the most common effects of rapid growth, is rising more rapidly than economists have anticipated. 
 The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in September and is now growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The last year in which inflation topped 3.5 percent was 1990, when it reached 6.1 percent.
The closely watched core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, stood at 0.3 percent in September, up from 0.2 percent, where it has been since April. Much of its growth came in the costs of clothing and tobacco. Analysts said the change reflected conditions specific to those industries and did not suggest that the tripling of oil prices over the last two years is causing widespread price increases in other sectors.
"Over all, the numbers aren't good, but the details are less alarming," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
The report adds to the uncertainty about whether the 10-year economic expansion is waning. On the one hand, stock prices have been falling for much of the last six months, and several big-name companies, including I.B.M. on Tuesday, have recently announced lower-than-expected sales. On the other, the United States unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent last month, tying a 30-year low, while inflation is rising about twice as quickly as it did in the late 1990's.
The Federal Open Market Committee has kept short-term interest rates steady at 6.5 percent at its last three meetings. Most recently, the committee said it was more likely to raise rates in the coming months, to ward off inflation, than it was to lower them in an attempt to give the economy a boost.
Separately, the Social Security Administration announced yesterday that it would lift retirees' benefits by 3.5 percent in December, based on inflation data for the last 12 months. That is the largest cost-of-living adjustment since 1991.
Still, few economists saw major reason for alarm in the inflation numbers. Energy prices -- which account for about one out of every $14 that consumers spend -- rose 3.8 percent and are almost 20 percent higher than they were last year. But crude oil prices have fallen somewhat in the first half of this month, suggesting that gasoline and home heating costs will drop as well, said Patrick C. Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who specializes in the consumer index.
Furthermore, there is only slight evidence that rising energy prices have caused companies to charge more for other goods, as happened during the oil shocks of the 1970's.
The evidence is mainly in the service sector, where prices have risen over the last year by 3.7 percent. "This does reflect some spillover from higher energy costs," said Mark Vitner, a vice president at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Over the last year, hourly wages in the United States have grown about 2 percent -- or 1.5 percentage points less than inflation -- and workers are starting to demand raises to help them cover the new costs, Mr. Vitner said. Wages represent the largest portion of costs for many services companies.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Gyrations in a Confused and Divided Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Some investors gave up and got out yesterday morning, creating one of the worst openings ever for the American stock market. Prices soon rallied, but the Dow Jones industrial average still closed under 10,000 for the first time since March.
The wild gyrations reflected one of the most confused and divided stock markets in memory, in which hopes that the market is about to rise again are balanced by worries that weakness in technology stocks may presage a bear market and a sharp slowing in the economy that will decimate corporate profits. 
 "People are asking themselves if this is the end of the sell-off," said William Rhodes, the chief equity strategist for Williams Capital. At the same time, he added, there is fear that stock prices had reflected overly optimistic expectations about earnings growth in coming years.
During the last six weeks, stock prices have fallen sharply across much of the market, with some well-known stocks, like Yahoo and Apple Computer, losing more than half their value amid signs that growth is slowing for many technology companies. That weakness, amplified into 80 percent or larger declines for some smaller stocks, has led to forced selling as some investors tried to contain their losses.
Worries about high oil prices -- which were intensified by a report of low inventories released Tuesday night -- also have contributed to the nervousness of investors. Oil for November delivery rose 49 cents yesterday to $33.48 a barrel.
At the opening yesterday, the selling was intense. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 435 points, or 4.3 percent, within the first 19 minutes of trading, bottoming at 9,654.64. The more volatile Nasdaq composite index was off 5.8 percent.
And then the market turned around. Within a couple of hours, the Nasdaq index had erased its entire loss and was up a bit for the day. The Dow was still down, but all of the decline could be attributed to two stocks with bad news: I.B.M. and J. P. Morgan. I.B.M. reported disappointing revenue while J. P. Morgan was hurt by losses in venture capital investments at Chase Manhattan, which is acquiring Morgan.
By the close, the Dow was down 114.69 points, to 9,975.02. But nearly all of that decline was caused by I.B.M., and there were as many Dow stocks with gains as there were with losses. The Nasdaq index ended down 1.3 percent, a relatively small move in this very volatile time, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off just over 0.5 percent.
The Wall Street rebound had immediate international effects as well. European stocks, which had been sliding, generally turned around about the same time. But, perhaps in an indication that some of the buying of American stocks came from abroad, the euro also began to fall, hitting a record low against the dollar for the first time since central banks intervened to support the currency last month. The euro traded as low as 83.3 cents.
I.B.M., which ended the day down $17.56, to $95.44 a share, disappointed investors with a profit report that showed revenue running below expectations. But even as I.B.M. was plunging in early trading, the Dow was getting some support from Intel, which ended up $2, to $38.19. Its actual profit report was not as bad as it had led analysts to fear last month, and that strength helped to buoy investors.
"You do see companies that are trying to find bottoms here," said Giri Devalupally, a technology analyst at T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company. He pointed to the gains yesterday in both Intel and Dell Computer, each of which has lost more than half its value since peaking earlier in the year.
Coming into yesterday, much attention was focused on Sun Microsystems, which was scheduled to release profits after the market closed. But in mid-morning it put a bullish headline about its earnings on its Internet site, sending the stock leaping 10 percent, to $118.75, in 20 minutes, as analysts struggled to extrapolate the underlying profit numbers from a headline. Trading was soon halted, and the full profit release was issued. Sun rose a bit more, then sagged as some analysts voiced concern that its gross profit margins had fallen. By the close, the shares were back down to $110.31, off $1.06 for the day.
Even while technology stocks have bounced wildly in recent weeks on each new piece of evidence regarding the state of demand, other shares have been helped by the fact that optimism for the overall stock market remains strong among many investors.
Ever since the 1987 crash -- whose 13th anniversary is today -- big falls in stocks have been viewed as buying opportunities, and investors have been willing to come in when prices fall sharply. Ameritrade, an online brokerage firm, reported that during the nine trading sessions before yesterday, its traders were net buyers on every day except last Friday, when some took profits on a strong rebound that gave the Nasdaq market its second-best day ever.
David Bowers, the chief global investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, noted that some investors were taking heart from the fact that both the Dow and the Nasdaq indexes had approached the spring lows last week, and again yesterday, before stabilizing and turning up.
Trying to analyze the market now is difficult because the end of October is the time that most mutual funds close their tax books for the year. That has created selling pressure as some funds have taken capital losses that can be used to offset capital gains taken earlier in the year on other stocks.
Just which stock funds have losses can vary widely, reflecting the huge gains many had before stocks began to fall. Lucent Technologies, for example, is down more than two-thirds from the high it reached late last year, but it is still trading for more than twice its value of four years ago. Intel is down about half from the peak it reached in September, but is still twice where it was two years ago. Microsoft traded at a two-year low this week for the first time in its history, but is still far above where it was three or four years ago.
All those stocks still have Wall Street adherents and clearly will remain major companies for years to come. The worst losses have come as nearly all investors have abandoned some of last year's Internet plays. For example, Stamps.com, a company that sells postage over the Internet, has seen turmoil in top management ranks and now sells for less than $3 a share, down from a high of $98.50 last November and less than half the amount of cash per share the company has in the bank.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Handily Beats Estimates, Aided by Windows

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Pointing to the strongest quarter ever for its Windows operating system, Microsoft yesterday surpassed analysts' earnings estimates for the latest quarter.
After the stock market closed, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 46 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year earlier and handily topping analysts' expectations of 41 cents, as reported to the First Call/Thomson Financial market research firm. 
 While the world's largest independent software company repeated its familiar cautions about potential perils of the global economy, it also said the quarter's results indicated that no slowdown in the desktop personal computer market loomed on the horizon.
The subject of whether the PC industry is moving away from its historical double-digit growth rate and toward becoming a replacement business and whether Microsoft will become a victim of the much heralded "Post-PC Era" is a perennial one for analysts who follow the company.
The company's revenue growth, year to year, jumped from 8 percent to 11 percent, said John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer.
"It feels good to be back in double-digit growth," he said. "The king is not dead."
Analysts, however, cautioned that while Microsoft's numbers for the quarter were strong, they were not stellar and that in the future the company would continue to grapple with the fact that its desktop software business is a mature one.
"When all is said and done, the quarter was a little better than expected," said Andrew Brosseau, an analyst at SG Cowan Securities in Boston. "But while you can push these numbers around, the company is still pulling a legacy business which accounts for 70 percent of their revenue, and that is not likely to accelerate."
For its first fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 30, the company announced income before an accounting change of $2.58 billion, compared with $2.19 billion for the quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter reached $5.8 billion, up from $5.38 billion a year ago.
In a conference call with analysts, the company said it believed it would be able to maintain its growth rate.
"It seems likely that revenue will be up in the low teens" year to year, Mr. Connors said, and up in the high teens quarter to quarter.
Microsoft stock closed at $51.75, up $1.31, on volume of 55.3 million shares in Nasdaq trading. The shares rose a further 5 percent in after-hours trading. Mr. Connors also said he expected Microsoft earnings for its full fiscal year to come in slightly higher than the current consensus analyst estimate of $1.88 a share because of stronger-than-expected performance in its first quarter.
Microsoft did not reveal the adoption rate of its new Windows 2000 operating system, which is aimed at the corporate market, or its Windows ME program, intended for home users.
Windows 2000, introduced this spring, has generally received high marks from corporate users, though many analysts have said those users have been cautious.
In contrast, Windows ME has generally played to lackluster press reviews.
Yesterday the company gave some indication of large corporate commitments to the Windows 2000 program, citing customers like NASA, Siemens and Motorola, each of which is planning to deploy tens of thousands of copies of the program.
During the conference call the company also referred to weakness in its European business, which is experiencing both slower growth and currency conversion issues. Revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa declined from $1.18 billion for the first quarter of 1999 to $1.08 billion in the latest quarter.
Microsoft had its strongest growth in Asia, where revenue rose 19 percent, to $708 million. The company said that much of the growth reflected language-specific versions of Office 2000 and its corporate NT and Windows 2000 operating systems.
The company also said that first-quarter income from its investment portfolio increased to $1.13 billion from $550 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
In a speech at an industry conference yesterday in Orlando, Fla., Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said the company expected to win its battle with the Justice Department.
Microsoft is now appealing a federal judge's order to split the company into competing operating systems and applications businesses.
"We remain convinced we will not be broken up," Mr. Ballmer said, "and we are not putting a lot of energy on it. It is not really a question we spend time dwelling on. It is not actionable for us."
Mr. Ballmer said the company's most significant challenge remained finding and keeping talented people.
"The greatest challenge is in attracting, retaining and developing incredible people," he said. "The transient nature of the work force has been a challenge for us."

HEADLINE: In Streets and Parliament, Calls for Philippine President's Ouster

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Cries for the ouster of President Joseph Estrada resounded in the halls of power and on the streets here today as opposition legislators filed a resolution to impeach him on charges of taking bribes from gambling rackets.
A few hours later, about 15,000 demonstrators massed in Manila's financial district to demand Mr. Estrada's resignation. Confetti streamed from the windows of the stock exchange as the ebullient crowd chanted and waved banners that said "Oust Estrada" and "No to corruption and cronyism." 
 For all the clamor, there is a growing recognition here that the drive to remove Mr. Estrada will be long and grueling and may well fail. The Philippine peso and the stock market plunged to fresh lows today as the political establishment appeared to dig in for a protracted siege.
"I think this will drag on, and the economy will continue to suffer," said Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the Philippine vice president, who broke with Mr. Estrada and now heads a coalition of opposition leaders.
The lawmaker who introduced the impeachment resolution, Heherson T. Alvarez, conceded he did not have enough votes to move it out of the House of Representatives, which is dominated by allies of the president.
Mr. Alvarez said he hoped that enough of those legislators would defect from the increasingly discredited Mr. Estrada to pass the resolution. But even in the Senate, which would conduct a trial, a loose alliance of supporters could enable the president to escape conviction and keep his job.
"He's hoping this will blow over, like the other scandals blew over," said Feliciano Belmonte, the House minority leader.
Mr. Estrada, 63, has denied accepting any kickbacks from gambling rings. Today, he again refused to resign. Speaking to a friendly audience of former squatters who had been helped by a government housing project, he said: "I will help you all the way. Hopefully, you will do the same for me."
The president's troubles began last week when a provincial governor, Luis Singson, accused him of accepting more than $8 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling rings. Mr. Singson portrayed the president as a rapacious man who lives a twilight existence of heavy drinking and marathon mah-jongg games.
Advisers to Mr. Estrada noted that Mr. Singson, who says he made illegal payoffs to the president, was hardly a reputable witness. They said Mr. Estrada would respond to his claims in the impeachment proceeding.
Some political analysts said legal machinations would have little bearing on the president's survival. They said Mr. Estrada would lose his grip on power only if the economy suffers so badly as a result of the scandal that the country's poor begin to feel the pinch.
"The most immediate impact is the downward pressure on the peso," said Walden F. Bello, an economist at the University of the Philippines. "This hurts us because we are so dependent on imports."
Aware that their country is competing with Indonesia for the title of sick man of Asia, opposition leaders are uniting behind Vice President Arroyo, who would succeed Mr. Estrada if he steps down or is removed from office. They said they planned to develop policies that could be swiftly carried out by a new government.
Mr. Estrada was elected to a six-year term that expires in 2004; he cannot run again.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: SUBWAY SERIES;
If Yankees And Mets Are Up, Dow Isn't

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Investors, watch out. There's a Subway Series coming. And that has meant, in the past anyway, that the stock market will most likely have a subpar year. Even worse, the Mets are going to be in it. When the Mets make it to the World Series, it is usually a good time to get out of the stock market.
Perhaps that reflects the fact that New York, the financial capital of the country, is distracted from its usual focus -- making money -- by the excitement of an interborough fight for baseball dominance, or even by the novelty of seeing the often-hapless Mets winning a pennant. 
 Or, more likely, it means nothing at all. The idea that baseball results should affect the stock market is not, on its face, an especially reasonable one.
Nonetheless, the record is there, and the Dow did have a bad day yesterday, the day after the Yankee victory Tuesday night confirmed that there would be a Subway Series.
This will be the 14th subway World Series, albeit the first since 1956 and the first involving the Mets. After, the previous 13 such series, 10 won by the Yankees, two by the New York Giants and one by the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by an average of 6 percent from the end of October through the end of the following October, when a new World Series champion was crowned.
That is not a horrible performance, but it is not nearly as good as the record in years when there was not a Subway Series. In those years, encompassing the years following 82 World Series (the Series wasn't played in 1904 and 1994), the average gain has been 7.6 percent.
In other words, having a Subway Series means that the stock market will, on average, do 1.6 percentage points less well than if there is not a Subway Series.
The Mets have never been in a Subway Series before, and they have only been in three previous Series. The first came in 1969, during what was then the longest economic expansion in American history, one that had lasted more than eight years. As it happened, that expansion ended a month after the Mets had surprisingly beaten the Baltimore Orioles, and a recession began in December 1969. By the end of October 1970, the Dow was down 11.7 percent. The current economic expansion, which is now more than nine years old, has replaced the 1961 to 1969 period as the longest expansion in history.
The next Mets appearance in the World Series came in 1973, when they lost to the Oakland A's. That same month saw an Arab-Israeli war, followed by an Arab oil embargo. Oil prices shot up to previously unheard of heights and the economy fell into a recession in November, the month after the Mets lost the World Series. By the end of October 1974, the Dow was down 30.4 percent as Wall Street entered its worst bear market since the Great Depression.
The Mets' third World Series appearance -- and the only one not quickly followed by a recession -- came in 1986, when the Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox. The stock market rallied impressively in the months after that series -- only to crash in October 1987. Still, the stock market ended October 1987 up 6.2 percent from a year earlier. That is a bit below par, but a lot better than after the Mets' first two World Series appearances.
The Yankees have, of course, been in more World Series than any other team. This will be the 37th World Series featuring the Bronx Bombers, who have won 25 World Series. In general, a Yankee World Series appearance has been a good omen for the stock market -- so long as the National League was represented by a team from out of town. In the years after a Yankee appearance against a non-New York team, the Dow has risen by an average of 12.4 percent, or more than twice as well as it has done following the average Subway Series.
The most recent Subway Series, in 1956, also came during the month of an Arab-Israeli war -- this one the Israeli invasion of the Sinai Peninsula after Egypt had seized the Suez Canal. The Yankees won that series, and the stock market fell 8.1 percent over the next year.
In fact, whether the opponent was from New York, the Dow has tended to do better when the Yankees lost in the World Series than when they won. And while the market has not done very well after any Mets appearances, its worst showing was after the Series they lost. The conclusion: any investor who believes that baseball can influence the stock market should be rooting for the Mets.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
AOL and Time Warner Slightly Beat Profit Estimates

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
With just a month or two before their proposed merger is expected to be consummated, America Online and Time Warner each posted quarterly earnings yesterday that were largely as expected. But the top management of both companies spent much of the day trying to counter the pessimism on Wall Street.
They argued that they would not be hurt by any slowdown in advertising by Internet companies and indeed had already discovered ways that their combination would accelerate their growth. 
 "We will be able to achieve more value creation for shareholders together than either of us could achieve alone," Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chief executive, said in a two-hour meeting with analysts yesterday morning at the Time Life Building in Manhattan to discuss Time Warner's results. That was followed by a lunch for journalists and an hourlong conference call yesterday afternoon to discuss America Online's results.
The executives were reacting to the increasing doubts about the companies' prospects implicit in their stock prices. On Tuesday, Time Warner's shares fell 16 percent and America Online's shares fell 17 percent. Both media and Internet stocks have been hard hit as investors worry that economic uncertainties, particularly the dot-com downturn, could hurt ad sales.
Stephen M. Case, the chairman of America Online, argued that the advertising client lists of both companies were quite diversified, with established companies outnumbering start-ups. "We have looked at our vulnerability to the dot-com sector, and only a few percentage points are potentially at risk," Mr. Case said in an interview. "Some businesses don't succeed, but other ones come to take their place. That's no different on the Internet than on television or with billboards."
Yesterday, as media company shares gained but most Internet companies saw their stocks fall further, the shares of Time Warner and America Online rebounded. Time Warner's stock rose $3.69, to $69.25, and America Online was up $3.31, to $46.91. After hours, America Online's shares rose as high as $51.
Mr. Levin also sought to reassure investors that the companies were "highly confident" that they would pass their review by federal regulators without debilitating conditions and would close the deal before the end of the year.
Last week, the merger was approved by European regulators, but only after Time Warner withdrew its proposed joint venture in music publishing with EMI. Mr. Levin said the companies hoped to renegotiate a deal with EMI and submit it again to European regulators next year.
Analysts said the results posted by both companies were mixed but generally on track with expectations. Both slightly beat their earnings-per-share forecasts. But Time Warner fell short of expected revenue. And America Online's closely watched advertising backlog -- a measure of contracts for revenue in future quarters -- showed no growth in the quarter. But in a period when companies big and small are announcing significant shortfalls, analysts took that as good news.
"In this market coming in at expectations is significant when so many companies are not able to do that," said Paul W. Noglows, an analyst at Chase H&Q.
Specifically, America Online earned $345 million, up from $181 million a year earlier, an increase of 91 percent. Its revenue grew 34 percent, to $2 billion.
Excluding one-time items and certain tax breaks, the company earned 14 cents a share, higher than the 13 cents analysts expected.
Time Warner earned $85 million, down 76 percent from a year earlier. Last year, Time Warner had a number of unusual items including a $477 million gain related to the sale of cable systems. Its revenue was $6.9 billion, up 3 percent, but substantially shy of Wall Street's expectations of $7.3 billion.
On a per-share basis, excluding one-time items, the company earned 7 cents a share, higher than the 4 cents that Wall Street expected.
In any case, the company prefers for investors to look at its operating cash flow -- earnings before taxes and some noncash accounting charges -- adjusted to remove one-time items. By that measure, the company's operating cash flow was $1.27 billion, up 13 percent.
The companies said they had completed a joint business plan and budget, in anticipation of the merger, and they reiterated their aggressive targets for future growth.
Mr. Levin said the combined company wanted its operating profit to increase 30 percent next year and 25 percent in subsequent years.
"It's significant, given everything that is happening in the market, that they didn't back away from their forecasts," Mr. Noglows said. "This company wants to grow faster than other diversified media companies, which have growth rates in the high teens and low 20's."
Both companies said advertising represented their fastest-growing source of revenue. Time Warner's advertising revenue grew 17 percent, to $1.3 billion. The same category at America Online increased 80 percent, to $649 million.
Subscriber growth at America Online continued to be brisk, despite even more aggressive competition from Microsoft's MSN service. Its flagship America Online service added 1.4 million subscribers in the quarter to 24.6 million worldwide, as international growth made up for a slowdown in the United States.
At Time Warner, cable systems and networks, which include HBO and CNN, were the strongest divisions. Cash flow declined 6 percent in the company's movie studio, its largest division by revenue. But its Warner Music division, which has been struggling, increased cash flow by 10 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Buoyant Gore Camp Wants to Rerun Debate on Cable

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Sensing that Vice President Al Gore's debate performance on Tuesday night has revived his candidacy, Mr. Gore's advisers said today that they wanted to buy 90 minutes of time on cable television channels in various swing states to rebroadcast the entire debate.
The move is part of the campaign's action plan, built around the slogan "The Big Choice: Prosperity For All," and inaugurating the final three-week push toward Election Day. 
 The plan is based on the premise that Mr. Gore's debate performance was unusually strong and provided the vice president ammunition both to make the case for himself as the best steward of the nation's economy and to make the case against Gov. George W. Bush as someone who would bankrupt Social Security and give most tax cuts to the rich.
The campaign began broadcasting three new television commercials today that underscored these themes. The commercials are running in 12 swing states and will be reinforced by three major speeches in the next few days -- an economic speech on Thursday in New York and speeches on Saturday in New Orleans and on Sunday in Dallas about his priorities and how they reflect his values. Except for a brief stop on Saturday in Washington to watch his son play football, Mr. Gore is expected to be on the road continuously until Election Day, Nov. 7.
Campaign officials were clearly pleased with Mr. Gore's performance in the debate, which most polls showed the vice president had won.
Virtually crowing about Mr. Gore's performance, Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said: "Last night allayed a lot of concerns." He said that the debate had fortified Gore representatives today as they met with Democrats on Capitol Hill who had been worried about Mr. Gore's previously weak debates and sagging poll numbers.
"We're going to move votes based on last night's debate," Mr. Fabiani said.
Gore officials contend that Mr. Bush made two major blunders in the debate. The governor agreed that "of course" most of his tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, because, as Mr. Bush said, they are the ones who pay the most taxes. And he said that his plan to privatize part of Social Security would cost $1 trillion, money that would come from the Social Security trust fund -- an admission that Mr. Gore said today essentially conceded that Mr. Bush would bankrupt Social Security in 23 years, 14 years sooner than was now projected.
A newly plucky Mr. Gore appeared on the campaign trail today as he traveled from Missouri to Iowa to Michigan and headed for New York late tonight.
"Social Security is on the ballot this fall," Mr. Gore told about 200 people in Des Moines. As if speaking to Mr. Bush, he added: "Don't promise it away. Don't use fuzzy math. You promise the same trillion to two different groups. That's fuzzy math. You want to talk about fuzzy math, that's plenty fuzzy." Mr. Bush had accused Mr. Gore in the first debate of using "fuzzy math."
At an outdoor rally here tonight, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of being in the pocket of the big drug companies. "He does what they want," Mr. Gore roared to the crowd of thousands. "That's just the hard truth."
But Mr. Gore was well aware that he also had to battle negative impressions that Mr. Bush sought to raise about him during the debate -- one, that Mr. Gore was an advocate of big government and, two, that he did not understand that younger entrepreneurial-minded voters wanted to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
Mr. Gore sought to reassure his audience that he did not want to expand government. "I'll make our government smaller and smarter," he pledged. He said he would do this in part by putting many government services online. "I want create a federal government where you never have to stand in line because you can get it online."
On the subject of investing Social Security, Nancy Nichols, an older voter in Des Moines, said she was concerned that Mr. Gore had not made his position plain enough. She said that a young Republican had told her that in the time that he had paid $9,000 into Social Security, he had also invested $9,000 in stocks -- and that those stocks were now worth $18,000. "Under your plan, they still would have that opportunity if they were willing to save, but I don't think that part of your plan or that message has gotten across," Ms. Nichols told the vice president.
Mr. Gore mocked the idea of older people investing their Social Security in the stock market. He gestured to Winnie Skinner, 79, a Des Moines resident whom he made famous last month because she recycled aluminum cans for extra money, who was sitting in today's audience, and said, "So, are you ready to get on the Internet and be a day-trader, Winnie?"
Ms. Skinner said in response, "What's that?"

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Rupert Murdoch lends his voice to those worried about a cooling of television ad spending.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
AFTER years of white-hot intensity, most recently driven by a media buying frenzy by start-up dot-com companies, the television advertising marketplace is cooling by almost all accounts.
While some network executives have disputed some earlier reports of weakening in the ad marketplace, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, openly acknowledged that the issue was becoming a problem when he predicted yesterday at a shareholders meeting in Australia that advertising sales for his television company in the United States, the Fox Entertainment Group, "look a little uncertain." 
 Mr. Murdoch also said that the sale of shares in the News Corporation's satellite-TV unit, Sky Global Networks, originally scheduled for next month, would be delayed at least several more months. American depository receipts of the News Corporation fell $2.81 yesterday, to $40.69.
As for the advertising marketplace, Mr. Murdoch said, "There are signs of weakness in the next couple of months," and he openly attributed that to a falloff in spending by Internet businesses.
The remarks illustrated a concern that has spread throughout the television industry over the last several weeks as network television, coming off a record selling spree last spring, began picking up signs that advertisers were beginning to look for ways to temper spending going into the first quarter of next year and even to cut back on some commitments made for the fourth quarter this year.
Those concerns have been presumed to be behind a sharp sell-off in shares for some media companies this week, including Viacom and Time Warner. But many of the media companies, and specifically those two, rebounded impressively yesterday.
Network executives will be scrutinizing what advertisers decide in the next few weeks during what is called the option period, when advertisers have an opportunity to pull back some of the money they pledged to the networks last spring during the upfront buying season.
"The marketplace right now is in a wait-and-see position," said Alex Wallau, the president of ABC. "People may start looking to make better deals for themselves down the road, but that happens all the time."
This year, however, a record amount of ad money was committed upfront at record prices. A significant factor in that heavy spending was the implied threat to some advertisers that if they did not snap up the time being offered by the networks it might be gobbled up by dot-com companies at even higher prices later in the year -- as happened last year.
Jack Myers, the chief economist for The Myers Report, an industry newsletter, noted that, "up to 50 to 70 percent of the money put up by venture capitalists to start up these new- media companies got passed through in spending on traditional media." He added, "That's over now."
Mr. Myers said he was forecasting a downturn in growth in ad revenue for the broadcast networks in 2001, falling from growth of 9 percent this year to just 3 percent next year. He called it "reality setting in."
Jessica Reif-Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch, said, "Of course there is a slowdown in the overall ad market." But she said that slowdown should be regarded as a return to more normal levels of ad spending after a period inflated by the dot-com businesses. "This was like a special event, like the Olympics. Nobody in their right mind would expect that to happen again."
She argued that other circumstances, like the Olympics on NBC, the presidential election and the delayed start to the fall television season were all having a negative effect on advertiser spending. "I think when all that clears out, we'll see a better picture," she said.
But some executives said the advertising falloff might be tied to specific performance of companies in the stock market and their desire to present strong earnings reports to protect their stock prices. Traditionally, if a company sees a potential earnings problems, it may seek to improve its bottom line by cutting advertising costs, at least temporarily.
One longtime senior advertising executive said, "Tell me what the earnings reports are going to be in the next few months and I'll tell you what shape the advertising market is going to be in."
Tom Wolzien, a media analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said any pullback in advertising commitments would most likely not be felt first at the network level. "This stuff usually cracks up from the bottom," he said. "I would expect local stations and small cable networks to be hit first."
There have been enough hints of some cracks in recent weeks to stir at least some concerns at the network level, Mr. Wallau said. "We are not at Defcon-4 mode or whatever the horrific Defcon number is. But we're definitely not comfortable."

Giving it just a moment's thought, Allen Sherman minced no words yesterday in relating what to him was irrefutable common knowledge.
"Yankee fans are much more highly educated," he said, standing with his wife and friends on a street corner in Midtown. "We have to be. It's harder to spell Yankees than Mets. And we can curse in so many different languages. We earn more, so when we throw a beer can it's those high-priced beer cans." 
 Mr. Sherman, 69, retired from the furnace business, grew up in the Bronx and was up from Florida for the 50th reunion of his Bronx stickball team. "I don't talk to Mets fans," he said. "I mean, they look like us. Some of them even talk like us. But they're not us."
Fred Sayed, 26, a technical support manager from Queens and a Met fan, was able to be pretty explicit himself in defining Yankee fans: "All Yankee fans are just flat-out stupid."
Now that the baseball gods have finally delivered the Subway Series that New Yorkers have prayed for, those two distinctive and combative camps, the fans who worship in the Bronx and those who pay homage in Queens, are at the raucous forefront of city life. But what taxonomic groups do these two species belong to? Can you even find a classification for them, especially a printable one?
Anthropological studies of these creatures being in appallingly short supply, one makes do with what's available. A New York Times/CBS News poll of adults in New York State that asked people whom they root for and then looked at who they are is one piece of insight.
The poll was conducted late last October, when the Yankees were already playing in the big show and the Mets were sulking. It's entirely possible that certain Mets fans, wanting to be part of something good, chose at that moment to align belatedly with the Yankees, and that others were simply too abashed to confess that they were Met fans.
But who would want those sorts of fans anyway?
It was small surprise that significantly more New Yorkers said that they were Yankee fans than Met fans. But a stunning one-fifth of those polled said that they didn't care one bit about either team and somehow found other things to do with their lives. That's more than the number of people who confirmed that they were Met fans. More than a third admitted, risking eternal expiation, that they cheered equally hard for both the Mets and the Yankees.
There's an old presumption, subscribed to by fans of both, that the Mets attract blue-collar workers while the Yankees are the team of the white-collar world.
Diana Violaris, 25, a secretary from Nutley, N.J.: "When I think of Mets fans, I see them like the team. Just a bunch of regular blue-collar guys who have seen struggle and work extra hard to be respected."
William Smith, a Yankee fan from Maplewood, N.J.: "Yankee fans are less emotional about the game, less rowdy and more cultured. I believe it's the dignity of the unchanged uniform that correlates into the fans. Upper-class people who enjoy winning and the finer things from life." (O.K., then why the big security detail out at the Stadium?)
It turns out the poll found no significant difference in education or affluence of either group. If you want to be picky, a higher percentage of Met fans had postgraduate degrees.
Yankee fans are often thought to be older types with families, while Met fans are reputed to be swinging bachelors. The Times poll actually found that Met fans were slightly older, and there was little difference in the marital status of the groups.
A majority of Yankee fans, the Times poll said, are women, while a majority of Met fans are men, a finding that several fans interviewed yesterday suggested had something to do with the Yankees' having cuter players. One fan said the Yankees were better dressed. Many others were quick to discount all of that.
So far as political leanings, the poll suggested that a higher proportion of Met fans were Republicans than was the case with Yankee fans. Yankee fans had a greater number of independents. Met fans were more likely to be moderate politically, and Yankee fans had a greater number of liberals.
On the street, people had other things to say. Roddel West, 22, unemployed for the moment, and his friend Will Cowan, 31, a hospital maintenance worker, both from Brooklyn, felt confident about what defined a Yankee fan.
"The Yankee fan is more traditional and more hard-working," Mr. Cowan said. "The Mets fan is more brash and cocky, but what have you done in 14 years? Mets fans talk a lot, but they don't say anything."
Mr. West said: "I think Mets fans don't know as much about baseball. They know 1986 and that's it."
Mr. Cowan said: "They don't even know how to celebrate. When they won, they didn't know, do I hug or do I slap? They don't even know how to give a professional interview."
He went on: "My best friend at work is a Mets fan. He doesn't have the background. He just jumped on the bandwagon. He's just going with the flow. Whatever he sees on SportsCenter that night is what he talks about. I don't know what it is with Mets fans."
Mr. West said: "It has something to do with Queens. I have a friend. He was a Yankee fan. He recently moved to Queens and now he's a Mets fan. We don't talk much anymore."
Mr. Cowan said: "More Mets fans are bachelors. Yankee fans are family people."
Mr. West said: "That's because it's bad to come home from a game when you lose and yell at your wife and kids. You don't have to do that as a Yankee fan. The Yankees don't lose."
What are you guys?
"We're both single," Mr. Cowan said.
The Mets' circle of fans has always been identified as heavily suburban. But a study of people who actually went to the games, done in 1998 by the city's Independent Budget Office, came up with some curious findings. More Met fans came from New York City than did Yankee fans. Almost a quarter of Yankee fans arrived from New Jersey, about double as many as those who went to Mets games. About a fourth of Met fans at the games were from Long Island, while the Yankees got fewer than 10 percent from the Island.
A mere 6 percent of Yankee fans came from the Bronx. Even the Mets pulled 3 percent from the Yankees' home borough.
Doug Drotman, a vice president at the National Media Group, a Manhattan sports marketing business, said that his own studies suggested that geography was a major predictor of team allegiance. If you grew up in Long Island or Queens, you rooted for the Mets. If you grew up in Staten Island or Brooklyn long enough ago, chances are you cheered for the Dodgers and moved on to the Mets. New Jersey and Manhattan, he said, are tossups, though they lean toward the Yankees.
"If your parents were a rabid fan of either, you were going to go to the games of whichever team they rooted for," Mr. Drotman said. "But if your parents were not a big fan of either, you were going to take to whichever stadium it was easier to get to."
Stuart Gordon, 42, an avowed Met fan who stocks groceries at a supermarket, saw a difference in attitude. "Mets fans are more humble," he said. "The Yankee fans are more arrogant. When the Mets win, they're saying, oh it's lucky. When the Yankees win, it's never luck. C'mon."
Could it be genetic? Who knows? Mr. Gordon's brother, Allan, 48, grew up in the same house in Queens, same parents, and yet he's a Yankee fan. What gives?
"I always seemed to take the underdog," Stuart said. "He always took the good team."
Why?
"I was more quiet," he said. "He was more outgoing. I guess I didn't want a lot of people to notice. Not many people noticed a Mets fan."
Then there are all those New Yorkers who claim that they are capable of rooting jointly for both teams.
Neil Rothfeld, 47, is a lawyer from Manhattan. He grew up in Brooklyn and became a fan just after the Dodgers rudely left town. He became a Yankee fan. When the Mets came into existence, they were lovable losers. He decided, big deal, he would cheer for them too.
He said he honestly doesn't care which team wins. "I just want a great Series," he said. "I want it to go seven games."
There may be unrest in his household. His daughter, 9, is a Yankee fan and only a Yankee fan. He attributes that to the fact that the first game he took her to was a Yankee game. His son, 7, is a Met fan. "Whatever his sister does, he does the opposite," Mr. Rothfeld explained.
As he pondered the divided loyalties of so many New Yorkers, he simply said: "I try to embrace both sides. I want to have peace."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: SUBWAY SERIES;
With the Help of the Series, Giuliani Giddily Finds His Inner 7-Year-Old

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
How much time will Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani devote to the Subway Series during the next week? "As much as possible," the lame-duck mayor and lifelong Yankee fan swiftly replied.
In the last 48 hours, Mr. Giuliani, the self-anointed first fan, has giddily wrapped himself up in the Subway Series. He sees it as all good things to Rudy: boyhood fantasy, cancer therapy, partisan politics, sound economics and a boost for his dream of ever more baseball stadiums. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani devoted 20 minutes of a 30-minute City Hall news conference to the Yankees, the Mets and insisting that his deputy mayors wear baseball caps. "Come on, Rudy, put your Met hat on," he said to Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington.
The mayor was predictably bundled up in a Yankee warm-up jacket and a Yankees baseball cap. As a Yankees fan since toddlerhood, he said he had to root for them. Still, he was careful to be flanked by two Met fans, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, and Claire Shulman, the borough president of Queens.
"If the Mets win, we lift term limits for the City Council," Mr. Giuliani said. "If the Yankees win, we could lift term limits for the mayor."
The day before Mr. Giuliani ended a speech about a new cancer project by saying, "Now I'm going to go back and think about the Yankees, because that's all I can think about today."
He cheerfully added that he would tell his prostate cancer doctors "that this is the best therapy for cancer."
"It's absolutely terrific," he said.
Mr. Giuliani has fallen into similar boyish spells, indulged by his staff, every October since 1995, the first in the Yankees' six straight years in the playoffs. But this time, Mr. Giuliani has seemed to reach new levels of ecstasy as he presides over the first Subway Series of his mayoralty and the first since he was 12. "You can't believe how long I've been praying for it," Mr. Giuliani said.
With his prayers answered, there was almost no media request the mayor didn't answer.
He appeared as guest on WFAN, the sports talk radio station, predicting civic calm during the Series, and, while he was at it, second-guessing some of the managerial moves of Lou Piniella, the manager of the vanquished Seattle Mariners.
He later offered up the Top 10 List on "The Late Show With David Letterman," noting that, in addition to the many personal benefits the Subway Series held for him, it also might help the rest of the city get over the closing of "Cats."
As in past years, Mr. Giuliani's first baseball impulse in the last two days has been to look back nostalgically at his youth. "For me, this is like reliving my childhood," he said. "Literally and figuratively. I grew up in Brooklyn, a Yankee fan, in the early 1950's." Although Mr. Giuliani moved to Long Island at 7, a fact he mentions less frequently, he did take his love of the Yankees with him.
The mayor has also seized on the Series as good political news. Although Mr. Giuliani isn't running for anything, he took the opportunity yesterday to swing away at Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Senate opponent before he dropped out.
(In one Yankee-related watershed event of his campaign, Mr. Giuliani unapologetically canceled four long-planned Senate campaign appearances in upstate New York in April to attend the rescheduled Yankee home opener. "What can I tell you?" the mayor said in what became Exhibit A of his indifferent race against Mrs. Clinton. "This is me.")
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said, to no one's surprise, that the Series would help Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio. "I think it all underlies the lack of authenticity in Hillary Clinton's candidacy," Mr. Giuliani said. "Rick Lazio's a New Yorker, he roots for the Mets, he's represented us in the United States Congress."
He added that "my simple advice to Rick Lazio would be to continue to emphasize that."
Ms. Clinton, for her part, said she hoped to squeeze a game into her schedule. "I hope I can," she said during a campaign stop in Syracuse. "I'm trying to work out problems with my schedule."
She added: "I'm absolutely thrilled. Just, gosh, a year after I moved to the state we have a subway series. I mean that's pretty exciting to me."
Mr. Giuliani said he also sees the Series as a boon for New York's economy, and is impatient with people who say otherwise. Asked yesterday how the city could make large amounts of money when many fans already live here, Mr. Giuliani testily responded: "You know, it's amazing. I've got to tell you this: Somehow, some way, people can figure out in this city how to look success in the face and say, 'Oh, my goodness, we can't stand it, we can't deal with it.' "
The city, the mayor said, would reap huge benefits from hotel rooms, ticket sales, sales taxes and income taxes on the ballplayers.
"If you're talking about direct revenues, taxes that we can literally count, that's in the $40 million to $50 million range," the mayor asserted.
But many economists say public officials tend to overestimate the economic benefits of major sports events.
Finally, Mr. Giuliani said the Series might smooth the way for building new stadiums for both the Mets and the Yankees. "I think it makes it easier to do a deal that the public will understand is a very good proposition for the city," he said.
Mr. Giuliani's staff said he expected to attend every game in the Series. "This is a liberated human being," said Norman Adler, a political consultant to Republicans and Democrats. "He can be for anybody or do anything that's legal right now. If he wants to pursue his childhood dream of being almost a Yankee, he's allowed. This is not sports, this is religion."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Says Gore's Election Would Endanger Prosperity

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: LA CROSSE, Wis., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush plunged into the final three-week stretch of the presidential race today, arguing that Vice President Al Gore would endanger the nation's prosperity and using his own pledge of tax cutting to rally his party's base.
Crisscrossing the swing state of Wisconsin on a glorious fall day, Mr. Bush, a Texas Republican, repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent as a proponent of big government. 
 "He's of the government," Mr. Bush thundered. "He's for the government. He loves Washington, D.C."
And seeking to sway voters who consider prosperity an argument for Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush said his opponent would actually endanger the good times.
"The surest way to slow down our economy is to spend all our taxpayers' money down on bigger government," he told a large crowd in Eau Claire.
On the day after the third and final presidential debate, the race was still considered a dead heat.
Mr. Bush engaged in a delicate balancing act as he barnstormed across a state that voted twice for President Clinton but is considered up for grabs.
On the one hand, he tried to fire up Republicans with sharply ideological broadsides against big government. He called the conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Yet he also sought to keep an appeal to independents and swing voters with promises of a new bipartisanship.
"I'm here to let you know I'm going to work my heart out all the way to the finish," Mr. Bush told an airport rally. "But I want your help. This is going to be a close election. Nobody should take anything for granted. It's going to be down to the wire, which means hard work and grass-roots people are going to make a big difference."
Yet he also told the Republicans: "Don't be afraid to talk to those open-minded Democrats about a better day tomorrow. They don't want a huge federal government in their lives. They understand freedom. Don't be afraid to take our message to independents. There's unfinished business in our nation's capital."
He struck the same note at the E. O. Johnson Company. "One of the reasons I've come is to ask you to tell your independents and Democrats to be open-minded," Mr. Bush said.
"Tax relief is important because its part of an economic growth package," he argued, saying the cuts "serve as a stimulus to the economy. This is our school of thought."
Wisconsin's governor, Tommy G. Thompson, was far more pointed as he introduced Mr. Bush at a packed rally here in the afternoon. He said that Mr. Bush had been well raised by his parents but that Mr. Gore needed to learn the lessons taught by Robert Fulghum in his book "All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten."
"Don't interrupt people when they speak," Mr. Thompson said. "He said, Don't be a bully. He said, Don't interrupt people. Come November, We should send Al Gore back to kindergarten."
And Mr. Bush scoffed at Mr. Gore's statement in Tuesday's debate that the vice president did not stand for big government. "Now there's a man whose prone to exaggeration."
Mr. Gore was also seeking to frame the final days of the race as a choice between economic visions. Tad Devine, a senior Gore strategist, seized on several of Mr. Bush's answers in Tuesday night's debate to argue that Mr. Bush "demonstrated conclusively that he wanted to fight for the wealthy, not the rest of society."
Mr. Devine pointed to Mr. Bush's reply when the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked him to respond to Mr. Gore's accusation that Mr. Bush's tax cut would mainly benefit the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans. (Mr. Bush said, "Of course it does.") Mr. Devine also pointed to Mr. Bush's description of the word "insurance" as "a Washington term."
Mr. Bush fired back today against accusations that he favors the well-to-do. "That's the kind of language that's divisive," he said. "It's the kind of language that pits one group of people against another. It's called class warfare. That's the kind of language that will make it hard to get something done in Washington, D.C. America doesn't want class warfare. "
Mr. Bush's aides declared themselves pleased with the outcome of the three presidential debates. "I think we exceeded all expectations," said Karen P. Hughes, the governor's communications director. "The debate phase was clearly a turning point. We have come out of the debate phase with the trend clearly in our direction."
Arguing that he would be the better steward of prosperity, Mr. Bush said there were warning signs of a recession on the horizon. He called his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut an "insurance policy against an economic slowdown."
 
In His Own Words: GEORGE W. BUSH
Remarks yesterday at Eau Claire, Wis.:
"The people of Wisconsin, they respect limited government. I thought last night it was one of the most telling moments in the debate when my opponent looked America in the eye and said he's absolutely against big government. Now there's a man who's prone to exaggeration. He wants to grow the size of the federal government. He believes in Washington. We believe in people. We're of the people and by the people and for the people. That's the motto of our campaign. . . .
He's of the government. He's for government. He loves Washington, D.C.
Now there's a role for our government, but it's not to tell the average folks how to live their lives. "

HEADLINE: Brooklyn School Breaks From the Pack;
A Case Study in How State Testing Was Used to Improve Education

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Just a year ago, John Q. Adams was holding his aching head and wondering what had gone wrong. The results of a new state math test had just come out, and only 39 percent of the eighth graders at his school in Brooklyn had met state standards.
Mr. Adams's students had done better than the abysmal citywide average of 23 percent. But in the surrounding middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge and Sunset Park, where parents are electricians, civil servants, jewelers and doctors, better than average was not good enough. 
 "It was devastating," Mr. Adams, the principal of Intermediate School 187, recalled this week.
This year, while the rest of the city stagnated, I.S. 187, in Dyker Heights, bucked the trend, posting the biggest gain of any school in the city. Fifty-seven percent of the students passed the test, a rise of 18 percentage points.
It was a gain so rare that in today's cynical education environment it was more likely to invite suspicions of cheating than congratulations.
But in a tour of his school this week, Mr. Adams provided a case study in how high-stakes testing -- often maligned as shallow, misdirected and irrelevant -- can drive improvements in education.
The trick, Mr. Adams said, was hard work, extra hours, small classes and teachers steeped in their subjects.
Over the last school year, dozens of the academically neediest students at I.S. 187 got not just more test preparation, but more hard-core education. Every child who scored in the bottom of four levels -- "far below standards" -- on state and city math tests was scheduled for double periods of math from September to June. Instead of the customary five periods of math a week, these children got 10, giving up electives like physical education, home economics and assembly.
Every day, in classes of just 10 to 12 students, they got a second chance to go over material they had struggled with in their regular classes of 33. Even children who passed the test were offered homework help, peer tutoring and test-taking strategy sessions before and after school and during lunch.
When the state math test was given again in June, 58 more children -- the equivalent of two full classes -- passed it this year than last.
This week, a new round of letters went home to parents, reflecting the latest round of test scores. Children who scored high enough to avoid double math periods, but still below standards, are once again being urged to attend after-school math and homework programs.
Mr. Adams acknowledged that having 57 percent meeting standards, though higher than the city average of 23 percent, still left a lot to be desired. So he is once again devoting time and money to children at the bottom.
The extra classes are paid for with I.S. 187's share of $30 million in "ending social promotion" money -- for programs to help promote struggling students legitimately into the next grades. Such funds were allocated to middle schools throughout the city by the Board of Education, for the second year in a row, but each of the city's 32 school districts is allowed to decide how to spend its allotment, which amounts to $121 for every sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade student citywide. Other schools used the money to lower class sizes, start new after-school programs and hire specialized teachers.
I.S. 187's decision to add math classes benefits children like Brittany Boccio, a diminutive girl with glasses and a riveting gaze, who was scared of math until she started attending double sessions last year. "Thank heaven for Mrs. Mennella," Brittany said this week, praising her remedial math teacher, Grace Ann Mennella, a certified public accountant with a bachelor's degree in probability theory and statistics. "I can't believe how much I improved."
On Monday, Ms. Mennella reviewed prime numbers for Brittany and nine classmates. They had been introduced to the same material last Friday, in a regular math class, but their grasp of it was still shaky. Using stick figures, charts and a lively sense of humor, Ms. Mennella drew each child into an exploration of prime numbers. She ended the lesson with a mathematical game, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a grid that showed the pattern of prime numbers.
Most of these children, Ms. Mennella said later, can do the work. But they have fallen so far behind that they have lost faith in their own ability. And they are embarrassed to ask what might be perceived as stupid questions in front of children who understand the work. She sees her job as restoring their confidence.
Mr. Adams has instituted a similar regimen for children who were weak in English. The proportion of his eighth graders meeting state standards in English rose by 8 percentage points to 64 percent.
Asked about curriculum and textbooks -- among the issues that obsess education advocates and teaching colleges -- the teachers at I.S. 187 look bemused. They have not changed textbooks in six years, since I.S. 187, formally known as the Christa McAuliffe School, was founded in a shuttered elementary school at 1171 65th Street, as immigration, the thriving economy and the declining crime rate in the city swelled the ranks of children going to public school in the surrounding neighborhood of modest attached houses.
Their mathematics curriculum is the boilerplate city and state math curriculum, which has been around, as one teacher said wearily, forever. Curriculums come and go, they said, but the constants when it comes to creating a strong school are hiring qualified teachers, keeping the school open to new ideas, encouraging teachers to work as a team, making sure that children who fall behind are noticed and keeping in touch with parents.
"We've all been at other schools where we've never seen the camaraderie that we have," said Dorothy Multari, a math teacher.
Barbara Heinberg, another math teacher, interjected, "We have very cooperative parents."
Ms. Multari added, "And the peer pressure is to do well."
While many schools in New York struggle with uncertified teachers who are not trained in the subjects they teach, a majority of math teachers at I.S. 187 received an undergraduate degree, if not a master's, in mathematics, Mr. Adams said.
I.S. 187 hires its teachers as zealously as a Wall Street investment bank hires its stockbrokers. Most principals pluck their teachers off a list compiled by the Board of Education, in a civil-service system in which seniority counts more than compatibility, talent or skills. At I.S. 187, hiring is done by a committee of teachers, parents, administrators and often a school aide, who interview every candidate.
Since the Board of Education adopted its so-called new standards for math and English several years ago, it has become common to find schools, especially in poor neighborhoods, decorated with jargon-filled posters extolling one or another of the standards. At some schools, teachers are encouraged to memorize the standards verbatim, right down to the code number, like, "Standard M4b: Statistics and Probability Concepts: Display data."
Not here. High standards, Mr. Adams said, are intuitive. "I'd rather have student work posted," he said. "I'd rather have them proud of what they do."
Parents have responded to the school's approach. It has grown from 250 students in 1994 to 1,059 students this year, divided into three smaller academies, each with its own theme: global communication, scientific research, and arts and humanities. The demographics have also changed, from 40 percent white, 29 percent Hispanic, 27 percent Asian and 4 percent black in 1995-96 to 53 percent white, 13 percent Hispanic, 30 percent Asian and 3 percent black this school year. The shift probably represents the area's more middle-class population, Mr. Adams said, and includes 15 classes of gifted students -- admitted by virtue of standardized test scores -- and 20 regular classes.
As the population has shifted, test scores have risen steadily -- but never as greatly as this year. Though he respects the tests, Mr. Adams tries not to get carried away by them.
"It's like the price of my house," Mr. Adams, who was born and raised in Brooklyn and still lives there, said ruefully. "It can't keep going up forever. You can brag and puff out your chest about test scores, but that's not the true essence of our school."

HEADLINE: Syrian Plane Flies to Iraq Again Without Notice

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 18

 BODY:
As part of a growing challenge by Arab countries to the sanctions against Iraq, Syria flew a plane to Baghdad today for the third time in 10 days without notifying the United Nations.
The flight was the 26th sent to the Iraqi capital by Arab nations since France and Russia began disputing procedures last month for some of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. France and Russia have been sympathetic to Iraq's quest to have the sanctions lifted and have begun to question the procedures for the ban on flights and whether there is a ban on passenger flights here. 
 Iraq symbolically reopened Saddam International Airport here on Aug. 17 for the first time since 1990. This month, the United Arab Emirates, after having notified the United Nations sanctions committee, was the first Persian Gulf state to send an aircraft to Iraq. Planes have also been sent from Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen, among others.
Bahrain and Egypt sent aid flights here on Tuesday. And today a Syrian Boeing 727 carried a delegation from the secretariat of the Arab Agronomists Union from Damascus, according to the Iraqi news agency. Aside from the flights sent by Egypt and Syria, nearly all the countries gave the United Nations advance notice and had their flights approved.
The United Nations sanctions committee is generally expected to discuss the flights on Friday in the hope of working out new procedures. A resolution in 1990 on flight restrictions states that the committee has to be notified of flights and the plane's cargo has to be inspected for banned goods.
In addition, because the United States and Britain enforce no-flight zones over large areas of northern and southern Iraq, they want want details of flight paths more than 24 hours in advance to ensure a plane's safety.
France and Russia have disputed the procedures. They say sanctions require notification and have not responded to queries from the United States and Britain, who say permission is also needed.
Russia has just filed papers with the committee for three flights, between next week and Nov. 10, diplomats said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: CHECKING THE FACTS;
Doing the Math Behind Candidates' Debate Claims

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
In their three debates, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have waded deep into the thickets of tax policy, Social Security and the budget surplus. The numbers they have thrown around have often been confusing and conflicting -- and sometimes wrong.
An examination of the transcripts of the three debates shows several instances in which the candidates made their points through the selective use of facts, fudging of details and, yes, fuzzy math.
 
Argument Over the Rich
 In the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Gore used the audience to illustrate his argument that Mr. Bush's tax plan favors the rich.
If all 130 audience members were "dead on in the middle of the middle class," he said, their combined tax cuts under the Bush plan would be less than the cut enjoyed by "just one member" of the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers, which he defined as people making more than $330,000 a year.
Mr. Gore's assertion was misleading, if not wrong.
In assessing the Bush plan, the Gore campaign relies on an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group that uses a well-respected computer model. The group defined the top one percent as as people who make $319,000 or more, with the average being $915,000. The average annual tax cut for members of that group under the Bush plan would be $46,072, Citizens for Tax Justice said.
There are a number of credible definitions of middle class. In this case the Gore campaign relied on one at the low end of the spectrum -- a range of $24,400 to $39,300 per household, with an average of $31,000, which Citizens for Tax Justice described as the middle 20 percent of incomes for tax purposes.
The average tax cut for that group would be $453 under the Bush plan, the group said. Multiplied times 130, the total is $58,890 -- $12,818 more than the average tax cut for the top one percent. (The vice president's example would have worked only if there were no more than 101 people in the audience.)
Mr. Gore seemed to imply in the debate that his assertion applied to anyone making more than $330,000 a year. Asked to explain Mr. Gore's statement, campaign aides said he had in mind someone making $1 million a year.
Even at that income level, the Gore campaign had to compare apples and oranges to make the math work. It used the Citizens for Tax Justice figures for the middle income tax cut, but estimated the tax cut for a $1 million earner by combining figures from The Wall Street Journal's online tax calculator and Citizens for Tax Justice.
 
Discord on Low Earners
In the second presidential debate last week, Mr. Bush said that "most of the tax reductions" in his plan would "go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder."
He was wrong.
In assessing his plan's effect on different income groups, Mr. Bush relies on an analysis by the nonpartisan staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation.
The analysis shows that in 2005, after the Bush plan is fully phased in, it would reduce taxes on households making $200,000 or more by $32.2 billion, or 26.8 percent of the total tax cut in that year of $120.1 billion.
Households making less than $40,000 would receive $12.3 billion in tax cuts in 2005, the analysis said, or 10.2 percent of the total.
Moreover, the analysis does not consider Mr. Bush's proposal to repeal the federal estate tax. Economists differ about how much of the benefits of an estate tax repeal would go to the wealthy, but there is no disagreement that they would reap most of the benefit.
Mr. Bush has said in all the debates that his plan would require people at upper-income levels to pay a greater share of federal income taxes.
The Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis shows that households making $200,000 or more in 2005 would pay 27.4 percent of total federal income taxes under Mr. Bush's plan, just as they do now. Households making $100,000 or more would see their share of the total income tax bill tick up to 25.2 percent, from 25.1 percent under current law. The calculations do not consider the effects of the estate tax, which would benefit people at upper-income levels the most.
 
Social Security Conflict
In the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush intended to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund over the next decade to establish private investment accounts within the retirement system. The vice president said that in doing so, Mr. Bush had promised the same money twice -- once for the private accounts and once to pay benefits to retirees -- and that he would have to break one of those promises.
Mr. Gore was right to say that Mr. Bush's Social Security plan will require $1 trillion to get started, and the governor acknowledged as much. Mr. Gore was also right that the money would come out of Social Security payroll taxes.
But the vice president was on shakier ground in suggesting that putting $1 trillion into private accounts would leave Social Security $1 trillion short of what it needs to pay in benefits.
Social Security is currently taking in more money from payroll taxes than it needs to pay in benefits to current retirees. That surplus is projected at nearly $2.4 trillion over the next decade, and the system will probably run surpluses until around 2015, when it will begin running huge deficits. Mr. Bush's $1 trillion would come from the Social Security surplus.
Both candidates and their parties have agreed that the Social Security surplus should go only to shoring up the retirement system or paying down the national debt. If the money is not used to overhaul Social Security, it would go automatically to debt reduction -- not to paying benefits.
Mr. Gore has a point in this sense: It is possible to think of debt reduction as a way of saving for the day when Social Security will need to call on general tax revenues to help pay for benefits.
To the extent that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money for debt reduction, the government might find it harder, or at least more expensive, to come up with the money needed for Social Security benefits in the long run.
Mr. Gore said that under Mr. Bush's proposal, Social Security would be bankrupt in 20 years. If nothing is done, Social Security will have run through its trust fund -- promises by the government to pay back to itself the Social Security surpluses that over the years have gone to government spending and tax cuts -- by 2037. Using $1 trillion of the surplus for private accounts would move that date up by around 15 years.
But in neither case would Social Security be bankrupt except in the most technical sense. Even if nothing is done to help the system, Social Security will be able to pay more than 70 percent of promised benefits indefinitely.
 
Discord Over Spending
Starting in the first debate, Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore was a big spender -- bigger than any of the three previous Democratic presidential candidates -- whose proposals would bust the budget. And he said electing Mr. Gore would mean the return of big government.
Mr. Bush's budget has less of a buffer than Mr. Gore's does. By Mr. Bush's own accounting, his budget would use all but $265 billion of the surplus, and that is without paying for some of his campaign promises, like an expanded national missile defense system. Mr. Gore says he would set aside $660 billion of the surplus for a reserve fund and higher levels of debt reduction.
Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore is proposing three times as much spending as President Clinton did when he was running in 1992.
That assertion rests on an analysis by a conservative research group, the National Taxpayers Union, which concluded that Mr. Gore's spending would total $2.9 trillion in the next decade. The Gore campaign says it would spend a little over $1 trillion and offer tax breaks of less than $500 billion. Mr. Clinton's 1992 proposals were made a time of record budget deficits; Mr. Gore's were made at a time of large and growing surpluses.
Mr. Gore said he had helped slim down the federal bureaucracy through his work on the administration's Reinventing Government initiative. Since 1992, the civilian government work force has fallen by 400,000 people, to 1.82 million, although nearly three-quarters of the reduction has been the Pentagon.
Some analysts measure the size of government by looking at total spending relative to the size of the economy. By that measure, government outlays have declined steadily in recent years, to 18.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. Mr. Gore said his plan would push that figure down to 17 percent by 2008.
 
Medicare Dissension
In the first debate, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush is refusing to treat surplus Medicare revenues in the same way that the two parties have agreed to treat the surpluses in Social Security -- by putting them in a "lockbox," where they would be unavailable to either party for new spending or tax cuts.
Mr. Gore was largely correct.
The vice president has proposed that the entire Medicare surplus of $360 billion over the next decade go to debt reduction. Mr. Bush needs that same money in his budget to pay for his $1.3 trillion tax cut and his spending initiatives. Without the Medicare surplus, Mr. Bush's budget would be in the red by $95 billion.
There is a loophole available to Mr. Bush. Most lockbox proposals allow the money to be used for Medicare reform, and Mr. Bush has nearly $200 billion in his budget for Medicare-related proposals, including the establishment of a prescription drug benefit for retirees.

Pace of Inflation Picks Up As Economy Seems to Slow
Inflation is on pace for its largest annual jump in a decade, the government reported, although the price increases remain largely confined to energy costs. The report further complicates the picture of an economy that seems to be slowing even as inflation, one of the most common effects of rapid growth, is rising more rapidly than economists have anticipated.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in September and is growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Inflation last topped 3.5 percent in 1990, when it reached 6.1 percent. Page C4. 

Tire Recall Pulls Down Ford Results
This autumn's recall of Firestone light-truck tires led to Ford Motor's first quarterly drop in operating income in four years. Ford's third-quarter profit from continuing operations dropped 16 percent, in line with analysts' estimates. Shares of Ford rose 63 cents, to $25.06. Separately, Bridgestone/Firestone announced a reorganization, consolidating 21 operating units into 4 with Japanese executives taking control of key operations. C4.
 
Two U.S. Money Managers Are Sold
Two European financial firms struck deals for asset management firms in the United States, part of a trend that has Europeans shopping for American investment firms. Allianz of Germany, Europe's second-largest insurer, agreed to pay up to $2.2 billion to acquire Nicholas-Applegate, a privately held firm that manages $45 billion in institutional accounts and mutual funds. ABN Amro, the largest Dutch bank, agreed to pay $825 million for Alleghany Asset Management. C19.
 
Chase's Profit Falls; Morgan's Rises
Chase Manhattan, whose stock had already fallen 34 percent since it announced its $31 billion merger with J. P. Morgan last month, gave investors more bad news. Chase announced a 26 percent decline in third-quarter operating earnings, which was far below what analysts had expected. In contrast, J. P. Morgan reported a 25 percent increase in net income, above Wall Street forecasts. C4.
 
Euro Sinks to Low Against Dollar
The euro sank to a new low against the dollar, two days after the president of the European Central Bank provoked a furor by publicly suggesting that central banks would not intervene soon to strengthen the struggling currency. In New York, the euro settled at 83.76 cents, down from 85.58 cents. C10.
 
Slowdown Seen in Advertising Sales
After years of white-hot intensity, most recently driven by a media buying frenzy by start-up dot-com companies, the television advertising marketplace is cooling by almost all accounts. While some network executives have disputed some earlier reports of weakening in the ad marketplace, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, acknowledged that the issue was becoming a problem. He predicted at a shareholders meeting in Australia that advertising sales for the Fox Entertainment Group in the United States "look a little uncertain." Advertising. C8.

A Case for Higher Gasoline Taxes

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS;
Last Debate Clearly Left Some Voters Dissatisfied

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 18

 BODY:
For at least one heterogeneous audience, here in one of the most closely contested battleground states of the campaign, the final presidential debate of 2000 was more about reinforcing political views previously reached than about arriving at new conclusions.
Almost without exception, a group of 20-odd voters in southeastern Michigan, who gathered at the request of The New York Times at Wallace House, just off the campus of the University of Michigan, said after watching the 90-minute television encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday evening that their voting plans were unchanged. 
 But many of them -- black, white, young, old, city folks, suburbanites, teachers, students -- were clearly dissatisfied with what they heard.
Republicans, Democrats and ticket-splitters alike laughed derisively when Mr. Gore, in one of his family-friendly moments, announced that all his children had made independent decisions to fly to St. Louis to watch the debate. One member of the group later called the remark "stupid." Another said it was "corny."
When Mr. Bush refused to give a yes-or-no answer to the question of whether he supports affirmative action, a lot of groans and a few hisses resounded through the room.
And in a post-debate discussion, which lasted for almost an hour, several participants complained about Mr. Gore's style. Fewer focused on his policy positions, although some found fault with his spending plans.
Marisa Buchanan, 21, a senior at the University of Michigan, said that she had been more impressed by Mr. Bush, even though she tended to agree with the vice president on issues. She said that she found Mr. Gore "a caricature of himself" whose oratory was "overdone, even for politics."
Nevertheless, Ms. Buchanan continued: "I found myself leaning towards Bush at the end, although I must admit I still don't like him. I've always had the impression that he says what other people tell him to say. But he seemed tonight to mean things, like when he defended his position on the death penalty. He appeared very sincere."
Mark Hadesh, 56, the owner of several small businesses, reached a different conclusion, though he, too, was bothered by Mr. Gore's manner.
"Al Gore's tedious," Mr. Hadesh said. "He makes me twitch. It's hard for me to listen to him. But when George Bush says he doesn't trust Washington, it means nothing. It's not nearly enough to persuade me to vote for him."
Another in the group said he thought that when Mr. Gore walked over to Mr. Bush while the latter was speaking, he briefly feared that the vice president "was going to smack him." And Norman J. Rotter, a neurosurgeon who lives in Oakland County, one of the pivotal suburban areas north of Detroit, said he worried that Mr. Gore was "too arrogant" to represent the United States effectively in negotiations with other countries, especially poor ones.
Peter Thomas, a computer consultant who grew up poor in Detroit, said that he found many of Mr. Gore's ideas "too grandiose," especially his promises to make all American schools excellent and to nurture a world at peace.
"I'm from the inner city," Mr. Thomas said. "I went to Kettering High School, and I have no hope that it will ever be excellent, so I want vouchers to send my kids to the best schools possible. I also doubt that we'll see peace any time soon in the Middle East."
Dick Siegel, a singer and songwriter, said he was considering voting for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, "but not if it would elect Bush." He was opposed "intellectually and spiritually," he said, to the Texan's positions and what he termed his "good old boy" personality. But he added, he found Mr. Gore "a strange man," which bothered him.
"Gore's inherently a bully," said Richard Boothman, 45, a lawyer and a Republican. "He's in your face, all the time. Bush had a theme: that he knew how to build coalitions between parties, and he'd done it in Texas."
Simone D. Lightfoot, the Detroit coordinator for the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund, said that as a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, she found Mr. Bush's criticisms of American military preparedness convincing. But she said she could not join in the complaints about Mr. Gore's manner. She explained: "I prefer a leader who's aggressive and outspoken, so I thought Gore did very well. Gore had the details. Bush said what he wanted, Gore how he'd get there."
Rebecca Blank, 45, the dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at Michigan, took strong exception to the other part of Mr. Boothman's comment. An economist and a Democrat, she said that she thought Mr. Bush's coalition theme completely fallacious.
"That was the area in which Mr. Bush had the least credibility," she said, "that he could go to Washington and make it work. I don't see any evidence at all -- he gave none -- that Texas prepared him to deal with Congress."
Michael Staebler, 57, a Detroit lawyer, agreed that "Texas is very different from Washington." A son of Neil Staebler, a longtime Democratic chairman and national committeeman in this state, he said that the political divisions were not nearly as deep in Austin as in Washington and the political problems in the state legislature were a good deal less complex.
Mr. Gore had other defenders. Nancy Reame, 53, a professor of nursing, said that he offered "more substantive strategies" on education and other major matters.
"I listened for specifics from Bush, but I didn't hear them," she said. "All I heard were generalities. Neither of them paid a lot of attention to women's issues like abortion and hand guns. Bush talked a lot about taking the government out of our lives, but not as far as abortion is concerned."
Her husband, Ron, 54, chairman of New Horizons Graphic Computer Learning, much preferred Mr. Bush's demeanor, describing him as more courteous.
"But Gore's statements were clearer," Mr. Reame, a Republican, said. "Gore was on target all evening. Bush, no. Bush tired at the end and seemed to run out of material. He was falling apart, not answering questions, sometimes not even following them well."
Mike Spahn, 21, the editor of The Michigan Daily, a student newspaper, said Mr. Bush had failed to answer questions and had failed to reply effectively to Mr. Gore's accusations, like the vice president's insistence that the Bush tax plan favored the richest 1 percent of Americans.
Whereas Mr. Bush "deflected all the tough questions," said Peter Eckstein, a retired economist, Mr. Gore "showed his experience during the last eight years and effectively laid out what this administration has accomplished."
Not for Paul Nine, 60, a lawyer, from Oakland County.
"Gore proved to us all tonight that he learned his lessons from Clinton," he said. "Just like Clinton, he disregarded the rules -- interrupting, asking questions when he wasn't supposed to, all that. In this country we're taught that everyone plays by the same rules, but these people don't do it."

HEADLINE: The Fading Copier King;
Xerox Has Failed to Capitalize on Its Own Innovations

BYLINE: This article is based on reporting by Reed Abelson, Claudia H. Deutsch, John Markoff and Andrew Ross Sorkin and was written by Ms. Deutsch. 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation, which only days ago was fending off rumors of its impending bankruptcy, is talking to venture capitalists about selling its Palo Alto Research Center, which in the 1970's pioneered much of the technology for the personal computer industry.
Struggling to raise cash as its sales and stock price plummet and its competitors grab shares of the copier market it once dominated, Xerox is also shopping around its financing arm and other assets, according to executives who have been approached by the company. The company is not close to completing any specific sale, they added, but even its copier and printer businesses may not be sacrosanct. 
 Xerox -- based in Stamford, Conn., and with 14,000 manufacturing employees in Rochester -- would neither confirm nor deny talk of asset sales. The company promises to lay out all its plans on Tuesday, when it announces the size of its third-quarter loss.
Xerox's competitors in what is called the imaging business -- Kodak and Polaroid, along with names like Lexmark and Pitney Bowes -- are sharing its pain. The economy is softening, prompting consumers and businesses alike to put off buying new copiers, printers and cameras. Technology has created new competitors, with the likes of Sony selling digital cameras and Hewlett-Packard dominating the market for computer printers.
But even against that backdrop, Xerox seems to be suffering most. Last week, when the company was unable to tap the commercial credit markets, it was forced to issue a statement after rumors circulated that it would seek bankruptcy court protection. Instead, it said it was relying on a $7 billion line of credit. While Xerox has refused to provide investors with more details, analysts and investors are estimating it is already using about $4 billion of that $7 billion to finance its short-term debt.
While no one seriously predicts bankruptcy, investors, with little hard information to go on, remain anxious. "What's driving the stock where it is today is fear," said David Giroux, an analyst with T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company. "They have not done a good job of allaying fears."
The stock has tumbled from nearly $64 in May 1999 to close yesterday at $6.75, a 10-year low.
As a result, some investors are now calling for the board to make sweeping management changes.
Others even suggest the board itself should turn over. "Xerox's board has been sitting on its hands and needs fresh ideas from new-economy entrepreneurs," said Roger Kenny, a managing partner of Boardroom Consultants.
Xerox may be forced to sell its half- share of Fuji Xerox, its Japanese printer and copier arm, to Fuji, some analysts suggest. And a few even contend that Xerox might bail out of copiers and printers altogether and turn itself into a "solutions" company, one that designs and runs document systems for companies.
"The solutions approach at least lets them salvage cash and right the ship," said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst with PaineWebber.
Several Silicon Valley venture capitalists say Xerox has begun talks with them about buying all or part of the Palo Alto Research Center, which is commonly known as Parc. An initial meeting with Accel Partners, a leading venture capital firm in Palo Alto, took place last week, according to several people close to the talks.
Accel executives refused to comment on the negotiations but another venture capitalist at a firm that has talked with Xerox said that the Accel talks were serious but preliminary.
No asset sale would be painless. But the loss of Parc would be a blow to the psyche of Xerox as well as a strategic loss. Xerox did not turn many of Parc's inventions into viable products, but Parc had various claims to fame: the computer mouse, the user-friendly icons that make personal computers so attractive to consumers and Ethernet, which links computers at remote sites.
"Xerox would hate to part with them because they are the future," said Tom Long, a former Xerox executive who is now chief executive of Oce Printing Systems USA.
Xerox may have little choice. "Unless they can float more commercial paper or get additional capital that will cost them an arm and a leg in interest, they will have to sell assets to stay out of bankruptcy," Mr. Reitzes of PaineWebber said.
Neither Xerox executives nor its directors are talking. Its senior management has been in continuous meetings at the Stamford headquarters, mapping out the strategy it will announce on Tuesday. "The plan is in place, locked and loaded," said Jeffrey Simek, a Xerox spokesman.
But what happened? How did this company, whose name was once a synonym for photocopier -- and Wall Street -- supremacy, fall so far? "I don't know if I blame management, but the problem certainly isn't the people who are putting the machines together," said Gary Bonadonna, director of the Rochester joint board of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents Xerox employees.
For decades, Xerox all but owned the copier market. But over the last few years, the lines between printers and copiers have blurred. Moreover, the fastest-growing segment of the document processing world is low-priced printers and copiers for the small-office and home-office market, now dominated by Hewlett-Packard. Xerox has been late to get products to that market and to establish solid relationships with Staples, Comp USA and the other retail outlets.
Xerox's direct sales force, once its greatest strength, has, meanwhile, become its albatross. Xerox sales representatives had enviable relationships with the corporate purchasing agents who bought analog copiers. But information technology executives and systems integrators put together the network systems in which modern copiers and printers play a part. Few of Xerox's sales people speak their language; most of Hewlett's sales people do.
In 1997, Xerox hired G. Richard Thoman away from I.B.M. to reinvigorate the company. One of the first things he did was rejigger its sales territories, long organized by geography, around customer industries. He also consolidated many back-office operations, but instead of streamlining the company, the reorganization mostly produced chaos, with sales representatives trying to acquaint themselves with new accounts even as they field irate calls from old ones.
Xerox also has become a bloated machine. It still maintains some departments organized around products, others around regions, others around industry groups. "We had layered complexity into a structure that laid on costs, slowed decision making and masked responsibility," Mr. Simek, the Xerox spokesman, acknowledged.
For a time, Xerox had some breathing space. Its most profitable product line, Docutech networkable copiers, so dominated the market for superhigh-speed machines that even would-be competitors talked about moving into "the Docutech space."
But now Heidelberger Druckmaschinen of Germany, Canon of Japan, and most recently, I.B.M. are making deep inroads into the market with "open architecture" machines that can more easily accept electronic files from various software programs. And both Canon and Ricoh of Japan are cutting heavily into sales in the next-fastest machines.
The lost market share also means fewer sales of lucrative service contracts and supplies like toner and ink cartridges. "When they lose their installed base, they lose that entire annuity machine," said Brian Merriman, president of Danka Worldwide, Heidelberger's main distributor.
In May, Xerox ousted Mr. Thoman. Paul A. Allaire, the former chief executive who had moved up to chairman, took back the chief's spot, and Anne M. Mulcahy, a 24-year Xerox employee, became the president and heir apparent.
Xerox's competitors have taken advantage of the chaos. Ricoh, for one, has grabbed more than 14 percent of the copier market. "Xerox has annoyed its customers and its employees, and that's giving us one of our best years ever," said Jim Ivy, president of Ricoh's Office Products Group.
Customers are showing as little patience as investors. Many complain of neglect, arrogance and a willingness to negotiate prices only after a sale has been lost.
"Xerox has lost the confidence of our technicians and management as a supplier for any equipment that would be attached to our network," said Michael Cushing, head of administration for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a longtime Xerox customer that could not persuade Xerox to help it hook new copiers into its network.
Jamie Estes, president of Print Solutions, a commercial printer in Birmingham, Ala., had for many years paid Xerox a monthly fee to supply, maintain and operate its Docutech machines. Things went fine until June 1999, when the Xerox-supplied operator resigned. "From then through October, they sent us 11 different operators, none of whom knew how to run the machine," Mr. Estes said. By last December, Mr. Estes had had enough -- he told Xerox to remove its machines, and bought a Heidelberger.
Even customers that are sticking with Xerox are spreading the wealth around. Kinko's, Xerox's largest private-sector customer, spends more than $20 million a month on service and leasing fees for Xerox products, and just signed another two-year $290 million contract with Xerox for printers and services. Still, Kinko's has also contracted with I.B.M. for about 150 of its high-speed copiers. .
Can Xerox, which has repeatedly disappointed investors and customers with promises to turn itself around, pick itself up?
"I hope they still have one more comeback in their system," said William A. Johnson, Jr., the mayor of Rochester. "But this is the direst, worst, most oppressive situation they've been in."

The Popular Pariah

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Al Gore has said he would consider putting a 24-hour-a-day Webcam, or Alcam, in the Oval Office.
Tipper, of course, immediately intimated to friends, with her sly, our-love-life-is-groovy smile, that there would be times when that Webcam would have to be turned off. 
 But this just proves you can never get a Webcam where you want one.
I have zero desire to see President Gore round the clock, putting comely interns to sleep with charts and lectures on gaseous reduction.
On the other hand, I would have loved to have a Webcam trained on Bill Clinton during the debates.
I wonder if the president, who is a pariah in his own vice president's campaign, chewed on his cigar and shouted comebacks at the screen as the Three Faces of Al flickered.
What an exquisite dilemma for a man who always wants things both ways! He needs his partner to excel so that Al can defeat W. and secure Mr. Clinton's legacy. But if Mr. Gore falls short, Mr. Clinton can comfort himself with the belief that "if only I were out there, the election would be over. I'm still the best. If you find a turtle on a fencepost, it didn't get there by accident."
Mr. Clinton, some close to him say, is bewildered and hurt by the way Mr. Gore keeps erasing him from his White House photo album. The president thinks Mr. Gore should run as his vice president, bragging on their record of economic growth, welfare reform and fiscal (if not personal) discipline.
I would much rather have the master pol's debate commentary than those "doofus-heavy focus groups assembled by the networks," as The Washington Post's TV critic Tom Shales calls them, which deemed the governor more specific and straightforward than the vice president even when W. was offering generic and incoherent bromides.
As W. bit the inside of his lip and looked hunched, vacant and played-out, you just had an image of a head full of sawdust as he sniffled, snorted and sifted through his brain trying to remember if the situation called for "I trust people, not government" or "Leave no child behind" or "The partisan bickering has to stop" or "Governors lead. That's what we do."
In a 1996 debate with Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton used sidling and staring to intimidate his rival. Mr. Gore attempted the same maneuver Tuesday. Lithe as a lawn mower, subtle as a subpoena, Alpha Al clomped right up beside Mr. Bush, who rewarded him with a disdainful double take that brought chuckles from the crowd. Mr. Gore kept right on striding up to the crowd, like an Olympic diver about to do a three-and-a-half-somersault pike.
Mr. Gore's points often had a subtext of tattling. He said his four children had come to the debate. (W.'s didn't, nyah, nyah!) He said he had gone to Vietnam, even though there were "fancy ways to get out of going." (W. got a cushy spot in the Texas Air National Guard, nyah, nyah!) He had "not spent the last quarter-century in pursuit of personal wealth." (W. was using family connections to get rich, nyah, nyah!)
Mr. Gore's erratic and sometimes arrogant debate demeanor, which has caused some Gore focus groups to violently turn on the Democratic nominee, has surely confirmed Mr. Clinton's belief, which he once confided to a friend, that Al would have been happier in academia.
After being slighted by the Gorites, the president would certainly be gratified to see them come beg him for an 11th-hour rescue -- to do last-minute stumping with minorities and in hard-fought states.
But Mr. Gore, who has not appeared publicly with the president since their awkward passing of the torch in Monroe, Mich., two months ago, resents Mr. Clinton so much he might rather lose than reattach himself. He has paid all the dues he intends to. He frets over polls that show lingering anger at Mr. Clinton that might drag him down.
Mr. Gore cannot even bring himself to use the word "Clinton." In the debate, he was boasting of his role in planning "the president's" summit meeting in the Mideast. He caught himself using the "P" word and you could practically hear the klaxon go off as he switched to praising the great job of "our country's team."
Can you imagine what the puffy-eyed Mr. Clinton, back (via a fund-raiser and a golf banquet) from 20 meetings that consumed 24 of 28 hours at an Egyptian golf resort where he did not even get to golf, must have howled at the TV at that point?
"Our TEAM? Oh, man, that is wrooong."

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES EASING SANCTIONS ON FOOD TO CUBA

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES with LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a bill easing nearly four decades of sanctions on the sale of food to Cuba, all but assuring the measure will become law.
But in doing so, the lawmakers added restrictions that will make it difficult, perhaps impossible, for food shipments to be made to Cuba in the near future, many farmers, lobbyists and trade group officials said of the 86-to-8 vote. 
 Politically powerful agricultural interests, eyeing a potential market, pressed hard for the removal of sanctions against food sales. But when it came to altering this abiding vestige of the cold war in an election year, opponents pushed back.
Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans in Florida, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, were able to win new restrictions on travel to Cuba and prohibitions on United States government credit and private financing for any sales.
"Wait till these farmers who think that they were given a great new market to deal in, wait till they try to get a visa to go there or try to get financing, they're going to be furious," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, who voted for the bill.
The easing of sanctions passed by the Senate today was contained in a $78 billion agriculture spending bill approved by the House on Oct. 11.
President Clinton has indicated that he will sign the bill, despite reservations over language he views as infringing on executive authority by barring a president from imposing sanctions on food and medicine without Congress's permission.
Cuban government officials have been sharply critical of the legislation, portraying it as a missed opportunity and stating flatly that Cuba has no plans to buy food from the United States.
In Havana today, President Fidel Castro led a large protest against the bill, which he called insulting. "They have included a load of restrictions which are humiliating for the country, and make it impossible in practice," Mr. Castro said before the demonstration. Page A9.
Indicative of the political sensitivity of the issue, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore had no immediate comment on today's vote, and his rival, Governor George W. Bush, condemned the Senate action. "Governor Bush opposes changing the sanctions against Cuba until Fidel Castro or the Cuban government allow free elections, free speech and freedom for political prisoners," said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.
 The agriculture bill includes a measure to allow pharmacies and wholesalers to reimport cheaply priced American-made prescription drugs that had been exported, with certain restrictions.
In addition to the provision on Cuba, the bill permits the sale of food and medicine to Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea, transactions that are in large part already permitted. Those countries may request United States government credits and private financing, conditional on a presidential waiver.
Cuba may not ask for such a waiver, but farmers and agribusiness officials nonetheless described the bill as "a crack in the door," in the words of Van Yeutter of Cargill Inc., a large commodities company.
Advocates of more open trade with Cuba foresee returning to the issue next year when the tricky politics of the presidential campaign have passed.
"I don't think you'll have the political dynamic with Florida and the Cuban-American community and their basic impact," said Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who strongly supports easing sanctions. "You're talking about 7 percent of the electorate in a state that has very close elections for the House, the Senate and the presidency."
The United States government first imposed a ban on trade with Cuba in 1962, after the Communist government seized more than 6,000 American-owned properties. While Cuba is a small market -- 11.2 million people -- its nearness to the United States and the fact it imports most of its food makes it an enticing market for American farmers.
Choosing their words carefully, farmers -- along with most Democrats and some farm-state Republicans -- said they would have much preferred the Senate's original version of the bill. That version lifted sanctions on food and medicine outright and received a large bipartisan vote in the Senate. A similar bill also was initially approved by wide margins in the House.
But House Republican leaders succeeded in weakening the final bill, drafted by Representative George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican, at the behest of two Republican Cuban-American lawmakers from Florida. The two lawmakers -- Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen -- claimed victory on the issue.
Under the compromise in Congress, Cuba would be barred from receiving United States government credit and private financing to buy food from American farmers. Instead, Cuba, a considerable credit risk, must either persuade a foreign bank to lend it money or pay cash. "The fact of the matter is it's going to be a difficult road in putting together business," Mr. Yeutter said. "Financing is a big issue. The country doesn't have much money today."
Cuba withdrew from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the 1960's and so is barred from any financing from them. And while Cuba now imports a number of goods from France, Canada, China, Mexico, Argentina and other countries, the sales are heavily subsidized.
"Which banks will want to take the risk of the Cubans defaulting?" asked Wayne Hammon, director of government relations for the National Association of Wheat Growers.

HEADLINE: Cubans March Against U.S. Bill on Embargo

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Waving placards with portraits of Abraham Lincoln, hundreds of thousands of Cubans marched today in hopes of convincing Americans that legislation passed by both houses of Congress will make it harder for them to visit the island.
The march was being held to show the world, "and especially American public opinion, what our people think of the gross lie that the genocidal blockade has been softened," the Communist daily Granma said. 
 Wearing his usual olive green uniform with white athletic shoes for marching, Fidel Castro led a crowd that the government estimated at 800,000 down Malecon coastal highway. Such a crowd would total 40 percent of the capital's population.
The Havana government insists that the legislation passed by the House last week and by the Senate today will toughen rather than ease the nearly four-decade embargo against the island. The bill has been described in Washington as offering the first opportunity in 38 years for American farmers to sell food to Cuba, as well as the first step in the easing of trade sanctions.
But because the legislation would bar the United States government and banks from financing the food sales, Cuba would have to pay cash or get credit from a third country.
"In practice, it will be totally impossible to buy food and medicine from the United States," read an editorial published on Monday in state newspapers. In protest, "our country will not buy a single cent of food or medicine from the United States," it asserted.
Among the authorities' biggest complaints about the legislation is that it will further restrict American travel to Cuba. Most Americans are already effectively barred from visiting Cuba because of spending restrictions imposed by the embargo, and the Congressional proposal would codify those regulations.
The Cuban government has also complained that support among Americans for the lifting of the embargo has been eroded in recent months by election-year politics. It worries that many Americans believe the current measure will do much more to ease sanctions than it actually will.
"Down with the blockade!" a series of speakers chanted today over a public address system set up outside the American mission here. "Long live the revolution!"

LUXURY BUILDING
A $50 million luxury building for the elderly, the first in Manhattan developed specifically for that purpose, opened its doors yesterday. Monthly fees -- which cover breakfast and 20 dinners, activities and housekeeping -- for the building, the Hallmark at Battery Park City, range from $3,990 for a studio apartment to $9,290 for two bedrooms and a den. Ulrich R. Wall, the executive director of the Hallmark, said 88 of the 197 apartments for independent living had been rented, as had 2 of the 20 units set aside for people who require more assistance. The building is owned and operated by Brookdale Living Communities, a national company based in Chicago. Terry Pristin (NYT)

The Giuliani administration is seeking a developer to buy and expand a city-owned garage and commercial building in an area of Long Island City, Queens, where major rezoning is proposed to spur commercial revitalization. The five-story building, with about 180,000 square feet of space, now houses a public garage with 1,100 parking spaces, a furniture store and offices. The proposed rezoning, which would increase the size of buildings permitted on many sites in the area, would allow for about one million square feet of space to be added at the garage site, the city's Economic Development Corporation said. The site, near the end of the Queensboro Bridge, is bounded by Queens Plaza South, Jackson Avenue, 42nd Road and 28th Street. The rezoning proposal requires City Council approval to become law, which could come more than a year from now. But a corporation spokesman, Gregory Miley, said, "We're confident it will receive all the necessary approvals." Joseph P. Fried (NYT)
 
HIGH-SPEED TRAIN
Amtrak's long-delayed high-speed train, the Acela Express, will begin service between Washington and Boston on Dec. 11, railroad officials announced at a news conference yesterday in Washington. Acela trains will travel up to 150 m.p.h., compared with other Amtrak trains, which reach a top speed of 125 m.p.h. The high-speed trains will shorten the typical four-hour trip between Boston and New York by one hour. The first train's arrival was was highlighted during the news conference, and 19 more have been ordered for next summer. The service was scheduled to begin last October but premature wheel wear and problems with the technology that helps the train negotiate curves were among the causes for the delay. The railroad is under a congressional order to become financially self-sufficient by 2003. High-speed service in the Northeast Corridor is projected to earn $180 million a year. (AP)

Mrs. Clinton Faulted In Travel Office Report
In his final report about the firing of employees of the White House travel office, Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel, asserted that Hillary Rodham Clinton had given "factually false" sworn testimony when she minimized her role in the incident.

Gov. George W. Bush argued that Vice President Al Gore would endanger the nation's prosperity as a proponent of "big government," and he used his own pledge of tax cutting to rally his party's base in Wisconsin. A30
 
Mr. Gore's advisers said they wanted to buy 90 minutes of time on cable television channels in swing states to rebroadcast Tuesday's debate. Mr. Gore's performance, the advisers say, helped him make the case for himself as the candidate best prepared to guide the nation's economy. A30

BRITISH UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS

BYLINE: By Alan Cowell 

 BODY:
For the 19th consecutive month, British unemployment fell, reaching a 25-year low of 3.6 percent, in another reflection of the strength in the economy. But there have been recent signs that growth could ease. The Bank of England said its monetary policy committee voted unanimously this month to hold the benchmark interest rate at 6 percent because reduced growth in the United States and the Continent's euro zone and falling stock prices and rising oil costs raised risks of a slowdown.

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
ITALY: VOTING ABROAD -- A constitutional amendment was approved to allow Italians overseas to elect their own legislators, including candidates who live abroad. Twelve seats in the 630-seat lower house and six in the 315-seat Senate are to be allocated to representatives of Italians abroad, of whom there are about 4 million, with more than 300,000 in the United States and Canada. First, however, a law must be passed setting up candidates' procedural rules. Voting by absentee ballot is not allowed. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
FRANCE: CABINET RESIGNATION -- Martine Aubry, the cabinet minister who shepherded the introduction of the government's 35-hour workweek policy, has quit her cabinet post to run for mayor of Lille. The widely expected move is seen as a steppingstone to run for higher office in 2002. If Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is expected to run for president in 2002, were to win, Mrs. Aubry could well replace him as prime minister. Mr. Jospin named his justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to take over Mrs. Aubry's portfolio. Suzanne Daley (NYT) 

RUSSIA: AMERICAN'S TRIAL DELAYED -- A Moscow court granted a one-day delay in the espionage trial of Edmond Pope, the American businessman accused of trying to buy secret plans for a torpedo, so lawyers could draft specifications for an evaluation of Mr. Pope's bone cancer. Lawyers argue that Mr. Pope, in jail since April, has been denied proper medical care. Judges denied other requests in the closed-door trial, including a plea for a jury. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: TORTURE REPORT -- Amnesty International said torture is increasing around the world, in dictatorships and democracies. At a news conference, Pierre Sane, secretary general of the London-based rights group, said it had uncovered evidence of beatings, rape, electric shock and other forms of torture in more than 150 countries, including Britain and the United States. Between 1997 and 2000 there was evidence of widespread torture by state agents in more than 70 countries, the group said. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
AUSTRIA: TALKS ON NUCLEAR PLANT -- Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel and Prime Minister Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic plan to meet on Oct. 31 in the Czech city of Brno to try to resolve a dispute over a nuclear plant in Temelin, some 35 miles from the Austrian border. The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, said the meeting would take place only if a suspended blockade of the border by antinuclear protesters was officially called off. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
SWITZERLAND: PRESIDENT TO QUIT -- President Adolf Ogi said he would resign this year, leading to speculation of a change in the traditional coalition-style government. Mr. Ogi was at odds with the rightward turn of his Swiss People's Party, which did well in last year's elections on an anti-refugee platform. The anti-Europe views of a leading party figure, Christoph Blocher, differed from Mr. Ogi's. With Mr. Ogi gone, Mr. Blocher may again try to win a seat on the country's governing council. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
EGYPT: VOTING BEGINS -- Elections for the 444-seat People's Assembly got under way, with scattered reports of harassment or arrests of people supporting independent candidates. The governing National Democratic Party was expected to maintain its overwhelming majority in the Parliament, where a handful of small opposition parties together control only 6 percent of the seats. Voting will also take place on Oct. 29 and Nov. 8. Abeer Allam (NYT)
 
IRAN: KHATAMI HITS OUT -- President Mohammad Khatami denounced the "sick" campaign against his reform movement and warned of an explosion of popular anger if his rivals continue to ignore the will of the people, the state news agency said. In an emotional defense before an audience of students, Mr. Khatami made a rare direct attack on conservatives who have hobbled his efforts to liberalize Iran's social and political life.
 (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: RIOTS SPREAD -- Soldiers joined the police in patrolling the streets of Lagos after riots that have already led to more than 100 deaths spread throughout the commercial capital. The security forces fired shots in the air to disperse rioters, many of whom appeared to be unemployed youths known as area boys. The violence began with clashes between a Yoruba group and Hausa merchants. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
ZIMBABWE: PROTESTS IN THIRD DAY -- Protesters angered by soaring food prices clashed with the police in the townships near Harare for a third day. Police officers and soldiers patrolled several townships, searched houses and sprayed tear gas when protesters tried to block roads. With the economy unraveling, inflation is soaring, and the price of bread and sugar surged by 30 percent this month. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: BACKTRACKING ON MOUNTAIN -- Bowing to western pressure, the government is backtracking on a decision to rename the nation's highest peak, Mount Logan, after Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former prime minister who died on Sept. 28. With sympathy for Mr. Trudeau low in the west, Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is expected to call an election for Nov. 27, has indicated that he now supports a Yukon Territory proposal to name a sub-peak of Mount Logan after the French Canadian. James Brooke (NYT)
 
MEXICO: TABASCO VOTE IN DOUBT -- With two rivals claiming victory, and the leadership of Mexico's long-governing political party in the balance, results of Sunday's election for governor in the state of Tabasco will not be known before the weekend, election overseers said. Preliminary results gave a 1 percent lead to Manuel Andrade, the hand-picked successor to Gov. Roberto Madrazo, who wants to be the next national leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. His opponent, Raul Ojeda, of the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, says the lead was built by fraud.
 Tim Weiner (NYT)
 
CHILE: TRUCK STRIKE CONTINUES -- Striking truckers obstructed roads throughout the country for a second day, and concern grew over possible food and fuel shortages. Leaders of the National Confederation of Truck Owners, who transport 92 percent of the freight hauled in Chile, said more than 7,500 vehicles were involved in the protest against a tax on diesel fuel. The government put the figure at 2,000 vehicles. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: FALUN GONG DEATHS -- Three more followers of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement have died in police custody, bringing the known total to 57 since the group was banned last year, according the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, based in Hong Kong. A 61-year-old man in Shandong Province died last week after he was arrested for distributing Falun Gong literature, the group said. Another follower jumped from a train and died while being repatriated to Shandong, while a third follower died after he fell from a building during police questioning. Erik Eckholm (NYT)
 
SRI LANKA: PRESIDENT'S BROTHER IS SPEAKER -- President Chandrika Kumaratunga's estranged brother, Anura Bandaranaike, was elected speaker of Parliament. The sister and brother come from the country's leading political dynasty. Both their parents served as prime minister. Mrs. Kumaratunga heads the ruling coalition, which has just returned to power. Her brother is a leader of the opposition United National Party. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

 "A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Nov. 12). Most of the artists in this show -- English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries -- are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein-air approach, used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. These canvases today are sought-after prizes. The 68 on view here were assembled by a pioneering scholar and collector in the field, John Gere (1921-1995), former Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, and his wife, Charlotte. Mostly painted in Rome and the surrounding countryside, they capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 "AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART," 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largesse of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector, who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the "Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation," by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but overall, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Glueck).
 
 "IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS," African Art From the National Museum of Ethnology in Lisbon, Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Dec. 31). Shown in quantity for the first time in the United States, this collection from the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau was assembled by the Portuguese government, starting in the 1960's. The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers; ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls, important in the socialization of girls, from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
 
 "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000," the year-and-a-half-long, millennium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest, though, is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The third-floor galleries open on Nov. 5.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 "PIERRE ET GILLES," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but this beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "RUSKIN'S ITALY, RUSKIN'S ENGLAND," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Jan. 7). This show commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of John Ruskin (1819-1900), artist, art and architectural critic, social reformer, educator and the first official professor of art in England. From its own collections, the Morgan has mined a biographical medley of letters, manuscripts, photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts relating to the life of this Victorian giant, whose published writings run to 39 volumes. Although not really an art show, it includes paintings and drawings by Ruskin and artists he admired, among them J. M. W. Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It touches on his widely influential books of criticism, his beautifully finished sketches of architectural structures, his teaching and his monographs on proposed social reforms. Not omitted are his 1877 attack on James McNeill Whistler, his failed marriage and attraction to young girls and his sad end after a long siege of mental illness. But there is much to celebrate in his life, and this show doesn't stint. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and the elderly; free for children under 13 with an adult (Glueck).
 
 * SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4.). "Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21.). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above( Cotter).
 
 * EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
DAN FLAVIN, Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 4). Flavin's simple, fluorescent-light works from the 60's illuminate this posh new gallery to simultaneously matter-of-fact and mystically radiant effect. The white ones have classic Minimalist rigor; examples consisting of just two or three colors are almost hedonistically sumptuous (Johnson).
 
 JOHN GOSSAGE AND HERMANN VOGEL, "Empire," Roth Horowitz, 160a East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067 (through Oct. 28). A veteran Conceptualist photographer, Mr. Gossage has orchestrated a dry but sly installation that intersperses his own oblique, fragmentary photographs of famous American memorials (shot on surveillance film using a hand-made telephoto lens) with beautiful, mid-19th-century photographs of Egyptian archaeological sites by the German photographer Vogel. This produces a suggestive layering of histories and politics (Johnson).
 
 "REMBRANDT AND THE VENETIAN INFLUENCE," Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Nov. 18). The Venetian influence in Rembrandt's later paintings has long been noted; this show is an attempt to demonstrate by specific examples. But the topic is more suited to a museum presentation; this one mounts only a dozen paintings, three by Rembrandt and one labeled "Studio of Rembrandt," along with oils by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. It is too small and catch-as-catch can to make the case. The most salient example here of Venice in Rembrandt is his great painting "Flora" (circa 1654). Next to it, the other works in this show pale (Glueck).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
MAGDALENA ABAKANOWICZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through Oct. 28). This pre-eminent Polish sculptor's regiment of 95 life-size, headless shells of human figures in rough bronze confronts the visitor here, creating a theater of tragic existentialism. On the terrace, giant, simplified dinosaur heads suggest a deep background of primordial terror (Johnson).
 
 * RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 28). This Dutch artist's solo debut in the United States includes a video (much seen elsewhere) of dancing teenagers in European clubs and a series of photographs she has been taking since 1997 of children in parks. In the video the youngsters preen touchingly. The photographs, color pictures along the lines of Thomas Struth's but more casual and less chilly, are heroic portraits, acutely sympathetic (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
LARRY CALKINS, American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530 (through Oct. 28). Mr. Calkins, who is based in Washington State, is self-taught but his work in various media has a professional-looking sophistication. Flat, child-size dresses on hangers -- one sprouting big nails, another festooned with little discs bearing the image of a moth -- are materially rough but poetically graceful. The surfaces of small paintings made of soot swarm mysteriously with ghostly images of flying insects (Johnson).
 
 MONIKA KULICKA, John Gibson, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1192 (through Oct. 30). As a protest against modern civilization's mechanization of the world, this young Polish artist who now lives in New York has slathered real, mossy green chlorophyll over five pieces of old wood furniture in a quixotic attempt to restore the dead wood to life. The absurdity of the gesture is amusing and yet somehow a little sad (Johnson).
 
 "LIFE, AFTER THE SQUIRREL," Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through Oct. 28). This nutty fun house of a show begins with Filipe Miguel's rustic shed, supposedly inhabited by post-apocalyptic squirrels. The main exhibition space has a squishy plastic floor and a ceiling of inflated pine trees. Works include Tony Tasset's stuffed "Dead Bluejay"; Aernout Mik's video of old men horsing around; a hypnotic video by Pipilotti Rist; John Neff's deadpan video recital of Hal the computer's last speech; and Vincent Pruden's provocative makeup table for applying blackface (Johnson).
 
 ALICE MAHER, Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190 (through Oct. 28). An Irish sculptor who creates evocative metaphors in a variety of media, Ms. Maher is having her first New York exhibition. "Gorget" consists of two sets of nine potato-size, smoothed-over female heads that look like archaeological treasures; one set is of solid crystal, the other, of chrome-plated bronze, looks as though it were made of mercury. On paper, the artist draws fields of interwoven loopy lines that look like undulating expanses of netting (Johnson).
 
 "PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION," Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7748 (through Oct. 28). "We are at a threshold," declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that most of the art isn't great, because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction (Kimmelman).
 
 DAVID RABINOWITCH, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Nov. 18). Restricting his vocabulary to circles, ovals and straight lines, and his means to pencil, ink or colored pencil, this Constructivist-Minimalist sculptor produced this series of extremely spare drawings during the early 1970's. Called "Construction of Vision," they are resolutely abstract and quasi-scientific. But the ellipses and angled lines, cleanly drawn with mechanical drafting tools, have a subtly playful animation (Johnson).
 
 CHRIS VERENE, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through Nov. 11) and Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through Oct. 28) With often piercing intimacy, this 31-year-old photographer chronicles the lives of friends and relatives in his hometown of Galesburg, Ill. Each of 60 richly colored, squarish images in this two-gallery show has a brief handwritten text added by the artist. Under the picture of a cousin, Steve, and his young daughter at a McDonalds, the text says, "His wife had just left them to go to a battered woman's shelter." A dozen prints, at Paul Morris, tenderly document the daily existence of Mr. Verene's grandfather (Johnson).
 
 * NEIL WINOKUR, Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166 (through Oct. 28). For this delightful portrait of his hometown, Mr. Winokur has produced a series of 32 still-life photographs, each a crystal-clear, deadpan picture of an ordinary but richly iconic object against a bright colored backdrop. A Greek-style paper coffee cup, a Chinese food container, a Giants pennant, an old Broadway playbill, a Con Edison orange cone, a hot dog, a rat, a toy-size Empire State Building: these images produce a resonantly evocative cross section of New York experience (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 * PETER HUJAR, "Photographs, 1980 to 1987," Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through Oct. 28). A show of 98 photographs from Hujar's estate, some never shown before. The prints, on a particularly warm paper that is no longer made, are quite beautiful. One would not use that adjective for the images, which are powerful and quietly, deeply disturbing, full of pain but resolutely refusing to dramatize it, now and again touching, now and again amusing in an elegiac sort of way. They are portraits of friends, some nude, some in costume, some engaged in odd enterprises like biting into a strawberry. They are portraits -- they cannot be called anything else -- of animals. They are images of destruction: collapsed houses, the flayed carcasses of slain cows, a dead dog on a heap of trash. They are intense and reticent at the same time. They are memorable (Vicki Goldberg).
 
 ALBERT RENGER-PATZSCH, Tatintsian, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 633-0110 (through Oct. 28). If the German photographer Renger-Patzsch (1897-1966) were working today, he would probably make his formally perfect, subtly poetic pictures of industrialized landscapes, medieval church interiors and close-up plant studies into glossy, sofa-size Cibachromes. These small black-and-white vintage prints from the 1920's and 30's offer a welcome, intimately evocative respite from today's overly showy photo-aesthetics (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
"RE-DRAWING THE LINE," Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473 (through Oct. 28). This unfocused show of works in which line figures, literally or conceptually, includes an invigorating giant doodle by Diana Cooper; whited out ledger pages by Peter Wegner; the image of a scribble cut from brown felt by Arturo Herrera; a dripped line from a performance by Francis Alys; a string sculpture by Pae White; and tangled plastic zip ties by Mungo Thomson. The importance of line in obliquely conceptual works by Alessandro Balteo and Sophie Tottie is harder to see (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
SUZANNE ANKER, Universal Concepts Unlimited, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through tomorrow). One of those Leonardo types who like to combine art and science, Ms. Anker presents silk-screened paintings and sculptures addressing the representation of genetics. Silk-screen panels display silvery, gridded fields of chromosome symbols with little human images mixed in. The 500 silver-painted, three-dimensional letters A, C, T and G piled on a glass panel refer to DNA. (Johnson).
 
 LOUISE FISHMAN, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727 (through tomorrow). Ms. Fishman's Abstract Expressionist painting is still tough and gritty in its bluntly gestural, grid-based physicality, but now it has a lusciousness of color that verges on the hedonistic. "A Stranger," with its web of impulsively made, wide slate-gray lines over a salmon pink field, is a voluptuous yet still excitingly raw picture (Johnson).
 
 PETER GOULD, Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 343-4293 (through tomorrow). This young Pop-Conceptualist presents two neat, small parklike installations based on fast-food restaurant landscaping. Grass is represented by green Formica and bushes by silhouettes cut from thin flat panels; stacked red bricks provide architectural framing. These cartoonlike abstractions of the modern, corporate oasis are quietly funny and oddly touching (Johnson).
 
 "IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER," Kaikodo, 164 East 64th Street, (212) 223-0121 (through tomorrow). Kaikodo's sales exhibitions are always a treat, and the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings in this one is a major lure. These days New Yorkers rarely get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums. Highlights include an album painting of a flower attributed to the 13th-century artist Qian Xuan (it's very fragile, so you have to ask to see it); a 17th-century calligraphic scroll by the fractious Fu Shan; and a witty four-panel portrait of a family of gibbons, gold-medal acrobats all. Devotees of ceramics and textiles will also find much to admire (Cotter).
 
 BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sunday). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger in a sense helped pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 GERHARD RICHTER, Barbara Mathes, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-5135 (through tomorrow). This exhibition of small works by the enigmatic and hugely influential German painter features a group of canvases from the 80's and 90's bearing his familiar brand of beautifully scraped, dragged and squeegeed Abstract Expressionism and an intriguing six-part photographic self-portrait in which blurry shirtless men -- the artist himself multiply exposed -- do mysterious things in dim, empty rooms (Johnson).
 
 BRIDGET RILEY, "Paintings 1982-2000 and Early Works on Paper," PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through tomorrow). This show picks up where the small survey of Bridget Riley's paintings at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea leaves off, following her continued involvement with color through nine recent canvases, while a group of gouache studies from the 1960's documents the transition from black-and-white to color, through subtly vivid tones of gray (Smith).
 
 DAVID SMITH, "The Last Nudes," Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through tomorrow). Made in 1964 and not seen during the great modernist sculptor's lifetime, "The Last Nudes" is a series of paintings of naked women, each rendered in a loose, drippy black line on white easel-scale canvas. Smith used an enamel-loaded ear syringe to make them. The Freudian implications may be amusing -- the emission of vital fluids triggered by female flesh -- but the pictures, though not without a certain graphic vitality, are barely worth a glance (Johnson).

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety;
Checking Tire Pressure From the Driver's Seat

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHATEVER the flaw that causes some Firestone tires to shed their treads, with sometimes lethal results, the company says that failure is highly unlikely if the tires are inflated properly.
Because the flaw remains unknown, that contention is unproved, but Congress evidently agrees with Firestone. An auto safety bill that both houses overwhelmingly approved last week made headlines mainly for increasing penalties for executives who hide safety defects. But it also included a provision that would eventually require systems to let a driver read the tire pressure on the car's instrument panel, similar to the dashboard warnings for low oil levels or high coolant temperature. 
 Several variations of systems that monitor tire pressure already exist. In the past, they have been marketed as a way to avoid flat tires. Now, there is an additional safety angle, because of the seeming propensity of a Ford Explorer to roll over if one of its tires falls apart.
Some new cars come from the factory with such devices, and systems will soon be available that can be added on to older cars.
"How often do you check your tire pressure?" asked Phillip G. Zaroor, president and chief executive of Advantage Enterprises Inc. of Harrisonville, Mo., which makes a device that checks tires every four seconds. Few drivers regularly monitor tire pressures, he said. And most cannot identify an underinflated radial tire at a glance, as they could with earlier bias-ply tires.
Underinflation can cause tire failure, according to Firestone, because if the tire sags too much, the sidewalls flex as the tire rotates, building up heat. The statement is drawn from simple observation, because Firestone says the mechanism that leads to tire failure is still unknown.
Mr. Zaroor's device, called PressurePro, is a simple add-on: a Chap Stick-size device that screws unto each valve stem, in lieu of the cap. Inside is a battery pack, consisting of three button cells, a pressure monitor and a radio transmitter. The system comes with a receiver that could be mistaken, at first glance, for a radar detector. It plugs into the cigarette lighter for power.
The transmitter works whenever the vehicle is traveling 10 miles an hour or faster, and its signal carries 100 feet, so it works well on a trailer hauled behind a recreational vehicle, Mr. Zaroor said. The receiver unit can be programmed to emit a warning beep at a certain pressure level.
Like garage door openers, each transmitter sends a coded signal, to avoid being picked up by the wrong receiver. More than 4,000 have been sold, mostly for recreational vehicles and trucks, he said.
But the original model is a bit long, and, if installed on the valve stem of a car tire, which is set at a 15-degree angle, it would protrude beyond the edge of the tire and could be damaged if, for example, the car scuffed the curb. In addition, if the unit failed, it could deflate the tire. (The stems on truck tires are typically not angled, which allows the device to stay within the wheel area.)
That system had a retail price of $179, but is probably not available on store shelves any longer, he said.
A new version, intended to have a retail price of less than $100, is due out in February. Because it uses more advanced microelectronics, it is smaller and does not protrude from the tire. It also uses less power, and so requires only one battery instead of three, and that battery is supposed to last for two years, twice as long as those in the original device. And, he said, the device cannot deflate the tire.
Another company, Schrader-Bridgeport, part of Tompkins P.L.C., sells SmartValve, a unit that alerts the driver when a tire is low, for $275; a model that specifies which tire, and by how much, is $363. The company, best known for its conventional pencil-type tire-pressure gauges, as well as for its tire valves, also provides the tire-monitoring units that are standard equipment on the Chevrolet Corvette and Plymouth Prowler. The company's Web address is www.schrader-bridgeport.net/ssv.
SmarTire Systems Inc., of Richmond, British Columbia, has been making tire monitors for years, but is only now nearing mass production of a system that is likely to have wide appeal. Its technology was first used on gigantic vehicles in open-pit mines, where big tires can cost tens of thousands of dollars each.
In 1997, tire makers came to SmarTire to develop a system that would warn the driver of a car with "run flat" tires that a tire was actually flat, said Charlene Krepiakevich, a spokeswoman for the company.
"Run-flat tires are designed to allow you to continue to drive safely," she said. "But if you don't know it's gone flat, eventually you'll be stranded."
To prevent that from happening, the company developed a temperature and pressure monitor that is strapped inside the wheel. Like Mr. Zaroor's device, it broadcasts to a monitor in the passenger compartment.
But run-flat tires have not yet caught on. And partly because installation of the SmarTire unit is complicated, the system had sold for about $300 for light vehicles and $400 for vehicles that are heavier or have more than four wheels.
Now, Ms. Krepiakevich said, SmarTire is anticipating a booming market, and mass production should lower prices. A new, refined version of its hardware will go into mass production soon, she said. It has a battery that will last seven years, which, she said, is almost certainly longer than the life of the tire.
Temperature and pressure usually move in tandem, so measuring one should generally be adequate, but SmarTire measures both. John I. Bolegoh, manager of technical services at the company, said that if a tire developed a slow leak on the highway, the normal rise in temperature during highway driving might mask the leak by indicating stable tire pressure. SmarTire would give early warning of a problem, he said. Or if a brake was dragging, the temperature of one tire might rise much higher than the others', another early warning sign.
The company plans to distribute the device through after-market auto parts stores. It has also signed a deal with TRW, a big parts supplier, to try to have its product included on new cars. That would permit a variety of built-in display systems, Ms. Krepiakevich said. A description is available at www.smartire.com/fl/.
Maintaining tire pressure would have other benefits, including less tire wear, lower fuel consumption and better handling.
And a factory-installed model could also establish the appropriate inflation for a new car. A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that most people inflate their tires to the maximum pressure stated on the sidewall, not to the manufacturer's instructions in the owner's manual or on the door post, two more obscure locations.
 Just what the Federal rule will require will not be clear for months. Congress gave the Transportation Department a year to develop rules requiring a warning system for tire pressure. The rule would be applied to new cars two years after it was published.
Until then, of course, one can always use the old-fashioned tire-pressure gauge.

HEADLINE: Does an International Bear Market Mean World Recession?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
REMEMBER 1998? As Asian currencies crumbled and stock markets crashed, panic spread around the world. Amid fears of global recession, the Federal Reserve aggressively eased credit. Markets recovered as it became clear that disaster would be averted.
Now those gains have been wiped out. Measured in dollars, half the value of stock markets in such countries as Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand has melted away this year, leaving them close to their 1998 lows. Japan has lost a quarter of its value. In this hemisphere, the markets of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru are all down by 15 percent or more. 
 And you were upset that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 5 percent.
"Nobody is really thinking about the weakness of the world outside the United States and Europe," said Michael O'Higgins of O'Higgins Asset Management in Miami. "It means the world economy is a lot weaker than people think. The markets smell trouble ahead."
There are signs of worry in this country, too. Junk bonds are trading as if recession and huge defaults are just around the corner, at premiums to Treasury bond yields that exceed those of the 1998 panic.
All this is happening as the world economy hums along with high demand pushing up prices of oil and copper. Even Japan is showing signs of rising domestic confidence and demand. The Japanese central bank's decision to raise interest rates was widely scorned, but the expected damage has not appeared.
The conventional wisdom is that the world is slowing, whatever the current numbers say. High oil prices are hurting growth while the Fed's tightening earlier this year alarmed overseas investors who recall it was the Fed that bailed out the world in 1998. Signs of a technology slowdown scare investors in such computer-component exporters as Taiwan and South Korea. In Taiwan, down 42 percent this year, the government yesterday announced its second package in a week aimed at shoring up stock prices. Part of the package is an increase in the amount foreigners are allowed to invest there, a change that might be more effective if it came at a time when foreigners wanted to do so.
The implicit investment thesis that has developed is that the United States stock market is the safest place for money in a slowing world. Our market is populated by growth companies that are supposed to do well even in a slowdown, while parts of Asia have replaced the American Midwest as the region that makes the products whose sales would plunge during a recession.
David Bowers, the chief global investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, says investors face a major decision on asset allocation. "Have we overestimated the slowdown?" he asked. If so, this would be a good time to look for investments in depressed markets.
Whether or not the markets are exaggerating the risks, it is amazing how little attention has been paid to the possibility during the current election campaign. In part, that reflects the comfortable assumption that the United States will escape the worst of any slowdown.
The unsettled nature of world markets may help to explain the wild rides the American market is experiencing as traders try to figure out if this is a turning point in the global economy. The rebound yesterday was reassuring, while the opening plunge on Wednesday was scary.
As they say in China, we live in interesting times.

HEADLINE: Export Surge Helps Reduce Trade Deficit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit narrowed in August to a six-month low as a surge in exports of aircraft engines, computer chips and other capital goods reduced the effect of record imports, government figures showed today.
The $29.4 billion trade gap in goods and services came after a record deficit of $31.7 billion in July, the Commerce Department said. While imports rose 0.8 percent, to $122.5 billion, the highest ever, exports rose 3.6 percent, to $93 billion, also a record. The value of oil imports fell 1.5 percent. 
 Imports of capital goods increased as well, suggesting that businesses' investment in productivity-enhancing equipment should keep inflation in check. Unemployment at a 30-year low of 3.9 percent keeps consumer spending strong. A dollar that is up more than 10 percent against a mix of currencies since the start of the year has held down prices for merchants turning to foreign sources for holiday gifts and other goods.
"This is welcome relief," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. Analysts still cautioned that a surge in oil prices last month threatened to widen the gap again.
Analysts also say the narrower trade gap will spell faster economic growth in the third quarter than previously estimated. Gross domestic product probably grew at closer to a 4 percent annual rate, compared with a previous estimate of 3.4 percent, many of them said.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said new applications for state unemployment benefits decreased last week. Initial jobless claims fell by 7,000, to a seasonally adjusted 307,000 in the week ended Oct. 14, after rising to a revised 314,000 the previous week.
The August trade deficit was the smallest since $27.5 billion in February. Through August, the trade deficit totaled $235.5 billion this year, up from $164.6 billion during the first eight months of 1999. The August deficit puts the annual shortfall on track to reach $379 billion, compared with the record $265 billion in 1999.
A 4 percent increase in exports of nonmilitary capital goods other than automobiles, to a record $31.9 billion, paced the jump in shipments abroad. Exports of computers, semiconductors, aircraft parts and engines and railway equipment all rose.
The decline in crude oil imports, to $8.2 billion from the previous month's record in volume and value, reflected lower prices. The volume increased to a record 310 million barrels in August.
Imports of consumer goods rose 0.8 percent in August as companies stocked up for the holiday season.

HEADLINE: The Empty Center of Campaign 2000

BYLINE: By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If you are expecting to soon find out what the election will turn on now that the debates are over, you're going to be disappointed. In fact, you may be puzzled about the whys of the outcome even after we know the winner of campaign 2000.
This is a very different kind of election. Not only is it a close race, but it's one of the few elections in which the lead has gone back and forth. The presidential contests in 1960, 1968 and 1976 were all tight in the end, but they were not seesaw races. There were changes in the leader over the course of the 1980 campaign, but ultimately this was not a close election, and the message voters were sending was clear. 
 Campaign 2000 is a difficult one for voters because this election is not about anything very much, even though we want it to be about something. Consider what the voters face. There are no overarching issues. Yes, people are concerned with health care, education, Social Security, Medicare and other issues, but they feel far less urgency than in past elections, when big foreign threats loomed or the economy was less robust. And the failure of health-care reform in 1994 and the Gingrich revolution in 1995 have soured the public's appetite for big changes from Washington.
Voters generally judge this year's candidates favorably -- in fact, they give the field a better rating than they did in 1992 and 1996. But there is not a lot of strong feeling one way or the other about Al Gore versus George W. Bush. Neither man has been more able than the other to make a compelling case for his candidacy. Add to this the fact that the central question of most elections is not being raised. Voters are not being offered a referendum on the administration in power; that question is being sidestepped by both camps. President Clinton's name was hardly mentioned in the third presidential debate.
No wonder as many as one in four voters still might change their minds, and many could sit out the election altogether. Ordinary Americans have nothing to hold onto this year unless they are partisan or ideological. That is why all of the groups without strong political leanings have been, and continue to be, on the fence. Independents, middle-income voters, suburbanites, white Catholics and other swing groups have been evenly divided or just leaning one way or the other since the end of the primaries last spring.
The swing groups are likely to have a variety of reasons for coming to their final decisions. Some strongly favor Mr. Gore on health care and other high-anxiety issues, but have trouble with his personality. Others think Mr. Bush might provide a refreshing change in tone in Washington, but worry about his qualifications and some of his positions on issues.
While the choices that different groups of swing voters make won't be based on whim, they might be highly idiosyncratic and may not provide the tight thematic narrative that analysts look for. That probably won't slow down the pundits. These days the meanings of elections are often overread, if not misread, in a rush to blather. (Think about the hard time today's pundits might have had in 1960: Was Kennedy's win about Quemoy and Matsu or the missile gap -- or was the election a personal showdown between Kennedy's style and Nixon's downbeat persona?)
There is a striking disconnect here. With Supreme Court nominations on the line, and control of Congress as well as the White House up for grabs, voters could be remaking Washington this Election Day. But if that happens, they will have ambled in the new direction, rather than striding there purposefully.

HEADLINE: Iraq Poverty Said to Undermine Food Program

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The administrator of the United Nations "oil for food" program in Iraq said today that although that distribution system ranked among the world's best, the lot of ordinary Iraqis has failed to improve because their living conditions remain mired in chronic deprivation.
"People have become so poor in some cases that they can't even afford to eat the food that they are given free, because for many of them the food ration represents the major part of their income," the administrator, Tun Myat, said. 
 With the average income of a junior public employee eroded to barely $2 or $3 a month, he said, "to sustain their livelihood, they sell part of what they get" in food and medicine to pay for clothing and other necessities.
Despite an individual ration of 2,470 calories a day, Mr. Myat added, "the upturn in nutrition that we would want to be seeing is not happening."
Mr. Myat, a Burmese-born lawyer who previously worked for the World Food Program, came here from Baghdad to brief the Security Council sanctions committee and encourage it to release $2.25 billion in contracts for civilian goods that the Iraqi government has requested. The United States and its allies have blocked the sale, contending that the goods could be used for other than relief purposes.
Mr. Myat said, for example, that more than 34 percent of applications to buy equipment for Iraq's battered electricity grid were pending.
Since 1996, when Baghdad accepted the Security Council conditions for selling oil to pay for food and medicine, $33 billion worth of Iraqi oil has been exported in quantities that are now unlimited. The aid deliveries, which started in 1997, have gone beyond basic needs to encompass oil-pumping machinery, electrical transformers and a wide variety of other equipment to renovate Iraq's physical plant, which was badly damaged in the Persian Gulf war and subsequent airstrikes.
In an average month, Mr. Myat said, Baghdad imports 150,000 to 200,000 tons of food and other goods through the program, to feed a population of 23 million.
"I think the Iraqi food-distribution system is probably second to none that you'll find anywhere in the world," he said. "It gets to everybody whom it's supposed to get to in the country."
But he followed up with a caveat. "You can give all the food and medicine you want," Mr. Myat said, but living standards would not improve unless housing, electricity, clean water and sanitation and other essential services were restored.
Mr. Myat said medicine was bought in bulk and distributed through a network of pharmacies and hospitals. But some inhalers imported for Iraqis suffering from asthma have turned up for sale in Damascus and Beirut.
"Human nature being what it is," Mr. Myat said, "I'm quite sure there must be a few enterprising people who might have taken it across the border, and that's what I'm trying to find out."
Mr. Myat's observations were useful because, as Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council last month, Baghdad has not allowed independent experts into the country to assess the effects of the sanctions in place since Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The Council said sanctions would be lifted after it had determined that Iraq no longer had chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as the means to make them. But President Saddam Hussein has refused to let United Nations arms inspectors return to resume the verification broken off nearly two years ago.
Mr. Myat was appointed the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Iraq in March after two predecessors, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, quit in protest against what they described as the suffering that sanctions inflicted on the Iraqi people.
Mr. Myat told reporters that he would keep doing his job because if the oil-for-food program foundered, Iraqis would have nothing to fall back on. "Let's not forget that's the only game in town," he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Oil Prices Haven't Done Much Harm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The low-inflation new economy is up against an old-economy challenge -- a surge in oil prices -- and so far the new economy is holding its own, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today.
Mr. Greenspan said the effects on the economy from higher oil prices have been modest so far. And the Fed chairman said there had been almost no effect on inflation expectations, reducing the chances the oil prices could set off a destabilizing spiral of rising wages and prices. 
 In an address here to a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Cato Institute, a conservative research group, Mr. Greenspan suggested that he saw nothing happening in the economy that would lead the Fed to raise interest rates anytime soon -- or reduce them.
He repeated his optimistic view that the growth rate of productivity was still accelerating as technological advances work their way through the economy. Higher productivity growth means that companies are producing more with the same amount of labor, allowing them to pay higher wages and maintain or expand profit margins without raising prices. But he warned about long-term challenges to continued prosperity. One is that the surge in productivity will eventually abate. The other is that the benefits to the economy of the federal government's running a large budget surplus are likely to be tempered because the two parties seem intent on using much of the projected surplus for tax cuts or new spending.
Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has bet over the last several years that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than traditional economic theory would allow. The country has been rewarded by a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent, a 30-year low; rising wages; and subdued inflation.
But against a backdrop of a rapidly changing economy, Mr. Greenspan said, "it is essential that we not be deluded into believing that we have somehow discovered the Rosetta stone of monetary policy."
For one thing, economists get reams of data about old-line manufacturing activities but are still struggling to get good information about developments in the technology side of the economy, especially in fields like software development, the Fed chairman said.
"So it is with some irony that just as we are adapting our old-economy models to the new realities, in drifts an apparition from the past -- a spike in oil prices that has potential implications for economic stability and for monetary policy," Mr. Greenspan said. The economy today is far less dependent on energy than it was in the early 1970's, when an oil price shock set off a recession, Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Tajik Tangle: Odd Alliances Worry Neighbors

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: KAFIRNIGANSKY REGION, Tajikistan

 BODY:
The winding road from the capital ends here, for anyone who would not like to risk becoming the hostage of a warlord named Umar.
Barely 20 miles from Dushanbe, the capital, four young mujahedeen fighters brandish Kalashnikov rifles at a checkpoint a quarter-mile from Mr. Umar's base, in a former auto-repair factory surrounded by cotton fields and persimmon orchards. 
 Umar, they say, is not receiving guests today. Besides, one advised, he is an unpredictable man and it is "not recommended" that visitors call on him lest he decide to rob them, or shoot them, as one warlord is suspected of doing to four United Nations workers killed on this road two years ago.
Umar's deployment of Islamic fighters on the only route out of Dushanbe to the rebellious Karategin Valley underscores the lawlessness in Tajikistan. Two years after a national reconciliation that followed a devastating civil war, Tajikistan is still a land of clan-based paramilitary forces, Islamic revivalism and regional enmities.
The man standing astride the divided politics of the country is President Emomali Rahmonov, a former collective-farm manager and Communist Party apparatchik who rules with enduring support from Russia and by sharing power and money with the enemies his army could not defeat on the battlefield.
Through financial inducements, and sometimes just brute force, Mr. Rahmonov is reconstructing central authority in Tajikistan by deepening relations with Russia and the West, who have pursued the closer ties with their own interests in mind.
Fighting Islamic extremism and drug trafficking has become the highest priority for both Central Asian and Western governments. In addition to asserting his authority against former enemies at home, Mr. Rahmonov has tried to prevent Islamic militants based in Afghanistan from expanding their guerrilla warfare and terrorism across Tajikistan's frontiers to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
"Tajikistan is a key state," said Robert P. Finn, the United States ambassador in Dushanbe. With Afghanistan to the south and all of Central Asia to the north, a destabilized Tajikistan "is a danger for all of its neighbors."
Such concern is well founded. The long and violent civil war after the breakup of the Soviet Union has made Tajikistan unique among Central Asian states.
"It was like a revolution in our country," said Hizomov Mirzokhuzha, a deputy commander of Tajikistan's police force in Soviet times. He took up arms against Mr. Rahmonov in 1992 as a top military commander of the United Tajik Opposition, a loose coalition of Islamic forces, democratic movements and regional bosses long excluded from power who were seeking to overthrow the post-Soviet hangers-on and the regional clans they served.
"During the time of the Soviet Union, I could never have imagined that I would become a rebel," Mr. Mirzokhuzha said in an interview at his home in Dushanbe. "No one wants to end up fighting, but the life of a person is written -- and sometimes, if you don't fight, you are going to be killed."
And there was plenty of killing, with estimates of 30,000 to 50,000 dead and up to one million refugees.
Today Mr. Mirzokhuzha is minister for customs taxation in Mr. Rahmonov's cabinet, a post that belies his real power as he helps the government enforce the peace by advising how to integrate rebellious warlords once under his command into the armed forces, where the reward for peace is a paycheck.
"The republic is now democratic, and it is on that foundation that we are working," Mr. Mirzokhuzha said.
But the process is anything but smooth, as Umar's roadblock demonstrated. While the handful of mujahedeen controlled the road here, Tajikistan's armed forces rumbled into the Karategin Valley to suppress and disarm the last of the rebellious warlords there, Mullo Abdullo, who fought as a field commander with the opposition during the war. On Sept. 11, about 40 of his estimated 100 Islamic fighters surrendered; others melted into the mountains.
Mr. Abdullo's grievance was simple: He was not happy that his forces were not offered jobs in Tajikstan's army, as required by the peace protocols. Government officials were loath to offer him and his men positions because they are suspected of the execution-style killing of the United Nations workers in 1998.
But some compromise was reached in September. After Mr. Abdullo's surrender, Mr. Rahmonov surprised many by touring major cities in Karategin Valley, pressing the flesh in town-hall-style meetings that received extensive television coverage. The visit was his first to the heartland of Tajikistan's Islamic revolt.
"The president's trip to the northeast shows that the situation in the area is stable," said Amirkul H. Azimov, secretary of Tajikistan's national security council, though he conceded that "some people were very nervous" that an attempt would be made on Mr. Rahmonov's life.
While Tajikistan may be more stable than ever before, the threat from Islamic extremists seems to be increasing. For that reason, some Western governments seem content to overlook Tajikistan's dismal human rights record. Freedom of the press has ceased to exist, with more than 30 journalists killed since 1992 and 150 or more forced into exile.
In September, Russian military officials who command 25,000 troops along the Tajik-Afghan border reinforced their positions after fighters for the Taliban, the fundamentalist movement that rules most of Afghanistan, scored fresh victories against the "northern alliance" of Ahmed Shah Masoud. Russia and Tajikistan provide rear-area support to Mr. Masoud's forces.
Neighboring Uzbekistan has also been a concern. The State Department placed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan on the list of terrorist organizations in September, asserting that its leader, Juma Namangani, was receiving support from Osama bin Laden, whose Afghanistan-based group is suspected in the bombings of two American embassies in Africa.
Mr. Namangani fought alongside Tajikistan's Islamic rebels during the civil war and has conducted guerrilla-style campaigns against Kyrgyz and Uzbek Army forces for the past two summers. Former colleagues here say Mr. Namangani has taken up arms in response to the repressive, antireligious policies of the Uzbek president, Islom Karimov.
"I know Juma Namangani very well," said Mr. Mirzokhuzha, the former opposition leader. "The people where he is from complained that the government came to their village and started arresting those who were going to the mosque and praying. They arrested his relatives, too, and that is why he founded this group -- to liberate them."
Mr. Namangani's support from Mr. bin Laden may include helicopters that now transport Mr. Namangani's rebels across Tajik territory, Western officials say, as well as financial aid that has allowed Mr. Namagani to buy food from villagers when his troops are in the field, a tactic that has improved his support.
Tajikistan's neighbors have charged that President Rahmonov or members of the Islamic opposition who now sit in his cabinet provide bases for Islamic fighters attacking Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, but Mr. Rahmonov says his security forces have worked to block attacks from Tajik territory.
"There were never such bases in Tajikistan and there are not now," said Mr. Azimov, the security council adviser.
As other Central Asian leaders have formed security arrangements, Mr. Rahmonov has tied his country's economic and security interests most prominently to Russia's. When the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan canceled their trips to Yalta in August for a summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Rahmonov dutifully showed up to discuss plans to establish a permanent Russian military base in Tajikistan.
"Russia was, is and will be our main partner for the future," Mr. Azimov said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds That Many Large Companies Pay No Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Goodyear, Texaco, Colgate-Palmolive, MCI WorldCom and eight other large corporations earned more than $12.2 billion in profits in 1996 through 1998, but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period, according to a study released yesterday. Indeed, as a group, the companies received $535 million in credits or refunds, the report found.
The study of 250 large publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during the three-year period. 
 The study was conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington research organization associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions. The group argues that the tax system favors the rich and politically connected.
Corporate profits overall soared 23.5 percent during the three-year period, but corporate tax revenues grew just 7.7 percent, a disjunction that has drawn intense interest from the Treasury Department and some members of Congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and their abuse.
In recent years, Congress has watered down the 1986 overhaul of the tax laws, which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters, and was supposed to simplify reporting. The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for corporations to cut their taxes, the study found.
"Corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the 1986 tax act," said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. "Companies also have gotten a lot of help from Congress, especially in gutting the minimum tax rules."
Mr. McIntyre said that he and T. D. Coo Nguyen, the co-author, spent more than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to shareholders.
All but 18 of the companies studied are on the Fortune 500 list, and the others are in the Fortune 1000. He said companies were excluded if they lost money or their tax disclosures "were crafted so that you could not figure them out."
At least two companies objected to the study's methodology.
Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear, said the study did not appear to consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in 1998. It made no objection to the 1996 and 1997 figures.
Michael N. Ambler, Texaco's chief tax counsel, said that his company had tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that were unresolved after more than a decade. If those disputes are settled with a refund, he said, that can easily distort the figures for any one year. He said that even the three-year study period was too short to give an accurate picture.
Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents officials at large companies, told Bloomberg News that the companies named in the report did nothing wrong. "There is nothing in the report that suggests that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity," he said.
The study by the Washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options, which are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to shareholders.
Recent annual reports filed by Microsoft and Cisco Systems indicate that they paid no federal income taxes in 1999 because stock options exercised by employees wiped out profits for tax purposes.
The study found that General Electric, I.B.M., Pfizer, Intel and Bristol-Myers Squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders.
The most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden, Mr. McIntyre said, can be traced to actions in Congress, which relaxed the corporate minimum tax in 1993 when the Democrats were in control of both the House and Senate, and again in 1997, after the Republicans had taken over. Congress made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many years, including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not be used at the time.
In at least one of the three years studied, 41 of the 250 large companies studied paid no federal income tax. Those 41 companies reported $25.8 billion in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes. If they had been obligated to pay the full 35 percent corporate rate, the tax bill would have been $9 billion, but the companies received $3.2 billion in refunds.
In total dollars, General Electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks, the study said, saving $6.9 billion in three years. The company paid $2.1 billion in income taxes on $25.8 billion in profits, for a tax rate of 8.1 percent.
The highest tax rate for the three years was paid by Winn-Dixie Stores, which paid an average of 35.7 percent of its 1996 through 1998 profits in federal income taxes. It was one of two companies that paid more than the 35 percent statutory rate because of multiyear tax rules. The other was Paccar.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Harlem Block Transformed After 10-Year Pause

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
After an 18-month renovation, the rundown rows of empty buildings that, like battered bookends, long filled the corners of Morningside Avenue at West 117th and West 118th Streets in central Harlem, have been turned into 49 condominium apartments.
The one- to three-bedroom units were carved from refurbished interiors created behind the restored brick facades of the buildings. Each of the two rows of six 19th-century buildings was combined into a pair of five-story structures. One is at 371 West 117th Street; the other is at 370 West 118th Street. 
 The residences, including several duplexes, have 648 to 1,225 square feet. All have been sold for $60,083 to $146,959 to buyers with annual household incomes of $28,000 to $70,950.
The $6.8 million project, called Morningside Parc, looks across Morningside Avenue to Morningside Park. Its 49 units were developed with city and state subsidies, under the Partnership New Homes Program. Its sponsors include the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership, with further support from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation.
This project "is a good example of how renovating existing buildings can be another vehicle to providing affordable homeownership," said Charles Brass, president of the housing partnership.
The project's developer and community sponsor is the nonprofit Harlem Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency. Galaxy General Contracting of the Bronx is the builder. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Community Preservation Corporation each provided $2.03 million in construction financing.
Morningside Parc is the long-awaited second phase of a larger renovation project totaling 148 condo units in former city-owned buildings on parts of both sides of West 117th Street between Manhattan and Morningside Avenues and stretching to West 118th Street. The first phase was completed in 1990, and it took four years to sell all 49 units in a market that was then in a downturn, with Harlem properties lagging those elsewhere in Manhattan.
Today the opposite is true. The current 49 apartments were sold within four months through a lottery that drew more than 550 applicants, said Diane P. Phillpotts, the president of Harlem Community Development.
Lisa M. Stevenson, who is in her mid-30's and works for a nonprofit theater services group in Manhattan, is buying a one-bedroom condo at the project.
"Without this project I would still have to rent or move to Queens or New Jersey to buy," she said. "I can now own my own piece of Manhattan, stay in the neighborhood and be part of the genesis in Harlem."
According to the city's housing preservation agency, it has invested more than $300 million in Harlem since 1994 and has 20,000 residences completed, under way or planned. That includes 4,200 homeownership units, which Carol Abrams, a department spokeswoman, said "tracks with what the three Harlem community boards are advocating."
Among the larger recent projects is Renaissance Plaza, which is nearing completion on Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street. It includes 62,000 square feet of stores topped by 241 city-subsidized co-ops. Another large project is planned at 1400 Fifth Avenue between 115th and 116th Streets. It will have 129 condos above 25,000 square feet of stores.
Prices of existing homes in Harlem are rising. The average sales price for condo apartments in Manhattan above West 110th Street and East 96th Street was $184,013 in the second quarter of this year, up from $171,286 in the same period in 1999, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. At the same time the board put the average sales price for town houses at $266,780, up from $224,538.
Along with public subsidies lowering the price of each Morningside Parc unit by $33,000, the project has been granted tax abatement from the city, which will effectively keep real estate taxes at a minimum for 30 years. Monthly common charges, including taxes, are initially projected to be $259.52 to $489.38; without the abatement they would be $270.40 to $509.89.
The buildings that make up Morningside Parc as well as those in the larger development had been taken over by the city through tax foreclosure. In time they became ugly bruises on the two blocks.
That began to change in 1989 with the project's first phase, which included the renovation of a six-story mid-block building on the south side of West 117th Street into 42 condominiums. Also, four brownstones on the north side of the street were converted into 8 condominiums.
Nearly 10 years passed between the completion of the project's first phase and the start of the second, a delay due mainly to the downturn in the real estate market.
Along with restoring the facades of the former walk-up buildings, the renovation, designed by Roger C. Lewis & Associates of Rockville Centre, N.Y., included new plumbing and heating systems, elevators and lobbies. Each complex also has such amenities as a community room and a landscaped rear courtyard.
The apartments feature oak floors, ceramic tile bathrooms and washer and dryer hookups. Many also offer park views. Buyers will be able to start occupying their units by the end of November.
Construction of the project's third phase is expected to start early next year. It will include 47 condos created from seven buildings on the south side of West 117th Street from mid-block west to the corner of Morningside Avenue. The seven are to be renovated into two structures, completing the transformation of the block begun over a decade ago.

HEADLINE: NASA Tests System to Warn Of Runway Collision Dangers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: GRAPEVINE, Tex., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Everything the captain could see through the clear night air indicated a perfect landing: gear down, engines rumbling at idle, and the autopilot receiving signals from the ground that would bring his lumbering Boeing 757 right over the middle of three parallel runways, touching down amid the thousand skid marks of the landing zone. It looked like another one of the 20,000 unremarkable jet landings a day.
But then a pair of headlights, barely visible, appeared in the inky blackness on the right side of the runway and began to cross. In a situation like this, flying at four miles a minute and with about a mile to go till the end of the runway, at less than 300 feet above the ground, the pilot would have seconds to react, if he was lucky enough to see the threat. 
 But this plane had an experimental computer from NASA with a voice and a flashing message that warned "Runway Conflict! Runway Conflict! Runway Conflict!" The pilot, Capt. Richard Grue, on loan from American Airlines, wasted no time in opening the throttles and roaring back into the sky.
The effort was designed to tackle one of the most worrisome and fastest growing problems in commercial aviation, runway collisions. Runway collisions have killed 63 people in the last 10 years, and the number of cases in which a plane or a vehicle enters a runway on which another plane has the right of way is rapidly rising.
The Federal Aviation Administration has been working on a system to predict conflicts and issue a warning, but it is 10 years behind schedule, and the agency has so simplified its technology, in an effort to finish up, that the National Transportation Safety Board says it will not do the full job.
For the last three weeks, a NASA crew of about 70 people has been using the 757, crammed with computers, and a Dodge van electronically equipped to mimic a plane. The experiments take up half of Dallas/ Fort Worth Airport, between midnight and 5 a.m., the only hours when the airport is not busy.
The plane, which NASA bought in a bankruptcy sale from Eastern Airlines, is testing several related technologies, which researchers hope will reduce accident rates and allow airplanes to fly and land closer to each other, a capability that would reduce chronic delays and would encourage airlines to spend money to install the new equipment, some of which has the look of a video game.
The F.A.A. system, which started limited use in San Francisco on Aug. 30, is supposed to be installed at 34 airports by 2002. It uses radar to sense planes' positions and movement on the ground or near it, and to predict conflicts and then alert the tower controller. But it does not monitor all taxiways, and the warning may be delayed because a controller must look at the screen, figure out who is at fault and radio new instructions, all in a few seconds.
The NASA system is a cockpit warning, with a map showing the plane's position and that of the intruder.
In tests this morning, some software programs never issued a warning, forcing a human pilot in the co-pilot's seat, who was privy to the script, to tell the test pilot to abort. One trick is writing the software to give alarms only when appropriate.
"You do it a little too early, and you get a lot of false alarms; too late and you get collisions," said R. Michael Norman, a researcher on loan to NASA from Boeing. Even a few unnecessary go-arounds would destroy the economic benefits of the system, he said, and pilots tend to disregard systems that give false alarms too often.
The NASA system has other capabilities. One feature is a "moving map," to allow the crew to see the plane's position on a map in darkness and fog.
Airplanes sometimes taxi into the path of others because they have taken a wrong turn in the forests of pathways and lights, among the most featureless terrain that anyone has to navigate. But the NASA system shows a screen with a map and virtual traffic cones, stop signs and turn signs.
A related system, "synthetic vision," generates a map of the terrain in flight and the intended path of the plane as what looks a little like a monorail track.
Captain Grue said the system needed work but, he said, "it's cool and it works." Captain Grue, who has had special training for landing at mountain airports in South America, said the feature for navigating once on the ground would be a major improvement, because it was so easy to get lost there.
NASA researchers and outsiders who have visited them are most excited about the system to prevent runway incursions. "The data show that runway incursions are on the rise, and traffic is going up 3 percent a year," said John C. Penney, a captain at United Airlines, who also flew the system this morning. "You're going to have more incursions on limited pieces of concrete," he said.

Nasdaq Climbs As Technology Stocks Surge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Technology stocks soared yesterday, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to its third-biggest gain ever as upbeat profit reports and a sunny forecast by Nokia dispelled many of the clouds hanging over Wall Street.
Continuing a rebound that began in the depths of near-panic selling Wednesday morning, stocks climbed steadily through the day, with all the main gauges finishing near their best levels. The Nasdaq surged 7.79 percent, a move exceeded only by the 7.94 percent advance on May 30 and the 7.87 percent gain posted last Friday. 
 "They were looking for an excuse to rally," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., referring to a battered high-technology sector, where semiconductor shares had dropped 45 percent from their peak. "All of a sudden," he said, "all the pieces were in place."
The Nasdaq gain amounted to 247.04 points, putting the index at 3,418.60 and narrowing its loss this year to 16 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 46.63 points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,388.76. As for the Dow Jones industrial average, which tends to lag when Nasdaq soars, the gain was 167.96 points, or 1.7 percent. The blue-chip Dow climbed back above the 10,000 mark, to 10,142.98.
Much of the buying was said to have come from individual investors, which along with many professionals seemed to have become overly demoralized by a steady barrage of warnings by leading companies that profits or sales would not meet expectations.
"There were disappointments, sure," said Jeffrey Warantz, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "But we knew earnings were going to slow down," he added. What happened was that "investors had gone wild and taken more off the stocks than was warranted."
Amid the bargain hunting, some mutual funds may have built up more cash than they needed to meet anticipated redemptions during the market's rocky performance since early September, while others may simply have finished the selling they wanted to do for tax reasons as the end of the fiscal year approaches.
Still other investors who had bet on a continued decline -- before yesterday the Nasdaq had declined every day but two this month -- were forced to buy stock to cover their short positions when the market turned up. Yesterday was the 13th anniversary of the 1987 crash.
Nokia, the world's biggest maker of mobile phones, not only beat third-quarter profit forecasts but predicted a record fourth quarter. This was a week after Motorola, No. 2 in the field, cautioned that earnings would lag into next year, prompting a sell-off. Nokia rose $8.13, to $38.13.
Microsoft, which reported its earnings after the close of the market on Wednesday, leaped $10.13, to $61.88, making the biggest positive impact on the three main gauges. A total of 127 million Microsoft shares changed hands, the third-heaviest trading of its shares on record.
The Dow's biggest gainers after Microsoft, which accounted for more than one-third of the total, were J. P. Morgan, up $8, to $142.25; Hewlett-Packard, up $5.38, to $90.94; and Intel, which rose $3.75, to $41.94.
Johnson & Johnson, down $2.50, to $91.75, in a weak drug group, was the biggest drag on the Dow.

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said productivity gains were keeping inflation in check.
The price of the 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.65 percent from 5.66 percent. The 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 107 2/32. Its yield dropped to 5.75 percent from 5.77 percent.
Bonds rose and notes pared losses after Mr. Greenspan and Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said there was little evidence that growth in worker productivity was slowing.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REFORM PARTY;
Nearing the End of the Tunnel, Buchanan Glimpses a Sunset

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
He has fought the good fight, surviving nasty party factionalism to get his name onto the ballot in almost every state and obtain $12.6 million in federal campaign money. He has even ridden out three recent hospital visits for gallstone problems.
But as he carries the Reform Party banner into the November elections at the age of 61, Patrick J. Buchanan is waging what he concedes could be his last battle as a political candidate. Facing a steady stream of polls that show his conservative message resonating with barely 1 percent of the voters, he all but acknowledged today that he was ready to bow out after the elections in favor of new leadership for an organization he has single-handedly overhauled since bolting the Republican Party last year. 
"I'll have to sit down and take a look at where we are," he said over breakfast, sounding not so much saddened by the year's fortunes as proud of his accomplishments. "I am a romantic. I like to roll the dice and take a chance. But I am also very much a realist. Buchananism may prevail even if Buchanan does not."
He is not going out just yet, mind you. Since the third of his recent medical procedures, he has been on the road almost constantly, visiting 22 states and planning stops in 10 more or so before Election Day.
Fortified by new radio and television commercials that trumpet his "America first" themes, he is concentrating on states where he sees weakness or at least vulnerability in the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among them are New York and California, and also Minnesota, where Mr. Buchanan spoke to an audience of several hundred today at the University of Minnesota Law School.
(That audience did not include the Reform Party's greatest star of recent years, Gov. Jesse Ventura, who, describing the party as "hopelessly dysfunctional," abandoned it eight months ago, in part over Mr. Buchanan's entry. A spokeswoman for the governor, now an independent, said he was scheduled to have lunch at the time Mr. Buchanan was speaking.)
It is in states that Mr. Bush is not likely to win, Mr. Buchanan said, that he has a better chance to convince voters sympathetic to his views that their support would not be wasted on a third-party candidate.
"George Bush has written off New York State," Mr. Buchanan said. "So a vote for Bush there is a wasted vote. But a vote for Pat Buchanan can help accomplish something: fighting for a third party, building a new party that doesn't poach or thieve but offers the American people something new."
His concern, of course, which he readily acknowledged, is that for now the country appears unready to embrace a third party, either his on the right or Ralph Nader's Green Party on the left. Mr. Nader has polled somewhat better than Mr. Buchanan in most national surveys, reaching as high as 4 percent in some, causing more concern for Vice President Al Gore than Mr. Buchanan has caused for Mr. Bush.
Unlike 1992, when the Reform founder, Ross Perot, tapped into a widespread discontent with government and won 19 percent of the presidential vote, or 1994, when Republicans captured both houses of Congress for the first time in four decades, this year finds a prosperous nation relatively content.
That, Mr. Buchanan said, does not necessarily bode well for a third-party campaign now, especially one like his, which promotes many more issues than Mr. Perot championed in his two runs for the White House. Mr. Perot focused largely on budget, trade and government reform; Mr. Buchanan has restyled the party to include stands against abortion rights, moral decline, liberal immigration policies and foreign military intervention.
"Look," he said, unflaggingly animated in an hourlong interview, "as long as we're fighting wars from 15,000 feet and not losing a soldier, when the unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, the Dow is at 11,500 and the Nasdaq is at 5,000, it's not going to be easy for us.
"But when the chickens come home to roost, this whole coalition will be there for somebody, and then they're going to think, 'What ever happened to that guy back in 2000?' There's no doubt these issues can win. But 2000 might not be the year for them."
For all his triumphs in the Reform Party, one failure still rankles: the inability to convince the Commission on Presidential Debates that he and Mr. Nader deserved a place on the stage with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore these last two weeks. Had he managed to prevail, Mr. Buchanan said, polls would have shown him "in the teens right now, the upper teens."
"But the perception is now that it's a very, very close race," he said, "and people want to bet on it like the Super Bowl because there are only two people in it." He laughed. "We're in the Fiesta Bowl with Nader."
Even Perot-like support would not do the party much good for now, other than to qualify it for federal campaign funds for 2004 by surpassing the minimum requirement of 5 percent of the popular vote. Nor did Mr. Buchanan make it sound as if jumping even that modest hurdle would have a huge bearing on his own future. After the election, he said, he will assess the results, then meet with party leaders to measure their appetite for party building and his role in it, as a candidate or, more likely, an elder statesman of sorts.
Steven J. Rosenstone, dean of the college of liberal arts at the University of Minnesota and author of a 1996 book, "Third Parties in America," said that with or without Mr. Buchanan, the Reform Party might undergo yet another metamorphosis over the next four years in an effort to gain ground.
"This is not unlike the pattern that has befallen other third parties," Mr. Rosenstone said. "They start with a bang, some with a flamboyant candidate, then factions emerge, issues are co-opted by the mainstream parties, and the novelty wears off."
All of that remains to be seen, Mr. Buchanan said.
"We're going to go all out for the next three weeks," he said enthusiastically, and "then I don't know what I am going to do after that. A lot depends on how well the Reform Party does. But I know one thing: I'm not going back to the Republican Party. The further away from it I get, the better I feel."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Chiefs Agree on a Disputed Medicare Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Brushing aside objections from President Clinton, Republican leaders of Congress announced today that they had agreed on a plan to pump $28 billion into Medicare over the next five years, mainly by increasing payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and other providers that care for the elderly.
With that plan, the Republicans appear to have set themselves up for a high-stakes political confrontation with the White House just three weeks before Election Day. 
 Mr. Clinton has repeatedly complained that the Republican bill, details of which have emerged piecemeal over the last week, would give too much money to H.M.O.'s., which he says are already overpaid.
Republicans, on the other hand, say it is imperative to increase payments to health maintenance organizations to keep them from dropping out of selected Medicare markets.
Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, said lawmakers had heard from hundreds of constituents who were saying in effect, "I've lost my Medicare H.M.O., and I want it back."
The president has threatened to veto the legislation, and Republicans today virtually challenged him to carry out that threat.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he could not believe that Mr. Clinton would veto the bill, since it provides $5.7 billion in new preventive-care coverage and other assistance to beneficiaries over the next five years.
Medicare spent roughly $214 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Congress sharply reduced the growth of Medicare when it trimmed payments to health care providers in 1997. Now, under pressure from providers of all types, it is acting to restore some of the money. Democrats endorse that goal but disagree with Republicans on how the money should be divided up.
The new bill, as described by Republican lawmakers and their aides, has these provisions:
*H.M.O.'s would receive $10.2 billion more from Medicare over five years than under current law -- $6.2 billion in basic Medicare payments, plus $4 billion to reflect the cost of new benefits and the higher rates for doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.
*Hospitals would receive $8.4 billion of additional Medicare money in the next five years. This includes a full adjustment in 2001 to cover inflation in the cost of goods and services used by hospitals.
*Nursing homes would receive $1.6 billion of additional Medicare payments. The bill would enable nursing homes to pay higher wages to nurses and nursing assistants but would not require them to use the money for that purpose.
*Home health care agencies would receive $1.3 billion in additional payments over the next five years. This would provide a 12-month delay in a 15 percent cut that is scheduled to take effect next October.
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the Republicans had not discussed the bill's details with him or other administration officials. The veto threat is "still operative," said Mr. Jennings, who pleaded with Republicans to consult the White House before sending their bill to the floor of the House and the Senate for votes next week.
"The absence of bipartisanship," he said, "significantly reduces the viability of any health care initiative."

HEADLINE: 2 MANUFACTURERS ARE SET TO MERGE IN $40 BILLION DEAL

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The United Technologies Corporation, one of the last old-style conglomerates that makes everything from jet engines to elevators, is expected to buy Honeywell International Inc. for about $40.3 billion in stock, according to executives close to the talks.
Both boards are planning to meet today, the executives said. The companies acknowledged late yesterday that they were in talks, but declined to comment further. The executives said the companies hoped to announce the deal as early as today. 
 The acquisition would create an industrial behemoth, bringing together United Technologies' Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Sikorsky helicopters and Carrier air-conditioners, with Honeywell's aerospace systems, power and transportation products, specialty chemicals and home security systems.
Last year, Honeywell merged with Allied Signal.
The combined concern, which merges two Dow Jones industrial companies, is expected to take the Honeywell name and have its headquarters in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, the executives said, though it remains unclear where it will be based. The executives suggested that the headquarters would not be in Hartford, where United Technologies is based, or in Morristown, N.J., where Honeywell is based.
According to the executives, United Technologies has offered about 0.74 of a share, or $50.32, for each of the about 801 million outstanding shares of Honeywell, making the total purchase price $40.3 billion. That is a 39 percent premium above Honeywell's close yesterday of $36.13, up $2.44. Shares of United Technologies closed down 38 cents at $68.
George David, the chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, would be chief executive of the combined company, while Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, Michael Bonsignore, would become chairman, the executives said.
The companies hope to save about $1 billion annually by combining, the executives said, and add as much as 25 cents a share to earnings the first year after the merger.
Although analysts had not predicted the deal, few were surprised by it. Wall Street had for some time been expecting United Technologies to announce an acquisition, and Honeywell's name has often made it onto the short list of possibilities. Honeywell has had a rough year both in terms of stock price and earnings, and several analysts have said it was vulnerable to takeover.
The two companies have many overlapping businesses. United Technologies makes Carrier heating and air-conditioning systems; Honeywell makes thermostats and other climate control devices. United is in the process of forming a distributed power business; Honeywell already makes microturbines. United Technologies owns Otis elevators and escalators; Honeywell is big in building control systems. United Technologies makes Sikorsky helicopters; Honeywell is a big supplier of avionics and helicopter engines.
"They are both major players in the same industries, and while there's lots of overlap in customers, there is surprisingly little overlap in their products," said one analyst who covers both companies.
Honeywell and United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney both make aircraft engines, of course, but while United Technologies is strong in the commercial airline market, Honeywell's strength is business jets. And, because replacement parts -- a very lucrative business -- are not interchangeable, they do not compete there. In fact, the two companies recently formed a joint Web site, Myaircraft.com, that enables their customers to buy technical information, use inventory control software and buy parts.
"There are enormous operating and marketing synergies across a host of product lines, from small aircraft engines to air-conditioning controls," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
The expected merger comes less than 17 months after Honeywell was formed, the product of a merger between Honeywell Inc., a Minneapolis-based maker of electronic controls, and the Allied Signal Corporation, a diversified manufacturer in Morristown. Although Allied was by far the larger partner, the merged company kept the Honeywell name and named Mr. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief, as its chief executive.
But Honeywell has traveled a rocky path since then. The weak euro has pummeled its earnings, while the softening economy has put pressure on sales. Moreover, Honeywell has a large chemicals operation that has been badly hit by rising oil prices.
It has also had trouble merging the disparate cultures of the two companies. Allied had for years been run by Lawrence Bossidy, a strong-willed executive who was groomed by John F. Welch at General Electric and had much of Mr. Welch's take-no-prisoners style. Honeywell people were used to a more relaxed, Midwestern and courtly management style.
Analysts say Mr. Bonsignore has not been able to create a seamless whole out of such disparate parts. In fact, Wall Street has been speculating that Honeywell's board was looking to replace Mr. Bonsignore. One name that kept arising was that of Robert L. Nardelli, one of the contenders to succeed Mr. Welch as chairman of G. E.
Mr. Bonsignore inherited some of the company's problems. Before the merger, Allied had invested heavily in pharmaceutical and chip-packaging businesses, both of which have been bottom-line disasters.
But the merged company has also had disappointing growth in industrial controls and fire security systems, two businesses that the old Honeywell brought to the party. And it has not been able to offset tripling oil prices with price and volume increases in its chemicals businesses.
Several analysts say the merged company has been marred by infighting, as each side tries to blame the other for this year's worsening numbers. In many ways, they say, that chaos may make the current merger with United Technologies more workable.
"No new Honeywell identity has emerged as yet, so it won't be a melding of two strong cultures," one analyst said. "George may just come in there and say, 'All right, kids, enough now, stop fighting,' " referring to Mr. David, the United Technologies chief.
He is widely regarded, both on Wall Street and among many management experts, as up there with Mr. Welch and Mr. Bossidy as among America's best chief executives. But unlike those men, both of whom are known for their brusque styles, Mr. David is someone who can win over customers and employees alike with a combination of charm and knowledge.
He is also credited with turning United Technologies into a lean, cost- effective company that has enjoyed six continuous years of double-digit earnings growth.
"George is a C.E.O. out of central casting," Mr. Rubel of Goldman, Sachs said. "He's articulate; he understands customer problem;, he's aggressive; he's forward thinking; and he earns the respect of his competitors."
Actually, both companies have been promising double-digit sales and earnings growth for this year and next. Investors just seem to believe United Technologies, though -- its stock has held firm, even inched up steadily, despite the recent market turbulence, while Honeywell's has taken a beating in the last few months.
Still, according to Charles L. Hill, research director at First Call/ Thomson Financial, analysts have strong buy recommendations on both stocks. He does note, however, that while analysts keep strengthening their recommendations on United Technologies, they have added caveats to their recommendations in light of Honeywell's lackluster earnings this year.

The Arabs' Road Map

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The first Arab summit meeting in a decade convenes in Egypt tomorrow, and it will signal what road the Arab world intends to go down in the 21st century. There are three possibilities: (1) This summit will end with Egypt still leading the Arab world on a road of cold peace with Israel and integration with the West; (2) it will end with Iraq and Syria leading the Arab world on a path against Israel and America; (3) or the summit could end in a way that will totally shock the 22 Arab leaders. That would be with the world looking at this Arab summit and wondering why the Arab East is the only region in the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, that is still ruled entirely by dictators, autocrats and kings, without one real democracy.
Let's examine all three: What was Anwar el-Sadat's genius? He understood that, for the sake of Egypt's future, he had to end his country's conflict with Israel, even if it meant leaving the Palestinian issue unresolved. Sadat was convinced the Arab world would eventually follow. 
 His successor, Hosni Mubarak, has adopted a more ambiguous approach. He has maintained just enough peace with Israel to keep getting U.S. aid and investment, but just enough tension so that Israel is not fully accepted in the region and so that the Egyptian regime can use anger toward Israel as an outlet for frustrations in Egypt over the slow pace of democratization and economic growth. In fairness, Israel's own ambiguous policy, negotiating peace while continuing to expand settlements, has made Mr. Mubarak's ambiguous peace easy to maintain. And it must be said that in times of crisis Egypt still works to keep the region from exploding.
Nevertheless, the downside of Mr. Mubarak's cold-peace approach is that it leaves relations with Israel up in the air, and this leaves Egypt and the other Arab regimes vulnerable to Yasir Arafat's inflaming their public opinion and bringing people into the streets, where they could start protesting all sorts of things besides just Israel. This, in turn, could force Egypt and the other Arab moderates into something they have tried to avoid -- a religious war against Israel that would drive away foreign investors and leave them globally isolated.
If that happens, we'll have option 2. That would be an end to the fleeting moment when Israeli moderates and Arab moderates worked together against all extremists, and its replacement by a quasi-religious war of angry united Muslims, spearheaded not by Egypt but by Iraq and Iran, against angry united Israeli Jews.
Should that happen, the Arab world will end up stuck in option 3. The Arab peace process with Israel has always been part of a larger embrace of modernization, gradual democratization and integration with the West. If the Arab summit meeting goes back to rejecting Israel, the region will be perceived as moving back to tribalism and separating itself from the major trends in the world today.
And that will only lead the world to ask: Why is it that East Asian leaders said to their people, "If you postpone democracy, we will give you prosperity." And they did, and democracy soon followed. While Arab leaders said, "If you postpone democracy, we will give you the Arab-Israeli conflict," and their people bought it and paid the price. Why is it that when East Asian leaders hold summit meetings they focus on how to solve their economic problems, while when Arab leaders hold summit meetings they focus on how to blame Israel or the West for their problems?
These are devastating questions. The only good news is that Arab leaders of a new generation are already asking them, and their countries -- Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Bahrain, Tunisia, Morocco -- are desperately trying to extract themselves from this Arab summit circus where the past always buries the future. Pay attention to Jordan's visionary young King Abdullah. He will be at the Cairo Arab summit, but afterward he will be flying to Washington. Why? To sign, on Tuesday, the first-ever free-trade agreement between America and an Arab country -- Jordan. Jordan will join Mexico, Canada and Israel as the only countries in the world with free-trade accords with the U.S.
Maybe a few Arab journalists will have the courage to ask their leaders at the summit, "O.K., we're glad you're still trashing Israel, but hey, why has Jordan forged a free-trade accord with the U.S. and our country hasn't?" If that happens, maybe the next Arab summit will be different.

HEADLINE: Group Presses Whitman for Decision on Aid for Newark Arena

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Backers of a proposed sports arena here for the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils gathered today to prod Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to quickly commit state aid to the project, arguing that it had economic and social benefits for both the state and the city.
Many in the group, which was dominated by Democratic officials, criticized the Republican governor, whose administration announced in August that all public aid to the arena would be limited to $75 million in infrastructure improvements. The group pressed her to be more generous in supporting the effort, an 18,000-seat arena that is estimated to cost $325 million. 
 The session, convened by the likely Democratic candidate for governor in 2001, Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, was attended by top officials of YankeeNets, which owns the teams and would be the arena's likely developer, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and other political and corporate leaders.
They concluded that Newark would be a better location for a new arena than the Meadowlands, where a money-losing operation currently exists, and that if such a complex were to be built here, it would accelerate the city's revitalization. Harvey Schiller, the president of YankeeNets, said the proposal reflected a nationwide trend of moving sports teams to urban centers from suburban locations.
Mr. McGreevey said in an interview that he could see the state contributing as much as one- to two-thirds of the cost of the arena. The aid would include improvements in roads and other infrastructure as well as public funds to supplement private investment and to attract funds at low interest.
Citing recently confirmed reports that the Meadowlands complex, where the Nets and Devils now play, was losing money and costing taxpayers about $50 million a year in operating subsidies, Mr. McGreevey said that building a Newark arena made good fiscal sense.
The Whitman administration has been negotiating for the last two months with YankeeNets on state assistance for the arena. Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said the gathering today was unnecessary because the administration had been making great progress in those talks.
"This is purely political for McGreevey, an announced candidate for governor, to call a forum to ask for more money when we are making progress," Mr. McDonough said.
Rae Hutton, a spokesman for the Senate president Donald T. DiFrancesco, a likely Republican candidate for governor, said that it was not surprising that Mr. McGreevey -- who raised Woodbridge taxes to build a new municipal building -- would call for more public financing for the arena.
More than two years ago Governor Whitman contended that the Nets and the Devils should remain at the Continental Arena at the Meadowlands, which is state owned. But the Nets seemed determined to move to a new arena in Newark. The governor then said that the state would not assist them unless the Nets could lure another sports team to make the proposed arena economically viable.
At the time, Dr. John J. McMullen owned the Devils and was pressing for a plan to build an arena in Hoboken. But he sold the team to the YankeeNets last spring and removed any barrier to the two teams moving in unison. The governor's office then said that in its negotiations with YankeeNets it would insist that all city, county and state public aid be capped at $75 million. In addition, it would continue to try to press for a rebuilt arena at the Meadowlands.
Today, Mr. McDonough said that the state had dropped the idea of building an arena anywhere other than Newark and that it would be flexible on the $75 million limit.

Eli Lilly said that it had terminated its agreement with Sepracor, a small drug company, to make a new version of the antidepressant drug Prozac after some patients taking the new formulation in clinical trials developed abnormal heart rhythms. The news sent Sepracor's stock down $33.75, or almost 30 percent, to $87.06. Lilly fell 75 cents, to $88.50. C6.
 
I.R.S. Seeks Credit Card Records
The Internal Revenue Service has asked a federal judge to issue summonses for two years' worth of records of MasterCard and American Express card transactions in the United States that were billed to bank accounts in Caribbean nations. Using the Internet and other outlets, banks in those nations openly solicit tax evasion in schemes, some using credit and charge cards, that the I.R.S. says have proved attractive to executives, business owners, physicians and other wealthy Americans. A1.
 
A study of 250 publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during the three years. C2.
 
G.O.P. Chiefs Push Medicare Bill
Brushing aside objections from President Clinton, Republican leaders of Congress announced that they had agreed on a plan to pump $28 billion into Medicare over the next five years, mainly by increasing payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and others that care for the elderly.

Support Grows for Internet Filters
Congressional support is growing for efforts to require schools and libraries with Internet access to install software to block access to pornography, obscenity and materials considered harmful to minors. A28.
 
Criticism Rises With Euro's Fall
Wim Duisenberg, the gruff and blunt-speaking president of the European Central Bank, acknowledged that he had blundered in his recent comments, suggesting that the central bank would not intervene again soon to strengthen the euro, and vowed to hold his tongue more in the future. With the euro sinking this week to a record low, Mr. Duisenberg has been criticized for saying things that in easier circumstances might have been quickly forgotten. C10.
 
Greenspan Says Oil Has Small Effect
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the effects on the economy from higher oil prices had been modest so far. And he said there had been almost no effect on inflation expectations, reducing the chances the oil prices could set off a destabilizing spiral of rising wages and prices. C15.
 
The nation's trade deficit narrowed in August to $29.4 billion, a six-month low, as a surge in exports of aircraft engines, computer chips and other capital goods reduced the effect of record imports. C6.

HEADLINE: Taxes, the Market and Luck Underlie the Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In all the political debate about how to spend the rapidly emerging budget surplus, almost nothing is said about where it came from. It is a patchwork creation, hard to keep sewn together.
Taxes thrown off by the soaring stock market contributed handsomely to the surplus. So did higher tax rates on the rich, enacted just before their incomes surged ahead of other Americans' in the booming economy of the 1990's. Cutbacks in military spending after the cold war also helped significantly. Without these three windfalls, the budget would be in deficit today. 
 "There was a huge amount of luck involved in creating this surplus," said June O'Neill, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, now an economics professor at Baruch College in Manhattan.
The bull market and the surge in tax revenue from the rich by themselves brought the budget out of deficit. If the market had risen more slowly in the 1990's, or income had been distributed more evenly across the work force, then the current surplus of $81 billion would instead be a deficit approaching $100 billion, according to government estimates. And if military spending had simply held steady at the 1990 level of $289.8 billion, instead of falling, then an additional $261 billion would have been subtracted over the decade from the surplus.
The nation, in sum, would have been struggling today with an annual budget deficit of more than $300 billion, about as high as the annual deficit has ever been for federal government operations other than Social Security.
The so-called unified budget surplus, including Social Security, which has its own revenue stream from payroll taxes, was $232 billion in the fiscal year that ended last month. This much larger unified budget surplus is often cited in the political debate. But without the windfalls of the 1990's, it, too, would show a deficit today, one of about $200 billion.
"We did not expect the favorable experiences that produced these surpluses," said Alan Auerbach, an economist and tax expert at the University of California. "Whether they will last is largely beyond anyone's control, including the politicians."
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are counting on the good luck to last. They propose to use up -- in tax cuts and new spending -- nearly all of the surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next 10 years. The projections of the budget office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, assume that the mix of fortuitous circumstances that swung the budget from deficit to surplus will continue over the next decade, at least on the revenue side. That would happen even if the economy slowed, the budget office estimates.
"We are assuming," said Dan Crippen, director of the budget office, "that the tax revenues generated by the economy at any level of economic growth are now permanently higher than they were a few years ago."
That assumption goes unchallenged by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush -- although the recent sell-off in the stock market, if it continues, could eventually undermine tax revenue. The candidates accept the surplus projections of the budget office, although Jason Furman, a senior economist in the Gore camp, says that to be on the safe side, Mr. Gore's proposals would fall $300 billion short of spending the entire $2.2 trillion in surpluses projected by the budget office through 2010.
Mr. Bush is taking the budget office projection on faith. "What else can a politician do but rely on the best estimates?" said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman.
The $2.2 trillion surplus does not include Social Security, which is expected to generate an additional surplus of $2.4 trillion by 2010. Mr. Gore would put this extra money aside to help pay retirement benefits when Social Security is projected to start running deficits in about three decades. Mr. Bush would put aside slightly more than half, but use about $1 trillion to finance individual retirement accounts.
The budget deficits began to shrink in 1993 after reaching a peak of $340.5 billion in 1992, excluding Social Security. The trend began gradually and became more rapid until a surplus of $700 million appeared in 1999. This rose to $81 billion in the fiscal year 2000, which ended on Sept. 30.
The swing was $421 billion, with much of it a result of normally rising tax revenue in a strong economy combined with caps on spending. But nearly $180 billion of that amount, or about 43 percent, according to the budget office, came from the unexpected surge in tax revenue thrown off by the soaring stock market and the rapidly rising incomes of people making more than $200,000 a year and particularly more than $1 million.
The bull market delivered more than $70 billion of the nearly $180 billion in extra tax revenue, not only from a surge in capital gains taxes on the sale of stocks, but also from taxes on stock options cashed in and market-related bonuses, as well as taxes on withdrawals from pension accounts fattened in the soaring market. Some of the rise in taxes on pension withdrawals was simply taxes deferred on contributions to retirement accounts like the 401(k). Most of these accounts have existed only since the mid-1970's and are just now being drawn down in significant amounts.
The surging economy and rising employment added another $40 billion in unexpected revenue from taxes on individual incomes, the budget office estimates. And labor productivity played a role. It surged over the last five years as workers increased their output for each hour on the job. This extra revenue from rising efficiency showed up as taxable individual income or as taxable company profits. Whether the unanticipated surge in productivity growth will last through the decade is still an open question among economists.
The surge in taxes paid by the wealthy has been the biggest single source of the surplus, accounting for roughly $72 billion of the $421 billion swing over eight years. That has pushed total income tax collections from all Americans to nearly $900 billion annually, or about 10 percent of the gross domestic product, up from 7 percent to 8.5 percent, for most of the years since the early 1960's.
The budget office's projections on the surplus assume that taxes on individual incomes will keep this revenue above 10 percent of the gross domestic product each year of this decade. That optimistic assumption is challenged by some economists.
"If we plunge into a recession, the surplus projections are going to be way off," said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group.
In explaining the projections, the budget office, in a July report, attributed the unanticipated rise in individual income tax revenue in part to the increase in capital gains taxes from "surges in stock prices and growth in stock market volume." Tax receipts from the wealthy, whose incomes rose far more rapidly in the 1990's than those of most other Americans, got equal billing.
"The average effective tax rate climbed because of a swift rise in income among people in the highest tax brackets," the report said. It concluded that the stock market and the tax revenue from the wealthy "explain many of the recent changes to both actual revenues and the projections of revenues over the next few years."
Congress set the stage a decade ago for the budget surpluses appearing today. Tax rates rose for the wealthiest Americans as a result of legislation in 1990, when Governor Bush's father was president, and in 1993, under President Clinton. A 1997 law undid some of the 1993 tax rate increases, but tax rates on wealthy Americans were still sharply higher when the economy suddenly roared ahead in 1996. The boom lifted nearly everyone's taxable income, but a far larger share of the gain -- in the form of stock options and bonuses as well as higher pay -- went to people with taxable incomes above $200,000.
So-called bracket creep, when rising incomes put people into higher tax brackets, accounted for a significant share of the surge in tax revenue. But equally significant was the flow of income to people already paying the highest rate: up to 39 percent vs. 28 percent a decade ago.
That was particularly the case for people reporting $1 million or more in taxable income. Their taxable income rose to $508 billion in 1998 from $171 billion in 1993, an increase of nearly 200 percent, according to Citizens for Tax Justice in Washington.
"Not since the 1920's has income been so concentrated at the top," Mr. Gale said.
But if tax revenue has grown faster than the economy itself and well above historical trends, in the view of the Congressional Budget Office, spending certainly has not. The spending restraint also fattened the surplus, but now seems in conflict with some of the stated plans of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.
Both have spoken, for example, of maintaining a strong military. But a budget office report this month estimates that an additional $50 billion a year will have to be spent on the military to maintain the armed forces at their present level. That includes the cost of overhauling or replacing aging equipment. The $50 billion is well beyond the annual increases in military spending used by the budget office to calculate the budget surpluses over the decade.
Federal spending on education has also declined since 1992 as a share of the gross domestic product, although both candidates call for a stepped up federal role in education. Generally, the mild spending increases for education, the military, research and other discretionary spending are a result of the spending caps imposed in the 1990's tax laws.
"If Congress and the next administration are not going to increase these spending caps," said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, "then any growth in the economy or surge in the stock market is naturally going to translate into more tax revenue and a surplus."

 BODY:

THE OTHER CONTEST
 
DODGERS, OLD AND NEW
So the full scope of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's command of specifics can now be told to a waiting nation.
On "Live with Regis" yesterday, the talk turned to baseball and Mr. Lieberman recalled that as a boy in Stamford, Conn., he was a Dodger fan. Then he proceeded to recite the entire starting lineup of the mid-1950's Brooklyn Dodgers: Hodges, Gilliam, Reese, Robinson, Furillo, Snider, Amoros, Campanella. He did not name the pitching rotation, but it was clear that he could have. 
 "When the Dodgers left Brooklyn," he lamented, "my heart was broken." But his was not a true Brooklynite heart, it turns out, for he switched allegiance years later to the Yankees. And a Yankee fan he remains, ready to root for them in the coming World Series.
What of Dick Cheney, Al Gore and George W. Bush? Mr. Cheney tells it straight: he's a longtime Yankee fan. But Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are taking a slide on this one. Mr. Gore told The Associated Press yesterday: "I love New York City. I'm dodging that question." And Mr. Bush said, "I'm for the New York team."
 Richard Perez-Pena (NYT)
 
THE REPUBLICANS
 
POLITICAL FUEL
Dick Cheney has said from the start that the Clinton administration's decision to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve was basically a political move to help Al Gore. But yesterday he added a twist to his partisan analysis: he said it was an ineptly handled political move.
"They were incompetent in the execution," he declared in a campaign stop in the Chicago area.
He noted that oil prices remain high. He predicted the nation's overall supply would not significantly increase because some of the companies that have access to the reserve oil would be tempted to stop importing higher-priced foreign oil. And he said that even if more and cheaper crude became available, there would probably still be a heating oil crunch this winter because oil refineries were already working at capacity.Michael Cooper (NYT)
 
THE ELECTORATE
 
VOTES FOR SALE
An Internet site offering to buy absentee ballot votes in the presidential race and sell them to the highest bidder has been ordered to suspend operations in Illinois.
The site, voteauction.com, was instructed by a Chicago judge on Wednesday to withdraw its offer pending further investigation by election officials concerned that operating such a scheme might be a felony offense. The site also has withdrawn its offer in two other states, California and New York, and Michigan officials are investigating.
The site, owned by Hans Bernhard of Vienna, who election officials say runs an international marketing company, boasts that it is "bringing capitalism and democracy closer together." It offers to buy the absentee ballots of undecided voters and then allow organizations and individuals to bid for a block of votes from a state. (Reuters)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
THE TWO E's
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, making another in a series of environmental speeches, said yesterday that Democrats were committed simultaneously to protecting the environment and promoting economic growth, but that Republicans believed it was impossible to do both. With new technology, Mr. Lieberman argued, it is possible to slow global warming and make the nation more energy efficient without hurting the economy. Speaking in New York to the national convention of the League of Conservation Voters, he said that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had managed over the past seven years to block many attempts to weaken environmental protections. But, he warned, "if George Bush is elected president, I fear that those same measures will be welcomed on a red carpet through the front door of the White House." Richard Perez-Pena (NYT)

HEADLINE: Taking Aim at Tax Havens, I.R.S. Seeks Credit Card Slips

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service, struggling against Caribbean havens it suspects of draining away at least $70 billion a year in personal income tax revenue, has set its sights on a new target -- the credit card slips of suspected tax evaders.
The agency has asked a federal judge in Miami to issue summonses for two years' worth of records of MasterCard and American Express card transactions in the United States that were billed to bank accounts in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. 
 Using the Internet and other outlets, banks in those nations openly solicit tax evasion in ways that the I.R.S. says have proved attractive to corporate executives, business owners, doctors and other wealthy people in the United States.
Americans can legally move their assets offshore but are required to notify the I.R.S. of those transactions and to pay taxes on their income worldwide. Some Caribbean countries offer an alluring tax haven, however, because they impose no income tax and do not generally cooperate with I.R.S. efforts to track down incomes.
But Americans who shelter income offshore face the problem of putting their money to use. That is where a credit card or charge card billed to an account at a Caribbean bank comes in handy, investigators say.
Banks in tax refuges issue MasterCards and Visa cards, which can be used anywhere to draw cash and to pay expenses. The bill is then paid automatically from the bank in the tax-haven country, leaving no record of income or spending except for the transaction reports from the networks that MasterCard, Visa and American Express operate.
Credit cards with $1 million monthly charge limits are being offered by some of these banks, according to documents filed by the I.R.S. in United States District Court in Miami. A federal judge there is expected within days to decide whether to issue the summonses requested by the I.R.S.
MasterCard International, which like Visa licenses banks to issue credit cards, said yesterday that it would try to cooperate with the government, but might not have the records the I.R.S. seeks. A spokeswoman, Sharon Gamsin, said MasterCard would also weigh the privacy interests of customers in deciding whether to fight a summons, if it is issued.
Ms. Gamsin said she did not know of any banks that had been dropped from the MasterCard system for helping tax evaders. The company's contract, she added, requires member banks "to comply with all local laws." It is not a crime in the Caribbean tax-haven countries to help an American citizen evade American tax law.
The charge-card unit of American Express declined to comment yesterday on how it would respond to the court action.
Visa, the other big credit card issuer, was mentioned in the court papers, but the I.R.S. is not seeking its records. Officials would say only that the scope of the investigation was widening.
John Buchanan, one of the I.R.S. managers supervising the campaign against tax evasion, said the request for credit card records was part of a widening inquiry into tax evasion using offshore banks. He said the agency was stepping up its efforts both to combat such evasion and to educate people that Congress taxes their worldwide income.
The $70 billion estimate of lost tax revenue was in an affidavit by Jack A. Blum, a Washington lawyer who has long experience investigating drug dealers, money laundering and tax evasion for the United States Senate and other clients. He said that figure was his low estimate. If the $70 billion proves to be correct, it means that close to a dime of each dollar individual Americans pay in federal income tax is used to make up for offshore tax cheating.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris and the United Nations have tried in recent years to ascertain the extent of worldwide tax evasion through offshore accounts. They say they can only guess that in total it runs in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
Joseph C. West, an I.R.S. special agent, said in an affidavit seeking the payment records that "credit, charge and debit cards are a common and purportedly a nontraceable method of accessing offshore funds in any location where the card is honored."
The request for records relies heavily on evidence supplied by John Mathewson, a Chicago executive who set up Guardian Bank in the Cayman Islands, which was used by more than 1,000 Americans to evade taxes. Mr. Mathewson, 72, a convicted money launderer who received probation in return for helping convict his bank's customers, told investigators that 95 percent of his customers used credit, charge and debit cards.
"Mr. Mathewson advised that he promoted the use of credit/debit cards so that his clients could covertly access funds stored in the Cayman Islands," Mr. West wrote in his affidavit.
That affidavit also described a mechanism used by the Royal Bank of Canada to routinely help wealthy Americans set up accounts overseas and arrange for them to get American Express cards.
A Royal Bank spokesman in Toronto, Joe Konecny, confirmed that the bank helps some big clients obtain American Express cards, but said he was unaware of any evidence that it was helping Americans evade taxes. The bank is an investor-owned corporation, not a Canadian government agency.
A variety of Web sites feature the logos of MasterCard, Visa and American Express and describe ways to get around United States tax laws.
The Web site of the Travelers Holding Company in the Bahamas, for example, notes that Americans must report assets being moved offshore, but adds that "there are several ways to establish an offshore account" without having to inform the I.R.S.
The site of Corporate Trust Services (Caribbean) Ltd. in Antigua says under the heading "tax avoidance" that "although there is in the United States the legal requirement to report holdings in offshore companies to the local tax authorities, no matter how restrictive these rules may be a greater tax savings may be achieved by the use of an offshore company."
All three credit and charge card companies said they were unaware that their logos were being used in advertisements soliciting tax evasion.
Mr. West said that the charge slips sought by the I.R.S. would advance a number of investigations, including one into 77 stock brokerage accounts established in tax-haven countries, 66 of which use charge cards for access to funds in the accounts.
He said the I.R.S. was also investigating a Medicare billing technique involving the use of an offshore bank to evade taxes on the sale of medical devices to the government at huge markups.

HEADLINE: Dual Purpose of a U.S.-Jordan Trade Pact

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The United States plans to sign a wide-ranging free trade agreement with Jordan next week, bolstering a partner in the troubled Middle East peace effort while helping Vice President Al Gore show that he could reinvent the way trade deals are done.
President Clinton and King Abdullah of Jordan will sign the agreement at a White House ceremony on Tuesday, both sides confirmed. Under the pact, each side would eliminate all tariffs and barriers to trade, which would make Jordan only the fourth nation to allow two-way trade in goods and services with the United States. The other three are Canada, Mexico and Israel. 
 Annual trade between Jordan and the United States, which totaled just over $300 million last year, is comparatively minuscule. The United States and Mexico trade more with each other on an average day.
But Jordanian and American officials say the agreement is groundbreaking. It could attract multi national investment to economically ailing Jordan, encouraging economic growth and creating jobs.
The Clinton administration is also hailing it as a new model for trade agreements -- one with the potential to attract union support, because it mandates compliance with international labor and environmental norms.
About half of Jordan's population of 4.5 million consists of Palestinians, most of them impoverished. In addition, Jordan borders the West Bank, where, American officials believe, high unemployment and low economic expectations contribute to unrest.
"This is going to be a source of domestic economic growth for Jordan that will make them an even stronger partner in the Middle East," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. "Their economy needs a jump-start, and this is a critical component."
King Hussein, the late Jordanian leader, who signed a peace accord with Israel in the early 1990's and helped broker the current peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, pressed for an open trade agreement with the United States, said Marwan Muasher, Jordan's ambassador the United States.
King Abdullah, his son, has worked to modernize the economy and pass a series of economic laws, especially on intellectual property protection, that allowed Jordan to join the World Trade Organization last year.
"Politically this agreement sends a strong message that the United States and Jordan are close partners," the ambassador said.
The agreement may also resonate on the presidential campaign trail. It is the first such accord to include a section detailing each side's responsibility to enforce environmental and labor laws. The provisions commit Jordan to ensure that multinational companies investing there allow their workers to bargain collectively. Jordan also promises not to ease any environmental pollution laws as a way of attracting investment.
Vice President Gore and George W. Bush, the Texas governor, have sparred over how to conduct trade talks. Mr. Gore, seeking to solidify support from labor unions, has repeatedly promised that he will not negotiate any new trade agreements unless they include language preventing labor or environmental abuses.
As he campaigns for the White House, Mr. Gore is expected to cite the Jordan agreement as the kind of trade accord he supports.
Mr. Bush has said that the push to harmonize labor and environmental rules is fundamentally protectionist, geared to thwart trade rather than enhance it.
The new standards, which take up about two pages of the 30-page free trade agreement, require Jordanian adherence to core labor standards specified by the International Labor Organization.
Having inserted the standards in the agreement, the Clinton administration has a shot at achieving something that has eluded it for almost eight years: union support for a trade accord.
Unions were vigorous opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the administration's first and largest such pact. This year they fought hard, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to derail permanent normal trade relations with China.
But the A.F.L.-C.I.O. umbrella union was involved in negotiating the trade agreement with Jordan, specifying what it considered acceptable core labor standards and enforcement provisions. Union officials said that although they had not seen the text of the agreement, there was the prospect of an outright endorsement.
"If it all plays out, there is certainly a lot of potential here," said Thea Lee, a trade policy official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We think this could be an important and constructive new road."
Labor unions have often said that they would support expanded trade if agreements were not used as a way for companies to skirt labor and environmental laws at American workers' expense. No trade agreement has yet passed their test.

HEADLINE: Once Close to Clinton, Gore Keeps a Distance

SERIES: AL GORE'S JOURNEY: Uneasy Alliance

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER and DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
After eight years together, here is the state of the relationship between President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore: Mr. Gore won't pick up the phone. He doesn't call, and Mr. Clinton doesn't know why.
Until the recent crisis in the Middle East, the two had spoken only a handful of times since the week of this summer's Democratic convention. 
 Mr. Clinton is both hurt by the personal rebuff and bewildered as to why his political heir won't come to him for the advice he is itching to give -- advice the president feels the candidate needs, according to two friends who have discussed this with Mr. Clinton recently.
After Mr. Gore's second debate with Gov. George W. Bush, the president was irate. He told one friend that the vice president was getting bad advice from consultants, especially Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, who seemed to Mr. Clinton to have coached all the fight out of him. But when the friend said, "Why don't you just call him?" the president said he didn't feel he should meddle.
The buddy movie that began when these two young Southern centrists started off on a high-energy bus tour across America in the 1992 campaign wasn't supposed to end like this. At the time, story after story about "Bill and Al's Excellent Adventure" highlighted their complementary strengths and campaign trail "double dates" with blond wives who seemed to be hitting it off famously, too.
At least, that was how it looked as the two women hugged each other while jumping up and down in time with the campaign theme song, Fleetwood Mac's "Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)." There were striking images of the running mates tossing a football around and huddled alone in the back of their bus at 2 in the morning, beat but apparently unable to stop yakking.
Former Clinton aides have said that one big reason Mr. Clinton chose Mr. Gore as his running mate was that he had a lot in common with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Paul Begala, a former aide, recalled that Mr. Clinton said when he picked Mr. Gore, " 'He reminds me of Hillary in that when he gets hold of something he never lets loose.' He saw a constancy that he's been accused of lacking."
But now, Mr. Clinton is left to wonder why Mr. Gore can't be more like his wife, who appeared with the vice president at a campaign event in New York yesterday. As a candidate, she does listen to his advice -- and not coincidentally, in the view of several Clinton aides, seems to be doing better in her race than the vice president is in his.
It took last week's outbreak of violence in the Middle East to bring Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton together. The vice president left the campaign trail to attend White House briefings on the crisis. It was the first time Mr. Gore had set foot in the White House since a state dinner on May 22, and he seems to be going out of his way to avoid appearing with the president. His office was even reluctant to release a photo taken last week of the two of them together -- and initially instructed the White House not to put it out, either.
One Democratic fund-raiser who knows both men said, "It's worse than you think, worse than it was last year." Even then, things weren't so hot. On the day Mr. Gore formally declared his candidacy in June 1999, ABC News broadcast an interview with the vice president in which Mr. Gore repeatedly distanced himself from the president, voicing disappointment over Mr. Clinton's behavior with Monica S. Lewinsky, the White House intern with whom he had an affair.
Mr. Clinton feels frustrated, eager to help but unwilling to insert himself where he's not wanted, say the friends who have discussed this with him. It's beyond him why Mr. Gore can't manage to relate to an audience in the way that comes so effortlessly to him. And he's convinced that Mr. Gore moved too slowly to capitalize on his successful convention performance -- in the president's view, running away from him when he ought to be running on their record.
Yesterday, at a meeting of the House Democratic caucus, Mr. Clinton responded to Mr. Bush's remarks in the last debate point for point and seemed to wish he had been there to make the arguments himself.
"I almost gagged when I heard that answer on the patients' bill of rights in Texas," Mr. Clinton said at one point -- Mr. Bush's answer, of course.
Yet there is no plan for Mr. Clinton to campaign with Mr. Gore, although he will be stumping for him and other Democrats, said Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane. "This is something Gore is going to do on his own," Mr. Lehane said.
And that is what has Mr. Clinton worried. He is concerned that a loss would reflect poorly on him, and aware, too, that he is responsible for some of Mr. Gore's problems. Yet the president also believes that he has left Mr. Gore a rich legacy, in both policy and political terms, and that Mr. Gore seems to be squandering it.
Gore aides, however, see the distance as a must. "He said at the convention, 'I am my own man, vote for me.' That's real," said Mark Fabiani, the deputy campaign manager. "It's not some kind of facade where behind it he's seeking Clinton's counsel every day."
The president does speak regularly with Mr. Gore's staff, as does the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, and his deputy Steve Ricchetti. Through them, the president stays well briefed on campaign developments. And sometimes, he cannot resist offering a suggestion.
Mr. Clinton called Mr. Eskew, Mr. Gore's top strategist, a couple of weeks ago to tell him he ought to make the vice president watch a skit about the first debate on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," in which Mr. Gore was depicted as overbearing and orange.
"He called me and said, 'You've got to show it to him,' " Mr. Eskew said. When they did, though, Mr. Gore, who does some pretty scathing imitations himself, turned into a critic, too. Sizing up Darrell Hammond, the actor who played him in the skit, Mr. Eskew said, "he said, 'He's got me in some ways, but I could help him in some places.' "
A couple of times a week, the president speaks with William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman who was Mr. Clinton's former commerce secretary. Mr. Daley said that Mr. Clinton's questions about campaign strategy usually concerned "big picture" matters like television ads.
"He will say, 'Are you up on the air in this place? How do you see West Virginia?' or some other state," said Mr. Daley.
Still, he said, if Mr. Clinton was unhappy with the vice president, he hadn't heard about it. "I haven't sensed it at all. He understands he's out there doing this stuff 20 hours a day; he's done it himself."
Several of Mr. Gore's friends, however, not only acknowledged the chill but said the vice president's relationship with Mr. Clinton never fully recovered from the scandal, because he felt betrayed by the lies, compromised by the recklessness and upset by the behavior, particularly as the father of young women near Ms. Lewinsky's age.

An Overstated Friendship
The idea that the two men were ever personal friends seems to have been mostly hype to begin with.
Mr. Gore is introverted by nature, highly rational in his decision-making, someone who spends virtually all his free time with his family. He is a man who has been heavily influenced by the women in his life -- his mother, his wife, his daughters -- but also by a rich, difficult and defining relationship with his father, the senator.
What bonding there was between him and Mr. Clinton -- an extroverted, instinctive, guy's guy who never knew his own father -- almost certainly centered on public policy. Mr. Gore definitely does not share the president's passion for politics. And -- this is not unimportant -- he does not even play golf.
"I don't think this was a real friendship; these are two very different character types," said Mr. Gore's close friend Martin Peretz, one of his Harvard mentors, who now owns The New Republic.
Among the slights perceived by the president is that not only are few Clintonites on the Gore campaign, but that the team is chock-a-block with people who have gone out of their way to criticize Mr. Clinton, starting with Joe Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate.
Some of Mr. Gore's closest friends speak of the president with extravagant, open disdain, especially Mr. Peretz, who is already on record as having referred to Mr. Clinton as "loathesome."
Mr. Peretz said about Mr. Gore that "Even though he had a hard relationship with his father, he also had unconditional love, while Clinton didn't have this with his father," who died before he was born. "My guess is Clinton resents Al, and that's why I think he's stuck it to him on occasion."
One such occasion came in July, when The New York Times reported that the president had been telling friends he thought either Senator Bob Graham or Senator George J. Mitchell, both of whom he had considered in 1992, would be fine choices as Mr. Gore's running mate.
"The vice president didn't really appreciate that," Mr. Peretz said. "I don't remember his exact words, but 'That sure was helpful' was the content."
Some Clinton aides suggest that the relevant resentment cuts the other way, that it is Mr. Gore who envies Mr. Clinton's political skills and is too proud to admit he needs help from the acknowledged master.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton have each made public comments that showed some ambivalence about the other. Mr. Clinton once told The Times that Mr. Gore's campaign had gotten off to a sluggish start and that he had been advising him to loosen up.
Not long ago, the vice president volunteered in an interview that one factor that helped him decide to run was "seeing the job up close" and not being daunted in the least. "This guy's done a great job, by and large, and has strengths I don't. But then, I have some strengths he doesn't."
A Diffidence Shared
 Another open sore is the antipathy between the two men's families.
Even Mr. Gore's mother, Pauline, once made condescending remarks about Mr. Clinton to a reporter for The New Yorker. Though she herself was born poor in rural Tennessee and struggled to put herself through school, she seemed to sneer at the president's humble upbringing: "Bill came up in a very provincial atmosphere. And even though he went to Yale, and he went to Oxford, you don't undo or move out of that provincial atmosphere that has influenced you in your early life."
Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton were never particularly close, but after "Tipper's people put out that she and the girls were appalled" by the Lewinsky matter, Mrs. Clinton never forgot it, a friend of the first lady said.
The Gore and Clinton children had never been any more than polite, either, several family friends said. Though Sarah Gore and Chelsea Clinton are the same age -- college seniors now -- they never made much of a connection.
Even Mrs. Gore's normally tight-lipped spokeswoman, Camille Johnston, spoke disparagingly of Mrs. Clinton in a recent interview, comparing the two women while making a point about how little Mrs. Gore cares about her public image.
"With Mrs. Clinton, there was always such a concerted effort with image," Ms. Johnston said. "She went from housewife to cookie lady to whatever. Mrs. Gore hasn't done that, so it's easier. She hasn't had to turn into somebody else."
And the Gores' oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, answered frankly when asked if the first lady and her mother are friends: "They've definitely had a personal relationship," she said, using the past tense. "Obviously, the last eight years seems like a lifetime. But they call each other on important occasions."
At the Democratic convention, Ms. Schiff, who is one of her father's top advisers, gave an enthusiastic nomination speech in prime time. But another interesting shot of her came earlier that week, when the camera found her while Mr. Clinton was delivering his speech. As she watched, a frown flitted across her face, then disappeared into an expression so perfectly, willfully blank that it expressed plenty. When clapping seemed absolutely required, she put her hands together every few seconds in a way that could not have produced any sound.

Two Rivals Who Meshed
 A lifetime ago, as Ms. Schiff says, way back in 1992, Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore didn't know one another terribly well.
Though they came from the same part of the country, the two men had only met once, at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel in 1987, when Mr. Gore was running for president and went to Mr. Clinton to ask for his endorsement.
Their identical aspirations made them natural competitors -- and Mr. Gore seemed to have jumped ahead -- said Mr. Gore's cousin, Ark Monroe, who escorted him to the meeting.
But Mr. Gore told the governor that they should consider one another natural allies, two southern moderates who could help hold their party together. If he was elected, Mr. Gore said, it wouldn't hurt Mr. Clinton's chances but would bolster them. He'd be paving the way, see?
The meeting went fine, said Mr. Monroe, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton. "I always kind of thought they'd be rivals, but they seemed to get along." Mr. Gore did not get the endorsement, though.
And the next time the two met, it was Mr. Clinton who was paving the way. Mr. Gore had just written his environmental book, "Earth in the Balance," which had greatly impressed the governor. On the June night in 1992 that Mr. Clinton interviewed Senator Gore about joining him on the Democratic ticket, they talked for three hours and got pretty wonky, according to a former Gore aide. Before long, they were comparing favorite economists, and were soon telling friends that this partnership was not only going to work, but was going to be great.
"They saw the campaign and the issues the same way; they have scarcely any differences on policy, and that's of enormous importance to the two of them," said Reed Hundt, who attended St. Albans with Mr. Gore and Yale Law School with Mr. Clinton, who later named him chairman of the Federal Communications Commission at Mr. Gore's urging.
By all accounts, both men genuinely enjoyed their time together on the trail. "Clinton's enthusiasm was real," said a man who has worked for both the president and the vice president. "He thought, 'Here's a guy my age, a team player who'll follow the script and not upstage me.'
"Clinton was digging it, and there was no jealousy and no backbiting. But there were people sticking the knife in Gore -- the Gephardt crowd and the Hillary crowd."
George Stephanopoulos, a close Clinton aide, was a leading skeptic, since he had worked for both Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis, neither of whom had appreciated the rough treatment they got from Mr. Gore during the 1988 primary campaign.
But, former White House aides recall, it was Mrs. Clinton who drove the first wedge between the two. Even before the election, her loyalists began jockeying to protect her position as first adviser -- and even tried to kick Mr. Gore off the bus, though he refused to budge.
Susan Thomases, a longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton, who had words with Mr. Gore not long after he was named to the ticket, denied there was ever any rivalry. "No one tried to kick him off" the bus, she said. "He was just initially reticent about it, that being his personality, and then he stayed on and on and on. I don't know why so much was made of that."
But someone who has known both the Clintons well since the 1970's and has worked with Mr. Gore -- and has been disillusioned by all three of them -- said that Mrs. Clinton had worked hard to curb Mr. Gore's power from the start. "Early on, Gore thought he would have much more influence," this person said. "But she put a stop to that."
These efforts only intensified after Mr. Gore's October debate with Dan Quayle; Mrs. Clinton, among others, thought he seemed a little slow to defend her husband on the character issue.

Assembling a Portfolio
 Despite the conflicts, Mr. Gore at least arguably still had more responsibility than any previous vice president. And not without some reason.
In a recent interview, Mr. Gore said he agreed to join the ticket in part because he felt he could make not just a difference but perhaps the difference in the race.
Pollsters did find that Mr. Gore's presence on the ticket made people feel better about voting for Mr. Clinton. His conservative persona and placid, no-surprises-here personal life seemed to offset concerns about Mr. Clinton's character, and his experience, particularly on foreign policy, eased worries that Governor Clinton was a little weak in this area. Stan Greenberg, then Mr. Clinton's and now Mr. Gore's pollster, recommended constant references to the Clinton-Gore ticket and commercials that showed both men.
After they won in November, but before the inaugural, representatives for the two worked out an extraordinary agreement, a prenuptial agreement of sorts. The deal hammered out by Roy Neel, who negotiated on Mr. Gore's behalf, and Thomas F. McLarty III, who stood in for Mr. Clinton, codified their partnership, and spelled out a degree of shared responsibility that was such a departure from the norm that it essentially amounted to a reinvention of the vice presidency.
The president agreed to hand over real power -- enormous policy and personnel responsibilities -- as well as to include Mr. Gore and his staff in all important meetings. Mr. Clinton also promised to lunch with him privately, every week, no matter what.
Once they took office, technology and the environment became part of Mr. Gore's portfolio, along with the "re-inventing government" streamlining project and a heavy foreign policy role. And Mr. Gore was able to position loyalists throughout the executive branch.
Yet the turf battles between Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton intensified in the West Wing, where their surrogates fought over everything from media attention to office space.
The two of them were not just Mr. Clinton's top advisers but, often, the only ones whose opinion seemed to count. "You always knew whether it was an important meeting when you saw whether Hillary and the vice president were there or not," said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. "They were the president's two top advisers and everybody else played second fiddle. If they were there, it was an important meeting. If they weren't, it wasn't."
A former administration official said that the only time he saw Mr. Gore lose out on a policy issue was in 1993, when he opposed health care reform and obliquely took on Mrs. Clinton.
"The president was moving ahead but a lot of us thought there hadn't been proper economic or political vetting," the official said, and Mr. Gore urged him to go to the president and make their case. "It was the only time he felt he couldn't go himself," said the former official, who is no longer in contact with either man, "and that's because it involved her."
Mrs. Clinton was widely considered the stronger of Mr. Clinton's two strong seconds until the debacle that followed, and the Republican "revolution" of 1994, when Democrats lost control of the Congress.
At that point, the Clintons brought back Dick Morris, a former adviser, to help reposition the White House, move it back to the political center. Mr. Gore, who allied himself with Mr. Morris, wound up playing a major role in their rehabilitation efforts.
"Al's hand was strengthened," said a former consultant who attended these meetings, because those in the liberal wing of Mr. Clinton's White House had been repudiated on health care and in the midterm elections.
Mr. Clinton relied heavily on him, especially at this time, presidential aides said. Mr. Gore stiffened Mr. Clinton's resolve against Republican efforts to dismantle environmental regulations, zealously raised campaign funds, as the world now knows, and even made it his business to make sure the cabinet secretaries stayed on message. "He was relentless," said the former consultant, who has no ties to or affinity for Mr. Gore.
In 1996, the vice president's support of the welfare-reform bill was considered decisive. "Gore was clearly telling the president to sign the Republican bill, even though it was punitive," said Mr. Reich, who strongly opposed the bill. "There were very, very few voices inside the administration telling Clinton to sign the bill, and Gore was the adviser in chief, the most important voice in favor of signing."
One key to their relationship was that Mr. Gore was not afraid to disagree with the president. He was also often the only person in the room who could cajole Mr. Clinton out of a mood, White House aides said. In mock news conferences where staff members threw out questions to prepare him for the real thing, Mr. Clinton would sometimes get agitated by a hardball question. He'd vent for a few minutes, then Mr. Gore, on cue, would say something like, "That's right, Mr. President, answer it just like that. That would be perfect" -- and they'd laugh and the storm clouds would pass.
They had their running jokes, too -- one mutual fascination, circa 1993-94, was the Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt case -- but theirs was primarily a business relationship.
And much of their business was conducted privately. Their weekly lunch took on even greater significance after 1994, when it became clear, as one former official put it, that they had to watch what they said in staff meetings carefully because "every slob in the room was taking notes for their book."
These lunches were definitely not social occasions. "Clinton would just go in and sit down and Gore would come with a foot-and-a-half stack of books," said this official. Mr. Gore has said the lunches almost always touched on environmental policy.
Several former Clinton aides with no ties to Mr. Gore said that his influence on the president has often been understated. He brought Mr. Clinton around on the importance of environmental issues, they said. During the budget negotiations with Republicans that led to the government shutdown., he successfully argued that the environment should be one of the areas on which the administration would not compromise.

Feeling a Breach of Trust
 But then, of course, revelations of the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, which began during the shutdown, essentially ended whatever friendship had existed with his vice president.
When the scandal hit, one friend of the vice president said, Mr. Gore at first believed the president, and even defended him to Tipper and his daughters, who did not. When the truth became known, Mr. Gore felt betrayed; the president had lied to his face in the Cabinet meeting in January 1998 when the the president said there was nothing to the story. But then, a Clinton friend said that the president also felt betrayed by Mr. Gore -- abandoned when he needed him most.
Publicly, of course, Mr. Gore stood outside the White House after Mr. Clinton was impeached and said his boss would be remembered as one of the nation's greatest presidents. Standing right behind the vice president as he spoke, Hillary Clinton nodded her head vigorously at every word Mr. Gore said.
The vice president was inclined to stick by Mr. Clinton not only because of his role, friends said, but because he, like the first lady, felt that Mr. Clinton had in part suffered at the hands of Republican bloodhounds -- some of the same people, in fact, who had worked so hard to defeat his father, Senator Albert Gore, in a legendarily dirty race in 1970.
But privately, said a friend of Tipper Gore, the vice president was sickened. "He has daughters," this friend said. "That was a moment Gore lost a great deal of respect for him."
Their work lives went on, of course. "It wasn't exactly the same, because nothing was exactly the same, but it wasn't too noticeable," said one former administration official.
Until last year, that is, when both Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton began revving up their respective campaigns, and their history began to repeat itself.
"There was a lot of competition, a lot of pent-up political ambition in the room when she's running for Senate, he's running for president and Clinton still thinks he's president," said the former official. "Who gets to go to what event?"
But it was a relief in some ways, too, this same official said. Finally, there could be physical as well as emotional separation from the president: "Gore had the cover to go out on the campaign."
And to the vice president, the campaign trail had never looked so appealing.

2 Die in West Bank Clash, Straining New Cease-Fire
An army-escorted hike by three dozen Jewish settlers in the West Bank touched off a protracted firefight that weakened expectations that the two-day-old cease-fire agreement would take hold. The seven-hour clash left two dead, one Israeli and one Palestinian. They were the first deaths since Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed in Egypt this week to halt the violence. A12

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Intensifies Attack on Bush Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said yesterday that Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut proposal would drain Social Security, jack up interest rates and undermine economic growth by giving "too much to too few at the expense of too many."
On a whirlwind day in New York, where the vice president courted national television personalities, campaigned with Hillary Rodham Clinton and appeared on a dinner dais with Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore delivered a blistering condemnation of Mr. Bush's economic proposals. 
 "The economic policies my opponent has put forward in this election are not just unfair, they're unsound, and they would hurt our economy," Mr. Gore declared at a noon speech in the soaring rotunda of Columbia University's Low Library.
"Governor Bush's plan gambles with our prosperity by bringing back deficits, draining Social Security, delaying debt reduction and fueling higher interest rates," he said, adding that the governor's tax cut proposal would "lavish more on those who need it least."
In his speeches to date, Mr. Gore has generally portrayed himself as the more responsible steward of the nation's economy, and he did so again yesterday. But in increasing signs that the economy will be the central issue in the election, both candidates have been escalating their predictions of how the other would ruin the prosperity, and Mr. Gore took his oratory to new heights.
"My opponent's plan really does pose a threat," the vice president said. "These are not personal differences. I'm not questioning Governor Bush's heart, I'm questioning his priorities."
And in a refrain that is emerging as the core of his message, he declared, "Prosperity itself is on the ballot."
These dire warnings came on an otherwise breezy day spent mostly on glossy television sets, where the vice president taped three national television programs -- with Regis Philbin, Rosie O'Donnell and a pre-election skit for "Saturday Night Live." In the latter, he sat stiffly in a formal chair in a White House-like setting and punctuated his scripted remarks with several deep sighs.
Perhaps most remarkably, he plowed through a day in the media capital of the world in advance of a World Series with two New York teams and managed to avoid saying which team he favored.
Flying into New York late Wednesday night, reporters asked Mr. Gore if he was rooting for the Yankees or the Mets.
"Uh-huh," he replied.
By today, he had worked out a more elaborate answer. "I'm for New York City!" he said.
He might have had a hard time convincing some people of that fact as his motorcade tied up traffic across town. Streets were blocked and pedestrians barricaded throughout the day, and some made unwelcoming gestures at his caravan.
But all was cheerful on the television sets. Ms. O'Donnell, an unabashed Gore promoter, captured the tone by announcing, "This is going to be a very pro-Gore day."
Early this evening, Mr. Gore attended a raucous rally with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his running mate, and Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the Senate in New York. Thousands of people jammed a midtown hotel for the rally, sponsored by the Service Employees International Union. Mrs. Clinton appealed to the crowd to get out the vote for the "Gore/Lieberman/Clinton ticket."
The message of the day was twofold: To convey his sense of fiscal discipline, in the speech at Columbia, and to show his human side on popular daytime television programs intended chiefly for women.
At Columbia, Mr. Gore was introduced by Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary. Mr. Rubin told the audience of a few hundred people that Mr. Gore was "at the center" of the difficult economic choices made by the Clinton administration. He said Mr. Bush's proposals would take the nation on the "wrong path."
In his speech, Mr. Gore pledged to "underspend" the surplus, balance the budget and eliminate the national debt. He also insisted that he would not, as Mr. Bush has charged, expand the size of government.
"You'd better believe that the era of big government is over," he said. He pledged that in a Gore administration, he would take government spending to "the smallest share of national income in 50 years."
On ABC's "Live With Regis," Mr. Gore demonstrated how as a teenager he hypnotized chickens, using Mr. Philbin as the stooge. The vice president, standing behind Mr. Philbin, circled his finger around the talk-show host's head, declared him under and intoned this message: "Regis, between now and Nov. 7, you will say good things about the Gore/ Lieberman ticket."
Ms. O'Donnell asked about Mr. Clinton, giving Mr. Gore a chance to debunk any negative association with Mr. Clinton's sex scandal that might linger among her primarily female audience.
"Why has it tarnished you when it has nothing to do with you?" she asked.
"I hope it hasn't, because I am who I am," Mr. Gore said. "I condemned his personal mistake. I do so again. He's my friend. We've worked together, we've been able to do some good things for the American people. I'm not trying to make this race about the past. It really is about the future."
He went on to note that he has been married 30 years.
After appearing on the "Rosie" set, he stepped across the hallway at the NBC studios at Rockefeller Center to tape a segment for a "Saturday Night Live" election special to be shown on Nov. 5.
As the cameras rolled, he began reading a script off the teleprompter, but stopped himself. "I thought we edited that," he said, calling for his speechwriter.
Mr. Bush is also to appear in the skit as himself. The script has Mr. Bush saying that he is offended by some of the material on the show, and Mr. Gore then says: "I was one the very first to be offended by material on 'Saturday Night Live' and I'm glad to see the governor has joined with me in condemning it."
He then sighs deeply.
 
In His Own Words
AL GORE
Speaking yesterday at Columbia University:
"Governor Bush has very different priorities. Instead of underspending the surplus, he overspends it. He starts with a $1.6 trillion tax cut that gives too much to too few at the expense of too many. Then he adds about a half a trillion dollars in new spending. Then he privatizes Social Security, which would cost another trillion dollars.
 The choice couldn't be clearer. Under my plan, zero deficits and a zero national debt within 12 years. Or a Bush plan that would leave us with a $1.1 trillion deficit in our non-Social Security accounts over the next 10 years, would raise interest rates and could undermine economic growth. . . . Sound fiscal policy sends a signal of reassurance to our markets, and my budget surplus reserve fund is a hedge against the possibility that even today's best projections of economic growth might turn out to be overly optimistic. . . .
Let's cut to the heart of the matter. Both sides in this election have proposed targeted tax cuts. The difference is, my plan targets the middle class; the Bush plan targets the wealthy. In fact, the other night in our debate, Governor Bush was asked directly by the moderator whether what I was saying about his plan was correct and whether his plan 'benefits the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans.' His answer? 'Of course it does.' . . .
And just yesterday, we learned that there's some confusion in the Bush campaign about how soon Social Security will be in deficit under their plan. . . . In this week's debate, I asked the governor to address this confusion. But when he tried to explain his proposal, his own chief economist said, 'I don't know why he said what he said.' . . .
If his chief economist has no idea what he's talking about, how are the rest of us supposed to figure it out?"

HEADLINE: Arab League Meeting May Seek Balancing Act

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 19

 BODY:
As their foreign ministers gathered here today in advance of a weekend summit meeting, Arab leaders sought to formulate a unified position that could appease popular demands to punish Israel but also keep the door open to future Arab-Israeli peacemaking.
The Arab League meeting, which opens on Saturday, is expected to affirm Arab support for the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, with the richer oil-producing nations putting aside their active distaste for Mr. Arafat and pledging an infusion of money for his administration. 
 But the presidents, princes and kings who lead the 22 member nations of the Arab League are also under exceptional public pressure to produce more at their meeting than their customary words of support for Palestinian self-determination and statehood.
Heavy Palestinian casualties during clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip this month have inflamed public passions against both Israel and the United States, which is accused of abandoning all pretense of even-handedness in the now-paralyzed peace effort.
The tide of anger -- more open and more defiant than any display of grass-roots political activity in at least a decade -- has left many of the Arab leaders in a state of near panic that the demonstrations could turn into more generalized protest against their own governments.
One clear outcome of the summit meeting will be an embracing of Mr. Arafat, who could direct the outcome through the demands he makes of his fellow Arab leaders on behalf of Palestinians. Faced with his own widespread public impatience with seven years of peace talks, which have produced paltry results in the view of many Palestinians, he will be looking for regional backing for his next moves.
"Arafat going to the summit is like Barak going to Clinton," said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and aide to Anwar el-Sadat, the assassinated president. "When they are cornered, they go to a bigger authority, either to redistribute blame for a failure or to get support and extra money. It means the problem is bigger than they are."
More extreme elements in the Arab world have already issued calls for a reactivation of an Arab boycott, a freeze on the already sparse Arab diplomatic and economic exchanges with Israel, the use of oil and oil-related contracts as a weapon against Israel's Western allies, and the wholesale transfer of arms to Palestinians to attack Israelis.
Yet there are also signs of deep ambivalence toward steps that would erase the tenuous Arab-Israeli thaw of the last decade and push relations back to the days of total nonrecognition.
In a television interview on Wednesday, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, urged that nations surrounding Israel open their borders to the flow of weapons and Arab fighters to join in a Palestinian uprising.
But when pressed on details, Mr. Saleh toned down his demand. "Yemen wants to help Palestinians defend themselves, not to start a war," he said.
Similarly, Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, was quoted by Syrian state radio today as calling for an end to all forms of Arab normalization with Israel. Syria, however, has already declared peace, on its own terms, as its national goal.
In the ministers' meeting here, Mr. Shara softened the impact of his words, which would in any case affect only a few Arab nations. "It is natural, that here we are to speak about peace and not about something else," he said.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt also said the summit meeting was not intended to give up on negotiating a final peace between Arab nations and Israel. In an interview on state television, he responded forcefully when asked if the Arab League would carry out harsh measures against Israel.
"What hard measures?" he said. "The logic of war is outdated. Matters can only be solved by negotiation and international pressure."
But less moderate leaders could still push the summit meeting to a more extreme response, especially if the situation in the Palestinian territories deteriorates in the days leading up to the meeting.
One unpredictable factor will be Iraq, which will be represented at a meeting of Arab leaders for the first time in 10 years. Since its invasion of fellow Arab League member Kuwait in 1990, Iraq has not been invited to the group's top-level meetings. It officially condemned Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and has urged Arab nations to back a full-scale Palestinian war against Israel.
But another maverick state, Libya, may not show up at all. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has already called a draft statement presented to Arab League members to be so feeble that he may not bother to come to Cairo.
"They will make fools of themselves in front of the people because they are so weak," he said of his fellow Arab leaders. "It's as if they are standing naked without a fig leaf. We declare. We condemn. We call for. It's the same old communique."
If the other Arab leaders on their way to Cairo now find themselves caught in a political vise between public anger and temperate diplomacy, it is partly one of their own making.
Many governments have been playing with fire lately, stoking popular rage against Israel by constantly broadcasting scenes of past Arab-Israeli wars and war songs. State-owned newspapers have excoriated Jews and Judaism, as well as the United States.
Anti-American and anti-Israeli protests throughout the region have recently been reinforced by open calls for boycotts of American products and denunciation of European and American companies as Israeli fronts.
The drumbeat of hatred and suspicion has gotten so loud in Egypt that the British grocery chain Sainsbury's has posted signs in its windows proclaiming that it will do nothing to help Israel "financially or politically."
Arab leaders, without exception, also lionized the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon, lauding them as a liberation movement that, through force of arms, drove Israel to abandon its occupation of southern Lebanon in May.
Turning off public anger toward Israel, and calling for negotiations over war, may now prove difficult for moderate Arab leaders.
"Nobody will have the courage to stand against the lowest common denominator of public opinion," said a former American diplomat to the Middle East. The summit meeting, he added, will provide a road map to future relations between the Arab nations and the United States.
"It will reveal if Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia can be a moderating force," he said. "In the past they were willing to take the risk of protecting the United States from the more obnoxious elements in Arab politics and to be associated with the United States."

EMPLOYMENT RISES

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York City continued to drop last month, and has declined sharply over the last year, according to figures released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. After adjustment for seasonal factors, the jobless rate in the city fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.8 percent in August and 6.7 percent a year ago. The rest of the state did not fare as well in September; the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 3.9 percent, which was also the national rate. A year ago, both upstate New York and the nation had jobless rates of 4.2 percent. The end of the communication workers' strike against Verizon caused an unusually big increase in the number of people working in September. But job growth has been strong over the last year, rising by 2.1 percent in the state and 2.5 percent in New York City. Rockland County experienced the fastest pace of job growth in the state, at 2.9 percent; in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, the number of jobs edged up only 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE;
After Attacks, Bush Strikes Back Hard in Defense of His Social Security Proposal

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
With the Democrats running new commercials attacking his Social Security plan, Gov. George W. Bush struck back hard yesterday, contending that Vice President Al Gore was pitting "grandparents against grandchildren" for political gain.
Campaigning at a tool factory outside Detroit, Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore "leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but the only thing he has to offer is fear itself." In a speech laced with some of his strongest broadsides in the campaign so far, he went on to accuse the vice president of being irresponsible and not facing up to the fiscal problems that Social Security will encounter in coming years. 
 "A true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren," Mr. Bush told the cheering crowd in Macomb County, the home of the so-called Reagan Democrat. "A true leader will fix this problem so that both the 'Greatest Generation' and the rising generation can depend on the promise of Social Security."
Mr. Bush wrapped the mantle of Roosevelt around his own plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to private investment accounts for younger workers. He called his proposal a "New Deal for a new generation."
The speech amounted to one of Mr. Bush's most sustained defenses of his Social Security plan since he unveiled it last May. He also spoke more broadly of the high-technology, investor-driven "new economy," portraying himself as an advocate of an entrepreneurial future and Mr. Gore as a relic the "planners and bureaucrats" of the past.
The Republican presidential nominee gave a spirited defense of Texas as a mecca of the high-technology industry, painting a picture of his state at odds with Mr. Gore's portrayals of it as a smog-ridden place where children lack health insurance coverage.
"We are attracting young, ambitious workers from all across America," Mr. Bush said.
But at the heart of Mr. Bush's address was his proposal for Social Security. On Wednesday the Democrats, moving fast to take advantage of one of the exchanges in the third and last presidential debate, began broadcasting a commercial about Social Security.
Asking "which promise is he going to break?" the advertisement echoes the language Mr. Gore used when he raised Social Security in the last moments of the debate.
"He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security trust fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own," Mr. Gore said in the debate, referring to Mr. Bush. "But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is the Show Me State, reminds me of the line from the movie, 'Show me the money.' Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, governor?"
The Democratic criticisms were based on the fact that Mr. Bush has put out the framework of a Social Security plan but not details, saying he wants flexibility to negotiate with Congress.
Analysts say that the transition from the current system to the kind proposed by Mr. Bush will require some hard choices. Under the Social Security system the payroll taxes of current workers are now used to pay current retirees. So if part of those taxes are shifted into private accounts, a way has to be found to keep paying current retirees.
Many experts estimate the cost of such a transition at nearly $1 trillion and say those funds would have to be accounted for through reductions in guaranteed benefits or a temporary infusion of cash into the trust fund.
Mr. Bush did not provide more details yesterday, but instead ridiculed Mr. Gore's math, saying, "My opponent, a man prone to exaggeration at times, seems to be deliberately missing a trillion dollars. Maybe if you've been in Washington too long you lose your ability to count real money."
He insisted that the Social Security system, which is projected to run a $2.4 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, would have "more than enough money to pay all the benefits it owes America's grandparents while allowing grandchildren to open personal accounts within the Social Security system." And he predicted that personal accounts, invested in the stock market, would "grow to $3 trillion by the year 2016, helping save Social Security for the future and building wealth for a new generation of Americans."
To give his advocacy of private accounts the sheen of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush invoked two Democratic senators who favor such an approach -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Both men are leaving Congress at the end of this session.
"With this Social Security reform, over time the working class will join the investor class," Mr. Bush said. "Millions of Americans -- of every race and age and background -- will have not only wages, but accumulated wealth."
Mr. Bush found other ways to go after Mr. Gore, winning the applause of his audience. He noted that a Texan, Jack S. Kilby, had just won the Nobel Prize for inventing the integrated circuit in the 1950's.
"It was an amazing achievement, unrivaled in the annals of technology -- until 1986 when one senator from Tennessee, alone in his office, invented the Internet," Mr. Bush said, mocking Mr. Gore's statement in 1999 that he had been instrumental in the creation of the Internet.

In His Own Words
 
GEORGE W. BUSH
Speaking yesterday in Macomb County, Mich.
 "Yesterday, the Democratic Party released its latest attack ad prepared by the Gore media team and designed to scare seniors. The chairman said that I had grabbed the third rail of American politics, and "he just didn't realize that we hadn't switched on the electricity yet and that's what we're going to do with this television ad as well."
Not this time. Not this year.
 It is irresponsible for the chairman of the Democratic Party and for Vice President Gore to stoke the fears of seniors while ignoring the hopes of younger workers. A true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren; a true leader will fix this problem so that both the Greatest Generation and the Rising Generation can depend on the promise of Social Security.
 Now, my opponent, a man prone to exaggeration at times, seems to be deliberately missing a trillion dollars.
Maybe if you've been in Washington too long you lose your ability to count real money. Independent analysts confirm, the Social Security system has a $2.4 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, more than enough money to pay all the benefits it owes America's grandparents while allowing grandchildren to open personal accounts within the Social Security system.
The personal accounts will grow to $3 trillion by the year 2016, helping save Social Security for the future and building wealth for a new generation of Americans.
Where we see a vision of hope, the Democrats will wage a campaign of fear. But this will not stop us from doing what is right."

Ebay's Net Income in Quarter Topped Wall St. Expectations

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
The Internet auction giant eBay reported quarterly earnings yesterday that beat Wall Street's expectations and offered a sharp contrast to the recent high-technology gloom.
The company reported $15.2 million in earnings for the quarter, or 5 cents a share, on revenue of $102.8 million from gross merchandise sales of $1.4 billion. The earnings were sharply higher than the $1.2 million, or 1 cent a share, for the quarter a year earlier. 
 Analysts polled earlier in the day by First Call/Thomson Financial had suggested the company would earn 4 cents a share.
The company promised more good news in the months ahead, with estimates of 2001 revenue of $630 million, about 50 percent higher than projections for this year. "The best is yet to come," said Meg Whitman, the company's chief executive.
In regular trading yesterday, eBay shares rose $3.81, to $57.19, on the Nasdaq in anticipation of good news. In after-hours trading following the earnings report, the stock jumped above $66.
Analysts said the news showed that eBay's auction system was continuing to gain devotees, not only in the United States but overseas as well. "Using eBay, buyers and sellers are able to meet for an almost endless stream of products around the world," said Derek Brown, an analyst with W. R. Hambrecht & Company.
In contrast to online retailers like Amazon, which have enormous costs of doing business, eBay's role as the online bazaar allows it to keep costs low. The company's warehouse is "scattered around houses and basements around the globe," Mr. Brown said. "That's the secret sauce."
An officer of the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., attributed eBay's continued success to discipline.
Rajiv Dutta, the vice president for finance, said eBay paid close, old-economy-style attention to profits even as other Internet companies disparaged profits in favor of growth and market share at any cost. Also, he said, "We've been sort of incredibly lucky."
In addition to its transaction fees, the company said it would generate revenue by offering services accompanying those sales. In the case of cars, for example, the company hopes to cull extra income by connecting buyers with insurance, inspections, shipping and more.
Another analyst, Timothy G. Fogarty of Thomas Wiesel Partners, said the company's prospects were are bright, but not unlimited. "We still have to ask ourselves legitimate questions about what kind of valuations are justified," he said. "You still have to inject some sanity."

HEADLINE: Social Security's Future

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Neither presidential candidate has addressed the fundamental problems Social Security faces over the next 30 years (news article, Oct. 20). As baby boomers start to retire, beginning around 2010, the ratio of retirees to workers will double. If the pay-as-you-go system is continued, its financing will require crushing taxes on wages. 
 The sensible alternative is to move rapidly toward a fully funded system, the assets of which would be invested in the nation's productive capacity. This switch would require a major investment of general revenues, including much of the projected budget surplus, to finance the pensions of current retirees.
Al Gore's proposals are a step in the right direction, but stop short of endorsing a full solution. George W. Bush's plan is economic nonsense -- his proposed tax cut is inconsistent with his plan to move workers, through individual investment accounts, to a funded basis.

HEADLINE: Maili Suu Journal;
Living at Ground Zero of Possible Atomic Disaster

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ

DATELINE: MAILI SUU, Kyrgyzstan, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Isolated between two of the world's tallest mountain ranges, the Fergana Valley is the breadbasket of Central Asia. Its tens of thousands of acres of fields, pastures and orchards feed millions of people in the region, and its cotton production is crucial to the economy.
Its teeming bazaars, too, are an integral part of the region's history as part of the Silk Road: the markets are exotic rainbows of color and diversity, from the thick felt rugs of onetime mountain nomads to the radiant silk weavings of Marghelan to qurduq fat from sheep and thick sausages made of horse meat. 
 But at the head of the valley, poised silently along the banks of the swift-running Maili Suu River, stands a Soviet-era uranium processing plant whose estimated 2.5 million cubic yards of radioactive waste represents a potential environmental disaster. It could wipe out the way of life that has thrived here for millenniums and threaten the lives and livelihoods of 10 million people in three Central Asian countries.
The material is buried under thin layers of gravel, sand and clay. Much of it is highly radioactive and on unstable ground, susceptible to earthquakes, landslides and floods that could send the material into the river and ultimately the water system of the valley.
Just as winds spread contaminated dust from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in 1986, the rivers, streams and irrigation canals that lace the valley downstream could carry radioactive material throughout the 60,000 square miles in the basin between the Tian Shan and Pamir-Alai ranges.
"This is a major environmental disaster waiting to happen," warned an internal analysis done last year by the American Embassy in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. "The United States government should take the lead in helping to defuse this environmental time bomb."
The risk was echoed in an unpublished draft paper prepared in June by the United Nations Development Program. The paper outlined how waste would make its way from the Maili Suu into the valley's main water source, the Syr Darya River, and contaminate the entire basin, the most densely populated part of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The contamination could destroy the agriculture base, force the immediate evacuation of 500,000 people and damage the economies and stability of all three countries, Yuri Misnikov, a senior United Nations official in Bishkek, said in an interview.
The Maili Suu plant is among dozens of environmental hazards littering Central Asia as a legacy of Soviet domination. Some are well known, like the former nuclear testing site at Semey in northern Kazakhstan, known as Semipalatinsk in Soviet times. Others are obscured by decades of secrecy.
No one knows how many Soviet-era repositories of uranium waste and toxic chemicals are scattered throughout Kyrgyzstan. Eight radioactive dumps were found in a village outside Jalal-Abad in the southern region, and radioactive waste was discovered on the shore of Lake Issyk Kul, the huge mountain lake in the north.
Experts say the worst site is at Maili Suu. Nearby mines provided raw material for the plant that produced weapons-grade uranium as the Soviets furiously developed an arsenal of atomic weapons for the cold war. The plant operated from 1948 to 1968, and its ruins stand not far from the river.
Twenty-three heaps of waste and 13 mining dumps have been identified. The exact amount and composition of the waste are unknown, because the records were taken to Moscow after the plant closed and the Russians have so far rejected Kyrgyz requests for access to the documents.
Radioactivity ranges from 10 to 50 times above normal levels in some areas, according to government officials in Maili Suu and Edward Taransenka, an environmental officer with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been studying the site.
Prolonged exposure is dangerous, but the larger threat is that a natural disaster could send the waste into the river. Kyrgyzstan's Environment Ministry said three of the most radioactive sites are on particularly unstable ground.
Despite the danger, no effort has been made to eliminate or mitigate the risks, though local officials have begged for new containment structures and for the moving of the most dangerous sites away from the river. Cost estimates range from $1 million to $3 million.
Part of the reason for the inaction is that the Central Asian governments face more immediate troubles, ranging from incursions by Islamic rebels to rising poverty and weak economies. In addition, the problem requires a regional solution and the countries have refused to discuss it jointly, though Kyrgyzstan has pushed for talks.
Foreign governments and international agencies have not stepped in to find a solution. American officials said privately that the responsibility belonged to the Central Asian countries. The United Nations has not given Maili Suu the priority necessary to provoke a coordinated response.
"People have come here and studied and promised to do something, but they have done nothing," Ashir Adbullaev, director of civil defense and emergencies in Maili Suu, said as he stood beside two of the most dangerous sites.
The place looks benign. The waste is kept in large reservoirs that were covered with a layer of clay and two feet of sand and gravel as they were filled.
Those buried reservoirs now form gently rolling mounds and slopes, with a fuzz of grass. Cattle sometimes graze on the hills, and children play there. Most of the barbed-wire fencing put up to keep out people and animals has been dismantled by locals for use in penning their livestock.
The city of Maili Suu has 24,000 residents and stretches for seven miles along the river. Dr. Nemat Mambetov, the region's epidemiologist, said that he had tracked increased incidences of cancer and blood diseases in Maili Suu since 1982, but that no direct relationship to the waste had been established.
The city is also dotted with "hot spots" of high radioactivity. Tons of material spilled into the river and washed down in 1958 when a wall at one reservoir gave way. The Soviets tried to keep the breach secret, but Dr. Mambetov said he believed that the radioactivity in town had come from that incident and smaller spills over the years.
Concern increased after a landslide on July 4, 1992, blocked the river. The water backed up and almost reached the waste sites before the river began flowing again.
Since then, Mr. Adbullaev said, it has seemed to be only a matter of time before something unleashes the poisons just below the surface on the banks of the Maili Suu and sends them coursing into the Fergana Valley.

HEADLINE: A Presidential Imprint on the Fed;
Gore or Bush Will Stand To Influence Central Bank

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
When it comes to the Federal Reserve, the two presidential candidates profess to share a basic approach: hands off.
But whether they like it or not, either Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush will put an imprint on the central bank -- perhaps firmly. 
 The winner of the presidential race will be able to appoint or reappoint at least five of the Fed's seven governors in the next four years.
Should the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, leave at or before the end of his current four-year term, which ends in June 2004, when he will be 78, the next president will also have a chance to place someone new in Mr. Greenspan's post at the pinnacle of economic policy making.
"Anyone who doesn't understand that this election will have an impact on the economy through the Federal Reserve Board doesn't understand American politics," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
Reflecting Mr. Greenspan's stature as the very embodiment of prosperity -- and clearly sensitive to any suggestion that they might exert political influence on the central bank -- both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have stressed their desire for continuity at the Fed.
The vice president would be "inclined to ask Greenspan to serve again" when his current term expires, said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said that Mr. Bush was dedicated to protecting the Fed's independence and that he had been an early proponent of reappointing Mr. Greenspan to his current term.
"There is no desire here to shape the Fed, except to provide quality governors with a diversity of backgrounds," Mr. Lindsey said.
Still, the next administration will inevitably be tested on whether it should continue the Clinton administration's policy of avoiding public criticism of the Fed, particularly if the economy weakens. And the new president's appointments will help shape the central bank's approach not just to monetary policy but perhaps even more in the arena of financial regulation.
On monetary policy, the new Fed appointees will immediately have an influential voice in the most important economic debate of this era: whether technology is permanently increasing the economy's ability to grow without generating inflation.
The degree of their influence is hard to predict. In part, that is because Mr. Greenspan, as long as he remains on the job, is all but certain to continue to have the final word no matter what the composition of the Fed. But it is also because there is little if any correlation between the politics of the president making the appointment and the way governors vote on interest rate decisions.
On regulation, where the main issues are the blurring of the line between commercial banks and Wall Street and the consolidation of the financial services industry, the ideological lines on the Fed are more apparent. Democratic appointees have been more sympathetic to consumer protection regulations, for example, than their Republican counterparts. And on regulatory policy Democrats have been more willing to challenge Mr. Greenspan, who has a strong preference for deregulation.
The Federal Reserve is comprised of seven governors, including the chairman, and the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. The governors are appointed by the president to 14-year terms, subject to Senate confirmation. The bank presidents are appointed by the boards of the reserve banks. All seven governors and five of the bank presidents, on a rotating basis, vote on interest rate policy. Most regulatory issues are decided by the governors.
The next president will be able to appoint or reappoint three governors immediately.
There are two empty seats, which Senator Gramm, whose committee has jurisdiction over Fed nominations, has blocked President Clinton from filling, saying the choice should go to the next president. In addition, the board term of the vice chairman, Roger W. Ferguson, expired in January; Mr. Gramm has held up approval of his renomination, although Mr. Ferguson can remain in his job until he or someone else is confirmed by the Senate.
In January 2002, Laurence H. Meyer's term as governor will expire. Two years later the term being served by Edward W. Kelley Jr., the only remaining Republican appointee other than Mr. Greenspan, will run out. Mr. Greenspan's current four-year term as chairman will expire in June 2004, although his board seat runs until 2006. Edward M. Gramlich's term runs until 2008.
Neither candidate has given any public indication of whom he might select for any of the Fed positions.
Should Mr. Greenspan leave, a President Gore could turn to Lawrence H. Summers, the current Treasury Secretary, or to a candidate from within the central bank, like William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, is another possible candidate.
Mr. Bush might look first to his current economic advisers, who in addition to Mr. Lindsey include Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard University, Michael Boskin of Stanford University and John B. Taylor of Stanford, one of the leading academic authorities on monetary policy.
"It would be a very healthy thing for democracy if the candidates were pressed not only to say which economists they would consider appointing, but what kinds of perspectives they would consider in making their choices," said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a liberal-leaning group that studies the Fed.
Assuming the economy remains healthy, any appointees to the Fed by a new president could expect to face questions about two closely related issues. The more immediate of them is whether the unemployment rate needs to rise substantially above its current level, 3.9 percent, to avert an eventual upturn in inflation.
The other, which could carry more profound long-term implications, is how enduring the effects of the technology revolution will prove to be on the economy's efficiency.
For the last five years, the Fed has been the crucible of a debate over whether technology, along with other factors like globalization, is fundamentally reshaping the economy or merely giving it a temporary boost.
Led by Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has proved pragmatic and flexible, gradually granting the economy far more running room than traditional theory would have allowed, in the belief that the United States is benefiting from a profound surge in the growth rate of productivity. Higher productivity means businesses can produce more for less, allowing profits and wages to rise without generating inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has been increasingly optimistic that the improvement in productivity will continue for some time, and he has said he does not think 4 percent unemployment is incompatible with price stability.
His views are not universally accepted within the Fed or among economists in general, however. Mr. Meyer, for example, has long asserted that the combination of 4 percent unemployment and moderate-to-strong growth will eventually ignite inflation. And some analysts say that productivity growth is too narrowly based in the technology sector and will fade as soon as the economy slows down.
Those monetary policy debates are likely to continue no matter who is elected president. But the new president's choices could more clearly influence the Fed's posture on regulatory issues, with Democrats more likely to be activist and in favor of consumer protections and Republicans more likely to favor deregulation.
It is largely a disagreement about regulation that has led Senator Gramm to block the Clinton administration's nominees to the Fed.
Mr. Gramm has been particularly concerned that Democratic appointees will enforce the Community Reinvestment Act, which seeks to insure that banks make a fair share of their loans to people in poor neighborhoods, in a way that amounts to the establishment of lending quotas. He said there were indications that the Fed would be more restrictive than Congress had intended in recent banking legislation in granting commercial banks the right to conduct more investment banking activities.
"Regulatory policy is an area where there would be a stark difference," Mr. Gramm said. "What has happened in this Federal Reserve Board is that the board has given Greenspan very wide latitude on monetary policy but the board has dominated on regulatory policy."
Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who is now an adviser to Mr. Gore, said there was a much greater likelihood that presidential appointments would influence regulatory policy than monetary policy.
"There's a quasi-ideological divide between people who think consumer protection legislation is a good idea, a worthwhile function of the government in general and the Fed in particular, and those who think it's not," Mr. Blinder said. "A Bush presidency versus a Gore presidency could make a difference there."
But Mr. Blinder said that even on regulation the party lines could be blurry. He recalled voting with Mr. Lindsey when both were on the board in the mid-1990's to tighten regulations regarding how banks advertise their interest rates -- and doing so in opposition to Mr. Greenspan.
Beyond monetary policy and regulation, the other big issue could be the Fed's independence.
Far more than most previous administrations, the Clinton White House has studiously kept its mouth shut about the Fed, especially when it comes to interest rates. The policy helped increase the Fed's credibility with the financial markets by reducing the risk of political meddling in monetary policy.
By contrast, President George Bush's administration openly criticized the Fed at times. Some of the former president's aides blame Mr. Greenspan for the elder Bush's loss to Mr. Clinton in 1992, saying the Fed did not cut rates early or aggressively enough to bring the economy out of recession starting in 1990.
Mr. Lindsey said Governor Bush "is a great believer in the political independence of the Fed."
But Democrats are happy to suggest that Governor Bush has not yet proved that he can resist the temptation to meddle with the Fed and that his family history with the central bank cannot be ignored.
Giving the Fed a wide berth "would continue to be the policy of a Gore administration," Mr. Blinder said. "I'm less confident it would be the policy of a Bush administration."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Courting the Hispanic Voter

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
The Republican National Committee released a new 30-second Spanish-language television commercial this week that promotes Gov. George W. Bush's promise to improve public schools and salutes his record on the issue in Texas. It is running in five states, most of them where the presidential candidates are in close races and all of them with many Hispanic voters: California, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
 
In addition, the Republican committee began broadcasting an expanded, 60-second radio version of the commercial in those five states and two others, Georgia and Washington. Both the television and radio commercials will run until Election Day, and while the committee would not say precisely how much money it was spending to run the advertisements, an official said it was a "multimillion-dollar" buy. 

PRODUCER -- Guerra DeBerry & Company
 
ON THE SCREEN -- The television commercial opens with black-and-white images of an impoverished barrio: a rundown house, a sorrowful man sitting on a curb, a lonely boy walking among the weeds that have sprouted under a bridge. Then, as the subject of the spoken words changes from the neglect of Hispanic people around the country to the strides being made by Hispanic students in Texas, the images bloom into full color, focusing on the happy faces and postures of a Hispanic teacher and her Hispanic students in a classroom. Hispanic children run merrily outside a school. And then Mr. Bush, in color and in close-up, talks directly to the viewer.
 
THE SCRIPT -- (translated from Spanish to English by the Bush campaign) -- First, an unseen announcer says, "They say that the economy's better than ever, but in our neighborhoods, we feel forgotten. We need a better education. And that means a new commitment. In Texas, Governor Bush raised academic standards and teacher salaries. Test scores improved. Now minority children in Texas lead the country in academic improvement."
 
Governor Bush, speaking Spanish, says, "For me, education is No. 1. Because our children deserve the best."
 
ACCURACY -- Under Mr. Bush's watch, Texas did raise standards and salaries, and Mr. Bush demonstrated as much interest in education as in any other issue. But some of the claims here about his education record are selective and broad. By some measures, in some grades, minority children in Texas were at or near the top in the nation for improvement; by others, they fared less well, especially in higher grades. Scores on standardized college-admission tests, for example, have not changed much.
 
Mr. Bush, as both a governor and a presidential candidate, has spoken in a more welcoming, concerned voice about Hispanic immigrants than most other Republicans. But critics say he has not moved nearly as aggressively as he could have to make sure that poor children in Texas, Hispanic and otherwise, have health care or to improve conditions in the impoverished "colonias" of Hispanic immigrants near the Mexican border.
 
SCORECARD -- In some ways, the subject matter and the claims here are less important than the language being spoken, which tells Hispanic voters that they matter. It is a message they are receiving louder and clearer this election year than ever before; in fact, this is the fourth Spanish-language commercial the Republican committee has released. The goal is for Mr. Bush to blunt Democrats' advantage with Hispanic voters, and the hope that he can do that is fueled by the demographics behind his 1998 re-election in Texas. Some surveys showed Mr. Bush receiving nearly half the Hispanic vote. FRANK BRUNI

HEADLINE: America's Bolshevik

 BODY:
Don Quixote himself might have despaired at the prospect of leading America's Communist Party during the cold war, but not the indefatigable Gus Hall. Mr. Hall died last week at the age of 90. His life story, improbably enough, is a genuine American tale.
Mr. Hall was one of 10 children born to Finnish immigrants in northern Minnesota. He joined the Communist Party as a teenager and at 21 he attended the Lenin Institute in Moscow, the ultimate training ground for Communist activists. 
 The 1930's were exhilarating times for a young Communist. The Great Depression had revealed the frailties of laissez-faire capitalism, and Stalin was then leading the fight against Fascism. But the next half-century sorely tested his Communist faith. Mr. Hall's advocacy of a violent revolution earned him an eight-year stay at Leavenworth. He was in prison when Soviet troops quashed the uprising in Budapest and Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his show trials. But none of that cooled Mr. Hall's Bolshevik ardor. By 1959 he had become the party's leader -- a post he held with unswerving, often unthinking doctrinal loyalty despite the Prague Spring, the Soviet Union's economic decay and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Mr. Hall ran for president four times. His best showing was 58,992 votes, in 1976. But he never gave up his understated Midwestern manner, even after he became a New York character and an odd kind of international celebrity. Despite his claims of independence, Soviet archives revealed that Moscow had bankrolled his activities for decades.
Mr. Hall was on the wrong side of history, and stayed there with what ultimately became a comical consistency. His favorite Soviet leader was Leonid Brezhnev. He condemned Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as "the wrecking crew," and proclaimed North Korea the latest miracle to emulate. He never wavered from his sclerotic orthodoxy, and never attempted to transform the party of the proletariat into a more trendy leftist alternative. That would have offended his native Midwestern stubbornness.

New York Ranks Near the Top For Efficient Use of Energy

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
The term "energy efficient" sounds jarringly incorrect in describing New York. Big, sprawling, arrogant, corrupt -- those are things people expect. "Efficient" seems a little too Jonathan Livingston Seagull and not enough Damon Runyon.
But New Yorkers are in fact astonishingly stingy in their use of electricity and fossil fuels. According to a recent study, only the residents and businesses in Hawaii used less energy per person, in proportion to the state's population and its economy. 
 The study, by a Washington energy research group called the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said that based on federal figures from 1997, New York State's residents and businesses also burned fewer hydrocarbons like gasoline or natural gas in proportion to the gross state product than all other states but Connecticut and the District of Columbia.
And who gets the credit?
Energy experts say the results are heavily skewed by the huge impact of New York City itself, where mass transit moves millions of people, thus saving uncounted gallons of gasoline that are burned in other metropolitan areas. Dense, high-rise housing is also often far less profligate of energy use for things like heat than the single-family homes that dominate most of the nation. And the housing is often cramped as well, with less room for energy-draining appliances.
New York's economy also has less dependence on energy-intensive industries like steel making or petroleum refining than the nation as a whole. Driven by the city's numbers, New York State had a lower percentage of households with clothes-washers, or dryers, or dishwashers, or freezers in 1997 than the national average, the efficiency study said.
In general, the report found that in states with higher energy prices, like Hawaii and California and most of the Northeast, people and businesses tend to use less energy or find ways to make it go further.
Energy-guzzling states at the bottom of the list, by contrast, tend to have low energy prices and huge empty rural spaces that require lots of driving, like Alaska, in 51st place, and Wyoming, in 49th, or an economic dependence on companies that use lots of energy, like Louisiana, which came in 50th place largely because of its huge petrochemical industry.
Another surprise -- contrary to all conventional wisdom -- has come from the State University of New York in Albany, where researchers have concluded that the Northeast, particularly a narrow band stretching through the metropolitan area and into southern New Jersey, is a prime potential location for solar energy.
Richard Perez, a senior research associate at the university's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, said that his solar insight began with a simple observation: the sunniest, hottest days in New York were also the days when the electricity system was pushing the limit of capacity because of higher air-conditioning use. Mr. Perez realized that solar energy could be the perfect add-on generating mechanism at those exact moments when it was needed most.
So he analyzed satellite and weather data, correlating sunshine with energy use, and redrew the conventional solar power map. Suddenly, the New York region was almost as attractive as Arizona as a place to use the power of the sun.
Last year, when 200,000 residents of upper Manhattan lost power for 18 hours on the hottest day in July, the available sunshine level was at 93 percent of maximum, Mr. Perez said. A few thousand small-to-medium-size buildings with rooftop solar panels would have been enough, he said, to have avoided the power loss.
Technical feasibility alone has not yet carried the day, Mr. Perez conceded. Although he was encouraged by some recent announcements about buildings in New York that had made a commitment to try solar generation, the public's skepticism, both economic and meteorological, runs deep, he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MILITARY;
BUSH WOULD STOP U.S. PEACEKEEPING IN BALKAN FIGHTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
If elected president, George W. Bush plans to tell NATO that the United States should no longer participate in peacekeeping in the Balkans, signaling a major new division of labor in the Western alliance, according to Mr. Bush's senior national security aide.
Under this arrangement, peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo would become a European responsibility, as could peacekeeping in other conflicts. The United States, in contrast, would focus on deterring and fighting wars in the Persian Gulf, Asia and other distant trouble spots. 
 Mr. Bush's plan would represent the most important revision of NATO tasks since the cold war. His aides say the change is long overdue and would let the American military concentrate its training and financing on traditional combat missions.
"The governor is talking about a new division of labor," Condoleezza Rice, the security adviser, said in an interview. "The United States is the only power that can handle a showdown in the gulf, mount the kind of force that is needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan Straits. And extended peacekeeping detracts from our readiness for these kinds of global missions."
In outlining the approach, Ms. Rice was providing the strategic rationale behind many of Mr. Bush's general comments in the campaign about using American military power and his repeated contentions that extended peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations had undermined military readiness. In sharp contrast, his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has said that if anything, Washington should take a more active role in using troops to prevent conflicts abroad.
Ms. Rice acknowledged that revising NATO's military tasks was delicate. Although Mr. Bush plans to make the redivision of military tasks a major objective, if elected, he plans to consult the Europeans and is not planning "precipitous" actions.
Many European allies have been insistent that the United States share the risks of Balkan operations. Britain is quite likely to be extremely concerned about suggestions that Washington might withdraw its forces from the Balkans, NATO specialists said, while the French may see it as opportunity to diminish the American influence in Europe.
Some European critics also said securing the peace in the Balkans was NATO's premier post-cold-war mission, one that has given the alliance an important rationale after the collapse of the Soviet threat.
"The Balkans is the new NATO mission," said Terence Taylor, assistant director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. "The United States has infantry and tanks in Germany. And if it is not going to send them to the Balkans, what are they are there for, anyway? Stopping the former Warsaw Pact from rolling westward? It is almost as if they are going back to the cold war."
The Balkan peacekeeping debate is part of a broader election-year dispute over the use of American power. The often partisan debate has also featured differences over military readiness, Pentagon spending and missile defense.
The peacekeeping debate has especially powerful implications for the NATO alliance and raises a number of critical questions. Should the leader of the alliance share the same risks and burdens in the Balkans as its European allies? Or would the West's security be better served if the American military did not have to worry about Balkan peacekeeping and could focus on other missions?
Can the United States continue to shape Western policy toward the region if it no longer has troops on the ground? Can it continue to exert the same degree of influence in European security policy?
American policy toward the Balkans has a tortured history. When President Clinton ran for office in 1992, he complained that the Bush administration had stayed on the sidelines as the Serbs turned Bosnia into a killing ground. But in office, the Clinton administration was initially slow to act.
Unlike the Europeans, Washington at first drew the line at sending peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. As the civilian toll rose, however, the administration pressed for a NATO bombing campaign. That succeeded in pressing the Serbs to go along with a Bosnia accord.
In 1995, Washington sent 25,000 American troops to help police the region, saying the troops would be stationed there for a year.
Today, the United States is still involved in Bosnia peacekeeping and is carrying out peacekeeping duties in Kosovo, as well. Still, the size of the American contingent has shrunk, and the Europeans are bearing most of the burden.
The United States peacekeeping force in the Bosnia and Kosovo totals 11,400 troops, according to the Pentagon. That is less than one-fifth of the 65,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in the region, and it is a fraction of the 120,000-member American military presence in Europe.
In budgetary terms, the Balkan mission accounts for a small part of Pentagon spending. The United States allocated $3.5 billion in the fiscal 2000 budget year for Balkan peacekeeping, slightly more than 1 percent of the Pentagon's annual $280 billion budget.
Longtime NATO hands say the American effort in the Balkans is extremely modest, given the United States' role as leader of the Western alliance and the fact that Balkan security has emerged as a primary mission for the alliance.
"If we want to have any influence in NATO on the Balkans, we are probably at the bottom line," said Wesley K. Clark, the retired United States Army general who commanded NATO in the Kosovo campaign. "When allies are putting in more than 80 percent of effort, there is not much room for an argument about burden-sharing. If we want to be part of this, we can't do much less."
In the campaign, Mr. Gore has taken a similar stance. For him, Balkan peacekeeping is one of NATO's primary tasks and an example of the operation that the American military needs to undertake to support American diplomacy in the post-cold-war world.
In addition to deterring and fighting wars, Mr. Gore says, the armed forces should prepare for peacekeeping missions, delivering relief supplies and rebuilding institutions in war-ravaged nations, activities that the Pentagon calls nation building.
To help the military carry out such a broad array of tasks, Mr. Gore says, he would earmark $80 billion of the federal surplus for military programs over 10 years. An additional $20 billion would be spent on international programs.
Mr. Bush says he would spend $45 billion of the surplus on the military over 10 years.
"The linchpin of our policy is forward engagement," said Gordon Adams, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore on military issues and a former top Clinton administration budget official. "We have a wide range of instruments to deal with the problems, diplomatic, economic and military.
"If you say you can use everything except the military, you have deprived yourself of one of those instruments. The Bush team has a curiously old-fashioned view. We will have a well-funded military that is designed to go nowhere and prepared do nothing, because they are only there to fight the nation's wars, and we are not having any."
Mr. Bush has contended that the military has been run ragged by peacekeeping and humanitarian work, missions that are taking a toll on morale and readiness.
Although Mr. Bush does not oppose all involvement in peacekeeping, he and his advisers say prolonged peacekeeping operations make it more difficult for the armed forces to prepare for major wars.
"This comes down to function," Ms. Rice said. "Carrying out civil administration and police functions is simply going to degrade the American capability to do the things America has to do. We don't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten."
In outlining a new division of responsibilities for NATO, Ms. Rice said the United States would not immediately withdraw from the Balkans but would inform NATO that its goal is to turn over the entire responsibility of stationing peacekeeping troops to its European allies.
The United States would continue to provide intelligence, help with communications, transport and do other logistical work after withdrawing its peacekeeping troops. In outlining that approach, aides to Mr. Bush have in mind East Timor, where an Australian-led peacekeeping mission received United States logistical support. Although East Timor represents one possible approach for Mr. Gore, it seems be the main model for Mr. Bush.
"We are not withdrawing from Europe," Ms. Rice said. "We are not withdrawing the kind of support we can provide, like air power. But when it comes to nation-building or civilian administration or indefinite peacekeeping, we do need for the Europeans to step up to their responsibilities. We are not going to do anything precipitous, but unless we set this as a firm goal we will never get it done."
In Europe, many allied officials complain that the American debate on the Balkans overlooks their contribution. They say that their forces are also stretched thin by the Balkan operation and that Americans do not seem to appreciate that they provide most of the economic aid.
Some also said Mr. Bush's program might give impetus to Europeans' efforts to develop their own military arrangements, perhaps more of a stimulus than Washington might like, given its goal to influence security policy in Europe.
Many allied officials are also haunted by the early 1990's, when they had troops in Bosnia and the United States did not. That case led to bitter disputes over strategy, and many Europeans are determined that it should never be repeated.
When the Clinton administration first suggested lifting the arms embargo on the beleaguered Bosnian Muslims and carrying out bombing strikes on Serbian forces, European allies complained that the plan would endanger their troops while the United States watched from a safe distance. As a result, many allied officials said, NATO should do everything to avoid a situation where European and United States officials do not face comparable risks on the ground.
Ms. Rice said that the Balkan situation was far more stable now and that the United States would not leave its allies to face a dangerous threat on their own. But European anxieties remain.
"There is a huge difference between providing logistics and air support and having your forces at the sharp end where a conflict might arise," Mr. Taylor said. "It is not burden-sharing to say, 'You guys go out and take the risk of getting killed, and if there are problems we will provide air support.' Putting American forces at risk is a fundamental to assuring that there is a political commitment from Washington. American feet on the ground is vital."

Against High Costs, A Better Light Bulb

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
High-strung, high-maintenance New York may never surpass laid-back Hawaii as the nation's most energy-efficient state, but a thunderclap of events in recent months in the Northeast have created what energy experts say is a glittering opportunity to try.
And it is all because a sharp rise in the prices of heating oil, natural gas and electricity in the last few months -- especially in the Northeast -- has thrown open the door for the return of the oldest environmental idea around: conservation. 
 Three months ago, the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative -- 1,500 families spread across 11 buildings just off Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx -- began replacing every old fluorescent light fixture in every hallway in every building with high-efficiency bulbs that use 45 percent less electricity. The co-op's directors calculated that the $45,000 investment would pay itself back in about two years.
Then came the summer of utility shock. With electricity rates up more than 40 percent in the New York region, the co-op's investment will be recouped after only eight months, or early next year. What had seemed pretty smart in early summer, said Amalgamated's general manager, William M. Schwarz, suddenly looked brilliant.
Most energy-saving technology is not much more sophisticated than that. Things like better bulbs and more insulation around a furnace room, experts say, can cut energy use as much as or more than expensive tools like motion sensors that turn off the heat or lights in empty rooms. Although the focus of conservation is probably still on the suburban homeowner, Amalgamated's experience has shown that urban conservation can have a huge impact.
"The best part is, it's not rocket science -- it's good Victorian engineering, rediscovered," said Amory B. Lovins, the chief executive for research at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an independent research center in Old Snowmass, Colo., that advocates alternative energy and higher efficiency.
Mr. Lovins and other experts say that for most Americans, higher energy prices and the impulse to conserve are probably still no more than a blip on the radar and not -- as they were in the 1970's -- a full-scale social movement. Leaders at the Amalgamated co-op say their motivations are mixed as well, one part penny-pinching, one part social consciousness.
The co-op was founded in the 1920's as part of the socialist utopian movement then thriving in the garment workers' union, whose ranks included many of the original tenants. Income ceilings limited the co-op's apartments to middle-income families, and there was always a social agenda. From the struggles of the labor movement, the co-op's social impulse morphed into environmentalism. Members embraced recycling before it was mandatory and trash compacting before it became city law.
Last year, as New York State was moving to deregulate its electricity system, Amalgamated's board approved an ambitious five-year retrofitting plan that includes everything from its lights to the testing or replacement of the estimated 5,000 motors that pump water and run elevators and distribute steam in the complex to a rooftop solar power system. A high-efficiency $150,000 water cooler for the air-conditioning system will go in before next summer.
"It's kept us who we are," said the co-op's president, Ed Yaker.
Energy entrepreneurs and researchers say that the widespread prosperity in the 1990's usually required conservation and efficiency to be dressed up as something else, like luxury. The Maytag Corporation came up with a superefficient front-loading washing machine several years ago called the Neptune that uses far less water and electricity than a conventional top-loader. But the company positioned it as a top-of-the-line European-style machine that was gentler on clothes and tacked on a price that was twice as high as its regular washers. Sales took off.
In New York, real estate developers have also positioned several new luxury residential and commercial buildings as "green" and done well in sales.
But many inventors hoping to get a piece of the market have cried in the wilderness for years.
Carmine F. Vasile, an inventor who lives on Long Island, vividly recalls April 28, 1980, when he accidentally touched a drainpipe in his basement in Medford, N.Y., while his wife was upstairs taking a shower. He burned his hand and realized that a lot of heat was escaping through the sides of the pipe.
Mr. Vasile, a former researcher in the aerospace defense industry with nearly 30 patents to his name, has spent 20 years trying to sell the patented device born of that accident -- a coiled heat recovery apparatus that recycles captured thermal energy back into the hot-water tank. The construction industry, he said, has mostly cared not a whit. "It's been a saga," Mr. Vasile said.
Some business executives say that higher energy prices could mean profitability for all sorts of old and new ideas.
Raymond G. Saleeby, who is the president and chief executive of myutility.com, a Manhattan energy management company founded last year, says that he expects the New York region's high energy costs to continue to worsen through the next year, and that the success of his company is predicated on that upward movement of prices. He says that he can cut a small-to-medium-sized company's energy bills in half, and he plans to hit where prices are rising fastest -- beginning next month in New York City, and then next year in California.
Other companies are trying to build a kind of commodities market in the metropolitan region in which reduced energy use -- and the resulting cleaner air quality -- will itself become a salable product that could further impel the conservation movement.
The company that put together Amalgamated's energy plan, First Rochdale, a two-year-old cooperative, is in the process of creating a pilot project: it is working with the Federal National Mortgage Association, the housing lender, and Cantor Fitzgerald, a brokerage firm, to form a commodities market for clean-air credits. The idea, to be tested first at the Amalgamated co-op, is to adapt the existing system, in which companies can buy and sell pollution credits, for the residential market in New York City.
But higher energy prices are a mixed blessing for conservation efforts. They are also battering local budgets, and that could mean less money in residential buildings available for conservation.
At Amalgamated, the second energy shock hit last month: drastically higher heating oil prices, up 51 percent over last fall. The increase has thrown every budget calculation into disarray, said Mr. Schwarz, the general manager. He is now being forced to consider an increase in common charges -- the monthly fees residents pay for things like heat and maintenance -- that could take effect next spring.
The tightening energy equation also means that plans, like the rooftop solar panels on the complex's two highest towers, will have to be strictly justified in financial terms. Social agendas are important, said Mr. Yaker, the co-op's president, but economics are what he will have to take to his board for the final decision.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RUNNING MATES;
Lieberman Declares His Party Built the Boom

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Calling the Democrats "the party of fiscal responsibility and economic growth," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today claimed for them the credit for the nation's extraordinary economic boom, and said only they would sustain it.
"Over the last eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration," Mr. Lieberman said, "we have come to understand that what we can do begins with being fiscally responsible, that when government balances its books, it not only stops draining capital out of the markets because it's in hock, but it creates a sense of confidence generally, and that is one of the conditions for growth." 
 Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Lieberman, his running mate, have signaled that they will make prosperity their core issue in the final push toward the election on Nov. 7. But Mr. Lieberman's remarks were a continuing reflection of the ticket's publicly split personality regarding President Clinton and his legacy.
Mr. Gore has tried to distance himself from his partner of the last eight years, and he and Mr. Lieberman frequently say they want to be judged more on their plans for the future than on the record of the past. But the vice president clearly wants to take credit for the good times, although without mentioning Mr. Clinton by name -- a task that more often falls to Mr. Lieberman.
"We've gone from the largest deficits in America, the federal government has, now to the largest surpluses," the senator said here in remarks to employees of FreeMarkets Inc., an Internet auction house for businesses. "It started right in '93. The Clinton-Gore administration said, 'We're going to get serious about coming out of debt; here's our budget proposals that are controversial.' It passed without a single Republican vote; Al Gore had to break the tie in the Senate. And it turned the corner."
Speaking at FreeMarkets and at a senior citizens' center here, the senator argued that while Mr. Gore's proposed tax cuts and spending plans fit comfortably within the projected government surpluses of the next decade, Gov. George W. Bush's would mean a return to deficit spending.
"That will take us back to debt and higher interest rates," he said, "and higher interest is a kind of stealth tax increase, because it affects your mortgage payments, your car payments, your student loans, your credit cards."
Most independent analysts agree that Mr. Gore's plans are more likely to keep the government within its means, but many believe that both candidates' proposals run the risk of overspending the surpluses.
Mr. Lieberman's visit here, and appearances he plans in the Philadelphia area on Sunday night and Monday, attest to the tightness of the race and a growing worry in the Gore camp. A month ago, polls indicated that Pennsylvania was solidly for Mr. Gore. But even as Mr. Bush has pulled slightly ahead in most national surveys, this state once again appears to be a toss-up in need of the Democrats' cultivation.
Mr. Lieberman also plans to campaign next week in Florida, another hotly contested state. And on Tuesday he is to be at the University of Notre Dame for what his aides call a major speech, on topics close to his heart: faith and values. The senator, the first Jewish candidate on a major party's national ticket, has for much of his career denounced what he describes as the corrosive influence of much of popular culture, and called for a greater role for religion in public discourse.
Mr. Lieberman, who does not campaign on the Jewish Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, will be out of action this weekend until sundown Sunday. He will be observing Simhat Torah, the last of a series of Jewish holy days that have taken him off the campaign trail for several days this month.
As Mr. Lieberman visited an Internet company today, so did the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney. At Intranet Solutions Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb, Mr. Cheney told more than 100 employees that Mr. Bush's economic plans would do more to help "the rising generation" of 18- to 34-year-olds who work there.
For a person in his 30's, Mr. Cheney said, the Bush proposal allowing workers to divert part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts could mean an extra $150,000 by retirement.
Noting that he and Mr. Bush had both held leadership posts outside government, Mr. Cheney called Mr. Gore's approach "old school" and said the vice president's proposals were "diametrically opposed" to the guiding principles of the "new economy."
At a rally later in Green Bay, Wis., Mr. Cheney depicted the Democrats as unworthy guardians of the economic boom.
"They can't wait to get their hands on that surplus," he said, "so they can spend it."
 
In His Own Words
 
JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN
Speaking yesterday to employees of FreeMarkets, an online, business-to-business auction service in Pittsburgh:
"What we've learned again is that government doesn't create jobs -- in America, it's always the private sector that creates jobs -- but that government can create the environment which is conducive for jobs to be created. If I may go back to an agricultural metaphor, government can turn the earth and provide some nutrients, but then it's the private sector that comes along and, you know, plants the seeds and nurtures the crops.
The central question before the voters this year is:
Do we want to see the country moving forward? Do we want to keep the prosperity going -- which Al Gore and I believe we're best able to do, and not only to keep the prosperity going but do it in a way, through better education and some of the tax incentives I've talked about, to expand the winner's circle to more of America's families? Or do we want to go back?"

HEADLINE: For Mrs. Clinton, Health Plan Left Lessons and Questions

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
To this day, puzzling questions hover over Hillary Rodham Clinton's effort to remake the nation's health care system in 1993 and 1994, the most ambitious project of her public life.
Mrs. Clinton mastered the complexities of health insurance, and she dazzled Congress with her command of facts and figures. But, even her allies say, she seemed to have a deaf ear for the politics of the issue in Congress. 
 She disregarded early warnings that her plan was headed for trouble on Capitol Hill. She plowed ahead, showing little of the knack for compromise that is often the soul of the legislator's art.
That experience is relevant now as Mrs. Clinton runs for the Senate from New York. She says she learned important lessons from the debacle of 1993-94, including the need to pursue grand goals by incremental steps. And, she says, she applies those lessons in her Senate race.
But the puzzle remains: how, friends ask, could someone so smart, so knowledgeable about the arcane details of the health care system, have been so obtuse about the politics of the issue on Capitol Hill, where she now aspires to work?
"We were politically naive," Mrs. Clinton said in an interview in September 1994, after the administration's proposal died in Congress. "We made a lot of miscalculations."
Mrs. Clinton expertly diagnosed the problems she tried to solve: soaring health costs, millions of Americans without insurance. But she got nowhere near persuading Congress that she had a workable solution.
Her opponent in the New York race, Representative Rick A. Lazio, will not let her forget. He calls her health plan "an unmitigated disaster." Likewise, Gov. George W. Bush chides Al Gore, saying the vice president joined Mrs. Clinton in fighting for "a government-run health care system" in 1993.
Mrs. Clinton has often acknowledged errors. But mostly she suggests that the president's plan, which she developed, was not packaged and sold well. By contrast, her critics and some of her allies say that the product itself was the problem, and that she failed to see its flaws because of the frantic, secretive process by which it was devised.
Her opponents suggest that Mrs. Clinton was personally responsible for the health care fiasco. That may be an overstatement. President Clinton was with her every step of the way.
But, some White House officials say, Mrs. Clinton was in charge of the project and could have altered the administration's course. Her allies say they doubt whether she could have blunted Republican opposition. In any event, she says, she never had much of a chance to discuss deals with Republicans because, at some point in 1994, their cooperation "just shut off like a spigot."
Mr. Lazio, like many of Mrs. Clinton's critics, says her record in the battle over health care shows she lacks the temperament and experience to do the job for which she is now running. They note that her health care plan died in a Democratic Congress, and one reason, they say, is that she failed to work with Congress, even with committee and subcommittee chairmen of her own party.
George Stephanopoulos, a top adviser to the Clintons, said that "having Hillary run health care was a mistake," in part because "compromise didn't come naturally" to her.
In his memoirs ("All Too Human," Little, Brown, 1999), Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mrs. Clinton's health plan "reflected both her strengths and her weaknesses," for it was ambitious, idealistic and highly logical, but also inflexible and overly complex.
Mrs. Clinton's defenders say the health plan fell victim to Republican partisanship and to relentless attacks by insurance companies, drug companies and small businesses. When Mrs. Clinton took up her assignment in 1993, Republicans, especially in the Senate, said they were eager to work with her. But by the end of the year, the tide began to turn.
In December 1993, conservative theorists like William Kristol were urging Congress to reject the Clinton plan, and their advice emboldened other Republicans. In response to Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message in January 1994, Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said, "Our country has health care problems, but no health care crisis."
In February 1994, the White House suffered a damaging blow when the Congressional Budget Office said that the Clintons had understated the cost of their proposal and the premiums needed to pay for it.
By the summer of 1994, many Republicans had made a strategic decision to oppose the Clinton plan, partly because they saw it as a vivid symbol of big government, and partly because they sensed that its defeat would help them win control of Congress. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said the president's plan would pass only "over my cold, dead political body."
Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said Mrs. Clinton suffered the fate of many strong women. "She was singled out as a witch-type figure," said Ms. Skocpol, who wrote a book on the Clinton health plan ("Boomerang," Norton, 1996).
Mrs. Clinton was a victim of "vicious ridicule" and "misogynist mockery," Ms. Skocpol said.
Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supervised the drafting of the Clinton administration's health care bill in 1993, said she still wondered about Mrs. Clinton: "How does a woman get to be so hated by people who have never met her? A lot of people were intimidated by her. She has a formidable personality."
But Mrs. Clinton's problems ran much deeper.
By her own account, she underestimated the magnitude of the task she had set for herself, redesigning the health care system and rearranging one-seventh of the nation's economy. She overestimated the mandate of a president who had been elected with 43 percent of the popular vote. And, by her own admission, she was a novice in dealing with Congress.
"I didn't understand the rhythm of the place," Mrs. Clinton said of Congress in the 1994 interview. "I didn't understand the institutional constraints."
President Clinton took office on Jan. 20, 1993. Five days later he named Mrs. Clinton to lead a task force that was supposed to devise a detailed proposal to control health costs and guarantee health insurance for all Americans. Mr. Clinton said he would submit the proposal to Congress within 100 days of his inauguration -- by April 30.
But the deadline slipped again and again. Mr. Clinton placed a higher priority on pushing his budget through Congress, over Republican opposition.
"Mrs. Clinton was not allowed to go forward with health care reform at a time when the president's power was at its height," Ms. Rosenbaum said.
Originally, Mrs. Clinton said in September 1994, "we thought we were going to get health care reform" enacted as part of the budget package. "I personally miscalculated," she said, "because of my experience dealing with state legislatures, which handle a huge array of problems in a compressed period of time."
Congress, she found, "can do only one big thing at a time."
The president and Mrs. Clinton delivered the text of their legislative proposal, a 240,000-word document, to Congress on Oct. 27, 1993.
In a recent interview, Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who was then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, "Mrs. Clinton was so committed to trying to get the entire bill through Congress that she created some blind spots for herself."
Mr. Rostenkowski said he had told Mrs. Clinton that it would have been wiser to "give us some parameters and guidelines" and let Congress fill in the details.
White House officials felt they would not be taken seriously unless they fleshed out their ideas.
In addition, Mr. Rostenkowski recalled, he urged Mrs. Clinton to be more flexible, saying: "Hillary, you're not in Arkansas now. You're dealing with legislators who have varied views. Compromise is what will get this bill passed."
Mrs. Clinton met frequently with members of Congress, but, they said, she did not assimilate their comments or criticism into her work.
The White House team "came over and saw us all the time, but ignored what we said," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who was then chairman of a powerful subcommittee responsible for health legislation.
Mr. Stark said he urged Mrs. Clinton to be less secretive. He challenged her estimates of the savings that could be achieved in a more competitive health care market. And he cautioned that the structure of her proposal, which called for the purchase of insurance through huge "regional alliances," was too convoluted to work. But his advice did not lead to significant changes in the proposal.
Many potential allies complained about the secrecy of Mrs. Clinton's task force. After a White House meeting in March 1993, Dr. Quentin D. Young, national coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program, a champion of universal health care, said, "It was a magnificent exercise in pseudo-openness."
When Mrs. Clinton visited Congress in February 1993, Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who was then minority whip, articulated the concerns that swamped the president's plan 19 months later.
Mr. Gingrich said then that Mrs. Clinton's proposal looked like "washed-over old-time bureaucratic liberalism, or centralized bureaucratic socialism."
Looking back in September 1994, Mrs. Clinton said she had been surprised by the ferocity of the opposition to her plan.
"I totally missed the coming wave of partisanship," Mrs. Clinton said then. "I just missed it. And I am still kind of puzzled about how it happened."
Members of both parties tried to send warning signals to the White House.
In May 1993, Representative Stark said the premise of Mrs. Clinton's proposal -- the concept of managed competition -- was "a fairy tale." That approach, which relied on market forces to hold down costs and expand coverage, had never been tried, Mr. Stark said, and he likened it to a unicorn, "a beautiful animal in fairyland, but unseen on earth."
Then in September 1993, just three days before Mr. Clinton presented his plan to a joint session of Congress, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said its financing was based on a "fantasy." Estimates of savings in Medicare and Medicaid were overly optimistic, he said.
A year later Mrs. Clinton said, "That was probably the single most damaging moment in the entire health care debate," and she described Mr. Moynihan's comment as "a killer."
Some budget experts inside the administration had expressed similar doubts about the financing of the Clinton plan. But they said it was difficult for them to criticize a plan devised by the president's wife.
Mrs. Clinton is now running for the seat Mr. Moynihan holds. His comments in 1993 carried weight because he was chairman of the Finance Committee and had a reputation for independent thinking and plain speaking.
Senator Moynihan worried, as he later wrote, that "the administration bill would devastate the New York City hospital system" by reducing the number of foreign medical graduates in city hospitals. And he lamented "the fatal complexity and coerciveness" of the administration's plan.
Mrs. Clinton now calls teaching hospitals "the crown jewels of America's health care system," and she supports Mr. Moynihan's effort to provide financing for medical schools and teaching hospitals.
Mr. Lazio says the Clinton health plan would have cost New York 72,000 jobs.
In 1993-94, Mrs. Clinton often emphasized her willingness to negotiate. But she was inclined to demonize critics and opponents, just as they demonized her.
Mrs. Clinton displayed a combative, adversarial style. She not only criticized the policies and practices of insurance companies and drug companies, but accused them of price-gouging and criticized their motives and morality.
In May 1993, in a campaign-style speech to the Service Employees International Union, Mrs. Clinton said she would "take on every special-interest group," and she denounced "price-gouging, cost-shifting and unconscionable profiteering" by the health care industry.
Mrs. Clinton appeared to relish the prospect of a populist crusade. "If the forces arrayed against reform want a real battle in which their self-interest is exposed and their real agenda is made public, they will get it," she vowed in November 1993.
But Mrs. Clinton did not build the coalitions or round up the votes needed to win that battle. Indeed, she turned a cold shoulder to moderate Democrats, complaining that their proposals would not guarantee coverage for 100 percent of the population.
In a curious way, events over the last six years have borne out the concerns of both Mrs. Clinton and her critics. Events suggest she was right to worry about health costs and the uninsured. Costs are surging again, and the ranks of the uninsured grew by an average of more than a million a year from 1994 to 1998.
But events also suggest that Mrs. Clinton's critics were right in asserting that the government could never perform the large role she envisioned for it. The government cannot figure out how much to pay health maintenance organizations caring for 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries, lawmakers say, so it could hardly have set premiums and supervised insurance arrangements for more than 270 million Americans.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: SUBWAY SERIES;
1956 vs. 2000? It's Deja Vu All Over Again, Except for When It's Not

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
During a desperately contested presidential election, in the media and cultural capital of the world, in a boom town where Broadway theaters were flourishing and entrepreneurs were pioneering a fledgling new video industry, New Yorkers took to the subways to cheer on pennant winners from rival boroughs as they waged World Series war.
The year, of course, was 1956. 
 There are enough similarities between Eisenhower-era Gotham and millennial New York to suggest that the intervening 44 years have been a valley to the peaks that were two Subway Series. In both of these baseball snapshots, New York stands revealed as a pre-eminent world city in its economic, artistic and athletic heyday. Both are times when city residents actually do have good reason to arrogantly assume that they are at the center of the universe.
And yet, a comparison of today's MetroCard Series with the last subway-token Series finds a chasm separating Ed Sullivan's New York from Regis Philbin's. It's not just that day games have been transformed into night games, that city workers' blue collars have been morphed into white, that suburbanites once desperate to leave are now desperate to score a city co-op, or that a white-skinned town has now become more demographically diverse.
New York in 1956 was a complex, before-the-economic-deluge city in a complicated time when schoolchildren did hydrogen-bomb duck-and-cover drills under their desks, where blacklisted writers worked under pseudonyms in the era of the silent generation, and where blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women were not encouraged to apply.
"The cold war was at its zenith, heading toward the 1962 missile crisis, there was the specter of McCarthyism and a nascent civil rights movement," said Ken Burns, the documentary film historian.
The contemporary roster of political and social ills notwithstanding, Mr. Burns and several historians suggest that New York and the nation as a whole confront a more palatable menu of disasters.
"I think we live in a much simpler, and much calmer, time right now," said Mr. Burns, whose nine-episode series, "Baseball," ran on Public Television in 1994. "The enemies of good history are nostalgia and sentimentality."
Some of the other contrasts with 1956 are more obvious. It isn't only that most every male was sporting a fedora in 1956, or that the 15-cent price of a subway ride would be 10 times as much by the millennium. Series fans paid a top price of $10.50 for box seats in 1956 and spent only $2.10 to become bleacher creatures; this year, the ticket-price spread is $50 to $300 in some luxury boxes.
The pre-suburbanized, pre-television-dominated, pre-automobile-oriented New York of 1956 was the nation's "leading manufacturing city," said Dr. Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City. A premier port city in the pre-container era, New York was where the great liners still docked and the great trains still roared into the terminals.
Employment was characterized "by the white male union blue-collar worker," said Dr. Mike Wallace, a professor of history at John Jay College and co-author of "Gotham: A History of New York to 1898," which won a Pulitzer Prize for history in 1999. "Now the labor centerpiece involves white-collar, female, nonunion people of color."
During the last Subway Series, New York was a town where neighborhoods, parishes and ethnic communities were much more the center of life. The city's relationship with its baseball gods was also more intimate.
"The connection between players and fans was more personal and exciting," given the localized nature of New York in 1956, said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian and political scientist, who was 13 when she avidly followed the last Subway Series.
Back in that facial-hair-free era when ears were unpierced and tongues were unstudded, many players lived among the folks. In 1956, the Dodger legend Pee Wee Reese occupied a modest brick duplex on Barwell Terrace in Bay Ridge, pitcher Sal Maglie lived in Riverdale and many Yankees occupied an apartment hotel on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.
In their heyday, Dodger stars earned something like 10 times the $3,948 yearly average salary of the 1956 working man -- not an inconceivable difference, about $250,000 in today's dollars -- whereas even journeyman players bring down $2 million today.
If there was more complexity in the tenor of those times, New York baseball in the 1950's seemed comfortingly uncomplicated. There was but one fierce loyalty and that was your family's, your neighborhood's, your borough's, team. Today it is baseball that has the high degree of difficulty, being but one option in a complex menu of sports entertainments. In the bloated new regional Big Apple, home-team allegiances are more shifting and fraught than ever.
Languishing at the center of the new dynamic are the players themselves, all caught "in the great celebrity hiding machine," as Roger Angell, who has written about baseball for The New Yorker since 1962, put it in an interview. "Today we look at them with the glazed-over interest that we apply to all celebrities."
In contrast, even the 1950's stadiums themselves permitted minor-league intimacy. Gone are the days when fans could see (for free) the great expanse of sacred Yankee Stadium turf from the 161st Street subway platform. Gone are the afternoons when Alan M. Dershowitz, now a Harvard Law School professor, was able to camp out on the roof of his grandmother's house "and see over the right-field wall at Ebbets."
Since phalanxes of rabid Mets and Yankees fans are front and center whenever the video-lights go on, passions today seem deep enough, but they aren't those of 1956. Traditional borough nationalism has attenuated in the decades since baseball was truly America's pastime. And many of both team's fans now come from the suburbs.
But in the 1950's, "the team you rooted for was as much a part of your identity as your religion was," Ms. Goodwin said.
Such was the presence of the Dodgers and Yankees in 1956 that it took a significant act of will by neighborhood Benedict Arnolds to avoid rooting for the borough team.
"Growing up in Brooklyn you were unable not to be a Dodger," said Sanford Teller, a Manhattan public-relations consultant who used to take the trolley from Borough Park to Ebbets Field. "Giant fans were pummeled."
In Our Lady of Lourdes parish on the Upper West Side not far from the Polo Grounds, "it was all Giants," said Peter Maas, the Manhattan author, who grew up in the neighborhood and attended the 1956 Series as a reporter for Collier's magazine. "Ebbets Field seemed to be in the Middle East somewhere. The Yankees were too rich and we saw the Dodgers as an alien force."
The exception that proves the rule is that Brooklynite Yankee defector, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In today's game, Latino fan rivalries are expected to add drama to the battle for New York. In 1956, the Hispanic player presence in the Series was limited, even though there were 650,000 Spanish-speaking residents in the city in 1956, 90 percent of whom were Puerto Rican. (The only Hispanic who played was the Havana-born Dodger Sandy Amoros; there were no Asians.)
In 1956, "the Dodgers were the Jewish and Italian and black team," according to Mr. Dershowitz, whose synagogue actually gave a blessing to the pitcher Sandy Koufax. "The Yankees got their own borough, and the WASPs."
The borough loyalty of the 1950's may also be a casualty of fans' perception that today's Yankees and Mets are generic collections of hired millionaires.
Patrick McEnroe, the 34-year-old sportscaster and tennis-league entrepreneur, grew up in Queens, 15 minutes from Shea Stadium, "but I always rooted for the Yankees, and I knew other kids who did," he said. "Maybe that tells you that there isn't as much identification with the teams, because so many players come and go."
New Yorkers may be glued to their pocket color televisions today, but the 1956 Series was a testament to the ubiquity of radio. "You could walk down the street from house to house and never miss a single play of the game," Ms. Goodwin said.
Though the first color-television sets were sold in 1954 (for $1,000) the 1956 donnybrook was, for the average fan, a black-and-white-screen, tin-foil-on-the-rabbit-ears experience. In a town where innovators were pioneering live television drama and comedy, "network executive offices weren't worrying that the New York demographics were too insular and parochial for national audience ratings," said David Halberstam, author of "Summer of '49" and "October 1964," who grew up seven blocks from Yankee Stadium.
In autumn classics then, the game-day afternoon was exactly that: a day game. Life in the boroughs was a scene out of "The Day the Earth Stood Still," when everything stopped. But thanks to evening scheduling, many millennial New Yorkers will be spared the crisis of every 1956 baseball Hamlet: to cut school or to call in sick at work?
If the city of 1956 was an alternate universe, "it is remarkable that New York has changed less than most other American cities since then," Dr. Jackson said. He said that Detroit and St. Louis lost half of their populations during the last four decades, while cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Baltimore lost nearly a third. New York's population of 7.4 million isn't too much lower than that of 1956, if the number of illegal aliens is factored in.
"In the '50's, the economy was booming, but people thought that the future was in the suburbs," Dr. Jackson said. "Now there is a sense of energy in the city that is more appealing to young people than the suburbs."
But aspects of the lost New York live again. Already, the Series is a political opportunity (with the Republican Senate candidate, Rick A. Lazio, hyping the Mets, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, promoting the Bombers). It isn't the first time. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived at the first game in an open campaign car and Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic nominee, was cheered at the next game.
Just as writers, painters, photographers, designers, musicians and celebrity chefs have put millennial New York on the cutting edge of innovation, the Dodger-Yankee town was a festival of modern dance experimentation, abstract expressionism, bold Broadway musicals, culinary creativity pioneered by the likes of James Beard, transgressive jazz and doo-wop on the street corners.
While the 14th Subway Series introduces a new generation to a 79-year-old city tradition, it will surely provoke a rush of memories for New Yorkers older than 50. "It's feeling a lot like deja vu all over again," said Yogi Berra, reprising one of his more celebrated Yogi-isms.
In the end, maybe the first Subway Series between the Yankees and the Mets is a triumph of continuity and revival for a city rich in both history and baseball. Or maybe it's just another occasion to brag.
"We purport to be the best, and it's nice to see that actually validated," Mr. Maas said. "The Subway Series is a symbol of New York's renaissance, and it will drive the rest of the country nuts."

 PARIS TO
 THE MOON
 By Adam Gopnik.
 338 pp. New York:
 Random House. $24.95. 
 In 1957, the French critic Roland Barthes published a book, "Mythologies," that remains essential reading for anyone trying to understand modern France. In a series of extremely short essays, some no more than 500 words, Barthes seized on neglected, even trivial aspects of French life and drew out of them magisterial analyses of his society. He wrote on, among other subjects, steak and fries ("fries are the alimentary sign of Frenchness"), the Citron DS, the soap powder Omo and the Blue Guides. Barthes's genius was to bring the eye of a journalist for the contemporary together with the analytical power of a sociologist and to write in the clear, aphoristic prose style of great French writers like Chamfort or Stendhal. Since 1957, there have been many books on the territory of "Mythologies," but almost all have suffered from impenetrable jargon or annoyingly breezy journalese.
But now, in this reviewer's mind at least, Roland Barthes has a worthy successor in the shape of Adam Gopnik, essayist for The New Yorker and its correspondent in Paris from 1995 to 2000. "Paris to the Moon" is a collection of essays originally written for the magazine that have been seamlessly integrated with new and often more personal material. There are profound and hilarious reflections here on French cafes, cooking, strikes, fax machines, Christmas trees, plugs, toys, football and hospitals -- and much else. The result is the finest book on France of recent years.
In the opening chapter, Gopnik accounts for what drew him to France, and more specifically Paris, in the first place. "I've wanted to live in Paris since I was 8," he declares, but in the nature of many love affairs with other countries, the reasons for Gopnik's passion remain vague and, he would be the first to admit, rather sentimental. As a child growing up in Philadelphia, he'd seen charming images of Paris in a book adaptation of the film "The Red Balloon," by Albert Lamorisse. As a teenager he'd gone on a trip to Paris with his family and had the best meal he could remember in a simple restaurant near his hotel. A few years later, he'd been back to Paris with his girlfriend (and now wife), Martha, and had felt like an adult for the first time. And, living in Manhattan, he'd felt drawn to the idea of providing his son with a French childhood -- Babar, puppet shows in the Luxembourg gardens, etc. -- in contrast to what he felt was the depressing Gameboy culture predominant in the United States.
The Gopnik family hadn't exactly chosen the best moment to move to France, as Gopnik concedes; living in France "was a hard romance to sustain in most of the last five years, when almost everybody else thought that Paris was going straight to hell." It has indeed been fashionable (until very recently) to write France off as a country wrecked by obsolete working practices and unable to adjust to the new economics (what the French call, usually with utter disdain, "the Anglo-Saxon model"). In the last five years, French politics have been rocked by a succession of scandals, there have been almost monthly strikes, the unemployment rate has stuck firmly above 12 percent, French filmmakers and writers don't seem to produce anything decent and, what is perhaps worst of all, it's now often said that you can eat better and cheaper in London.
But this feeling of being in the right place at the wrong time did not deter Gopnik, who threw himself into the task of describing and interpreting his beloved country. He excuses the absence in his book of some of the more typical journalistic assignments: high politics, local corruption, crime. What really interested him about France was how people ate, where they bought their washing machines, where they went on holiday and so on -- the details of everyday bourgeois life.
The distinctive brilliance of Gopnik's essays lies in his ability to pick up a subject one would never have imagined it possible to think deeply about and then cover it in thoughts, making connections with literature, sociology and philosophy -- all treated in a highly readable way. "It is as if all American appliances dreamed of being cars while all French appliances dreamed of being telephones," he writes, trying to account for why his refrigerator in Manhattan looks so different from the one in Paris. He argues that the French are obsessed by telephones because they love to communicate, and then goes on to point out that the way they use their phones is very distinctive and quite un-American. They favor a clipped, epigrammatic style of phone conversation, as opposed to the flabby, endless digressions of Americans. Then follow some reflections on the French and their plugs. Gopnik makes much of the fact that the French have "light, dapper, rounded three-prong plugs with two little cylindrical probes," while the Americans usually leave their plugs ungrounded, a symptom of an un-nannying approach by the American authorities, but also of a very un-French tolerance of risk.
Some of Gopnik's finest pieces relate to eating. In an essay entitled "A Tale of Two Cafes," he tackles head-on one of the great mysteries of life on the Left Bank of Paris: why it is that in the Place St.-Germain there are two cafes, almost identical in atmosphere and food, one of which is deemed the epitome of chic (Cafe de Flore), the other of which (Les Deux Magots) is derided by anyone in the know and is abandoned to the lowest of the low in the natives' eyes, American tourists. Gopnik's analysis of this mystery takes in most of the major figures and events in the history of modern France. He mentions the Vichy government, relations between Camus and Sartre, semiology, Voltaire and Michel Foucault. He is truly able to see the whole world in a grain of sand.
Another virtue of this book, and what makes it peculiarly French despite the nationality of the author, is the way it is written. Gopnik writes essays in the French rather than the Anglo-Saxon style, by which I mean that he fuses a personal voice (we get to know and like him in the course of the book) with an essentially serious intellectual project. It is this mixture of the personal and the intellectual that places him in the tradition of nonfiction writing that starts with Montaigne and includes the essays of Baudelaire, Camus and of course Barthes himself.
"Paris to the Moon" is purportedly about France, but by the end we feel we have learned about more than just one country, we've learned -- through the prism of France -- about differences among societies, and so too about our own particularities.

 A New World
 By Amit Chaudhuri.
 192 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $22. 
 Sleep can be a refuge from intolerable anguish; but it is thin and vulnerable, restless and soon over. Humiliated when his wife leaves him for another man -- partly bald, moreover, and with bad breath -- Jayojit Chatterjee takes leave of his life in California to spend the summer with his parents in Calcutta. Amit Chaudhuri portrays this retreat into childhood reassurance as a sleep of its own: briefly consoling and mournfully fragile.
Author of a trilogy of novellas that evoke the amiable languor and stagnant poisons of his native city, Chaudhuri employs both art and risk in "A New World." Mirroring Jayojit's somnolence, the story fades away at times; mirroring its sweetness, the writing is lovely; mirroring the shards of painful memory that pierce the lethargy -- nails through a fakir's mattress -- the languor of the summer narrative is interrupted by snippets of the year-round realities Jayojit has temporarily shed.
Jayojit works to give substance to the daily details of his Calcutta holiday, as if they, not his broken marriage and position as an economics professor, were his real life. He clings to them like a dream that fights awakening.
With his young son, Bonny, whom he has managed to wrest from his ex-wife, Jayojit lands at the airport after an interminably circuitous flight on a Bangladeshi airline, chosen to save money. He feels light and floating, his burdens unshouldered. When the taxi driver overcharges him, he laughs as if the fare were play money.
Calcutta promises respite and cosseting. As soon as Jayojit and Bonny arrive, sticky and tired, his mother offers to assemble a greasy breakfast. They lack the energy to touch it. (Her cooking, Chaudhuri writes, in one of many phrases that give wings to this purposely still story, "was safe and insipid, and had a tranquillity about it.") "Have a bath, then, you two," offers the father, a retired admiral. Bathing is nourishment in the steamy city.
The days pass, easy and torpid. Bonny, whose displaced-child docility the author suggests without ever mentioning it, plays with his set of plastic dinosaurs. Jayojit takes naps and baths, rambles through the neighborhood, chats with the neighbors, does small errands. Some of the chapters are nothing but errands, accomplished slowly.
"Snapshots" is too active a word for Chaudhuri's portraits of life in his family's middle-class apartment compound. "Old postcards" is more like it: a dog barking, the slumbrous watchman at the gate, the drivers hanging about the tea-stall outside, the pavilion from where the building's laundry is delivered crisp each day. "There were few things to rival washed clothes in their undisappointing recurrence."
At times nothing moves at all: not in Jayojit's summer days, not in the pages of the book. It is a dead calm, and it can be trying for the reader. Gradually it becomes trying for Jayojit, as he begins to outsleep himself. And from his restless rest, Chaudhuri assembles a moving portrait of aging parents and a son whose troubles mark them, just as their decline marks him.
The apartment is decent but cramped. Evenings, the sound of television ("a form of public dreaming") drifts from next door. Admiral Chatterjee -- a rear admiral, actually -- is living on a pension whose value is shrinking and on investments too cautious to profit from the securities boom. Jayojit, an economist of some small repute (his bugbear is Americans who ask him about Amartya Sen), is an occasional consultant to the Indian government. He is helpless, as economists tend to be, when his father shyly hints that he could use some financial advice.
Admiral Chatterjee speaks a bluff naval English (though he was an independence nationalist as a young officer). He used to frequent the officers' club; now diabetes and a small stroke have sapped his energy. More profoundly, so has his loss of position, perks and deference. He schools himself to be simply one more old man to bank clerks and shop attendants. There is a fragile habit of command, still, but puzzlement beneath it. He feels threatened by his wife's quiet plea for a washing machine; they must make do with the part-time help that is all they can afford. It is change he fears. As for Mrs. Chatterjee, change might be welcome -- perhaps in everything except deference to her husband.
Jayojit's holiday has a little while to go but it is over, in fact. Even on holiday, life intrudes. Jayojit will buy a washing machine for his mother; he has a purposeful though wonderfully indirect talk with the family doctor, an old friend, about his father's health.
The artfully -- perhaps too artfully -- hidden thread that runs through Jayojit's Calcutta story is, of course, what happened to his marriage. Until Bonny's birth, he and Amala had been passionate and seemingly loving. "Then unfamiliarity set in, though no one else would notice it, and they got used to even that. The child, instead of bringing them together, actually enabled them to separate into their own spheres of desire and loneliness."
Amala moved out, sued for divorce and got full custody of Bonny. Jayojit -- tigerish in California, a tiger tranquilized at his parents' -- fired his lawyer, hired another, brought an unusual action in an Indian court and won vacation rights. Chaudhuri feeds us these things one scrap at a time, spaced between the Calcutta errands, naps and walks. Frustratingly, it never quite makes a full meal, though it infuses tension into the stillness. It also represents, perhaps oversubtly, Jayojit's own need to blot the story out for a while.
In fact, the real weight of the breakup is conveyed not in the brief, grudging facts, but in what it has done to Jayojit's father and mother. Again, the disclosures are scattered, but they are devastating. "In a strange way, they felt abandoned," Chaudhuri slips in at one point. Overweight and failing, the admiral has begun to take conscientious morning walks. He doesn't much want to live longer, but "he felt this need to see Jayojit through."
Most quiet and affecting is an aside about the parents' television habits. They had been addicted to soap opera romances. Then, during Jayojit's custody battles, they stopped watching. "They'd found they could no longer immerse themselves, or even find a center, however temporary, in a proxy existence." Holmes's dog that didn't bark illuminated a murder; the Chatterjees' unwatched TV illuminates a different death.

 One Drop of Blood
 The American
 Misadventure of Race. By Scott L. Malcomson.
 584 pp. New York:
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30. 
 ARE you really white? Are you really black? Would it offend you if I asked? In all likelihood, yes, even if upon reflection you would add, correctly, that it shouldn't matter. And, of course, like all couth readers of the Book Review, you are firmly of the view that race has no scientific basis. So why the unease and why the haste to change the subject?
Asking an American if he is really white is like asking him if he is really male, a question that could be mortally hazardous in many parts of this land. Despite all the talk within the academy of "hybridity" and "socially constructed identities," most citizens of this country view race as rooted in nature, like sex or age -- a marker of identity that you see in the mirror, in your family and in the people you encounter daily. The strangest thing about this conviction is that no other nation's history and culture more compellingly demonstrate the fluidity and sheer unnaturalness of racial identity.
Over the centuries America has made and remade the white and other so-called races with abandon. A century ago the Irish were not white but "Negroes turned inside out," while Negroes were "smoked Irish." The immigration act of 1921 was passed to keep the very different and "inferior" races of southern Europe, as well as Jews, from contaminating white people. Jews entered the Caucasian chalk circle only after World War II, Italians having squeaked in a little earlier, although many non-Italians continue to harbor doubts. And the nation's Census Bureau has had such a thoroughly bizarre history of racial categorization that recently, out of sheer conceptual and political exhaustion, it gave up and asked people to classify themselves in any and as many racial ways as the spirit moved them.
In the past decade or so a remarkable body of work within the academy has challenged our received notions about the formation of racial identity in America. Stimulated by the classic works on American racial history by Winthrop Jordan and Edmund Morgan, and by the turn in social theory toward the view that most of our cherished categories are not absolutes but conventions that change across time and place, a young group of scholars has generated some of the most exciting works of cultural and social history in recent times. The designation sometimes applied to these works -- whiteness studies" -- is an awful misnomer, not only because its implications are as critical for nonwhites as for whites, but because it refers to two very different kinds of scholarship. One school seeks to abolish whiteness, while the other seeks a politically acceptable way of expressing white pride and cultural distinctiveness that all too closely resembles that other white identity movement known as white supremacy.
Scott L. Malcomson falls firmly into the camp of the abolitionists, as the historian Noel Ignatiev calls them. And what the abolitionists have shown is that European settlers in the New World began to imagine themselves as "white" soon after their arrival on these shores. Over time, whiteness became a powerful, flexible means of uniting these otherwise disparate men and women, for it defined them against Native Americans, African slaves and, finally, against the group that was to become America's domesticated Other: African-Americans. The "one-drop rule" was the foundation of this process, and by the late 19th century it had become a virtual law of nature among white Americans. As Malcomson points out, "A little 'black blood' could make you black, but it took a great deal of 'white blood' to render a person white. . . . The sum of what you were not -- Indian, black, slave -- made you what you were." And it still does. The proposition that whiteness, as such, has no content but is rather a negation, the identity of not-being-black, is a shocking revelation to most white Americans, who continue to imagine that there is a nonracist way of defining their whiteness in positive terms, although they are tongue-tied when asked to say what it is. Were the nation ever to acknowledge this, the result would be a cultural revolution that would outdo the 1960's.
The great achievement of Malcomson's new book, "One Drop of Blood," is to harvest these insights from their academic greenhouses, make them accessible to the broader American public and move us toward a redemptive embrace of their wider implications. He seems to have been born for the role. A gifted if sometimes undisciplined writer, with an acute eye for paradox, he is as at home with the cultivation of ideas as the academics who have paved the way for him, but he is not bridled by their conventions. He is capable of absorbing and integrating vast quantities of knowledge from a wide range of sources, as his travel books on Central Asia and the South Pacific demonstrated. He is the perfect age for the task, a post-civil-rights baby blessed with genuinely liberal parents who could take the achievements of the 60's for granted rather than spend his life marveling at them. Growing up with Chinese and African-American friends in multiracial Oakland when its schools were still integrated, he emerged mercifully free of any need to ingratiate himself with nonwhites or to be unctuously oversensitive in his dealings with them.
The potential of this work, then, lies in Malcomson's refreshing insistence that race is not only a matter of equal concern to whites but that the African-American experience in all its richness is as deep and personal a matter to him -- a young white American determined to know his culture and himself -- as it is to the most soul-drenched African-American. Malcomson not only crosses but audaciously attempts to erase the border between insider and outsider perspectives on race. Few white intellectuals have gone this far. The consequences that follow from these assertions are explosive and exhilarating, for both Malcomson and his audience. But there are also dangers.
Malcomson's vision boldly embraces America's entire history of race. His explorations -- or rather, his jazzy, intensely reflective variations on the findings of others -- are organized into four parts, each tracing, from their origins to the present, the respective racial histories of Indians, African-Americans, white Americans and Oakland, Malcomson's hometown. Each of the first three parts is sandwiched between reports from the present, a technique that works awkwardly at best. (The account of Malcomson's sermon before a group of white-separatist Christian fundamentalists is particularly jarring: it strikes a false tone and stands out like a thick stroke of deadened color against the book's bright, finely wrought texture.)
A major theme of the book is racial separatism, as Malcomson traces the futile attempts by all three groups to "escape" race by building racially pure communities. Having lost their ancestral lands, Indians yearned for their own state, ending up today with homelands whose main economic hope lies in casinos patronized by white gamblers. Black separatism began with the nearly insane idea of colonization -- the return of blacks to Africa -- a notion rejected by the great majority of African-Americans but pursued by black nationalists like Marcus Garvey and often abetted by white purists, including Presidents Jefferson and Lincoln. Later, black separatism evolved into the hopeless call for a black state carved out of Western lands, an idea that still thrives in Afrocentrist fantasies. White separatism in the Jim Crow South was the most dangerous of all, since it was backed by force, and since it aimed to establish a pure white body politic in which a planter elite depended on an exploited class of black laborers.
The greatest irony of America's separatist history, Malcomson argues, is the fact that "the racial contest was over ideological or psychological materials that were remarkably similar and in many ways identical." At all periods of American history, "those preoccupied with racial destinies walked about in a forest of mirrors." No wonder, then, that Marcus Garvey developed close friendships with white separatists and that today white separatists often simply borrow from the rhetoric of black separatists, as black separatist leaders had previously done with their "defensive breastwork against whites."
Malcomson brings the tragedy of Indian-white relations to life not only in cogent commentaries on the Indians' resistance to encroachment on their lands, but through concise and vivid portrayals of the lives of early-19th-century Indians like the Cherokee leaders Elias Boudinot and John Ridge, who, after becoming the perfect models of assimilation, were used and betrayed by their white allies in the nearly genocidal forced removal of their people, and later assassinated as collaborators by angry Cherokee nationalists. And he highlights an aspect of this entanglement that modern multiculturalists would just as soon forget: that African-Americans, as slaves to both Indians and whites, quickly became the common Other in the perverse triangulation of race. Even today, many Indians, while accepting the thousands of whites who have suddenly decided "that their Indianness was, at some level, more precious than their whiteness," nonetheless wish to exclude Indians who look too black. There are no innocents in this horrible American misadventure, and this sometimes includes African-Americans who, when invited, did not hesitate to join genocidal assaults against the Indians.
Malcomson then turns to the invention of blackness in America, the ways in which African-Americans came to know and define themselves as a race apart. The later chapters of this section are the best part of the book. His searching commentaries on the separatist ideologies of African-American leaders like Martin R. Delany, Marcus Garvey and Booker T. Washington, on "the beautiful despair of the Harlem Renaissance," on the racial terror of the long decades between the 1920's and the 60's, and on the marvelous paradoxes of the civil rights movement are powerfully evocative, and carried through with an ardor and interpretive brilliance that rivals James Baldwin. This passage on the blues culture of ordinary African-Americans is typical: "It was not so much racially separate as independent of race, even antiracial. . . . Whiteness had to be kept contingent, alterable, part of history rather than of nature; blues, blackness, then, defended these qualities. Among other things, it kept alive in our shared culture a spirit of nonracial humanity."
The book begins to falter with the third, long section, on white America. Because the racial identities of Indians and African-Americans are so entangled, Malcomson has already revealed his best insights on the development of whiteness in the course of his earlier discussions. The section on whites is not only repetitive but, particularly in its treatment of minstrelsy, oddly dated, in light of outstanding recent work by Eric Lott, W. T. Lhamon and others. And when Malcomson has nothing new to say he tends to substitute literary preciosity for substance, a fault that nearly undid his two previous books. Groping for the lapidary and smartly paradoxical phrase, he sometimes misses genuine paradoxes. Thus, it is simply not true that the one-drop rule did the opposite of what it intended and that the "dream of racial essence . . . made the physical metaphysical." The real paradox here is that the one-drop rule succeeded all too well, so much so that its most devoted adherents today are African-Americans, in spite of its devastating role in their own history of exclusion.
The last section, on Oakland, is really an autobiographical fragment, and the book would have been better without it. It is strange indeed that the closer Malcomson gets to his own world and his own whiteness, the more abstruse and elliptical he becomes. He recalls with sadness the sudden falling away of his African-American friends as he moves through high school and the fact that the "black friends I had had were friends rather than black; now they were shifting to being black rather than friends." Why did this happen? Suddenly the whole purpose of the book seems to pivot on the answer to just this question, a bad move. We have been taken on a tour of America's entire racial history in preparation for this moment: understanding why this particular white soul, with the most humane and unprejudiced of parents and the most integrated public education that America has to offer, lost all his black friends with the nset of puberty. His answer: "I honestly don't understand why."
This is maddening. How can Malcomson speak so perceptively and eloquently about the inner griefs and outward tragedies of Native Americans and African-Americans from the dawn of the nation's history, yet be void of insight about the subject on which he should be the greatest authority: his own racial past? Among other problems, it casts some doubt on the authenticity of what has gone before. Still, I am prepared to grant him the benefit of that doubt. For all its flaws this work remains a valuable contribution. Where it succeeds, it succeeds astonishingly well, and Malcomson has set a new standard of open, honest dialogue on race in America, especially that between Euro- and African-Americans. And where it fails, it fails trying hard to clear a path toward a place that few white Americans have ever cared to know.

 BODY:

MR. WROE'S VIRGINS, by Jane Rogers. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) This fact-based novel tells of the self-proclaimed prophet John Wroe (1782-1863), who persuaded his congregation to give him seven virgins for "comfort and succor" as servants in his Lancashire mansion. "Rogers has conjured an engaging, serious and gleefully ironic novel, one that leaps headlong into the most ambitious and risky territories: faith, love and existential meaning," Kathryn Harrison wrote here last year.
 
THE BLACK ROOM AT LONGWOOD: Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena, by Jean-Paul Kauffmann. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $14.95.) A French magazine writer, recording a week spent in Napoleon's final home, provides an elegant, obsessive meditation on the impoverished reality of captivity. "Kauffmann's bittersweet book is an inquiry into the mechanics of remembrance and regret," W. S. Di Piero said here in 1999. "What he finds at Longwood is a rotting diorama, a monument to time as torture."
 
THE TINY ONE, by Eliza Minot. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) Via Revere, this novel's precocious 8-year-old narrator, displays a variety of voices, from childlike to teenage to nearly grown-up, as she recalls in minute detail the events surrounding her mother's death in a car accident. "Minot has a sharp eye, a great ear and a terrific memory," Jeffrey Eugenides wrote here last year.
 
GOTHAM: A History of New York City to 1898, by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace. (Oxford University, $24.95.) Two history professors at the City University of New York march from prehistory to the Dutch settlement to the consolidation of the boroughs. Their huge narrative, crammed with facts and oddities, won a Pulitzer Prize. "Burrows and Wallace offer a large-canvas portrait of a city they clearly love," Clyde Haberman wrote here in 1998.
 
GAP CREEK, by Robert Morgan. (Scribner, $13.) Set in the North Carolina back country at the turn of the century, this novel features penniless characters repeatedly stung by bad luck as they care for their ill and go about the backbreaking physical labor that allows them to survive the winter. "At their finest," Dwight Garner said here last year, Morgan's "stripped-down and almost primitive sentences burn with the raw, lonesome pathos of Hank Williams's best songs." Scribner has also reissued The Blue Valleys: A Collection of Stories ($11), in which Morgan explores the hardscrabble lives of working folks in the Blue Ridge Mountains from Civil War times to the present. The result is "a procession of tales rich with native detail and character, told in language as plain and deep as the hills," Joanne Kennedy wrote in these pages in 1989.
 
CRUDDY: An Illustrated Novel, by Lynda Barry. (Scribner, $12.) Roberta Rohbeson is a 16-year-old girl whose ghastly home life and cross-country trip with her father, an unemployed meatcutter who goes berserk, leads her to the brink of suicide. "The author's ability to capture the paralyzing bleakness of despair, and her uncanny ear for dialogue, make this first novel a work of terrible beauty," Alanna Nash wrote here last year.
 
MY MOVIE BUSINESS: A Memoir, by John Irving. (Ballantine, $12.95.) In recounting his personal history of seeing his novels made -- or not made -- into movies, the author of "The Cider House Rules" (which won the author an Oscar for best adapted screenplay) explains how turning a book into a film involves a long series of compromises that a writer tries to make artistically valid. "The book digresses charmingly and effortlessly into related subjects," William Boyd wrote here last year. "His tone throughout . . . is measured and genial."
 
STRANGE BEAUTY: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics, by George Johnson. (Vintage, $15.) This balanced biography portrays the Nobel Prize-winning scientist as a brilliant but tormented man who dominated elementary particle physics in the heady 1950's and 60's. "He appears as a flawed, almost Shakespearean hero," Louis A. Bloomfield said here in 1999. "Johnson does a wonderful job of describing the competition and cooperation among scientists, the egos and insecurities, the disappointments and triumphs."
 
TO SEE AND SEE AGAIN: A Life in Iran and America, by Tara Bahrampour. (University of California, $17.95.) The daughter of an American mother and Iranian father describes her Westernized childhood in Tehran and her life as an exile after the fall of the shah. Last year our reviewer, Adrienne Edgar, called this "a fascinating, often moving, account of her life on the boundary between two very different cultures." Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Is The Choice Between These Two Guys Worth 10 Million?

BYLINE: By James Bennet; James Bennet is a staff writer for The Times Magazine. This year, among other articles, he has written about the campaigns of Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

 BODY:
In the hills over Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, it was possible for a moment to believe that Republican Congressman James Rogan and Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff did not loathe each other. They were opponents in what was shaping up as the most expensive Congressional race in the history of the republic -- and one of the fiercest -- and yet there they were chatting amiably in the morning sunshine near the convertibles that would carry them in the day's first parade, two suburban white guys trading updates on their kids.
My attention wandered to the blonde perched nearby in a red Cadillac convertible. And froze there. "Do you know Susan?" Rogan asked without enthusiasm. Yes, it was she. Susan Carpenter-McMillan -- once the spokeswoman for Paula Jones and now a candidate for a California State Assembly seat -- was as vehement as ever as she alighted from her car. Had I heard, she wondered in that scratchy, unconquerable voice of hers, what it was that everyone said about her and Jim Rogan? And I thought, Together -- she as a Valkyrie for Jones and he as an impeachment prosecutor on the floor of the Senate -- they almost toppled the president of the United States? No! The correct answer was weird hair. "They always ask if Jim's hair is a toupee!" she said, laughing raucously. "And they always make fun of my hairspray!" 
 A few moments later, when I caught up with Rogan, he was speaking quietly with an elegantly dressed silver-haired man. I stood to the side, near a six-foot neon-yellow Pikachu and a portly green Power Ranger who were observing the congressman as they awaited their turns in the parade. They did not seem much impressed. "It's all fund-raising," Pikachu informed the Ranger.
That sure seemed to be the case. Because Rogan's impeachment crusade made him vulnerable in this increasingly Democratic district and because this was one of a few close races that would determine which party controlled the House, the Rogan-Schiff contest already looked like the politico ad absurdum of our times, when fund-raising records are tumbling at every level of national government and even a State Assembly seat can run upward of a million dollars. For more than a year, Schiff and Rogan had been working the phones, the mail and the rubber sea-bass circuit, raking in millions from across the country. Where some saw wretched excess, others saw opportunity. With more than 50 candidates raising more than $1 million by midsummer, House races like this one were drawing the kind of professional political consultants you used to find only at the national level. And those consultants were finding plenty of ways to spend the money. Already by July 4, 22 House candidates had spent more than $1 million apiece. The most bruising part of the campaign lay ahead, but the two candidates in California's 27th Congressional District had already spent $5,325,855.25 -- and figured to spend perhaps another $5 million before it was over. All for one House seat, just one, out of 435.
As the parade started, Rogan and Schiff took their places ahead of the firemen, the two little gymnasts on the skittish white horse and the inexplicable guy in the gorilla mask riding on a pickup's hood. The candidates' cars made a slow serpentine between the sidewalks, down Foothill Boulevard in the suburb of Sunland-Tujunga. Legs over the convertibles' back seats, the candidates sat out in the open, waving and making remarks, each after his own fashion. Schiff, the Democrat, stuck to wishing people a happy Independence Day and a nice weekend. Rogan, the Republican, joked about horse droppings. His constituents freely shared their own views. "Get a new rug!" one man hollered at Rogan.
 
Making The Dough Rise
Matt Keelen, a 30-year-old Rogan consultant, grew up around politics and the dining trade, which together with his easygoing manner and entrepreneurial drive may explain his choice of profession. Keelen's father had been mayor in his hometown of Keansburg on the New Jersey Shore, and his parents owned sports bars. They were Democrats, but Keelen came of age at a time of national Republican excitement and Democratic malaise. He also came of age when a career in the business of politics had acquired some of the same professional gravity as a career in medicine or law.
After college, Keelen headed to Washington, where he hoped to work on Capitol Hill. Instead, he found work making fund-raising calls and earned a few extra dollars tending bar. At night, he studied toward a master's degree from the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. He was not, and is not, cynical about his chosen field. "I was raised believing you could do good in politics," he said. Just as other students ground away at Chaucer or organic chemistry, Keelen studied developing a message, raising money and the work he most enjoyed, making ads. Admen are the celebrities of the political trade, overpaid by candidates and hyped by reporters as puissant lizards of Oz. But those jobs are hard to come by.
Keelen's work, meanwhile, soon took him to the political action committee, or PAC, for the National Restaurant Association and then to a fund-raising firm. In December 1997, he hung out his own shingle as a political specialist. He went into business as a PAC fund-raiser, that is, a consultant dedicated to raising money from the political organizations (of labor, business and other groups) dedicated to dispensing it. He would make the calls, engineer the meetings, build the friendships that Republican House candidates could cash in on -- for a retainer, an event fee or a commission of 10 percent or so, after expenses. In 1997, he landed Jim Rogan's account by promising to raise $40,000 for him in about 10 days and delivering. Keelen doesn't believe in just serving wine and cubed cheese. He takes PAC directors to a ballgame or serves them a meal. He is his parents' son. He eventually raised more than $650,000 for Rogan before the '98 election.
These days, Keelen employs five people and works for 25 House candidates. But he is starry-eyed when it comes to Rogan -- I'd do anything for Jim," he told me -- and he went right back to the PAC's for him after he won in 1998. Keelen was one of the first people employed for the 2000 campaign.
Raising money was the earliest, highest priority of both campaigns. Schiff hired two fund-raisers before he hired a campaign manager. He had to employ a "call time" aide in Sacramento and secure a space and telephone there so that he could squeeze in calls to donors between his legislative duties. Ted Osthelder, Schiff's campaign manager, had, like many Democratic operatives, studied finance techniques with Emily's List, a political network for Democratic women. In its methodical primer, "Making the Dough Rise," Emily's List breaks down potential donors into four "circles," starting in close with "family" and progressing out through "power," meaning those who see some financial or other benefit in the candidate's election. PAC's tend to fit in the power circle. To reach them, Schiff early this year hired a PAC fund-raiser in Washington, Tom Erickson.
Some PAC's, like that of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, were able to pony up the maximum legal contribution of $10,000 to Schiff, but his average PAC donation has been closer to $1,700. (Rogan's has been about $1,000.) It has taken a lot of effort to accumulate hundreds of thousands of these dollars. Schiff, the unknown challenger, has had to spend more time calling on friendly PAC directors. Rogan, the incumbent, has been able to hold more events for groups of PAC directors. Keelen, who has found himself eating three lunches in a day that also includes breakfast and dinner events for his candidates, marvels that he does not weigh 500 pounds.
For all that work, PAC's have supplied less than 20 percent of the candidates' funds. Most of their money has come from individuals, as it does for most House candidates. Oliver Stone sent money to Rogan, while Barbra Streisand lent her name to a brunch for Schiff. John McCain raised $70,000 with a speech for Rogan, and Bill Clinton pulled in $225,000 for Schiff during just one dinner in D.C. Each candidate has also dialed for dollars thousands of times. As Keelen puts it with apt redundancy, "Fund-raising is a long, tedious, boring process."
The record for spending in a House contest is $8.9 million, set in Newt Gingrich's race in 1996 -- the same year Rogan was first elected to Congress. By the end of September, Rogan had raised $5.8 million and Schiff had raised $3.6 million. In the end, the race is likely to cost more than $10 million. Yet here is a surprise about the emphasis both Rogan and Schiff placed on fund-raising: neither man found that he had to spend more time doing it than he had in the past. That is, for all the muscle they have put into shaking the money tree, for all the cash that has fallen down, the chore has not struck either man as more onerous than usual. "It's an interesting paradox," Rogan mused over lunch one day. "I spent probably 10 times more time trying to raise $400,000 for a State Assembly race than I've spent raising $4 million for this House race."
But it's not a paradox at all. Thanks to the bandwagon effect of political finance, the more money you raise, the more money you raise; this explains why the parties are so eager to boast about revoltingly high-dollar events. Further, thanks to the scare tactics of political finance, the more money your opponent raises, the more money you raise, provided you are competitive to begin with.
The trump card of the PAC fund-raisers has had nothing to do with the district's dreams or the candidates' records. Keelen has simply reminded wavering donors that there are only a handful of Congressional races this close, and that the first vote cast by the new congressman will be for either Speaker Hastert or Speaker Gephardt.
 
Is Spending, Not Fund-Raising, The Real Campaign Scandal?
We have had several years now of dark warnings about the quids pro quo fat-cat contributors get for their donations. But, in a more literal sense, it is not clear that donors ever really know what they are getting for their money when it comes to the campaigns themselves. Campaign-finance watchdogs are much more interested in getting than spending. Yet it is the spending that starts the money chase -- spending on consultants, TV ads and receptions to raise more money. Three thousand miles from the palmy, sunbaked towns of Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank and San Marino that he represents, Jim Rogan stopped by an elegant bar in Philadelphia, on the margin of last summer's Republican National Convention, for a fund-raiser that was unique, and uniquely circular: it was held for him by a business that has absorbed the lion's share of the money that has been raised for his campaign, in the course of raising that very money. The firm is the Lukens Cook Company, a direct-mail consultancy. "Ever dollar is going to count," Walter Lukens told me.
One of the most expensive things a campaign does is to raise money. It may cost untold amounts of the candidate's time and dignity, but it costs quantifiable amounts of hard cash. Typically, a campaign spends up to one of every five dollars in the pursuit of more. Rogan and Schiff have spent more than that, however, because they have relied on direct mail. They have done extensive national "prospecting" for donors. That means they have rented mailing lists from other candidates and companies for thousands of dollars and then sent out, say, a million appeals at an average cost of 45 cents to 60 cents each.
This mail tends to go to the circle of donors that Emily's List calls "Ax to Grind" -- people who couldn't care less about little old ladies in Pasadena but who are generically furious at, alternatively, righties or lefties. Each candidate has trumpeted how much the bad guys are helping his opponent, thereby bringing in not only money for himself but also fresh bogeymen for that opponent. "My opponent has received generous contributions from billionaire Hollywood movie moguls David Geffen and Steven Spielberg," read a plea from Rogan, mailed with a signed picture of him and Henry Hyde. A Schiff appeal signed by Norman Lear warned, "Right-wing funders are planning to pour more than $2 million into Jim Rogan's campaign."
The cost of such direct mail is staggering. In 1999, Rogan spent at least $1.4 million, two-thirds of his total campaign expenses that year, on direct mail. To stay competitive, Schiff got into the act this year. In the first six months, he put more than $715,000 into direct mail, more than half his spending during the period.
A candidate is lucky to break even on such a mass mailing. But those who do respond, Lukens said as we stood at the bar, will probably contribute again. They enjoy receiving updates on the campaign, together with the inevitable pledge envelope. "It's like letters from camp," he said. To keep donors feeling generous, Rogan's appeals, like solicitations for aid for hungry children, are specific about what a contribution can buy. The letters assume an astonishing degree of literacy about political mechanics and acceptance of that literacy as part of American life. "It costs us $133 to run two 30-second cable ads," read one Rogan letter. "To reach minimum saturation on cable, we have to run 600 ads a week at a weekly cost of $40,000."
From his extensive direct-mail appeals, Rogan has "acquired," as they say in the trade, a base of at least 50,000 donors. Schiff's base is closer to 30,000. These people will respond to plea after plea, often sending $30 to $50. Some will contribute till they hit the legal limit of $2,000 for the primary and general election.
As long as it turns a profit, such fund-raising is worthwhile. A fund-raiser like Keelen or Lukens is the most obviously efficient campaign worker. As Keelen argues, a good fund-raiser should more than cover his month's wages with a day's work. That cannot be said for other consultants.
In California these days, even candidates running to represent water districts hire consultants, to the amazement of old-timers like Joe Cerrell, a Los Angeles political consultant who is chairman emeritus of the American Association of Political Consultants. As campaigns become more costly, Cerrell said, candidates are willing to run fewer risks of shoddy work, and so they hire more consultants. That makes campaigns more costly still.
Even by contemporary standards, the Rogan-Schiff matchup is something new, and Cerrell has taken to calling it "the consultant full employment act." Besides his small campaign staff and apart from consultants hired for isolated tasks, Rogan employs a chief consultant, a media consultant, a pollster, a direct-mail house, a telemarketing firm, an accounting firm, a fund-raising consultant in California and Keelen.
Schiff, who has raised and spent less, has a similar but smaller roster, including Erickson. But having one consultant in Washington can mean you need another. The Schiff team conceives of itself as running two campaigns. The second one, the "D.C. campaign," is mostly about buzz and fund-raising -- about keeping the candidate's profile high enough and his chances rosy enough to guarantee PAC contributions and assistance from the national party. The two benefits are related, since the most important message the D.C. campaign can deliver is that the candidate is a top prospect of the national party. Erickson's office is just steps away from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.
PAC directors demand detailed, inside information. So campaigns often hire pollsters based in Washington rather than in their districts. "One of the things a PAC wants to know is who's on your team," Erickson explained. They are more impressed by names they know. "If Mark Mellman or Fred Yang calls, 'O.K., we'll see what we can do,"' he said, referring to two Washington pollsters. "But if someone from Northwestern University calls, you know, 'Who the hell are you?"' Unsurprisingly, Schiff has a respected Washington-based pollster, Diane Feldman, with a track record in California races.
 
Campaign Ads: Who Cares?
Over whiskey and gin and above the roar of a bar, two old friends, two young politicos, were catching up on a Saturday night in Philadelphia as the Republican National Convention got under way. Since their days as lackeys together on the Dole campaign, one of them had found his way into the dazzling lights of a presidential campaign; the other was getting less exposure but more overall responsibility by following a different route, through House politics.
"You try to say one clever thing and you offend every religious group!" Todd Harris, John McCain's spokesman, volleyed over the din to Jason Roe, Rogan's brash campaign manager.
Roe grinned. "There are plenty of religious groups left to offend," he replied patiently. He had committed that particular gaffe weeks ago -- months, in campaign time -- and he could joke about it now.
"That's right," snorted Harris. "The Hare Krishnas."
For Harris, the campaign was winding down; for Roe, the toughest period lay ahead. The Rogan campaign was facing some tactical questions. The candidate was getting pounded with commercials paid for by the Democrats, and his own spots did not seem to be doing him much good. Like Rogan, Roe was disappointed that George W. Bush had not picked McCain, who remained popular in California, as his running mate. If he had, Roe thought, the race would be over.
Roe is a compact man with a jet-black goatee and a sharp wit -- sometimes, like his candidates, too sharp. In his office, he keeps a poster of Richard Nixon, a picture of Anna Kournikova and tapes of his beloved Simpsons. He has posted a picture of his candidate in which the Judge -- as Roe likes to call Rogan -- is making bunny ears with his fingers behind Roe's head. Like Keelen, Roe is 30, and like Keelen, he grew up around politics -- his father was an executive director of the Michigan Republican Party -- and decided to make it his career.
In California races, most big strategic decisions get made by a chief consultant, an old hand who works for several candidates. It is the campaign manager who devotes every waking hour to making the trains run on time. Schiff's campaign was also being managed by an itinerant, goateed pro, Osthelder, a 32-year-old Wisconsin operative who had worked on campaigns there, in Michigan and in Indiana.
By the convention, Rogan had already spent an awful lot of money. After advertising before the primary early this spring, he began again in early May, at a clip of $40,000 a week; some of that money went to pay the commission of the consultant who purchased the ad time. The commercials were tough on Schiff but not always helpful to Rogan. Some commercials were just sloppy, featuring misspelled words.
On the one hand, Roe was happy with what the advertising had accomplished. He had studied Parke Skelton, Schiff's general consultant, and knew he liked to hoard cash until a campaign's last days. Rogan's early advertising, as intended, had forced Schiff to spend money on commercials of his own. In other words, the Rogan campaign was spending some of the money it raised to force the opponent to spend some of the money he raised.
The problem was that the commercials did not seem to be having much effect beyond that. The campaign finally yanked them and "went dark" for about three weeks in August, to the bafflement of the Schiff camp. As he weighed what to do, Rogan had to consider the incentives of his consultants. "We have one guy who makes his money on TV and another guy who makes his money on mail, and of course they both think what they do is most important," Roe said.
Roe was also starting to worry about the outside groups who were pouring money into the race. This year, all records are being broken by groups using hundreds of millions of dollars in largely unregulated money to wage "issue advocacy" campaigns that praise or trash candidates but stay within the elastic campaign finance laws by not calling outright for someone's election or defeat. This kind of flyby politicking terrifies candidates, who have no control over who will attack them when or for what. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been pounding Rogan for almost a month, and the American Federation of Labor had joined in. No Republican group had come to Rogan's rescue. "For three or four weeks now, I've been having people tell me, 'I'm hearing this rumor; it's coming soon,"' Roe told me. "I don't know if they're shining me on or not." They were. The National Republican Congressional Committee did not start advertising for Rogan, by attacking Schiff, until after Labor Day.
Yet Roe harbored doubts about the effectiveness of any of this advertising. For all the money raised for this race, no one could afford to buy broadcast television or much radio time in the Los Angeles media market. The advertising was relegated to cable television -- which almost a quarter of the voters in the district did not have, according to Rogan's polling. Others did not watch the channels like CNN where many of the commercials ran. Those who did watch the news channels tended to be political junkies, whose minds were already made up. There were so few undecided voters left in the district already that Roe saw the two campaigns as fighting over maybe 20,000 or 30,000 votes out of 10 times that many. A couple of weeks after the campaign went dark, when it convened two focus groups of a dozen voters, not a single one could remember a Rogan commercial.
Everyone kept right on buying advertising time. It may be the need to spend that drives fund-raising in the first place, but once a campaign raises enough money, that relationship can be reversed. A few weeks later, when I asked Jim Nygren, Rogan's chief strategist, why the campaign began to advertise so early, he answered, "Fundamentally, because we had the budget to do it." It was late August, and Nygren, who runs the direct-mail operation, had just hired a new adman. "We have an enormous budget," he said, "so we hired someone good." Nygren is a veteran of California politics, but he seemed dazed by the resources at his disposal. He returned to that subject repeatedly. "We have a huge operation," he said.
Before I saw Nygren, I had paid a visit to Parke Skelton, Schiff's general consultant, in his cluttered office a block north of Hollywood and Vine. In keeping with his routine, Skelton greeted me by complaining that I was wasting his time. It was the week of the Democratic convention, and he had a stack of messages from news organizations like The Boston Globe and The Providence Journal-Bulletin. "Don't their cities have their own politics?" he asked. The good-natured grousing was intended to make a point: to Skelton and Schiff, press from outside the district was of little value at this late date, when the D.C. campaign was going well and the national donor network was established. Such coverage, like the convention itself, was a distraction.
That kind of discipline is a hallmark of the Schiff campaign. Skelton, who creates the "persuasion mail," produces the television commercials, spins the press and buys the television time, is earning a flat fee of $100,000 for 16 months' work on the race, one of several he is handling. He does not take commissions. "If I tell a candidate that our tracking shows he needs to take another mortgage on his house to pay for a direct mail," Skelton said, "I don't want him thinking, 'Parke's getting 15 percent of my mortgage."'
Skelton sees the campaign as a series of city-council races. Schiff spent less than $6,000 on advertising before the primary on March 7, all of it for Armenian-language cable channels to reach one swing minority group. The Armenian advertising had worked like a charm, Skelton said. But in general, he, like Nygren, prefers to rely on the mail. Each campaign pored over the voter registry, divvying up the population by party, by voting history and by ethnic surname. The Rogan campaign, for example, found 16,000 voters it believed were of Armenian origin by searching for names ending in ian or yan. Such households received customized messages, sometimes misleading ones, from each campaign. Those less costly letters, keyed to the diversity of the district, are likely to be more powerful than the one-size-fits-all advertisements. The Schiff campaign's internal polling in August found that fewer than one in three likely voters could even remember seeing a Schiff ad. The good news for Schiff was that the same poll found that Rogan's commercials seemed to be backfiring. "I'm running out of ideas on how to spend the money we're raising," said Skelton, reflecting the same amazement as Nygren. "I may start running Rogan's ads for him."
As we drove through the district one afternoon last month, Roe said that after direct mail, his most effective tool was not advertising but "voter contact" by volunteers or the candidate. That meant nothing to the consultants, he added. "None of them are making money off it."
There is a suspicion about all this getting and spending that is shared by members of both campaign teams. It is that an arms race is under way in California's 27th Congressional District, one that preserves the political status quo even as it darkens the political environment. I raised that notion with Keelen, the fund-raiser, in late September. "It would be interesting to see if they ran just on message and each was given a quarter of a million bucks," he replied. He paused for a moment, considering. "It probably wouldn't be much different," he said at last. The reason is that, in here somewhere, there are actual candidates with opinions, and there are actual voters with opinions of their own.
 
Is All Politics National?
It's been decades since a Democrat last left for Congress from the 27th Congressional District. To the mavens in Washington, the seat seemed safe for the Republicans. But then Congress took upon itself the task of determining whether President Clinton had dallied with an intern and lied about it. And James Rogan, member of the House Judiciary Committee, former judge and prosecutor, rose like a plump trout to the occasion, with his characteristic sense of history and his own place in it.
This summer, a reunion of sorts took place in a judge's chambers inside the Pasadena Superior Courthouse, where Rogan once argued and decided cases. Half a dozen members of the House Judiciary Committee, former managers all, gathered to hold a hearing on methamphetamines and to lend support to the only manager whose seat was in danger. Here, in private, the men had the towel-snapping camaraderie of aging high-school jocks.
"Chris, we're going to run you down to Hollywood, let you spout off to all the leftists," Rogan said.
Chris Cannon looked up from the judge's desk, where he was signing a stack of the posters of the House impeachment team that Rogan likes to give donors. "Why don't you send me somewhere where I can get you some votes?" he asked.
Like the posters, the subject of impeachment was nowhere in evidence when the hearing started. "This is a tribute to Jim Rogan," Asa Hutchinson said in opening it, "the respect we have for him, and the problem of methamphetamines."
The hearing was also a tribute to the advantages of incumbency and to the shadowy role impeachment is playing in our politics. After scrambling the government and transfixing the news media, impeachment has become a nationally shared secret, the new race politics -- spoken of candidly in private but more often in code in public. Impeachment, per se, did not even come up during the candidates' first face-off, in mid-September. But it was impeachment that started the laughter when Rogan declared that he was proud of "yes, at times, even working with a Democratic president."
Both sides have used the issue in their national fund-raising, and it has driven up the price tag of this seat. But each would prefer that the other bring it up in the district. "People got so sick of the whole impeachment thing that the voters will punish whichever campaign puts it in front of their face," Skelton said. Schiff's campaign is afraid of making Rogan sympathetic, a principled martyr, by attacking him directly.
Rogan hopes to salvage something by presenting himself as doing what's right, regardless of the politics. He even inserted the I-word into a commercial, couching it so that it sounded like a response to a Schiff attack. But he gave me much the same analysis as Skelton of impeachment's role. "What my advisers want me to tell you and all of your brothers is that, 'Oh, that's not an issue,"' he said over lunch one day at a favorite spot, California Pizza Kitchen. The reality, he said, was that because of impeachment, some people would support him no matter what and others would vote against him just as passionately. "And there's an awful lot of people on the other side," he added, jabbing his butter knife at me.
With his severe features and odd, monkish cap of hair, Rogan projected an image during impeachment of a waspish inquisitor with the hubris to lecture even the august Senate on its duties. But the reality of Jim Rogan is more interesting, just as his political predicament is much too complex to be chalked up to impeachment.
In an age of doggedly temperate politicians, there is something raw and reckless about Rogan, a onetime Democrat turned conservative Republican. The stories he tells are not anodyne; they tend to be about things like slugging a childhood friend when he caught him shooting up and about visiting his mother in a halfway house after she was jailed for welfare fraud.
In Jim Rogan's company, you are apt to meet people like Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, the guitarist, who rushed up to embrace the congressman after Rogan sneaked me onto the floor of the Republican National Convention. Rogan wheeled Baxter around, arm over his shoulders, and introduced him as an expert on weaponry and a guitarist years ago for the Doobie Brothers. "But most importantly," Rogan concluded, "at the Palomino Club, where Jim Rogan was bartender, he was in the house band." Baxter described a party he recently played that involved "a midget Elvis and a midget stripper." Rogan replied with a lengthy story from his Palomino days involving an immensely fat Elvis and a sweat-soaked rag.
For all the rough and tumble of his childhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, Rogan, who is 43, described himself at various times as a bookish, chubby boy who was painfully shy, who took passionate refuge in following politics and collecting its tangible symbols. He is a nationally known collector of political memorabilia, like that stolen seal from the '68 convention. When he was about 12, Rogan waited outside a reception for Gov. Ronald Reagan. He talked Reagan into signing and handing over the eight note cards he had used for his speech. When Rogan needed money to help pay his law-school tuition, he reluctantly sold Cards 2 through 8 for $1,500. It was those cards, he explained to me eagerly, that enabled him to become a lawyer, and then a judge, and then a congressman, and then a member of the House Judiciary Committee weighing the impeachment of a president. Shortly before the impeachment vote in the House, he saw the cards in a memorabilia catalog, bought them and donated the lot to the Reagan Library. "It's a great story, isn't it?" he asked.
As a politician, Rogan views himself as destined. But as a congressman, he is probably doomed, if not in this election then in the next, and it is local circumstances and not impeachment or even the high-tech witchery of a modern campaign that are weaving that fate. His own advisers say that when the state's Congressional seats are reapportioned next year, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature needs barely to tinker with the district's boundaries to give the Democrats a lock. Already, the electoral ground is shifting beneath Rogan's feet. "It's staggering to me as a native to watch what's happened here," said Jim Hayes, the president of Political Data, a company that tracks California voters and is based in the district.
Older white voters have died or moved away, and as is happening in suburbs across the country, immigrants have moved in -- Latinos, Filipinos, Chinese. The district has the biggest concentration of people of Armenian origin in the United States. Another change was evident when I drove with Hayes to pick up some data: we passed the propped-up facade of an Old West town, as Hayes reminisced about seeing Sela Ward walk past. Hayes uses the computers on the Warner Brothers lot. More Hollywood operations, like DreamWorks SKG, are locating offices in Burbank and Glendale, bringing Democratic union workers with them. These days, the district is 44 percent Democratic, 37 percent Republican.
That change was under way the first two times Rogan ran. By this election cycle, the opportunity was too fat to miss, and Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, recruited the strongest candidate he could find, a Democrat who could have been cast on the Warner Brothers lot itself.
Adam Schiff is the anti-Rogan. Like Rogan, Schiff is a devoted family man and a prosecutor-turned-politician, but that is about where the meaningful similarities end. Schiff was born in Framingham, Mass., near Boston, and educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School. While Rogan is all unsanded edges, Schiff is placid and baby-faced and looks younger than his 40 years. His own advisers joke about his lack of charisma, but they marvel at what a dogged campaigner he is -- an animal," in the frequent tribute of one of his aides.
Rogan is jumpy and combative; Schiff, relentlessly unobjectionable and cautious. Ask Rogan what members of Congress he admires, and he won't stop talking. Ask Schiff, and he will name just one, Sam Nunn, the centrist former senator from Georgia who left in 1996. Ask him for more examples, as I did, and he will name just one: Sam Nunn. Adam Schiff, like Bill Clinton, talks about "challenges," not "problems." He wears an American flag tie. He curbs his tires.
While Rogan's voice is urgent, Schiff speaks in the sonorous tones of a man dispensing gardening tips on public radio. His manner is so mild that you hardly notice how smart and tough he can be. Rogan likes to talk about himself; Schiff talks about his constituents and gets excited when the subject is the possible curfew at the Burbank airport or the expansion of the 710 Freeway through South Pasadena, issues he has labored at as a state senator. It is not surprising to learn that he is for the curfew, against the expansion.
Schiff fits an emerging mold of politician, post-Gingrich and even post-Clinton, a type whose traits are exemplified in turns by George W. Bush and Al Gore. When it comes to politics, they are sophisticated enough, like Bush, not to talk much about how sophisticated they are; they deliver the good news with a grin, the attacks almost as amiably and the bad news rarely, if at all. When it comes to policy, they are mechanics, like Gore, rather than architects; they present themselves as unglamorous, hard-working public servants, on contract for a job. At the Congressional level, their watchwords are bipartisanship and constituent service, and they mean both.
In all his criticisms of Rogan, Schiff returns to the idea that he does not represent the district, in its beliefs or its needs. Schiff -- who is pro-choice but not pro-abortion, pro-gun-control but not anti-gun, pro-labor and also pro-business, deeply worried about health care and the schools and able to speak a little Armenian when the occasion demands -- is probably more in tune with more voters. Schiff repeatedly gave me the same definition of a congressman's role: "This is fundamentally a service job," he said.
Rogan has a loftier conception, and he flashed some anger when I asked if a congressman should not be more careful to hew to his constituents' beliefs. "If my job was merely limited to taking a poll of my constituents' views, that would not only go against the fundamental role of representative democracy; it could lead to tyranny," he said as we drove through Pasadena. "I thought a lot about that going through impeachment. There are 700,000 people in this district, all with an opinion. There's only one of them that takes an oath to defend the Constitution. I didn't take an oath to represent the majority in my district."
But over the last several months, through campaign move and countermove, Rogan has found himself struggling to adapt his messages to most voters' concerns. Since the early attack advertising was not working, he tried changing his spots. His first positive commercial presented Rogan as a family man seeking prescription drug coverage for seniors, H.M.O. reform and a juvenile Brady Bill -- that is, it presented Jim Rogan as Adam Schiff. The self-styled maverick had been driven by polls to adopt the issues, if not the precise stands, that Bill Clinton and the Democrats championed.
 
What Money Cannot Buy
In June, I happened to be across the country from Rogan's district, outside of Scranton, Pa., for a special election for a State Assembly seat. With redistricting approaching and control of the State Assembly teetering, both parties had poured money into the race. The candidates combined to spend more than $1.5 million dollars. The Democrat won with a total -- a grand total -- of 8,791 votes. He had the privilege of serving for eight days. That was all the time left in the legislative session. Then he returned home to campaign against the same Republican.
Something crazy is happening in American politics. It is compounded of competitiveness, consultant specialization, a corrupted campaign-finance system, the maturation of polling and advertising technology and a surfeit of careless contributions in a booming economy.
Yet no candidate, at least no candidate in a close race, can abandon the old ways and the accountability to constituents that they bring. Evidence of this can be found in the Sisyphean life of Jim Rogan. The permanent campaign, promulgated by Clinton at the presidential level, has long been a fact of life in marginal House districts. As Rogan told me once, there is no such thing as a noncampaign day.
Rogan has never seen the fireworks in the capital on the Fourth of July, though he longs to. He has never gone scuba diving on some cushy foreign junket, like his colleagues in safe seats. The only overseas trip he has made in his life was to Armenia, for obvious reasons. "Sometimes you feel like a hamster on a wheel," he said during one long day. He misses his wife and kids at home in Arlington on the lonely weekends he spends in his rented apartment in Burbank. The job, he said, was worth it. But not by much.
That day included more than two hours of taping for campaign commercials at an Armenian school. But it also included the kind of events that keep a politician in touch. It started at 7:30 with a school district's citizen oversight committee meeting, followed by a fund-raiser with local telecommunications executives, a meeting with Burbank city-council members, the hearing on methamphetamines and, that evening, a brief sit-down at a restaurant with Philippine-American leaders, who were disappointed that Rogan did not stay for dinner. "Is this my jacket?" he muttered to himself, befuddled by the fit of his own clothes as, grizzled and pale, he stood to rush to the airport for a red-eye flight to Washington.
Try as he might, Rogan cannot show up as often or stay as long as Schiff, who commutes daily to Sacramento. Schiff's State Senate district encompasses the Congressional district, and he is a familiar presence. "I know, I met you before," said a woman in Burbank when Schiff knocked on her door to introduce himself early one evening this summer. "When's our work going to pick up? Remember, you and I talked about that before."
"That's right," Schiff said, not entirely convincingly. "Now I remember." In this tight race, no candidate or outside group wants to cut a corner, since that extra consultant or extra commercial may move just enough voters. But that same concern keeps Jim Rogan taking red-eye flights and Adam Schiff knocking on doors. That may be Schiff's chosen image, but he must do the work to cultivate it. "I am determined," he said between houses, "that if this is a close race, the extra thousand votes will be for me." As he distributed fliers, Schiff pointed out that his number was on the back. But he does not wait for his constituents to call him. He randomly calls them from his office in Sacramento, just to check in.
The next day, after holding a three-and-a-half-hour public hearing in Glendale on youth violence, Schiff stopped in at a Chamber of Commerce reception in wealthy La Canada Flintridge. Then he was off, farther up into the hills as the sun set, to the Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Station. There, in a windowless room, about 30 people had gathered for the presentation of scholarships of $100 to kids going off to college. Rogan, who was in Washington, was represented by an aide. The local assemblyman was on vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Even two of the seven young scholars were no-shows. But Adam Schiff was there.
"It's a pleasure to come and recognize young people," he said, meaning it. "Thank you very much for inviting me."
All this explains why America does not elect visionaries from marginal House districts and why pork-barrel politics is alive and well. The old sins of politics endure alongside the modern ones, but so do the old virtues -- of attentiveness and responsiveness, of neighborliness. National groups and outside donors may be trying to influence the race, but the candidates are talking about local concerns and the local manifestations of national and even global ones: about blocking a proposed hilltop development in Glendale, about providing prescription drugs less expensively, about how Turks slaughtered Armenians during World War I.
"Most people, regardless of what ethnic group they belong to, are just looking for someone to give them a little respect," Carlos Moorhead said when I visited him at his country club in Glendale. For 24 years, before he retired and Rogan was elected, Moorhead, a conservative Republican, represented the 27th district. He also served on the Judiciary Committee, and during his first term he also voted on a president's impeachment. He opposed Nixon's impeachment, taking a popular stand in the then-conservative district.
Moorhead spoke like a relic of a gentler political era. A grandfatherly man with Popeye forearms and laugh lines crowding blue eyes, Moorhead refused to say an unkind word about Schiff, though he is squarely behind Rogan. He never practiced negative campaigning, he told me proudly, and he was not about to start. He tried to avoid commenting on the millions raised for this race, though he was clearly saddened by it. "I'm not a good money raiser," he said. "People would ask me, 'Do you really need the money?' And I'd say, 'No."'
Moorhead argued that, even today, money need not decide the race. "People vote for folks they like," he said twice, simply.
During my long talk with Moorhead, I found myself thinking back to the Fourth of July parade. That morning, a wave of chatter had paralleled the candidates' cars through the crowd: "They're running for what?" "I think he's cute," "He was all for impeachment, and now they're madder than hell at him." Some of the talk was directed right at the candidates. One woman demanded to know why he had not fought for seat belts in school buses since "you promised me that three years ago!" "Let's go buddy," a man whose T-shirt advertised the Pasadena Academy of Self-Defense called out to his congressman, "how 'bout no gun control?" Rogan shot him his intense glare and replied that the government should start enforcing existing laws and locking criminals away. "You've got my vote," the man replied.
The truth is Susan Carpenter-McMillan had a point: weird hair matters. Candidates' quirks and local issues matter. Pikachu -- with his crack about it all coming down to fund-raising -- was missing the obvious, in a way that Moorhead, and now Rogan and Schiff, could never afford to. All the money and outside meddling was a story, but not the story. It is hard to envy the voters of California's 27th Congressional District the advertising that has bombarded them, like residents of swing states in the presidential race, for months. It is hard to envy them the political direct mail that will be stuffed into their mail slots at a rate of perhaps 20 pieces a day come November. But it is hard, in the end, not to envy them their choice, which for all the high-priced consulting and cynical strategizing remains firmly in their hands.

 BODY:
'The next president is going to appoint three, maybe even four, justices of the Supreme Court," Al Gore declared in a moment of enthusiasm during the first presidential debate. But Gore and George W. Bush said little about their visions of the court, except to dance around the one question that has obsessed presidential candidates since 1980. "The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision's going to be overturned," the vice president announced. "This is a very important issue, because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted, and it could be lost." Bush countered with echoes of Richard Nixon's campaign rhetoric from 1968. He promised to appoint judges "who will strictly interpret the Constitution," as opposed to "liberal, activist judges who will use their bench to subvert the legislature."
In fact, both candidates are repeating slogans from old debates that may not turn out to be central during the next four years. Consider abortion. There are now six justices on the court who support the core principle of Roe v. Wade -- namely, that abortions can't be banned before fetal viability. Only three justices believe, as Justice Antonin Scalia declared as recently as June, that Roe "must be overruled." For Roe to be overturned, Bush would have to replace two pro-Roe justices -- say, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor -- with two committed anti-Roe justices. Given the uncertainties of Supreme Court retirements, he might not have this opportunity. What's more, overturning Roe wouldn't lead to a national ban on abortion. Although some state legislatures would vote to restrict abortion, many would maintain the status quo. 
 Even if we assume conservatively that the next president will have only one court appointment, however, the stakes in November's election are high. There are a number of issues on which the court is more closely divided along ideological lines than it is over abortion. One is affirmative action, where the vote of a single new justice could decide whether or not race-conscious admissions in public schools and universities are permitted in America. Another key issue concerns the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
The word "federalism" tends to make most people's eyes glaze over. But although the issue gets less attention than affirmative action and abortion, it is no less important. During the past five years, the Supreme Court has struck down all or part of 25 federal laws, from the line-item veto to the Brady gun-control law. In many of these cases, the court decided -- by slim 5-to-4 margins -- that Congress or the president had encroached on states' rights or on the separation of powers. The election of 2000, therefore, could redefine the shape of the federal government. If Gore wins, the court might well abandon its recent attempts to impose meaningful limits on Congress's power. If Bush wins, however, the court could embark on a concerted attempt to roll back the boundaries of the modern regulatory state.
How would the country be changed by such an effort? Some of the laws that the court has struck down so far -- like the decorously named Violence Against Women Act -- might be viewed as symbolic laws, designed to please powerful constituency groups rather than to solve national problems. (It is arguable, for example, that violence against women is already regulated adequately by the states.) But the court in recent years has begun to impose more serious limits on federal authority -- preventing Congress from authorizing senior citizens to sue the State of Florida for age discrimination, for example, and preventing the Food and Drug Administration from regulating tobacco as a drug. If the court continues much further down this path, the effects on national politics could be profound. The federal government might have much less discretion to regulate water and air quality and to control the spread of viruses that haven't yet crossed state lines. Indeed, Congress might be hamstrung in its efforts to enforce national solutions to a host of problems that can be only dimly imagined today -- involving crime, privacy and the regulation of cloning and other genetic technology. Even if you applaud the idea of serious limitations on federal power, you might be wary about having them imposed by the Supreme Court.
Many people are familiar by now with the constitutional arguments for and against legalized abortion and affirmative action. But the debate over federalism tends to be too abstract to get even the hearts of lawyers pounding. In the hope of making the issue more concrete, I visited two judges who have written influential opinions on opposite sides of the debate: J. Michael Luttig, an appellate judge in Virginia; and David S. Tatel, an appellate judge in Washington. This choice of judges was not made casually. Luttig is considered a leading candidate for a Supreme Court appointment in a Bush administration; Tatel is among those who are similarly well regarded by the Gore camp. Conversations with each of them, therefore, offer insights into the very different directions the Supreme Court could take in a Bush or Gore administration.
'Michael Luttig is a conservative's conservative," says Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice in Washington. "He's not afraid to be a risk-taker and to look behind the meaning of statutes and use the judicial power to rein in the federal government." Luttig is an idol of the conservative legal movement today, which can be summed up with the following battle cry: No more Souters! Having appointed five out of the past seven justices with the express purpose of over-turning the landmark decisions of the Warren and Burger Courts -- Roe v. Wade, Miranda and the school-prayer decisions -- conservatives are understandably frustrated that this aspect of the counterrevolution failed. Their frustration is focused, in particular, on Justice David Souter, whom they view as having committed a dastardly betrayal by morphing into a vision of his predecessor, the liberal hero William Brennan. Among conservatives, Luttig is widely viewed as the anti-Souter, the absolutely reliable nominee.
Having read Luttig's opinions, which display a relish for eviscerating the logical flaws of his colleagues, I was surprised and charmed by his self-deprecating friendliness and emotional accessibility. He is an extremely likable man. Unlike Justice Scalia, for whom he clerked, Luttig is intelligent without being a showoff. Born and reared in Texas, he has a down-home unpretentiousness that might very well appeal to George W. Bush.
Luttig, 46, showed me around his chambers on the ninth floor of the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., which are adorned with autographed pictures of Supreme Court justices featuring unusually intimate inscriptions. As a Department of Justice official in the Bush administration, Luttig worked tirelessly for the confirmation of David Souter in 1990 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. Thomas's gratitude is evident in several pictures, one of which shows him in shirt sleeves with his arm around Luttig's shoulder. Another picture has an inscription from "Clarence," which reads: "This would not have been possible without you! Thanks so much, buddy!"
Luttig's speedy progress from law clerk for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger to White House aide to federal appellate judge -- he was appointed by President Bush at the improbable age of 36 -- has given his opinions a confident, relentlessly logical quality, like those of a bright, young law professor who has never been chastened by life outside the academy. Luttig, who studied Ludwig Wittgenstein in college, is known for making mathematically precise arguments, especially in cases involving the limits of federal power.
Six years ago, however, Luttig suffered a personal tragedy, which he agreed only reluctantly to discuss. In 1994, Luttig's father was brutally murdered in his garage in Tyler, Tex., by three young carjackers who shot him twice in the head as he got out of his car. After watching her husband's murder, Luttig's mother survived by playing dead.
"I loved him more than life," Luttig told me as we sat in his office. "Everything he said and did, I respected. He is the single-most important influence in my life. He is my hero." The experience of sitting through the federal and state trials of his father's murderers, Luttig suggests, helped him to sympathize with a defendant's family. "When my mother walked in the courtroom, she walked past the mother of one of the people who killed my dad," he said. "There was a look on her face: 'God, how did this happen?' My mother hugged the woman, and I followed -- I hugged the woman. It forced you to think about things at the outer margins of life. There was a bond established between my family and her family."
One of the carjackers was convicted and sentenced to death. The death sentence is now being reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals, and Gov. George Bush may ultimately be responsible for deciding whether the execution should proceed.
Two years ago, Luttig was asked to recuse himself from a death-penalty appeal by the defendant's lawyers, who argued that Luttig couldn't be impartial in light of his father's death. But Luttig rejected the request, arguing persuasively that judges shouldn't recuse themselves from capital cases merely because they had "experienced the fullness of life -- good and bad." In 1938, when Earl Warren was a district attorney, his own father was murdered by a burglar. Warren went on to become chief justice and rule on many capital cases. Nevertheless, Luttig's ordeal could hardly have made him more conservative in death-penalty cases: even before the tragedy, he was already the most conservative judge on the most conservative appellate court in the nation. In his nine years on the bench, Luttig has never voted to reverse a death-penalty conviction.
Luttig was also asked to recuse himself in a recent case involving restrictions on abortion. In 1998, Virginia became one of many states that passed laws forbidding so-called partial-birth abortions. Luttig wrote an opinion allowing the law to go into effect. In June, however, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, disagreed with Luttig's analysis. When it came time for Luttig to re-evaluate Virginia's law in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, he rejected a request by abortion rights lawyers that he step aside. Luttig held his nose and applied the Supreme Court decision with which he disagreed.
"As a court of law," he wrote, "ours is neither to devise ways in which to circumvent the opinions of the Supreme Court nor to indulge delay in the full implementation of the court's opinions." Luttig told me that it was important that different justices, appointed by different presidents, had decided to reaffirm Roe after it had been the subject of vigorous debate. "If you don't believe in the disruption of society, reliance on precedent is important," he said cautiously. "At the other end of the spectrum is the magnitude of the analytical errors. In each case there's a heavy choice -- not heavy as in brooding, but heavy -- with the need for incremental movement, so the court doesn't lose respect." This pronouncement -- that judges should generally respect precedents, except those that are flamboyantly wrong -- will hardly reassure partisans of Roe v. Wade.
Luttig's confirmation hearings might focus on his views about abortion, but his most important legacy as a lower court judge has been his enthusiasm in applying the Supreme Court's recent decisions restricting federal power. It was Luttig who wrote the lower court decision striking down the Violence Against Women Act, which the Supreme Court reaffirmed by a vote of 5 to 4. The Constitution authorizes Congress to "regulate commerce . . . among the several States," and between 1941 and 1995 the Supreme Court didn't strike down a single federal law on the grounds that it exceeded this broad power. But recent Supreme Court decisions have construed Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce more narrowly. Although Congress concluded (rather tendentiously) that violence against women affects interstate commerce by impairing their productivity, Luttig reasoned that any economic effects of violence against women were too remote to be taken seriously.
In a concurring opinion, Luttig's colleague J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd reflected on the dangers of what he candidly called "judicial activism" by conservatives. Wilkinson, a well-respected moderate conservative, is himself mentioned as a leading Supreme Court candidate in a Bush administration. A former law professor and newspaper editor in Virginia, Wilkinson argued that any time courts refuse to defer to the decisions of legislative bodies, their decisions must be called activist. But he insisted that the Supreme Court's recent decisions limiting the scope of federal power were more defensible than than those of previous eras of judicial activism, the 1930's and 1960's, because the court was merely acting as a "structural referee" between federal and state governments. Looking to the future, however, Wilkinson cautioned that "if modern activism accelerates to a gallop" -- leading to a "wholesale invalidation of environmental, civil rights and business regulation" -- then the new conservative judicial activists would be just as discredited as their predecessors.
When I asked Luttig what he thought of Wilkinson's warning, he said he disagreed with his colleague's definition of judicial activism. "It's not true that every time you strike down a law, that's an act of judicial activism," Luttig said. "In fact, it can take any form, including striking something down, but also not striking something down when you are exercising your own policy objectives."
The debate between Luttig and Wilkinson continued in a case decided in June. Wilkinson, writing for the majority, upheld an application of the Endangered Species Act to prevent landowners from killing or trapping red wolves on private property. In a vigorous dissent, Luttig insisted that this application of the Endangered Species Act was unconstitutional because "the killing of even all 41 of the estimated red wolves that live on private property in North Carolina" would have only a trivial effect on interstate commerce. "The interpretation of this clause of the Constitution, no less so than any other, must ultimately rest not with the political branches, but with the judiciary," Luttig wrote. Wilkinson declared that Luttig's aggressively limited view of national power would "place in peril the entire federal regulatory scheme for wildlife and natural resource conservation." But Luttig sees his view as unflinchingly logical. "I don't think there's a scholar out there who believes that the commerce power is without check," he told me confidently.
If Bush judges are likely to question the scope of federal power, Gore judges are not. Although Gore has indicated that he would appoint liberal justices like Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, it is not yet clear if Gore is more willing than President Clinton to expend significant political capital to appoint judicial liberals rather than judicial moderates. At the very least, however, it seems probable that Gore justices, like the moderate Clinton appointees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, would share a distaste for sweeping exercises of judicial power and a reluctance to strike down federal laws in the name of states' rights. One judicial moderate who fits this mold is David Tatel, appointed by Clinton to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Not long ago, I visited Judge Tatel in his chambers in Washington. "Nice to see you," Tatel said as he greeted me at the door. "Come on in, have a seat." Ushering me toward a chair, he sat down on a comfortable sofa, behind a coffee table with nothing on it except a copy of Gerald Gunther's biography of Judge Learned Hand.
I asked what he thought of the book. "Isn't it great?" he said. "There's actually a quote here that I wrote down for my clerks." Tatel picked up a small keyboard with six large black keys. He placed an earpiece into his left ear and tapped a few times on the keyboard. "Here it is, from Page 289: Hand was 'uncertain about the proper result in most cases, even after decades of judicial experience."'
It is easy when talking to Tatel to forget that he is blind. A degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, began to destroy his sight when he was in his teens, and he became legally blind in the 1970's. But he maintains ordinary eye contact when he speaks and walks freely around his chambers; the keyboard is the only evident sign of his disability.
"My kids call this my Fisher-Price toy," he said. "I can use it to take an opinion home on disk and work on it myself. It's a great little machine, and it gives me an enormous amount of independence. But it has a terrible voice." Reaching over to a telephone on a stand at his right, Tatel punched in a number for a newspaper-reading service for the blind that has a voice he prefers. The voice began to recite the letters to the editor from that day's New York Times so quickly that the words were like high-pitched gibberish. "That's the speed I like to listen to," Tatel said. "It sort of sounds like your Swedish aunt."
Suddenly, Tatel got up from the couch, walked across the room, sat down in the swivel chair behind his desk, reached under his computer stand, picked up a small device and walked back across the room, reaching only once to touch the bookcase against the wall. "This holds 5,000 pages of text," he said, settling back again on the couch. "I'm using it to read a whole bunch of Supreme Court cases from last term." In the next year or so, Tatel's court will be one of the first to receive briefs and submissions on computer disks, and Tatel will be able to listen to the digital submissions on his portable keyboard. For now, however, Tatel's briefs are read to him by a reader provided by the court. "I suspect the other judges preparing for this case will prepare for it in two or three hours," he said. "This will take me five or six hours to do it, just because I have to have everything read to me."
Tatel, who is trim at 58, swims three mornings a week at the Y, where a clerk meets him to walk to chambers. Until last December, for 30 years he jogged regularly with a friend, navigating the familiar course by tying their arms together with a cord. "I quit not because of my eyes but because of my back," he explained. He is also an enthusiastic skier and has trained his children to ski behind him, calling out the turns on a radio headset. But when I pressed for more details, he asked me to ensure that his blindness wouldn't become the focus of this article. "Somebody once said that I viewed myself as a judge who happens to be blind rather than a blind judge," he said. "If you get too much into the jogging and the skiing, it becomes an article about my blindness. I don't believe it's like the race issue. I think you can make a very powerful argument that having a black judge is important for the judiciary, or women judges, but it's not like that issue. I hope I wasn't put on this court because of my disability, because I actually don't think it's particularly relevant, whereas I think the race and gender issue can be. Everybody has a lot of experiences in their lives that affect how they look at things. I don't think it's a big deal, and I'm uncomfortable having it be a big deal."
Judge Tatel is as deferential to Congressional power as Judge Luttig is willing to rein it in. The differences in their approaches to federal authority is best summed up in a decision that Tatel's court decided last year and is now being reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Tatel's conservative colleagues voted to strike down the part of the Clean Air Act that authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate ozone and other forms of air pollution. Resurrecting a judicial doctrine that has not been applied since before the New Deal era, the conservatives held that the Clean Air Act's broad instruction to the E.P.A. to set air-quality standards that will "protect the public health" is an unconstitutionally vague delegation of Congress's authority, because no one knows precisely what "the public health" is. (To pass muster, the conservatives suggested, the law should have more carefully constrained the E.P.A.'s discretion in choosing one pollution level over another.)
In a strong dissent, Tatel suggested that the conservatives' reasoning would also call into question the constitutionality of many other broad federal regulations, from the Federal Communications Commission's authority to regulate TV networks to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to determine "just and reasonable rates" for electricity. "Not only did the panel depart from a half-century of Supreme Court separation-of-powers jurisprudence," Tatel wrote in a related decision, "but in doing so, it stripped the Environmental Protection Agency of much of its ability to implement the Clean Air Act, this nation's primary means of protecting the safety of the air breathed by hundreds of millions of people." Tatel's position may well be vindicated by the Supreme Court later this year. But during the next decade, battles over the scope of the federal government's power to regulate will probably be fierce.
Although Tatel has been reluctant to use his authority as a judge to second-guess the political branches, he first made his name as a lawyer by arguing for vigorous judicial intervention in cases involving civil rights. Tatel served as director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under President Carter and then as national director of the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights Under Law. As a private lawyer, he went on to represent school districts in litigation to promote school desegregation, and he was responsible for negotiating a pioneering desegregation settlement between the N.A.A.C.P. and the City of St. Louis.
But time appears to have modulated Tatel's view that courts should be the primary engines of social change; he now seems to feel that courts can enforce constitutional rights but should not impose heavy-handed remedies in an effort to remake society. This year, Tatel applied his insights about the limits of judicial activism when a Maryland district judge appointed him to be mediator in a longstanding lawsuit claiming that handicapped children in Baltimore weren't getting the special education to which they were entitled. After ordering the school district to pay millions of dollars and trying to supervise the district himself, the judge, Marvin J. Garbis, finally decided that the parties should set educational goals for the school. With Tatel's help, both sides quickly came to an agreement. Tatel told me that such "mediated" discussions were a "more effective use of judicial power" than the old mode of forcing change by judicial fiat.
Tatel's views about judicial power are not minimalistic across the board. He favors a strong role for the courts in protecting individual rights against infringements by Congress as well as by state legislatures and is particularly committed to individual privacy. He dissented from a decision to deny President Clinton the attorney-client privilege during the Monica Lewinsky investigation for conversations with Bruce Lindsey, a White House aide. He struck down part of a recent federal regulation that requires phone companies to turn over to the police information about all the digits that have been dialed after a suspect's call is connected, including voice-mail passwords and bank account information. And he dissented from a decision to uphold the District of Columbia's Juvenile Curfew, which forbids children 16 and under to be in a public place without adult supervision between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Children have a "fundamental right to free movement," Tatel concluded, and parents have a fundamental liberty "to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control."
Tatel's reasoning suggests that he would be more inclined than a judge like Luttig to recognize a constitutional right to personal autonomy, which isn't found explicitly in the Constitution. How broadly he would interpret this right is impossible to say. But Tatel seems no more likely to engage in a freewheeling Roe v. Wade-style expansion of the right to privacy than Justices Ginsburg or Breyer, both of whom joined the unanimous Supreme Court in refusing to recognize a broadly defined constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide. There is, at this moment in our legal culture, little support among judges of either party for the aggressive creation of new constitutional rights. Instead, Democratic and Republican judges are focused on conserving their judicial victories of the last generation and are divided about whether to accept their defeats. While Tatel might not vote to overturn the recent decisions limiting the scope of federal power, he certainly would not vote to extend them. In a recent opinion defending judicial restraint, Tatel noted, "The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted."
There is a political subtext to this high-minded debate about federalism. The idea that Congress's power to regulate commerce "among the several States" could be interpreted to justify any federal legislation first took hold during the New Deal. Back in 1937, in the face of F.D.R.'s court-packing plan, the conservative justices decided to get out of the business of enforcing constitutional limits on Congress's power. As a result, the modern regulatory state was born. Sixty years later, however, the New Deal is no longer a sacred cow. And it is clear that today's conservative judicial revolution is, in many ways, a response to the New Deal itself. Although "strict constructionist" judges like Luttig oppose the use of the courts to create individual rights, these same conservatives are eager to use the courts to resurrect limitations on federal power that have been ignored since the 1930's.
This election, for better or for worse, will determine whether or not the premise of the New Deal -- that federal power is essentially unlimited -- will remain in force in the 21st century. Although Judge Luttig is correct that the Constitution doesn't seem to anticipate a federal government of unlimited power, Judge Tatel is correct that ever since the New Deal, efforts by judges to enforce those limits have threatened to strike at the heart of what Washington does. And even those who shudder at the excesses of the regulatory state might hesitate before encouraging courts to dismantle it. For more than 50 years, liberals and conservatives agreed that the tyranny of elected representatives was less dangerous than the tyranny of unelected justices of the Supreme Court.
It isn't at all unusual that the candidates and the voters aren't paying attention to the central question the election will resolve. After all, how many of the people who voted for Nixon and Reagan expected their candidates to go to China and end the cold war? As the shortsighted focus on Roe v. Wade shows, presidential campaigns often end up resolving wars that few people noticed were still being fought. But at least in the election of 2000, the constitutional choices are clear.

HEADLINE: Two Cheers For Sweatshops

 BODY:
In their semi-endorsement of American-run sweatshops overseas, your writers argue that corporate exploitation of labor is a necessary first step in a region's economic growth.
Although they exhort consumers to make responsible choices to support foreign workers, the authors expect no such responsibility from corporations, in the quest to inflate bloated profit margins with the smallest possible investment in labor.

HEADLINE: A Caribbean Campus Where Relaxation Is a Major

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MOSES; JENNIFER MOSES is the author of "Food and Whine: Confessions of a New Millennium Mom" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
I'D never before been to Jamaica, and didn't know quite what to expect. Before my husband, Stuart, and I left, my mother-in-law, an inveterate reader of travel magazines, had warned us that every criminal in the country was lying in wait for American tourists. But what we found upon landing at Montego Bay and rounding the corner into customs, was a group of musicians, in native garb, greeting us with a hokey welcome song.
At first, barely awake after our dawn departure from Louisiana, I thought I was experiencing some kind of traveler's hallucination. But no, the cheery welcome band was flesh-and-blood, and an hour or so later, as I plunged into the famously clear blue Caribbean Sea, it dawned on me that there are worse things than getting up early.
It was late September, and we were staying at the Half Moon Golf, Tennis and Beach Club, just a few miles from Montego Bay. The huge resort sprawls out behind high stucco walls on 400 acres of coastline, looking north toward Cuba. 
 Though Stuart and I don't play golf at all and not much tennis, we figured that we could, at the very least, loll around on a couple of chaises in the shade of a palm or a coconut tree on the beach, and indulge in some competitive novel reading. Aside from a rather languorous middle-aged couple, both blond and sporting tiny bikinis, lying face up in the full sun a few palm trees away, we practically had the entire broad white, picture-perfect beach to ourselves.
But first things first. The swim in that impossibly blue salty sea -- in the warm gentle waters of a protected bay -- effectively cured most of our minor ills. And what the swim didn't take care of, the Bloody Marys at lunch, at the resort's Seagrape Terrace restaurant, did. As I took my first sip, and looked around at the gorgeous terrace with its classic mahogany furniture, with the glistening white sand of the beach and the sparkling water beyond, I began to think that even I might relax enough to stop worrying about our three kids at home.
Our junior suite was so beautiful that a part of me wanted to memorize its every detail, perhaps to emulate it at home. But I also wanted to get out and explore a bit. Perhaps I'd come across the likes of Queen Elizabeth or Eddie Murphy (both of whom have been guests). So off we set on a self-guided tour.
There were flowers everywhere -- in vibrant island colors: pink, red, purple, white -- growing in beds along the meticulously maintained brick pathways and on overhanging vines, bursting out of pots. There were arches of flowers -- hibiscus, oleander, camellia and bougainvillea -- formed by trained vines. Also trees: lemon, almond, all-spice, coconut palms.
We wandered down a covered, brick walkway past two-story stucco-faced beach-front blocks of guest rooms, sniffing the perfumed air, and thanking the Creator for having invented the 747.
We walked past first one swimming pool (circular, with an island in the middle) then the next (Olympic-size), and then the next (smaller, half hidden), and then the next. The resort has 53 swimming pools, some not much bigger than a big Jacuzzi, and many tucked discreetly within the flanks of the guest cottages.
Half Moon also has 13 tennis courts, a riding stable, an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course, and a total of 419 bedrooms in a variety of combinations -- from standard hotel rooms, to villas with as many as seven bedrooms and staffed by butler, maid and cook -- every last one of them decorated slightly differently.
There are also several restaurants, snack bars and bars, a night club, a soccer field, a nature reserve, a shopping village, conference rooms, a putting green, a croquet lawn, nursery, children's playground, commissary, basketball and volleyball courts, and a fitness center, even a small hospital with a dialysis unit.
Think of a somewhat sprawling college campus that happens to be in the tropics, decorated in high English colonial style with a twist of Mary Emmerling, staffed by an army of helpers, and filled with people majoring in tennis and golf, and you begin to get the idea. (The resort offers tennis lessons, and has a branch of the David Leadbetter Golf Academy.)
Tuition? Not for the faint of pocketbook. Some offerings -- like playing tennis or working out in the spa's Nautilus room -- come at no extra cost, but many others are a la carte. There's snorkeling on a slightly off-shore reef, sailboats, wind-surfing, paddle-boats or bicycling around miles of bicycle and jogging paths. There are squash courts, a pavilion devoted to chess, fitness trainers and aquasizing (water exercise) classes.
And then there are all those enticing spa offerings. A facial, with calming, healing aloe vera and lavender oil? Why not? It sounded good. Real good. I just didn't know where to start.
"How about a nap?" my husband said.
We managed to navigate ourselves back to our room, in a white stucco cottage set back from the beach. It had a porch, with a table and chairs for dining and a chaise longue; inside was a sitting room with a television, a large bedroom with a king-size bed, and a big, tiled bathroom.
There was also the requisite fully stocked minibar (was it self-indulgent to drink Champagne in the middle of the afternoon?) and an old-fashioned console-style radio. The floor, like those throughout the resort, was black and white tile, covered with Oriental area rugs. The white plaster ceiling arched above the bed like a tent, the walls were fancifully painted in a sponged pattern of swirling sky-blues, and the bed spread and curtains were of a bright floral pattern.
It was, in short, the most fanciful hotel room I'd ever seen. Later, I learned that most of the handsome Queen Anne style mahogany furniture throughout the resort was made on the premises.
By the next morning, we were sufficiently chilled out to start the day bright and early in the fitness center, where we'd signed on for a yoga class. At 8 a.m., the resort was in full swing, with men raking the beach and pulling seaweed from the sea floor to make bathing that much more delightful. Maids pushed cleaning carts and other employees carried room-service trays to and fro on bicycles.
At the fitness center, our teacher was depressingly young and gorgeous, with the kind of body that you wouldn't think could occur via natural selection alone. She made us stretch our ankles and toes, our necks and shoulders, our inners and our outers, and when the class was over, asked if we were O.K. We were, but we were also, by then, very hungry. So we wandered back through the open-air reception area and settled down for breakfast at the central restaurant, the Seagrape Terrace.
The food at Half Moon, particularly at the Seagrape, was a bit of a disappointment; the kitchen was somewhat uneven, the offerings a bit unimaginative. But breakfast was another story: fluffy scrambled eggs and omelets, stir-fried mixed green vegetables, muffins, French toast, dumplings, croissants, jellies, jams, fresh melon, fresh fruit salads, oatmeal, olives, yogurt.
After breakfast, we settled in for a long morning of reading in the shade. By the time we'd emerged from our cottage in our bathing suits, the blond middle-aged couple were already out, soaking up the sun and drinking tall brightly colored drinks, and a waitress was taking drink orders. Just as I was beginning to doze off on my chaise, it was time for lunch again.
Stuart wanted English fare, and so we hopped on a resort van for the Royal Stocks, a surprisingly authentic looking English pub in the resort's shopping village, but operated independently. The hamburgers (in the end, we decided against pub fare) were absolutely delicious.
After lunch, we headed over to the luxurious spa, where each of us had signed on for a deep body massage. Situated in its own building, the spa is a warren of small and large rooms, all artfully decorated down to the attractive hand-cream containers and brass toilet-paper holders in the women's room, and the vase of flowers in the entry foyer. We were ushered into separate rooms and presently my masseuse knocked. After about 15 minutes of having my tensions beat out of me, I began to appreciate my physical being in a way I hadn't before.
It's amazing how quickly time passes when you're basically doing nothing, because before we knew it, it was once again time to dine. Up the beach, a cocktail party for the guests was in full swing under a dazzlingly starry sky. A steel band played "Yellow Bird," and waiters circulated with hors d'oeuvres.
I had a glass of Champagne, and then we caught a van to an off-campus restaurant, Belfield 1794. Out the gates and onto the main highway we went, and then up and down hills, around bends and through crowds, past shanties and half-completed government-subsidized housing, under villas built high up in the hills, skirting the flanks of mountains, through a valley and then up again into the hills on the other side of Montego Bay.
It was worth the trip. The Belfield is an independently owned establishment on the resort's "dine around" plan, which allows you to charge meals at six restaurants to your resort bill. It is on the site of what had once been the sugar mill of the 3,000-acre Barnett estate, which dates from the days when the entire economy of the island was based on sugar cane, and Europeans were making money hand over fist from the labor of African slaves. Diners can visit the Great House, just steps from the restaurant, and get a glimpse of plantation life, but we skipped the history lesson in favor of immediate gratification.
The restaurant -- an open-air round building under a thatched roof, situated above the dirt floor of the original mill -- is strikingly dramatic. As for the Jamaican cuisine: it was simple but delicious -- spicy, rich, tender and fresh. I had something called chicken stuff-stuff, which came with spicy yams and cassava, and Stuart had curried goat. Even the waiter was impressed by how well we'd cleaned our plates.
Jamaica is a big island -- nearly the size of Connecticut -- and lushly beautiful: rolling green mountains, morning mists, turquoise sea, fantastic flowers. It wasn't until 1962 that Jamaica ended its colonial status under the British to become a self-governing member of the Commonwealth. Happily, we American tourists didn't have to convert our money (Jamaica is suffering terrible inflation, the Jamaican dollar losing value before your eyes), but instead could rely on our American dollars.
Which we discovered the next day, when we took a 15-minute drive into Montego Bay, the island's second largest city. The streets were sultry, baking in the sun, and we seemed to attract the keen attention of just about every shopkeeper in town, all of whom seemed to be feeling the pinch of the off-season.
On Gloucester Avenue -- known as the "hip strip" -- with its glitzy bars, hotels, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and innumerable T-shirt and souvenir shops, I was approached by a half-dozen women who offered to braid my hair, Jamaican-style, for $30. But we were on a serious shopping expedition, having promised our children something from the Caribbean.
At last, gifts in hand (beads for our daughter, and noisemakers for our sons), we headed for lunch, at the poetically named Pork Pit. About as inelegant a setting as you can imagine, it had molded plastic orange tables and chairs, plastic cutlery and tissue-thin paper napkins. But oh, the food! We devoured our platters of jerk chicken, rice and beans, and roasted yams, accompanied by first-rate ginger beer.
As we left, I was approached by yet another woman who offered to braid my hair. This time I said yes. I followed her down the road to her shop in the open-air crafts market, took a seat, and proceeded to undergo torture.
Three women worked on me at once: I felt like I was getting scalped, and at one point started doing Lamaze breathing exercises. A half hour later, they were finished.
"You look just like Bo Derek," they said. "Beautiful."
And I did, except, of course, that I'm a half-foot shorter, 25 pounds heavier, 20 years older, and Jewish. My husband looked skeptical, too.
Back at the Half Moon, the blond couple were still lying on the beach, only this time they'd both flipped over. People were sipping tall sweet rum-based drinks in brilliant shades, sailboats dotted the horizon, birds were singing in the trees, and the air smelled wonderful.
But by the next afternoon, the Half Moon -- in all its extravagant and almost unworldly beauty, its rarefied luxury -- was a thousand miles behind us, and the sound of the Caribbean gently lapping against the beach had been replaced by the sound of traffic. The kids, however, loved their presents, and my $30 worth of beaded braids jangle when I walk.
 
A resort, or an exclusive town?
To visit Jamaica, Americans must have either a current passport or a certified birth certificate and some form of state-issued photo identification, like a driver's license. There is a departure tax of $26 a person.
The Half Moon Golf, Tennis, and Beach Club, Half Moon Post Office, Rose Hall, Montego Bay, Jamaica, West Indies, is a few miles from Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay. Reservations and information: (800) 626-0592 or (876) 953-2615, fax (876) 953-2731; or go to www.halfmoon.com.jm.
The resort offers a wide range of room types, meal plans and inclusive plans. For example, guests can choose to be on a breakfast plan, modified American plan, or full American plan. Likewise, there's a choice of a number of activity plans, like a Golf/Spa Plan, the Leadbetter Golf Plan (with lessons at the David Leadbetter Golf Academy), and a Spa Plan.
Because my husband and I visited the resort during the off-season, breakfast was included with our room, a junior suite ($350 for both of us a night, for a total of $1,050 for three nights). But since we were not on any special plan, all our other meals, as well as spa treatments ($5 to $60), boat ($15 to $35 and hour) and bicycle ($10 to $15) rentals, exercise classes (about $25), and drinks at any of the resort's many bars or from our room's minibar were a la carte. Golf greens fees are $100.
There is no extra charge for use of the resort's 53 pools, the Nautilus exercise room or gym, the 13 tennis courts, croquet lawn or the 18-hole putting course. The manager's punch party on Monday and Friday nights, and transportation around the resort -- as well as to the Belfield restaurant in Montego Bay -- were also included in the price, as were taxes and service charges.
Counting the villas, the resort has a total of 419 bedrooms in 252 units. From Dec. 15 through April 15, rates range from $390 a night (double occupancy) for a standard room, to $1,190 for an Imperial Suite. In the off-season, these rates are $240 to $790 a night.
The villas in high season are $780 a night for a two-bedroom with a garden view to $2,340 a night for a six-bedroom with an ocean view, a maid, butler and cook. Off-season rates are nearly 50 percent less.
Reservations for Belfield 1794, on the Barnett Estate, Fairfield, Grandville, can be booked through the resort or by calling (876) 952-2382. Dinner for two with drinks was about $60. Closed Sunday.
The Pork Pit restaurant is a simple place with great food on the eastern end of Montego Bay's "hip strip," at 27 Gloucester Avenue; (876) 952-1046. Lunch for two with soft drinks was under $15.JENNIFER MOSES

Enjoy!

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Alissome Japanese waitress at the Yosaku restaurant in Bethesda, Md., presented me with a bowl of Nabayaki Udon -- thick noodles in broth with bits of chicken and shrimp -- smiled and said, "Enjoy."
That is not a Japanese word. Indeed, that invitation to pleasure in eating is not an Asian attitude. According to my Times colleague Nicholas D. Kristof, author with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, of "Thunder From the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia," servers of food in Japan are likely to say honno okuchi yogoshi de gozaimasuga, "here's a little something that will make your mouth dirty." The idea is to apologize for the meal and to suggest humbly that it will not be enjoyable at all to the honored guest. The Chinese equivalent, as a mouthwatering repast is placed before the eater, is meishemma cai, or "this food is nothing much." 
 In American eateries, however, and in restaurants around the world that cater to English-speaking patrons, the new server's imperative -- enjoy! -- can be heard. The mock-stern but cheerful command is spreading like the Asian leguminous vine kudzu, rivaling the readily understood O.K. and the widely accepted no problem as a major American contribution to a universal language.
Waiters (or servers, as the unisexy prefer to be called) in every culture have their national phrases to accompany the placement of a plate. Bon appetit, say the French, and the wish for a hearty appetite is expressed in Greek as kali orexi, in Spanish as buen provecho and in German as guten Appetit.
A German waiter is as likely to say simply bitte, which usually means "please," and the same idea is expressed in New York's Russian Tea Room as pozhaluista. The closest translation of these would be the neutral comment of American hash slingers as they plonk down the plate: "There you go."
A British butler is likely to warn, "The plate is hot, Madam." Until a decade or so ago, the Yiddish term was es gezunterheyt, "eat in good health"; the Gaelic equivalent is slainte, "health."
But then along came the imperative, intransitive enjoy! That exhortation has become so ubiquitous that in a Diner's Bill of Rights concocted recently by Zagat's restaurant survey, one of the inalienable rights of patrons was "for the waiter NOT to say 'enjoy' after the food is served."
How did it all begin? In his 1958 book, "For 2 Cents Plain," Harry Golden wrote: "When my mother served our meals . . . she would always say, 'Enjoy, enjoy.' . . . The word enjoy was seldom used by itself. It was always repeated." Accordingly, Golden's next best seller was titled "Enjoy, Enjoy!" In 1968, the New York Times reporter Marylin Bender quoted the furrier Jacques Kaplan on the effects of inflation: "Whenever they felt money would lose its value, people would gorge themselves. It's a dancing over the volcano attitude, an enjoy-enjoy philosophy."
Even as the dialectically duplicated verb lost its duplication on its journey to general usage, lexicographers noticed the way the hortatory "Enjoy!" did not transmit action to an object. Lillian Feinsilver wrote in her Yiddish dictionary in 1970 that enjoy as an intransitive verb "has become fairly common in recent years. . . . Enjoy yourself' was abbreviated to the simple 'Enjoy' by the solicitous Jewish mother." She noted the oddly intransitive usage by the violinist Mischa Elman: "I get a great kick out of life. I know how to enjoy."
Now, as a service to philological scholars, we examine the grammatical puzzlement contained in this seemingly simple food fiat. Enjoy yourself, meaning "have a good time," is clearly reflexive, turning the verb's action back on you, the understood subject. But the simple and now far more common enjoy! poses the question: Enjoy what? The food? Yourself gorging the food? The object is indeterminate; the verb's action does not know where to go.
"When used solely in the imperative mood," says Mike Agnes, editor in chief of Webster's New World Dictionaries, "the intransitive verb 'enjoy' may well qualify as a 'defective paradigm,' whereby a word fails to exhibit the full range of expected inflections. How odd that a word of such felicitous intent seems to reveal itself only in the stern imperative."
Jeffrey McQuain, the new editor of the newsletter Copy Editor, calls the new use of enjoy! "the implied intransitive" because it has no direct object but implies there should be one. He tracks the construction back to the ancient "Eat!" or the Italian "Mangia! Mangia!"
"The implied intransitive is especially popular in sports shorthand," McQuain says. "Coaches and fans yell their advice in the imperative mood without the subject (you) and without the object." Thus, "Bunt!" could mean either "Bunt the ball" or "Bunt, you miserable hitter."
Beware the loss of clarity in the defective paradigm or the implied intransitive. Until recently, verbs could be transitive (I love you) or intransitive (I love). Ron Meyers of New York deplores the de-transitivizing trend, using as his examples "please wait while your credit card is authorizing" and "this book usually ships in three days." What subject of the sentence is doing the authorizing or shipping? What object is the verb's action being done to?
Grammarians, lexicographers and all those living in syntax will find delectation in plunging into a deep, delicious analysis of this emerging phenomenon. And to those happy linguists we can only say. . . .

HEADLINE: The Guts Of Times Square

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Stephen Wilkes photographs of Times Square document some seldom-seen corners of what Guy Debord once called the spectacular system -- the conversion of the public into consumers of banal visual experience. In the late 20th century, the spectacular system became increasingly decentralized. Television, superhighways, suburban malls and multiplexes displaced city streets as channels for communication. Eventually, however, the systems specialists came to realize that there should be the occasional urban center, in the traditional manner of 19th-century industrial cities. These have now been deployed around the globe. Planners call them social condensers. They are designed to give consumers the impression that there still exist places where they can sample the fragrant atmosphere of cosmopolitan freedom, even though that atmosphere now comes canned.
Times Square is the world's leading exemplar of these manufactured centers. And Wilkes's pictures show us the hardware that operates this colossus of urban animatronics -- the hidden spaces that house the social condenser's electric circuitry. Command posts where human operators serve electronic brains. The lifts that transport the electricians who keep the spectacle glowing. As expressions of contemporaneity, this covert architecture far outshines the new skyscrapers in Times Square. It is the real world urban matrix, where human energy still has its uses amid electrified grids. 
 Debord took a dim view of what we call urbanism: street furniture, signage, zones for art and entertainment. Planners envision such projects as the fullest expression of the civic spirit, a reinforcement of the city's historic role in modern democracy.
 Not surprisingly, Debord regarded urbanism as an instrument of control. Where planners see public space, Debord saw isolation, the fragmentation of citizens into shopping units, their identities derived from a limited selection of brands. In Times Square, the crowd is an urban product to be consumed along with the signs. The crowd is itself a sign, the icon of a public that has passed into history along with the muggers, drug addicts and prostitutes that once gave Times Square its bleary edge.
Brainwashed American and image shopper that I am, I am a big fan of the new Times Square. I think it is true to its name, perhaps the most chronologically attuned chunk of real estate in the world. The invasion of media giants -- Disney, Conde Nast, Bertelsmann, Virgin -- has heightened the synchronization of time and place. Never before have the producers and consumers of media been brought into closer proximity. They rub shoulders in the street, linked by a zest for the ephemeral that I fully share.
Debord, whose "Society of the Spectacle" was published in 1967, was prophetic. Decades before the New Economy, long before the digitalization of absolutely everything, he foresaw the oligarchic uses to which these technologies might be put. In this sense, Times Square is completely monstrous, the gigantic maw of the New Economic beast. With the cylindrical Nasdaq sign, the beast even has a pretty nose.
But the evolution of Times Square continues. Recently, rumblings have been heard to the effect that the new Times Square is becoming too much like the old Times Square. While crime has not returned, there's too much loitering. People from the wrong neighborhoods are getting off the subways. These complaints are music to my ears. They mean that Times Square is still contested space and that people actually have a place in this "people" place. The circuits run in more than one direction. The vital signs give cause for hope.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Nasdaq Sign: Times Square's biggest, most technologically advanced sign is constantly moving, flashing ads for Nasdaq 100 companies, live coverage of financial events and, during market hours, up-to-date stock prices. A network of computers masterminded by Gene McCarthy (left) projects about two ads a minute onto the cylindrical screen, from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily. Sometimes McCarthy is asked by the Nasdaq people to broadcast a special event, and he has to head to the control console and reprogram the system. Charles Sperazza (opposite), the electrician responsible for the upkeep of the 10-month-old sign, is engaged in a less high-tech pursuit. He spends his days climbing around the insides of the tower. When it comes to finding balky spots on the $20 million sign, the computer isn't much help; someone has to stand outside and radio to Sperazza the location of the glitch. Unlike the Nasdaq of late, the sign is doing well: $1 million buys two minutes an hour of advertising for a year; one minute costs $500; minimum: 10 minutes.; The Discover Sign: Before it was dismantled earlier this fall, the Discover sign at the top of 1 Times Square offered a great view north, especially if one of its 12-inch-by-18-inch panels happened to have been removed (as it was on the May night the photograph on the opposite page was taken). Today all 1,140 sections of the 55-by-55-foot sign have been taken down to make way for a new L.E.D. sign; the 77,000 six-watt incandescent light bulbs that made up Discover's traditional lighted sign are being replaced with light-emitting diodes capable of shooting out millions of colors. "Nothing in that old sign could be used for the new one; it's a whole different kind of technology," explains Anthony Calvano, president of Landmark Signs and Electrical Maintenance Corporation, which expects the new sign to be ready next month. "Everybody's looking for clarity and sharpness, and today that means L.E.D." The old sign, located atop the building from which the ball drops on New Year's eve, was installed about seven years ago. At the rate technology is advancing -- in four years, the number of colors offered by L.E.D. has jumped from 10 to 1.07 billion -- the new sign will not be around nearly that long.; The Coke Sign: "A man can barely fit in there," Bob Jackowitz, a project manager for Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, says of the 10-foot-wide interior of the Coca-Cola bottle hanging 70 feet above 2 Times Square. But workmen like Rob Martini, pictured above crouching to replace a lamp, jam themselves at least three times a week in the space, which is chock-full with steel girders, ladders, platforms, hot lights and 60 miles of fiber-optic cable. Built by Artkraft in 1990, the sign has an intentionally retro look: the top pops off the bottle; color wheels change the hue of the bottle so that it appears to fill up and then to empty; a cascade of more than 5,000 lights offers a changing array of Coke logos. Laszlo Szabo (above center) sits 20 blocks away from the high-wattage, in a room at the Artkraft offices, programming messages for Coke and two more of Times Square's biggest signs -- Suntory Whisky and the Biography Channel. Life for Szabo, a 46-year-old native of Hungary known to his colleagues as Laszlo the Wizard, is about to get even more interesting. Sign designers are working to create signs with ever-more advanced L.E.D. panels, signs that people will be able to communicate with as they walk by, and -- the Holy Grail of signage -- signs that will use holograms to catch our attention. -- reported by Hope Reeves; (Stephen Wilkes)

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
A Rare Opportunity For Real Architecture Where It's Needed

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
WE were getting a lot of mail from readers complaining that I never write about New York buildings, so my employers decided to build one. Not just any building, but a work of architecture, a project with the potential to raise the quality of building in New York. Last week, when I learned that Renzo Piano had been chosen to design the new headquarters for The New York Times, I knew that we had such a project.
The intended site is the east side of Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The plan depends on the approval of the board of directors of The New York Times Company, as well as city and state permits to lease the site. Piano was chosen from among three finalists. The others were the British architect Sir Norman Foster and Cesar Pelli of New Haven. The architects of a fourth proposal, Frank O. Gehry and David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill, withdrew from the competition several weeks before the final choice was made. 
 The images of all four plans presented in these pages, including Piano's, are studies. The goal of the selection process was to choose an architect rather than a design. In a process like this, it is common for a proposal to undergo substantial revision after the architect is chosen. Architect and client may even decide to start again from scratch. The client is looking for a set of intangibles: a texture of thought, a feeling of compatibility, the sense that something historical has been set in motion by the first encounter.
It is too soon to evaluate Piano's design, and it will never be possible to assess what the other finalists might have done. But it is not premature to talk about some of the issues raised by the proposals, and by the selection process itself. Nor is it too soon to state that Piano has been given the chance, and unquestionably possesses the skills, to design the most important corporate skyscraper to be built in New York since Eero Saarinen's CBS Building in 1965.
I am a part of this story, a footnote who gets to tell the tale. At the invitation of Michael Golden, the vice chairman of The New York Times Company, and with the approval of my editors, I met periodically, over a six-month stretch, with the group responsible for choosing an architect for the new Times building.
I had serious reservations about crossing the line from the news department to the corporate side of the paper. The Times does not permit its critics to serve on arts juries. This policy is wise, not only because it constrains us from abusing the authority of the newspaper and from potential conflicts of interest. More important, sitting on a jury removes us from our natural habitat -- the realm of ideas and values and their artistic expression -- where we go in search of stories. That realm is our reality.
I am not a disengaged critic. The cultural dimension of building stirs me emotionally. I have minimal interest in personalities or politics, except as these play out on a symbolic or allegorical plane. Architecture's practical dimension is one of the things that make it exciting to write about, but the practicalities do not lack outspoken advocates. The metaphoric dimension is less easily grasped, particularly in a city like New York, which has seen solittle thoughtful architecture in recent years.
THIS is where a critic can be useful. The symbolic level is where architecture itself kicks in. When it does, land use rises above the level of real estate speculation. Buildings earn the space they occupy on other than economic terms. Defining those terms is what a critic does. More important, his job is to insist that those terms, while not quantifiable, are as substantial as the materials from which buildings are made and the money it costs to build them. My job is to say: architecture is real. Over the months, I had ample opportunity to do my job. I also learned about factors that have eroded New York's status as a city where serious architecture is possible.
The selection of an architect for The Times building was conducted as a 50-50 partnership between The New York Times Company and Forest City Ratner, a real estate development firm whose projects include Metrotech, the office complex in downtown Brooklyn. The Times building will be slightly under 700 feet, or 45 stories, tall. The lower half of the tower will be occupied by the paper's newsroom, its business division and corporate offices. Space in the top half will be leased to outside tenants. A six-story base will include an atrium for shops and restaurants and an auditorium for lectures, forums and other public events. Forest City plans to occupy one floor of office space. The Times assumed primary responsibility for selecting an architect.
I attended meetings of the Design Advisory Group, composed of staff members of The Times and Forest City, occasionally joined by representatives of the 42nd Street Redevelopment Authority, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, and of the Economic Development Corporation, a city agency. A smaller group was designated to arrive at a consensus on the final choice.
I'm not going to report on what transpired behind closed doors. Here, I want to sort out some thoughts that occurred to me in the course of looking at the four finalists' designs At the last meeting I attended, when there was movement to revive a proposal that had been previously passed over, someone present observed aloud that we seemed to be on shifting ground. I felt I had been on shifting ground the entire six months.
In fact, architecture itself is always on shifting ground. Architects try to pin down ideas that are floating in the cultural atmosphere, chief among them, perhaps, the evolving relationship of self to community in a modern democracy. There's nothing inherently stable in that relationship, or in the processes architects and clients use to articulate it in urban space.
The guidelines for the selection process were prepared by the client partners and presented in impressively large, handsome books. The guidelines struck me as a road map to mediocrity. In the criteria for evaluating previous work of the firms being considered, "architecture" was folded in with objective standards, like whether a firm produces works within budget and has extensive experience with skyscraper design. The truth is that architecture can't be quantified. And to judge from recent additions to the New York cityscape, prior experience with skyscraper design struck me as possible grounds for disqualification.
Architecture, meanwhile, was defined as "compatible/compelling design vocabulary." If compatible meant contextual, this standard was an open invitation to all kinds of mischief. Architecture should contribute to, rather than fit in with, its surroundings. Compelling, besides being generally incompatible with compatible, suggested to me a standard of formal values more suitable for architectural photography and rendering than for architecture itself. The concept is oblivious of the relational values from which architecture is made: of outside to inside; top to bottom; structure to expression; content to form.
Somehow, however, we got from that unpromising start to a stunning outcome. Renzo Piano's design embodies those relational values, and others, in radiant form.
Piano, who has offices in Genoa and Paris, is the world's greatest living practitioner of what I call "normative" architecture. Others call it "the classical humanist tradition," which sounds more dignified. But why not just come out and say it? He's Italian.
Piano's aesthetic is as much urban as it is architectural. All Italians know that when you get a bit of money, you do something to ornament the city. You put up a church, create a nice civic square, commission a statue. Then, when the money goes away, the church is still standing. The statue remains. As Piano mentioned to me, "even when people are poor, they don't have to live in a poor way." They still have the richness of their surroundings. He has brought that philosophy to projects in Berlin, Paris, Sydney and other centers of cosmopolitan life.
We're at the crest of a building boom in New York. The city is feeling very rich. But with a few exceptions -- Columbus Center, the Rose Earth and Space Center at the Museum of Natural History, LVMH Tower -- I see few buildings that will be worth preserving for the future. In fact, if it were possible to cancel most of the current construction, the world would be a better place. The 1980's, too, were a time of vast mediocrity. What Piano brings to the job, apart from his talent, is a deeply ingrained sense of civic responsibility, a conviction that The Times must give back, through architecture, the good fortune it has enjoyed.
I don't want to make too much about Piano's Renaissance humanist lineage. He lives in different times. Nonetheless, he shares with Michelangelo, da Vinci and Brunelleschi the belief that art and science exist within the same cultural continuum. This idea has been evident from the first building that brought Piano wide recognition: the Pompidou Center in Paris, designed in collaboration with Richard Rogers and completed in 1977. Controversial when new, the this exoskeletal structure set off a debate that helped make it the most visited tourist attraction in Paris. For The Times project, Piano will employ new techniques in structural engineering, vertical circulation and curtain wall construction, in association with Fox & Fowle, the architects of the Conde Nast and Reuters buildings in Times Square.
ISEE The Times project, in its present form, as a work of urban landscape. The building's base, which Piano describes as Baroque, is made of concrete slabs that float, at 11 different levels, around three sides of a central atrium. The programming of this space needs work. The Baroque idea (to draw people in) is valid. Once there, people should experience something beautiful. Current renderings, however, show something like a media mall, in a Fun Palace configuration that recalls the work of the British architect Cedric Price from the 1960's. There is too little contrast with the city outside.
Anyone who has gone for a ride on the Pompidou's escalator knows that Piano is a great poet of circulation. Now he is playing with ways to organize the tower's elevators. Instead of a central elevator core, he prefers a side arrangement that would give office floors the spaciousness of a piazza. What I'm waiting for, however, is to see how he plans to connect the building to the Eighth Avenue subway and Port Authority station. The connection could turn the tower into an infrastructural midtown gateway.
Piano has planned additional landscape features for two upstairs levels. He envisions the roof of the base as the site for a water park, a shallow pool that would reflect the tower on its surface and bounce sunlight back up onto the tower's skin. This poetic device could become a setting for instant squalor, not to mention a source of leaks. There will be a garden on the roof, protected by extensions of the glass curtain wall above the building envelope.
What is New York's cityscape about? Escaping gravity and heaviness without losing touch with the ground. The Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, the Seagram Building and other New York landmarks embody this idea. For The Times tower, Piano has designed a triple-skin wall that lifts the material city's grid into a metaphysical realm. A thermal wall of double-pane panel is shielded on the exterior by a sunscreen of white ceramic rods. These last are interrupted at eye-level by bands of fixed, slender blinds. Inside the offices, movable blinds or shades will increase the layers to four.
Piano has used this system before, usually in combination with orange masonry panels. Here, the metal, glass and ceramic surface will shimmer without interruption across the entire expanse of wall. Indentations at the corners will allow the expression of the walls as independent planes. This effect will be heightened by the extension of the glass high above the roof line.
Piano uses terms like vibration, breathing and magic to describe what he calls the "immaterials" of architecture. It is with these qualities that the reality of his architecture resides. But he comes from a family of builders. And he works within a tradition of close collaboration between architects and those who fabricate their work. He reminds us that the term design originated in the Renaissance with the Italian word for drawing. The concept signified the architect's emergence as a specialist apart from building. From it, we derive the conception of architecture as the meeting ground for matter and mind. Piano will invite New York to revisit that ground.
Cesar Pelli designed a perfect bullseye for those who can't help enlisting The Times as a target for resentment. Pelli is the house architect of the monoculture, a designer of iconic corporate towers that bear less relationship to their surroundings than to other corporate icons around the world. To create these, he often borrows forms from the iconography of ancient authoritarian regimes. At the World Financial Center in Battery Park City, for example, the four towers are variously crowned with a pyramid, a ziggurat, a dome and a mastaba.
Pelli's use of these symbols reflects the formalist idea that they have been cleansed of their original meanings by subsequent usage and can now be appreciated as abstract geometric shapes. I never bought this idea, and Pelli's design for Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, based as it is on regional motifs, suggests that Pelli himself is prepared to abandon it when he chooses. In any case, the triumph of formalism was never so complete that viewers aren't free to locate meanings even where the architect chooses to deny them.
For The Times proposal, Pelli selected the obelisk, that most ancient authoritarian symbol. Since its appearance in ancient Egypt, the obelisk has been recontextualized many times over. Its meaning has changed in each context. In Baroque Rome, it represents the triumph of the Christian church over pagan superstition. In Washington, it is a tribute to the symbolic founder of the first modern democracy. In New York, it is the archetypal skyscraper, a sign of material aspiration.
But we are living in a time when our liveliest minds are engaged in challenging forms of authority and the codes that represent it. Hierarchy, paternalism, control: visual symbols cannot, after all, be detached from the power relationships that govern social behavior. Indeed, globalization, and its monocultural effects, have made it ever more urgent to reject the idea that symbols can be used as purely abstract forms. It is an assertion of social and artistic responsibility to insist that forms have meanings.
One of the things we know about the monoculture is that it is protean. Its appearance constantly morphs. This mutability diverts attention from the fact that the underlying economic power relationships remain the same. Pelli's design, for example, draws from a recent avant-garde preoccupation with folded planes. This motif has appeared in the work of Peter Eisenman and others. A high-style French version of it materialized in New York last year in Christian de Portzamparc's glass facade for the LVMH Tower on 57th Street.
PELLI has regularized the folded plane motif, and in doing so turned its meaning into the opposite of that intended by architects associated with this motif. Others have used the folded plane to challenge classical notions of hierachy. Pelli's obelisk affirms them. It is symmetrical. It is without scale. The pattern of its window mullions is nearly identical throughout. From top almost to bottom, it is an authoritarian object.
On the ground floor, the motif changes. The obelisk rests on a "happy face" base of retail shops. This, too, is part of the monocultural structure. Buy a pair of khakis. Consume the festival atmosphere. Literally support what some might call your oppressors, the folks who peer down from the structure's upper floors.
I was disheartened by the inclusion of Pelli among the finalists. Evidently, my message about the reality of architecture wasn't getting through. I could accept that this slick corporate object might represent a developer's view of The Times. I could not accept that it represented the paper's view of itself. Yes, The Times is a powerful institution, but of a particular kind. It is not part of so-called "black car" culture. We take subways. The newsroom reaches daily toward the Enlightenment ideals of free speech and independent inquiry, however imperfectly. The newsroom itself, as well as its coverage of news, has been powerfully affected by debates over authority that have unfolded in architecture and throughout the culture. The paper has the responsibility to challenge and correct, not blindly affirm, the corporate world's view of itself.
Pelli's obelisk stood as aloof from these issues as it did from the site's physical context. Aloofness, in fact, is what clients hire Pelli to provide. This arm's-length attitude extends to Pelli's relationship to his own buildings. The architect, an agreeable man, likes to tell potential clients that, in his native Spanish, pelli means skin, and thus he naturally came to think of the building skin as the essence of architecture. He leaves most of the rest to specialists in other fields.
It is true that there are many historical precedents for emphasizing facade design over space and structure. It is also true that Mr. Pelli has designed some attractive building skins. But the thing to bear in mind is that the equation of architecture with building skins is what most developers want to believe. They want the image of architecture without the expense and inconvenience of the real thing. Pelli provides that image for people whose interest lies in denying architecture's reality. This denial goes far toward explaining why New York architecture is in such bad shape. Why go through this process to end up with more of the same?
Norman Foster also creates power fetishes, but they are unquestionably works of architecture. Their elegance is mathematical as well as esthetic. Sir Norman Foster thinks holistically. He gets his mind around structure, space, program and image, making of them an integrated system. He turns problem-solving into art. And he is acutely responsible to the well being of those who inhabit his buildings.
His proposal for The Times didn't work for the clients, who saw it as not sufficiently flexible to accommodate the building's lease tenants. The design is a space frame in the shape of a right triangle. Along the hypotenuse, winter gardens were planned at intervals of seven stories. Each seven-story segment was conceived as a village in a vertical urban stack. The effect was an apotheosis of the New York set-back.
The combination of three (sides) and seven (floor intervals) illustrates the mystical-mathematical fascination of Foster's work. What I liked best about this plan was the implied shapes that would result if the triangle were multiplied. Double, turn upside-down, and you get a rectangular solid. Double this, and you arrive at a square. Viewers may well have perceived these ghost shapes in the midtown context.
Anyone who is less than 100 percent enthusiastic for a Foster building in New York must feel like the ingrate of all time. I prize few qualities higher than rational thought. But I don't fully trust its architectural expression. My generation was strongly influenced by Robert Venturi's 1966 book, "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture." We came to appreciate the non-straightforward, the hybrid, the slightly deranged. Some of also us came to suspect that pure rationality too often serves to mask a highly irrational will to power.
At my last meeting with the group, someone asked which of the four proposals I preferred. I replied that if I were in their shoes, I would find it painful to choose between Piano and Gehry/Childs. The two teams had not designed equally good versions of the same thing. They had designed two different things. Two entirely different beasts. One rational and classic, the other Romantic and Gothic. Unlike the 19th-century critics who debated which style was best, we know that classical and Gothic represent more than different tastes. They correspond to different mental faculties, the right and left sides of the brain. Yet Piano's design is clearly sensuous, and Gehry/Childs's design incorporates the classicism of the International Style.
The truth is, I was madly in love with the Gehry/Childs proposal. Gehry's work will do that to you. It doesn't want you to keep your distance. From the outset, Gehry had told the clients he intended to design them "an object of desire." He and Childs made good on the promise. As I sit here, I'm looking at a six-inch-tall glass model of their design. Am I a masochist, or what?
I will have the opportunity to write about the Gehry/Childs proposal next May, when models and sketches of it will be part of the Gehry retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. I need the distance, after all. For now, my attraction to it is based on my preoccupation with dualisms, on the cultural as well as the psychological plane. I believe collaboration between "name" architects is the wave of the future. The Gehry/Childs plan was a true collaboration, by two outstanding architects of different cities, skills and outlooks, who between them produced a major miracle.
There has been speculation about why the Gehry/Childs team withdrew. Mine is that the proposal was defeated by the very factors that made it great: the attempt to create a shared reality from four different points of view. However much they may have agreed on economic and practical matters, The Times and the developers represented two cultures. This made for unusual discussions with all the teams but Pelli's, who alone among the four finalists has embraced with something like passion the pragmatics of commercial real estate development. With the Gehry/Childs proposal, the structure changed shape. What was, in effect, a three-way conversion was enlarged to four. The lines of communication increased exponentially.
Partnerships between two firms are common in architecturally ambitious projects. Usually, however, tasks are divided between a signature, so-called "design architect" and an "executive architect," reponsible for more detailed drawings and other construction documents. This will be the arrangement between Renzo Piano Building Workshop and Fox & Fowle. The Gehry/Childs team, however, was not usual. The two firms had to devise novel ways to implement a pioneering arrangement. They, too, represented two cultures. The clients had to believe that the arrangement between them could work in practical terms.
Could four cultures intertwine? Where would the design work be done? Would the architects' two staffs get along? Would David Childs feel overshadowed by Frank Gehry? Would there be overlap between tasks? Would this affect fees? The share value of Times stockholders? Who would be in charge? Would the curtain wall work? Could the clients accept that, under any circumstances, architecture cannot be achieved by relying on standard real estate procedures? Given the ambition of this proposal, and the city's virtual innocence of all things architectural for many years, such obstacles to realization were inevitable.
Another factor must be confronted. Its name is love. In a 1959 essay on "The Sublime and the Good," Iris Murdoch writes: "Art and morality are, with certain provisos, one. Their essence is the same. Love is the perception of individuals. Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real."
Frank Gehry has always insisted that to do his best work, he needs a close relationship with a strong client. What he is really saying is that he needs a client's love. This is not a diva thing that suddenly came over him when he became the It Architect. To judge by a 1969 interview about the client-architect relationship, published in Designers West, Gehry has been saying the same thing all along. His job is to empathize with the client's reality. He expects the same
IT has always been clear that Gehry packs emotion into his work. What is less apparent is that much of this emotion emanates from his relationship to the client. In the case of the Times project, Gehry believed that he had demonstrated his affection for the paper by entering a competition in the first place (something he no longer does), by devoting much time, money and energy to the design (the Gehry/Childs design was the most highly developed of the four), and by producing a work that differs substantially from the Bilbao Museum and is in no sense inferior to it.
Gehry felt that his feelings were not reciprocated. This I understand completely. I once offered my resignation here for the simple reason that I felt I wasn't appreciated in proportion to the energy I was putting in. I was wrong, and so was Gehry. From the day he and Childs presented the project at 229 West 43rd Street, the tide of opinion began to shift in their direction.
For me, this shift was the most extraordinary part of the process. Just a week before, the clients had regarded Gehry with suspicion, as someone who might produce something unacceptably funny, weird or arbitrary. By the time the presentation was over, roughly half the people present had psychologically moved into the building. (Or so indicated a poll that was taken shortly therafter.) In fact, there is a great deal of passion circulating through 229 West 43rd Street. But The Times does not typically wear its heart on its sleeve. And I suspect that any developer's "due diligence" procedures are about as tender and heartwarming as a visit from the I.R.S.
This episode brings to mind a poem of Auden's:
If you see a fair form, chase it
And if possible embrace it,
Be it a girl or boy.
Don't be bashful: be brash, be fresh.
Life is short, so enjoy
Whatever contact your flesh
May at the moment crave:
There's no sex life in the grave.
But is this lusty philosophy suitable for what is still widely thought of as the newspaper of record?
Great buildings break rules. Piano will give us something subtler, more refined -- more normative -- than the design conceived by Gehry and Childs. Yet I'm confident that Piano's will be great. Since the 1970's, the reigning law in New York building has been: thou shalt not commit architecture here. That rule will now be shattered by Piano -- with luck, beyond repair.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
At SUNY in Farmingdale, a New Bioscience Park

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE

 BODY:
THE State University of New York at Farmingdale on Route 110 here has been given both a new grand entrance and a new mission with the recent opening of the first building at its Broad Hollow Bioscience Park.
The park, planned as an incubator designed eventually to nurture start-up companies in a supportive, relatively inexpensive university-related environment, is a collaborative venture of the college and the nearby Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading biological research institution. 
 The 50,000-square-foot, $15 million structure, which opened in September, is the first of what is hoped will be a cluster of similar buildings on the campus. The plan is that the other buildings will be devoted to helping fledgling bioscience companies bring science developed at research institutions like Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to commercial application.
Biotechnology uses living organisms, genetic studies and biological techniques developed through basic research to detect and treat disease. Products have included antibiotics, interferon, and insulin used in the treatment of diabetes.
The idea of bringing a biotechnology incubator to the Farmingdale campus was initiated by the college in 1997. An 11,000-square-foot pilot incubator for start-up manufacturing companies has been operating on the campus since 1996, and now houses eight start-ups.
The school, with 3,000 full-time students and 2,200 part-timers, changed from a two-year to a four-year institution in 1993. It wanted to have a place on campus where students could have hands-on experience using the technology they will be learning in the classroom, said Dr. Michael J. Vinciguerra, the school's acting president. The experience, Dr. Vinciguerra said, would be provided through internship programs and other interaction with commercial companies, "so we floated the idea of developing a research park on campus."
Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group, was asked to prepare a study for the college. It found that the proposed park would help foster the college's already extensive role in preparing skilled workers for the technology-based manufacturing jobs that had become the bedrock of the Long Island economy.
"We were already experiencing a shortage of skilled workers," Dr. Kamer said, "and developing a technical skill base was very important to help stimulate business activity around Route 110 and throughout Long Island."
The study caught the attention of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which had been looking for ways to keep the companies it licenses to develop commercial applications of its scientific discoveries from moving to areas like the 41-year-old Research Triangle Park in the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area. Out of 11 companies formed around technology developed at the laboratory, only four had remained on Long Island, said Dr. Kamer, who is on the board of the bioscience park.
ESTABLISHING a close-by bioscience business park where companies could become part of a cluster of science-based enterprises similar to those found in Raleigh, Boston, Princeton, N.J., and other areas was a way of "keeping our science and our scientists on Long Island," said John P. Cleary, chairman of the board of the bioscience park. New York State also saw the potential, and $15 million in state financing was approved for the first building.
Owned by the New York State University Construction Fund, the structure occupies 5 of 20 acres on the 380-acre campus that have been earmarked for the new park. The building is fully leased, with an anchor tenant, OSI Pharmaceuticals, taking 41,000 square feet under a 20-year lease, and the remaining space leased to three smaller tenants.
The smaller tenants pay annual rents of $15 to $17 a square foot, about 30 percent below the market rent of $23 a square foot that OSI, as an established company, will pay when it moves in about a year from now. As part of their leases, companies must agree to contribute through student internship programs and with guest lecturers to a biotechnology curriculum that the college expects to begin offering next year.
Although most of the new space has been taken by one large tenant, the 20-acre site allows up to 200,000 square feet of additional space to be built in two buildings that will be earmarked for small companies, said Greg Blyskal, the executive director of Broad Hollow Bioscience Park. The hope is to get a new building under way within 18 months. The cost, which will depend on size and design, and the financing have not yet been determined.
"The vital thing is to get a second building going and to continue the development of the cluster idea, because collaboration is one of the reasons companies move to North Carolina, the West Coast and other areas," Mr. Blyskal said. "Science is moving so fast that companies must develop a relationship with other companies in order not to fall behind."
Long Island already has several incubators, and more are in the planning stages. The State University of New York at Stony Brook was the first to develop the idea, and now has two such buildings, one devoted to biotechnology, the other to software start-ups. The university would also manage a proposed business incubator at Calverton, for which $3 million in state financing has been secured. Transfer of the 50-acre Calverton site, owned by the Town of Riverhead, requires approval of the town board. A public hearing is to be held on Nov. 8.
A 17,000-square-foot software incubator managed by the Long Island Software and Technology Network, known as LISTnet, a private membership group devoted to promoting Long Island's high-tech industry, opened at Briarcliffe College in Bethpage last year. And the North Shore/Long Island Jewish Health System has unveiled plans for an incubator program that would provide 25,000 square feet of new space for start-up companies in biotechnology and biomedical technology. The venture has received a $4.5 million state grant and will be situated on the North Shore University Hospital campus in Manhasset.
"The incubator concept is definitely growing, because it is such an important concept," said Peter Goldsmith, the president of LISTnet, which started with 50 members three years ago and now has 900. "It's not just the money," he added, referring to the fact that incubators usually charge below-market rents. "It's really about getting the support network that growing companies need."
Einhorn Yaffee Prescott Architects of Albany, working with Urbahn Associates of New York City, designed the Farmingdale building as a multitenant structure with 537-square-foot laboratory-equipped modules that could be interconnected depending on how much space a tenant wanted. The main entrance is through a lobby with a 30-foot-high atrium. Two wings lead out from the central spine.
THE decision to lease all but one wing to OSI Pharmaceuticals grew out of concerns that the company, which had outgrown its 35,000 square feet in Uniondale, might leave Long Island if it could not find suitable new space. Additionally, a large mature company serving as an anchor "will develop a momentum" and will help attract small start-up companies, said Mr. Blyskal, the park's executive director, likening the idea to a shopping mall where a quality anchor tenant helps attract satellite stores.
"We are cutting back on incubator space for the short term but we are not giving up on the longer-term goal of developing a biotech industry," he said.
OSI, established in 1983, grew out of research developed at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Its products include cancer-fighting drugs and pharmacological agents. Recently it also took over the management of clinical trials for one of its own drugs used to fight a broad spectrum of cancers, including lung cancer.
An additional $8 million in state funds has been obtained for a 13,500-square-foot extension of the Farmingdale building, to be built in the next year, that OSI is to use for its administrative offices, and to tailor the 41,000 square feet in the existing building to the company's requirements.
The building's three other tenants are BioSupplyNet, which moved into 1,070 square feet last month; Immuno-Rx, which expects to move into 535 square feet on Nov. 1; and a stem cell company, so new it has yet to be named, that is taking 4,280 square feet and is expected to arrive by the end of the year. Stem cells, the primordial cells from which all others emerge, have the ability to divide indefinitely and offer breakthroughs in treating serious disease. The other 3,000 square feet in the building is common space.
Two of the three companies grew out of work begun at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. One, BioSupplyNet, publishes a business directory called the Source Book that lists all the materials on the market that scientists might need. The other is the stem cell company.
Immuno-Rx, which is headquartered in Manhattan and is relocating its research laboratory from Tampa, Fla., to Farmingdale, works on medications that boost the immune response against cancer and certain viral diseases. The original research was developed at the University of South Florida Medical School in Tampa by the company's founder, Dr. John W. Hadden.
"Having a facility that will house a critical mass of scientific people and that has the support of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory was very important to us," said Dr. Harvey J. Brandwein, the company's president, explaining why Immuno-Rx chose to come to Farmingdale.

Rivals Combine to Develop Exxon Mobil Campus

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK

 BODY:
CORPORATE mergers breed real estate opportunities. Such an opportunity recently attracted two development companies that over the years have been both rivals and neighbors to become partners as well.
The Rockefeller Group Development Corporation of Manhattan and Gale & Wentworth, a real estate services and investment company of Florham Park, emerged earlier this month as the successful bidders for the former Exxon campus -- Exxon Mobil since last year -- along Route 24 and Park Avenue in this Morris County borough. The two-building 473-acre complex, which once housed Exxon's engineering division, was declared surplus when Mobil and Exxon merged last Nov. 30. So was Exxon's international headquarters site, a 47-acre four-building complex a half mile away, which is now being sold. 
 Most of the 1,000 employees at the larger site were relocated to Fairfax Va. Empty, it became one of the last prime commercially zoned parcels of any size left to develop in Florham Park, which like Morris County as a whole, has been the focus of considerable office construction in the past few years.
Each of the development partners has an office park flanking the Exxon site, on which they have joined forces to create a $400 million office park with 2.2 million square feet of space and such amenities as a day-care center, health club and hotel conference center. It will be built in the next five to seven years, with construction expected to start as early as next year, according to the partners.
Cooper, Robertson & Partners of Manhattan is developing the master plan for the project, which will be presented to the borough's planning board in the next 90 days. The Hillier Group of Princeton is the architect. A new interchange along Route 24 is also envisioned as part of the plan and would address existing traffic in the area -- a major community concern.
"A lot of work still needs to be done, but we're looking at the site's redevelopment as a positive," John N. Corica, the borough administrator for Florham Park, said, noting that if the interchange "can be done, it would solve many regional traffic issues."
The partners will close on the site after they secure local approvals. In addition, the interchange is subject to approval from the state. No one involved would disclose the price for the property, but real estate executives put it about $66 million.
While the project is seen as a natural extension of the partners' existing parks, it also reflects the continued evolution of the Route 24 office market. The artery, a 12-mile stretch completed about eight years ago, linked eastern Morris County to Newark International Airport via Interstate 78 in 15 minutes instead of 30 and spurred development around major crossroads.
To the north of the former Exxon parcel is Park Avenue at Morris County, the 100-acre 1.1 million-square-foot corporate center that Gale & Wentworth developed for the J. P. Morgan Investment Management Company in Manhattan, the park's owner. The park, which real estate executives say initiated the area's change to an office corridor, is fully leased. Gale & Wentworth is also developing two other projects in the county, with different investment partners, ultimately totaling one million square feet.
To the south is the Rockefeller Group Corporate Park, a 142-acre campus being developed by the Rockefeller Group, which is owned by Mitsubishi Estate and which formerly managed the landmarked Rockefeller Center for the Rockefeller family interests. The company still owns or manages four buildings on the west side of Avenue of the Americas that it considers part of Rockefeller Center. But its historic buildings on the east side of the Avenue have been owned since 1996 by an investment group led by Goldman Sachs, which is now selling them.
The Rockefeller Group in recent years has refocused on its role as a real estate developer. At its Rockefeller Group Corporate Park, the company has renovated two buildings, totaling 390,000 square feet, and is constructing a 220,000 square foot speculative building on the property, which could accommodate an additional structure the same size. In Mount Olive, farther west in the county, the group is developing the International Trade Center, where half of an eventual seven million square feet of office and industrial space has been built since construction at the 684-acre site began in 1984.
INITIALLY, the Rockefeller Group and Gale & Wentworth pursued the Exxon tract separately. But Leslie E. Smith Jr., senior vice president at the Rockefeller Group, said, "We're better off as a team, given we surround the property and the enormity of the project." Combining the expertise and financial resources of the companies reduces the risk to each one, he said, noting that "we are both long-term players."
Stanley C. Gale, chairman of Gale & Wentworth, said the partnership also provided the seller with "a comfort level and the assurance of our gaining all the approvals needed to proceed." In addition, "we have the staying power, to sustain and maintain the project," if the real-estate market were to experience a slump, he said.
Barry Wood, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, which has its headquarters in Dallas, said the ability to get approvals was a factor in his company's evaluation of potential buyers, as were the price and the development proposed for the site.
The joint venture is not a surprise in light of the location of the site and the similar corporate cultures of the companies, said Peter Blanchard, a principal at the Garibaldi Group, a brokerage in Chatham that is handling the sale of the smaller Exxon property. "Each didn't want to lose the site," he said. "There's a threshold to how high the bids could go before its redevelopment was no longer economical."
Joining forces also enables each to capitalize on the county's strong office market, where projects totaling 2.25 million square feet are in various stages of development. Most of the projects are in Parsippany as well as towns along Route 24, according to the Parsippany office of GVA Williams, the commercial brokerage.
The partners are confident that their new project will not compete with those projects nor their existing ones, and commercial brokers agreed. The pace of construction "is cautious, yet aggressive," Eric Witmondt, chief executive of GVA Williams, said, noting the buildings will be brought to the market at varying times.
Among the Route 24 projects is a 135,000-square-foot building that the Kushner Companies of Florham Park is constructing at the corner of Columbia Turnpike and Vreeland Road in Florham Park. Also, the Wm. Blanchard Company of Springfield is building a 150,000-square-foot speculative structure on Park Avenue at Columbia Turnpike and Route 24 in Hanover. Brokers said the building had been leased, a report company principals would not confirm.
Other developers have plans to start buildings. East of the Blanchard site on Route 24 in Florham Park, the M. Alfieri Company of Metropark is to start construction next spring on the initial phase of a 750,000-square-foot office park. The four buildings at the smaller Exxon Mobil site, the sale of which is believed to be imminent, are also expected to be renovated, according to brokers. The buyer is said to be the Advance Group of Bedminster. The company declined to comment.
Most of the buildings are leased before they are completed, Mr. Witmondt said, noting that as of the third quarter, the county's office vacancy rate was 7.7 percent and average rents had risen to $25.13 a square foot.
"Many companies from New York and Bergen County are moving west to Morris County, and those here are expanding, keeping the demand, particularly for large blocks of space, ahead of the supply, " he said. And users prefer a full-service campus environment because in a tight labor market it is seen as a way to attract and retain employees, he added.
That is what both Mr. Smith of the Rockefeller Group and Mr. Gale of Gale & Wentworth are betting on for the office park they will build on the former Exxon property. Mr. Gale said that if existing companies in the 165 million square foot northern and central New Jersey office market grew by 10 percent, this would generate a need for 16 million square feet. "And the state's core industries -- telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and financial services -- are growing, never mind outside companies moving in," he said.
Mr. Smith added that three companies needing 500,000 square feet each were interested in the site, and the developers hope to begin construction next year on up to 500,000 square feet, subject to borough approval. The intent, he said, is either to retrofit the site's two existing buildings, totaling 500,000 square feet, or raze them and build an equal amount of space, which could be supported by the existing road system.

HEADLINE: Making the Hudson Live Inside a Museum

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE Hudson River Museum sits amid green fields and river views, in a setting as gracious as the Victorian mansion from which it sprung. Until now, however, the river was merely a timeless backdrop, or the subject of paintings that hung on the museum's walls.
By next summer, however, the Hudson River will be a living presence at the museum, as fully described, illustrated and interpreted -- if the museum's education department fulfills its plans -- as any ecological system can be. The museum has announced a permanent installation called Hudson Riverama, a $1.25 million project expected to open next July. 
 "Our hope is that after seeing Riverama, our visitors will not look at the river the same way again," said Cathy Shiga-Gatullo, the museum's education director, who spearheaded the project.
Much of the building's first floor will be devoted to the interactive exhibition, which has been financed largely by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and $350,000 in state grants.
To accommodate the installation of six Hudson River habitats, a river lab and a resource area, several changes are planned. Two large open wells, architecturally distinguished by their balcony views, will be filled in to make room for the 4,575 square feet of exhibition material. In addition, the museum's western wall will be opened to offer a picture-window view of the river and its sunsets, providing a "portal onto the Palisades," as Fred Ellman of Roundtable Design in Tarrytown, the project's design company, put it.
An environment simulating a journey down the length of the river, from the Adirondacks to New York Harbor, is planned to encircle the Andrus Planetarium (which will be closed for two weeks when construction begins in February). Visitors will pass through habitats like highlands, tidal marsh, sandy bank and developed shore. Ambient sounds, light and video will accompany strollers. A "touch wall" in the form of a bas-relief will provide a sensory story without words, Mr. Ellman said, giving information about the flora and fauna comprising the food chain. In addition, the museum plans a ship-to-shore radio to allow visitors to communicate with passing ships.
The lab area will offer interactive videos, microscopes for viewing marine life and computer stations for recording weather and tidal data. Demonstrations and other activities will be conducted by a staff of volunteers.
The expected audience is school groups, families with young children and older adults, Ms. Shiga-Gattullo said.
She said the museum was not abandoning its artistic focus but, rather, elevating the science program to the level of the art and history programs. A strong environmental mission also underlies the project.
"One of our goals is to develop a sense of stewardship about the river in our viewers," she said.
The announcement was made in a museum gallery showing large watercolors of the river by Don Nice. John P. Cahill, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, was among the officials who attended. "The Hudson River symbolizes the renaissance of an environmental movement in New York State," he said.
Missing from the group was Philip Verre, the former museum director, who left last month to become the deputy director of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. A nationwide search for a new director -- someone who "can move between disciplines" -- is under way, Ms. Shiga-Gattullo said.
The museum, which still has $400,000 to raise for the the exhibition, has been approved for participation in the state's economic development zone tax credit program. Contributors who give more than $500 for Riverama qualify for a 25 percent tax credit against personal or corporate state income tax. In addition, the contributors may be eligible for a federal and state charitable deduction.
Mr. Ellman promised that Riverama would be "really cool."

HEADLINE: POLITICS;
Rivals for Congress Debate Who's More Middle Class

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Even before Larry Otis Graham officially declared last spring that he would challenge Representative Sue W. Kelly for her Congressional seat, the incumbent went on the offensive.
In a fund-raising letter sent out by her supporters last year, Mrs. Kelly, the Republican who has represented the 19th Congressional District since 1994, attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton as "a carpetbagging opportunist" and referred to Mr. Graham, a Democrat, as a "liberal journalist" recruited by the Clintons to defeat her. 
 If anything, relations between the two sides have deteriorated since then.
Until last week, the candidates had not met to debate the issues, and now they are not only questioning each other's politics but also their truthfulness and their economic and social backgrounds. Each is claiming, in effect, to be more middle class than the other and more in touch with voters.
There's no question that Mr. Graham, 38, has a certain star power for a first-time political candidate.
A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, he has written 13 books on education, labor and racial issues and has been a television commentator. He is perhaps best known for his 1992 article in New York magazine about posing as a busboy at the Greenwich Country Club to find out about racism and anti-Semitism there.
His efforts to research discrimination in large corporations helped lead to the successful class-action lawsuit against Texaco in 1997. His wife, Pamela Thomas-Graham, is chief executive of CNBC.com. They live with their 2-year-old son in Chappaqua, several blocks from the Clintons' house, and Mr. Graham said he has received campaign advice from the president.
Still, Mr. Graham faces an uphill battle.
With $650,000 in her campaign treasury, Mrs. Kelly has twice as much money as Mr. Graham. And the district, which covers part of White Plains and all of Westchester to the north, as well as Putnam County and parts of Orange and Dutchess Counties, is predominantly Republican.
Mrs. Kelly, 64, a former real estate broker, won the seat in 1994 and was re-elected handily in 1996 and 1998. She succeeded Hamilton Fish Jr., a moderate Republican, who held the seat for nearly three decades.
Mr. Graham has been campaigning since May, trying to convince voters that Mrs. Kelly has sided with the conservative Republican leaders of Congress, voting against the interests of the district.
"She claims to be a moderate, but she has not offered anything in moderation to this district except for service," he said in a forum last month in Chappaqua. He criticized her environmental record and her effectiveness in fighting for Medicare and aid to education.
He also said she has received almost half her funds from special interest groups, like the National Rifle Association.
He has called for more federal spending for education, specifically prekindergarten programs, and strengthening gun-control laws, including banning assault weapons.
He called Mrs. Kelly's failure to attend debates and candidate forums "a slap in the face of constituents who want dialogue."
Mrs. Kelly called such criticism innuendo and fear tactics. "I've worked really hard for the people in this district," she said, "and I think they know that."
She said she could not take part in debates before this week because she was "down in Washington, working for the people of my district." And she denied being in lock step with Republican leaders or being influenced by special-interest money.
Her priorities include saving Social Security and reforming Medicare to give the elderly different plans to choose from and coverage for prescription drugs. She also favors tax breaks for college tuition and eliminating the inequity in income tax rates for married people and the inheritance tax.
Mrs. Kelly supports the death penalty, while Mr. Graham supports a moratorium on it. Both candidates favor abortion rights, although Mrs. Kelly opposes so-called partial-birth abortion. She favors increased military spending, while he favors cuts.
Mr. Graham is hoping to benefit from Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. He has campaigned alongside the first lady in the district, and the president offered suggestions on strategy and campaign consultants.
The Kelly campaign, meanwhile, hopes to capitalize on antipathy toward the Clintons.
Her campaign has also raised questions about the way Mr. Graham describes himself to voters.
Long a prominent member of exclusive black social circles, Mr. Graham once lectured the intelligentsia. Now he is courting middle-class voters at Rotary Club meetings and train stations.
Before running for office, Mr. Graham proudly discussed driving his Jaguar, wearing expensive suits and dining in the best Manhattan restaurants. His home in Chappaqua has a swimming pool, a tennis court and a guest house.
Now, the Kelly campaign says, he is deceiving voters by offering himself up as a man of the people.
Many articles over the years have portrayed him as coming from an affluent family with a "a real estate developer" father and "a psychologist" mother.
But these days, Mr. Graham tells voters he grew up in a "union labor household" where his mother, a social worker, and his father, a mail carrier and firefighter, could not afford to pay his college tuition.
"As a candidate, Larry Otis Graham claims he grew up in a blue-collar family," said Rob Ostrander, a campaign spokesman for Mrs. Kelly, "but before running for political office, he described himself as 'elite.' It raises a question about who he is and where he comes from."
Mr. Graham dismissed such remarks as "a race to the bottom" strategy meant to skirt more substantive issues. His father only dabbled in real estate, he said, and their inheritance of an old family trucking fortune never amounted to much.
"Proving one of us has more middle-class roots than the other is ridiculous," he said. "She is the daughter of a doctor."

The Politician's Pollster: What Moves Voters?

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK

 BODY:
TWO presidents, Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela, and two prime ministers, Tony Blair and Ehud Barak, have turned to the pollster Stanley B. Greenberg for advice.
His polls are not for public consumption. The information gleaned from his polling efforts is shared with his clients, international and national, political and corporate. Dr. Greenberg's interest lies in managing social change and reform. 
 Recently Dr. Greenberg worked with his client Vice President Al Gore in what he called "debate camp" in Tennessee to prepare for each debate. He says the purpose of the polls is "to understand what's going on in the campaign and develop a strategy."
He has on occasion conducted polls together with Fred Steeper, Governor Bush's pollster on international affairs and foreign trade issues. They work together to reassure their clients that the polls will be nonpartisan.
He is interested in the process. "Who's ahead is the least interesting part of a poll. The poll is about understanding the dynamics of the election and then figuring out how to move the voters to a different place than they are now."
Dr. Greenberg believes that the traditional method of polling by telephone is on the way out. Often his staff must make 20 calls to reach one human.
With the advent of fax machines and answering machines, voice mail and screening and the strong aversion people have to being called by strangers, he says, "Vote polling is in trouble." And he explained that his set of questions lasts 25 minutes. He predicts that Internet polling will become commonplace within two to four years.
He polls out of political conviction and carefully selects for whom he will work. "I work for people I believe in. It's part of the kind of political progress I want to see made." Recently Dr. Greenberg met at his home that he shares with his wife, United States Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, in New Haven to discuss his work. Following are excepts from that conversation:
Q. Do poll results influence voters' decisions?
A. I don't believe that and I also don't think that shows enough respect for voters. I think voters take the election very seriously. They know this is an important election. Who gets elected president effects their lives. There is no evidence that they follow the crowd or pundits. If the public followed pundits then Bill Clinton would have been out of office a long time ago.
Throughout the entire time of Monica Lewinsky, the entire impeachment process, time after time, the pundits said "this is the big moment, he's gone," "now he's truly jeopardized his position." They were always wrong. All they had to do was go to a focus group and listen to people who were very thoughtful about it. They had very well developed views of how to judge a president and were balancing some very important things in a very serious way. But they weren't listening to the pundits about how what judgment they should make about the president. They were not going to allow the elite to take away their election. They elected Bill Clinton president. They didn't elect the Republican congress.
Q. Are polls ever inaccurate?
A. Sure they are, though not usually. Usually it's a problem of interpretation rather than the polls being wrong. One problem that you have with polls is the press focuses on the most extreme poll. On any given day you take six, seven polls that are out there. If you take the average that's probably close to where the race is. That's because of sampling theory. There is going to be a distribution around a real value in the middle. But the press wants to write about the most interesting one, the one that is the most different is the one they write about. That's the one that is most likely to be wrong. Not that it was badly done. Polls will have a distribution of samples that will vary. That will always happen. Go to the average, go to the most boring poll, the one that's in the middle of the pack, and probably it's the one that is the closest. So the press will overinterpret the polls, the one that is most extreme.
Q. How do you assess the undecided voting bloc in your polls?
A. Figuring out what is going to happen to the undecided vote is the most difficult, most complex part, of figuring out an election. Usually when you have an incumbent who is very well known, such as Bill Clinton was in 1996, he doesn't get any of the undecided vote. There's a reason why they are holding back. They are not saying what that is. Bill Clinton polled 49 percent. And he got 49 percent. All the undecideds went someplace else.
The difficulty with this election is Al Gore is not quite an incumbent. And you have an election where many more people think the country is moving in the right direction. This is not a "throw the bums out election." People would like to preserve a lot of what's going right and so it's complex to gauge the undecideds. The problem is not the accuracy of polls. The problem is interpreting them.
Q. How do you conduct a poll?
A. I don't believe in doing just polls. I always do focus groups. In a presidential campaign you poll quite regularly. We'll do two or three national polls a week. In addition to that every night we'll have focus groups. We bring a couple of groups of 10 people together in a room. Usually they are people who are like-minded and undecided, people who say they are Bush voters and who say they are open to Gore. People who are the kind of voters we need to reach. Also demographically similar so that they are comfortable. We don't mix post graduates with high school graduates because the post graduates will dominate and there will be a kind of deference to them on issues that they don't deserve. We have demographic homogeneity so people are comfortable. I always separate women from men so women can bond to each other faster. These sessions last two hours maximum.
Q. When you do these groups abroad do you find any differences?
A. In France, when I do these they last about five hours. We serve wine and dinner. It's a very relaxed, full evening. It's an intense intellectual experience. It doesn't matter whether it's a working class group or college educated group. It's a very different environment. The goal is the same, to make people comfortable.
Usually here it's done in a mall because people are comfortable going to a mall, a public place where people get together. In Britain, we do it in people's houses. Americans would not be so comfortable going into people's houses.
Q. What factors do voters consider as they choose between Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush?
A. They are trying to make an assessment. Is he real? Is he genuine? Does he have a record that says can he can really do this, make a difference? They think, "I don't want to be disappointed. I don't want to believe this is just a bunch of promises. I want to know whether this can be done. That we can afford it. That it will effect my life and the country."
These are underlying fundamentals that have to do with the issues and have to do with the economy.

HEADLINE: Keeping Homeowners in Their Homes

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
TWO weeks after Vehronna Smith bought her five-story, five-apartment brownstone on Dean Street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last March, she slumped onto the old, crooked hallway stairs, wept and said to herself, "Oh God, what have I done?"
Ms. Smith, 32, a singer and writer, had lived with her father and brother in the ground-floor apartment for three years, renting for $875 a month, before jumping at a sudden chance to buy the building. 
 That day, two weeks after the closing, she climbed to the top floor, talked with one of her old neighbors/new tenants, and found out that in winter the heat never rose beyond the second floor. "The tenants froze last year," the fledgling landlord said. "I didn't know because our heat was just fine on the first floor. The boiler wasn't large enough to pull for the entire building; it needed replacing."
On the way down, Ms. Smith twisted her ankle on the warped stairs, sat and cried. "I was thinking I had stumbled into the money pit," she said.
And the boiler was just the beginning.
Each year, thousands of new homeowners and small landlords in the city and suburbs find they have tumbled into a money pit, buried beneath bills for some unanticipated major expense or tripped by a sudden drop in income because of difficulties like the loss of a job, an illness or divorce.
To keep those people in their homes, to support the willing but beleaguered landlord and to maintain the quality of housing stock, an array of private and government programs provide assistance -- sometimes independently, often in tandem. The programs offer aid ranging from low-interest loans and debt consolidation to teaching people how to balance their budgets; from a horde of volunteer fixer-uppers descending on needy homes one Saturday morning to teaching a new homeowner how to use a power saw. One organization, in New Britain, Conn., ran what it called a tool lending library, until it discovered that too many tools were too overdue.
"So many people come to us in some sort of trouble, delinquent," said Francine Justa, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, a nonprofit group that operates 11 offices in the five boroughs. "Somebody buys a house for the first time and then they start spending more money on furniture, dishes, supplies, putting themselves further into debt."
The rate of homeownership in the United States hit an all-time high during the second quarter of this year -- 67.1 percent -- fueling and, in part, fueled by a significant expansion of the mortgage market.
There are pitfalls.
"Part of the big push to expand homeownership has been to adopt less stringent underwriting criteria," said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation. "Lenders are allowing people to carry much more debt, relative to their income, than they used to. So a lot of mortgages are now written for people who need to pay at least 40 percent of their gross income to pay their debt" -- leaving them vulnerable to unforeseen expenses.
That trend is one of the factors that have helped spur foreclosure-prevention programs, both for the individual homeowner and, particularly in the city, the struggling small landlord.
Some buyers don't understand even the basics of what they are getting into. "When I first started working in this field," said Ms. Justa of Neighborhood Housing Services, "I got a call from somebody we had just helped into homeownership, and she asked when the man was coming to cut the grass. She had always rented an apartment. I realized we needed to do a little more education."
Jerilyn Perine, New York City's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, sees aid to homeowners as part of a larger picture. "It's part of our overall anti-abandonment strategy," she said, "which for us means preserving buildings, particularly multiple dwellings; keeping them in the hands of owners who are capable, struggling a little, but who with some help could do a good job." No small aim of the effort, she said, "is to ensure that conditions for tenants are appropriate."
It took teamwork between Commissioner Perine's department and Ms. Justa's Neighborhood Housing Services to, figuratively at least, lift Ms. Smith off that warped staircase.
Ms. Smith and her family moved into the brownstone on Dean Street in April 1997. Three days later, her mother died "in the middle of the living room," she said, "before we even had a phone."
Over the next three years, the building changed hands three times -- the last, with Ms. Smith buying it for $350,000, on March 24. "I bought it, honestly," she said, "because, with it being the last place that my mom was alive, sometimes you have to listen to that voice even if you don't understand. The voice is saying, 'Do this, it will pay off later.' "
And beyond that inner urging, there was the very concrete revival of the neighborhood. "The area is rising so much," Ms. Smith said. "Every week there are people coming who have literally been priced out of Manhattan."
But first there was that feeble boiler to deal with, and those stairs. "And the windows are cheap and leaky," Ms. Smith continued -- and continued. "The apartment doors are glorified bedroom doors. Floors are crooked, just carpeted over. Kitchens and bathrooms need to be updated. The backyard needs a fence. The back of the house needs new pointing. And those hall stairs are going to be completely replaced, new banisters."
A lot of money was needed. "Conventional lenders don't even want to talk about a renovation to someone who has owned a building for less than three years," Ms. Smith said. "And if you can convince one, you're going to have an interest rate almost double the mortgage; someone mentioned 15 to 18 percent."
Then Ms. Smith saw a cable-television news story about how the housing department offers low-interest loans to owners interested in rehabilitating their properties. "My property was definitely sickly, on life support," she said.
Five days after Ms. Smith made the call -- to (212) 863-5300 -- a financial analyst from the department's Owner Services Program inspected her property, contacted Neighborhood Housing Services and began arranging an $82,500 renovation loan at 8 percent interest over 30 years.
"They gave me a list of approved contractors," Ms. Smith said. "I interviewed a dozen until I found someone I was comfortable with. I even went to see a sample of his work. He handles everything from wood to metal to sheetrock to plumbing to heating and electric." Work is to begin within a month, with the agencies monitoring progress.
"They are directly responsible for me seeing it as a dream house, instead of a nightmare," Ms. Smith said.
FINANCIAL assistance arranged through the housing department can help dissipate anything from a nightmare to an annoyance. "We have little loans, up to $7,500 per unit, at 1 percent interest, under the Code Compliance Loan Program," Commissioner Perine said. "It's there to remove code violations or replace one building system."
There are also "deeper subsidies," she said, under the Participation Loan Program (participation with a bank), for extensive rehabilitation, typically in buildings of 20 units or more.
"An owner comes to us," Ms. Perine said. "We go through a review. The bank does the actual underwriting. We add our money into the bank loan, at 1 percent. The bank has its own market rate. We will sometimes lend up to 50 percent. So the outcome is a below-market loan to complete a very substantial rehabilitation. Generally, we're seeing rehab work at $40,000 to $50,000 per unit."
"And there are three other loan programs in between those extremes," she said. The department also offers free classes for landlords on property management, finances, building systems, and energy, heat and water conservation.
The frequency with which neophyte home buyers and close-to-the-profit-margin landlords slip into financial trouble has been exacerbated -- perhaps ironically in the robust housing economy -- by the ready availability of financing for what the mortgage industry refers to as the nation's traditionally "underserved" population.
"There has been a marked increase in the availability of mortgage financing, both in the conventional market and from subprime sources," said Naomi Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation. Subprime mortgages are offered at higher than conventional interest rates to people with less than stellar credit histories.
"There's been a proliferation of subprime lending over the last five years," Ms. Bayer said. "There's a market for it, and there are investors willing to provide capital."
In fact, according to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, 14.9 percent -- or 2.1 million -- of all mortgages originated in the United States in 1999 went to subprime borrowers. "Over 90 percent of subprime loans have been made in the last six years," Ms. Bayer said, "and the subprime market has grown roughly 30 percent each year over the previous year during that time."
Despite the record length of the nation's economic growth, mortgage foreclosure rates have risen steadily in recent years. In 1980, for example, the default rate for conventional mortgages was 0.25 percent; in 1990 it was 0.83 percent and last year it was 1.02 percent.
"That would be around half a million foreclosures a year just for conventional mortgages," Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation said.
When combined with defaults for federally insured mortgages and subprime mortgages, which go into foreclosure at a rate of 6 percent a year, Dr. McCarthy calculated, there were more than 1 million defaults in 1999.
"That's a lot," he said. "Granted we have 70 million homeowners, but still a million is a lot of defaults, especially in a robust economy."
For Yanick Charles, who once found herself teetering near the financial brink, it is little things -- like the window-well cover she installed herself -- that are keeping her and her 9-year-old daughter, Gina, in their three-bedroom brick home in the Clifton section of Staten Island.
Ms. Charles, 47, a single mother, has taken every foreclosure-prevention course offered by Neighborhood Housing Services, including the 10-week home maintenance workshop taught by Carlton Brathwaite. "It's a hands-on program," she said. "We did electrical wiring, a little plumbing, working with sheetrock, installing parquet floors, working with power tools."
"Prevention is better than a cure," she said. "And if what I can do is not enough, I know my limits and call an expert."
Only five years ago, caught in a squeeze, Ms. Charles was way beyond her limits -- "a couple of tens of thousands" in debt after using her credit cards to pay mortgage bills.
AFTER renting the top floor of a two-family house in Jamaica, Queens -- "My baby wants to run, the people downstairs complain and I cannot hold her," she said -- Ms. Charles paid $115,000 for the house on Staten Island, with 20 percent down and a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 6.25 percent.
"I had my parents living with me then," the native of Haiti said. "They were both stroke patients, incapacitated. So, between my parents' pensions and my salary, I managed the household."
By 1995, however, both parents had to go into nursing homes. And then Ms. Charles lost her bookkeeping job. "I became sole proprietor with the same expenses and no income," she said.
And even after she was hired by S.I. Bank and Trust (S.I. for Staten Island), the hole deepened. "Between home expenses and day-care costs for the rest of the afternoon, I reached a point where this paycheck was not covering everything," she said. "My last resort was to use somebody else's money -- the card."
Finally, last December, "before the year 2000 kicks in," she said, "I decided to clean up my act."
Ms. Charles contacted the American Credit Alliance, a nonprofit organization that helps people consolidate their debt. "They negotiated with my creditors to have some of the rates lowered," she said, "and now they collect a set amount from me every month, $638, and dispatch the payments to each creditor. So I don't have them calling me."
"It's the better way to control things than paying 18 to 20 percent -- sometimes 24 percent -- on each of the credit cards," she said.
And over the last two years, Ms. Charles has taken courses in how to shop wisely, how to avoid foreclosure, fire prevention, water-damage prevention, insurance coverage and the myriad facets of home maintenance.
"It gives me confidence," she said, "and I'm optimistic that I can fix a situation, that they are temporary setbacks."
Not everyone can fix a situation themselves. And so, along with about 100 groups across the country, volunteers from the Neighborhood Housing Services branch in New Britain, Conn., participate in Christmas in April.
"We take people from a local business or a church and, with volunteer labor and donations, renovate 20 houses a year, all on one Saturday," said Christine Traczyk, the director of New Britain housing services.
A committee reviews applications from elderly and low-income homeowners. "Every house is different," Ms. Traczyk said. Some require painting, others need a new floor, a window or a door. "We've done two roofs, kitchens, bathrooms," she said. "One year we completely constructed a deck on a home for physically challenged people."
"Twenty-five to 30 volunteers descend on this homeowner at 8 in the morning," Ms. Traczyk said. "And about 5 o'clock, we all gather for a big picnic."
Not even counting the social value of keeping people in their homes, the cost effectiveness derived from the panoply of foreclosure-prevention programs was indicated by a study conducted over the last five years by the Family Housing Fund of Minneapolis.
Between 1991 and last December, said Pam Zagaria, its vice president, the fund and three other groups provided foreclosure counseling and, often, financial assistance to 2,265 households. "Of those, 1,073 had their mortgages reinstated," Ms. Zagaria said.
The program's total cost by the end of 1999 was $3.3 million.
"We divided that by the number of mortgages reinstated," Ms. Zagaria said, "and the average program cost for each reinstated mortgage was $3,075."
"Then," she said, "we calculated the total savings -- to the homeowner in terms of equity, the unreimbursed costs to the lender, to the loan insurer, to the loan servicer, to the city if a house becomes vacant and boarded, and the decline in property values -- and it ranged from $27,000 to $75,000."
There is no way to calculate the savings, emotional as well as financial, reaped by Myla Jones after she received support from the Long Island Housing Partnership.
Ms. Jones, 36, a teacher from Copiague in Suffolk County, is raising her four children herself. Her estranged husband, she said, has barely helped with child support or payments on the three-bedroom ranch.
"Four kids," she said, "and I was trying to pay the mortgage, a car loan, food, you name it; credit cards. By '98, I owed five months, and I'm drawing from savings to make the payments."
To avoid foreclosure, Ms. Jones declared bankruptcy and underwent debt reorganization, requiring her to pay $1,000 a month. "Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up those payments," she said, and eventually owed $18,000. To consolidate that debt, Ms. Jones went to a mortgage broker.
AND then she heard about the Long Island Housing Partnership. "I went in and they helped me," she said. "I learned that the loan from the mortgage company was exorbitant -- 13 percent and a whole lot of points." The monthly payments would have been $1,400 for 30 years. "I couldn't afford the other payments, so how was I going to make that?"
One staff member at the partnership, Carol Woods, "started making calls," Ms. Jones said, "renegotiating with Astoria Federal." The original rate of 9 percent was lowered to 8 percent, and the back payments were incorporated, "so I could start new," Ms. Jones said.
The new payments were $1,050 -- $50 more than on the first loan. "But I can handle it," Ms. Jones said, crediting another partnership worker, Diane Patrizio, with providing one-on-one budget counseling.
"She showed how I could stay on track," Ms. Jones said, "cutting it down to bare necessities. Like cable; I don't have cable. We get free videotapes from the library. I hang clothes on the line."
It was a hard lesson, Ms. Jones said, "a horrible feeling not knowing if you're going to lose your home; I lost a lot of sleep. But they kept in touch, constantly calling, reassuring me.
"Now I know what I'm dealing with."

Newsday Ends One Edition And Begins New Web Site
 Newsday has ended its weekly Executive Edition and shifted editorial coverage to a new Web site and an enlarged Business & Technology section. The online coverage, at newsday.com/ebiz, will provide frequent updates on local and national business news and emphasize technology, real estate and health care, said Raymond A. Jansen, Newsday's publisher. 
 The expanded Business & Technology section on Mondays will include a column on innovation, industry leaders, a technology-oriented column on workplace issues, and additional Manhattan high-tech news.
Newsday sent the Executive Edition to 10,000 "business and opinion leaders," said Howard Schneider, a managing editor. Its last regular edition appeared on Monday. Newsday will continue to publish quarterly economic reports under the Executive Edition name for the same readership, Mr. Schneider said.
"It didn't make sense to continue publishing a weekly in print when we could publish a minute-by-minute account on the Web," Mr. Schneider said. "By shifting content from the Executive Edition to the Web site, we expand our ability to deliver news in a much more timely way."

HEADLINE: The Pacific Rim, a Continent Away;
Asians, the State's Fastest-Growing Minority, Are Changing the Face of New Jersey

BYLINE: By LYNNE WEIL

DATELINE: EDGEWATER

 BODY:
ON the western bank of the Hudson, right on the river's edge, stands a pagoda-roofed restaurant with postcard view of Manhattan and a serene rock garden in the rear. A few feet away, there is a warren of small, interconnected stores that sell everything from origami paper to kimonos to the latest Godzilla comic books.
Among the many imported items at the nearby grocery story are 17 kinds of tofu and the Korean pickled vegetables known as kimchi. The pharmacy offers barley juice and shark cartilage pills. 
 The unusual collection of businesses -- called the Mitsuwa Marketplace -- is part of a nationwide network of enterprises that cater to an East Asian clientele. To the growing Asian population in New Jersey, it is a merchandise mecca, and for those who were not born here, one of the best places to put homesickness to rest.
Whether they are visitors with visas, immigrants or citizens born in the United States, the state's Asian/ Pacific Islander population has increased by 69.5 percent since 1990, the largest comparative growth of any ethnic group, according to federal Census Bureau estimates.
Put another way, in the last decade New Jersey's total population has increased by 5 percent, to 8.14 million people. And while the white, non-Hispanic population has shrunk by about 1 percent, the group with the second highest rate of growth, the state's Hispanic population, has grown 37.4 percent during the same period.
In five years, the Census Bureau says, New Jersey's current population of 475,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders will have grown to 578,000; the projected population in 2025 is 995,000.
"The ethnic composition of New Jersey is changing in meaningful ways," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "That is likely to have an effect on how people identify themselves as New Jerseyans, and on the issues that the state faces in the future."
Nor is New Jersey simply following a national trend; it is leading one. With 28.5 percent of its population Asian-born, New Jersey had the second-highest proportion of Asian residents in 1997, the most recent year for which statistics were available. Only California, where 33.5 percent of the population was of Asian origin, outpaced New Jersey.
One recent Sunday, Michael Usami, a product manager for Sony Electronics Inc., was browsing in the Kinokuniya Bookstore at the marketplace here.
Mr. Usami, who moved to Ridgewood from his home near Tokyo two years ago, said: "I come here maybe once a month. It feels good to be here. I think about Japan a lot."
Japanese friends and fishing buddies help him feel at home, Mr. Usami said. On the other hand, he added, his wife, Kaori, has become acquainted with people in their neighborhood, which is racially mixed. And their sons, Shin and Len, seem to "know lots of American kids" and prefer to speak English rather than Japanese.
Peter and Rebecca Jen, who came to New Jersey from Taiwan three years ago to attend college, said they were considering making the move a permanent one. On this day, they drove an hour from their home in Denville to scour the Yaohan Food Market for special sales on the everyday things that they took for granted back in Taipei.
After one such excursion, they took turns holding their 15-month-old son, Jonah, and heaving 60 pounds of sticky rice in cloth bags into the back of their car.
"We normally shop at the local grocery store near our home, and buy the usual things that people get," Rebecca Jen said. "But often there are special items here on sale, so it is always worth the trip."
Whether it is Indians in Jersey City, Japanese in Bergen County or Chinese in Piscataway, Asians have been drawn to New Jersey by relatives who preceded them here as well as by the growing number of job opportunities. But unlike earlier migrations -- made up of people with little money or education -- many of today's Asian immigrants already have an education and have come here to capitalize.
In the 1990 Census, which provided the latest reliable statistics, 71 percent of the state's Asian population said they had attended college.
"Asian immigrants tend to be well-educated professionals," Mr. Hughes said. "In New Jersey, Asians are finding employment especially in the burgeoning high-technology industry, in electronics and computer design."
The Asian-born in this country often are referred to as a model minority because of their relative success. But along with the population and its prosperity, tensions have also begun to rise. Incidents of bias -- including violent crime -- have prompted some to question how well accepted Asians in this country really are. Those concerns were heightened after a nuclear scientist at the national laboratory in Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, was accused of stealing nuclear secrets for China.
Like all broad demographic brush strokes, being Asian can mean many things. Mr. Hughes noted that in New Jersey, Asians made up about 90 percent of the people whom the Census Bureau categorize as "Asian and Pacific Islander."
Data from the 2000 Census is not yet available. For now, experts say patterns established in the 1980's are the best indicators for the recent rise in the Asian population.
In the 1990 Census, Indians comprised 1 percent of the 7.7 million people then living in New Jersey, the largest Asian community in the state. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service says that more people have been coming to New Jersey as legal and permanent residents from India than from any other country -- 15,003 from 1996 to 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available.
Residents of South Asian origin are spread throughout the state, but there are regions with comparatively larger concentrations of people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Central Middlesex County is one such area, with an estimated 50,000 people of South Asian origin in and around Woodbridge and Edison. Indeed, a several-mile stretch of Oak Tree Road has come to be widely known as Little India because of the concentration of Indian-owned restaurants, services and shops.
Since 1990, Edison has been home to the annual Navratri, or Nine Nights Festival, which participants say is the largest celebration of Indian religion and culture in the country. The manager of the event, Jayesh Mehta, said that on an average Saturday night in mid-October, as many as 10,000 people were drawn to the festival.
Run by the Iselin-based Indo-American Cultural Society, the Navratri festival features music, dance and foods from throughout the subcontinent. "This is our big opportunity once a year to proudly share some of our cultural gifts with other people," said the president of the society, Pradip (Peter) Kothari.
Not everyone has seen it that way since the Raritan Center in Edison became the site of the festival. Complaints about excessive noise and crowds have led to several legal disputes.
Mr. Kothari dismissed the grumbling as "the irritation some people feel toward any community which is different from them." But, he said, "It could be worse. Things have improved dramatically in that regard in recent years."
For instance, on the night after Mr. Kothari opened his travel agency in Iselin in May 1990, vandals smashed the windows. And he said it happened 10 more times in subsequent years.
As bad as that experience was, it paled next to the wave of beatings and destruction of property visited on Indians in Jersey City in 1987 and 1988. The gang found responsible for much of violence called themselves "dotbusters" -- a crude reference to the bindi cosmetic dot with which religious Hindus mark their foreheads.
In a letter to a local newspaper, the dotbusters wrote that they would "go to any extreme to get Indians to move out of Jersey City."
The group's tactics included "Patel attacks" in which they would select victims from the telephone book by name and harass them in their homes. The most infamous crime took place on Sept. 27, 1987, when a 30-year-old Indian man, Navraze Mody, was beaten to death by a gang of youths after he left a Hoboken cafe.
That incident mobilized many in the state's Indian communities to protest what they viewed as police indifference to their safety, and a lack of prosecutorial rigor.
These days, Asian leaders in the state agree that the most recent issue to galvanize opinion in their communities has been the case of Wen Ho Lee, who was accused of spying, lost his job and was jailed for nine months before his release in September. He pleaded guilty to one felony count of mishandling nuclear secrets, while the other 58 charges against him were dropped.
"A large number of Asians in this state work in science and technology," said Marjorie Li, the president of the Asian American Political Association, based in New Brunswick. "Many had great empathy for Dr. Lee. They felt they might have been faced with the same treatment, and it was really shocking."
Now the state's Asian communities are split over how best to get along in New Jersey: Keep a low profile or to become more visibly active and take more interest in public life.
"Many first-generation Asian immigrants read only the newspapers in their own languages, and keep up only with the news from their old country," said John Bang, a staff assistant on immigration issues and Asian outreach for Senator Frank Lautenberg. "The second generation comes in a little more savvy about U.S. current events. They also show a much greater interest in the political process."
Still, Mr. Bang said the Asian-American community was not a very cohesive political force because it was made up of people of different nationalities.
"But they are starting to come together in regional political groups," Mr. Bang said, "so that they will have more political capital."
Mr. Bang, a second-generation American whose parents are Korean-born, added: "We don't have our own Jesse Jacksons or Al Sharptons. It's contrary to the Asian culture to be aggressive and toot your own horn. But that is what the communities will have to do to gain political recognition."
Michelle Kim, a junior who is majoring in political science at Rutgers, might be ready for the job. A second-generation Asian American, she was student body president at her high school and became active in campus politics at Rutgers in her freshman year.
Now Ms. Kim says she is considering a career in public service when she graduates. "I see the need for somebody to be out there as a voice for the Asian community," she said. "Somebody has got to do it, and not many people are willing to do it, so it might as well be me."
In staking claim to that position, Ms. Kim considers herself unusual among second-generation Asian Americans because she has not been placed under intense pressure at home to earn good grades, but has always been encouraged to take part in social activities at school.
Ms. Kim said: "Maybe it's because my mother went to high school in the United States after moving here in 1970 from Taegu, South Korea. She recognized the importance of my being involved with things that other kids at school were doing. A lot of first-generation Asian parents are concerned only about their children's academic achievement and financial stability in the long term."
Upendra Chivukula, the Indian-born mayor of Franklin Township and one of the few people of Asian origin to hold municipal office in the state, is among those who is trying to raise the Asian profile.
A past president of the local Lions' Club and former head of the Democratic Party for Franklin Township, Mr. Chivukula said Asian transplants to New Jersey did themselves no favor by remaining "in close-knit, ethnically distinct societies, unseen by the rest of the world."
"The challenge they're going to be facing will be getting accepted in the communities where they live, and being integrated into them," Mr. Chivukula said. "They should not appear clannish. There will also be a certain jealousy factor as more people of Asian origin are succeeding here."
If public opinion polls are any indication, however, most New Jersey residents do not resent the immigrants, and are more tolerant of immigration than the country as a whole.
"Keys to Successful Immigration: Implications of the New Jersey Experience," published in 1997, explored various dimensions of immigrant life in the state, including public attitudes toward the foreign-born.
Thomas Espenshade, chairman of Princeton University's sociology department and a faculty associate at the school's Office of Population Research, edited the study.
In a Gallup poll commissioned by the university, slightly more than half of New Jersey adults surveyed welcomed the new immigrants, while 40 percent thought the number ought to be decreased. Those who wanted to see immigration reduced expressed anxiety over the availability of jobs and possible overcrowding, but no specific animosity toward immigrants themselves.
The study contrasted this result with a 1993 CBS News/New York Times poll that found more than 60 percent of respondents nationwide wanted immigration to decrease.
"One of the things that has actually helped in New Jersey's case is that the foreign-born population is better educated than the foreign-born population nationwide," Mr. Espenshade said. "Those who are better educated tend to pass along the values of education and achievement to their children, and that's probably been good for the state."
Asked whether New Jerseyans' attitudes toward immigrants and native-born Asians might change as the Asian population here continued to rise, Mr. Espenshade said: "That would be difficult to predict. But these attitudes tend to remain stable, as long as the economy is good."
For Asians who are newly arrived in New Jersey from overseas, getting acclimated and finding a job are more immediate challenges than the question of prejudice.
"Maybe after living here many years, people begin thinking about their place in mainstream society, or whether they become the object of bias," said Mai Lieu, director of the migration and refugee office of the humanitarian agency Catholic Family and Community Services in Paterson. "But first they think about are how cold the winter here is compared to their country, or how far they need to ride the bus to work."
Ms. Lieu's agency helps newly arrived refugees and immigrants obtain housing, become enrolled in the Social Security and Medicaid programs, and find employment. Initial job placements for many, she said, tend to be in electronics firms staffed by other Asian immigrants.
Ms. Lieu currently is working to help Trang Khanh Huynh, a Vietnamese refuge, resolve some of these very issues. Ms. Huynh, 29, arrived in the United States from Saigon last February with her two younger brothers. Soon afterward, their father was admitted as a refugee in August 1999.
Ms. Huynh is about to complete a six-month beauty school course that will entitle her to become a licensed manicurist.
With Ms. Lieu as her interpreter, Ms. Huynh said: "The first thing I would like to do is to get a job in a salon, so I do not have to depend on anyone else for support. When I have enough money, I hope to start taking English lessons."
Earlier this year, when Catholic Family and Community Services helped Ms. Huynh fill out her census form, she was living with relatives, had no job prospects and was uncertain what the future would bring. How does she envision her life in 10 years, when the next census is to be done?
"I will speak English well and have more American friends," she said. "And I will own a beauty salon."

HEADLINE: New President Seeks Higher Visibility for Pace

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
DAVID ARMAND CAPUTO, a Fulbright scholar and the past president of Hunter College, was installed on Wednesday as the sixth president of Pace University.
Dr. Caputo succeeds Patricia O. Ewers as president of the 92-year-old university, which has more than 13,000 students at five campuses in New York City and Westchester. 
 "I've not taken over a troubled university, although I do want to increase its visibility and move it into a higher tier of major universities," Dr. Caputo said in an interview before his installation.
A 1965 graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Dr. Caputo received a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship and earned two master's degrees and a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University.
He said he wanted to increase the number of full-time faculty at the university -- of Pace's 1,000 faculty members, 59 percent are part-time -- give more honors and opportunities to top students and broaden community input.
In line with the latter goal, Pace is building a $15 million training institute for judges who want a better understanding of changing issues in today's courtroom, like domestic violence. It will be only the second judiciary school in the nation, the first being the National Judicial College of Reno.
"It's a nice blend between academia and the real world," Dr. Caputo said of the judicial institute.
As a hands-on administrator, Dr. Caputo said he enjoys meeting with students and listening to their concerns.
During a recent overnight visit to one of Pace's dormitories, he observed that students today were concerned with how they would fit into the larger economic community when they graduated.
"They're bottom-line oriented," he said. "They're interested in the world at large, and they're competitive."
Pace, which has traditionally attracted students who are the first-generation offspring of immigrants and often the first in their families to attend college, was founded in 1906 by Homer and Charles Pace, two brothers who borrowed $600 to rent a classroom and office space.
Acknowledging the advances since then as well as the anticipated technological changes ahead, Dr. Caputo predicted that "the decade ahead will be one of great transformation."
"Some schools will become virtual universities, some will stay with the traditional approach," he said. "Those are the extremes. To succeed, we'll need to incorporate a variety of methods."
The changes, however, are not being dictated solely by technology, he said. The traditional student, as colleges have known them in the past, have also changed, and those seeking higher education today "want it on their own terms."
"College students work, they have families," Dr. Caputo said, "and we will have to be responsive to that."
As of this fall, Pace reported an enrollment of 13,331 students representing 78 countries. It has 8,132 students at its Manhattan campus, 3,260 in Pleasantville and 1,939 in White Plains.
In the coming decade, Dr. Caputo said, he would address the need to double the university's $100 million endowment.
With a budget of more than $186 million a year, the college is dependent for its operating expenses on the $15,870 annual tuition, which is significantly higher than the tuition at state-supported schools but less than the annual tuition, for example, at New York University, which is $24,336.
"We're about in the middle for private schools," Dr. Caputo said. By comparison, Iona College in New Rochelle charges $15,500, and Fordham's tuition is $20,200.
But for a school that attracts many students from working-class families, Pace cannot depend solely on large gifts from graduates.
"That they give is more important than how much they give," he said.

HEADLINE: A County Consumed by Supermarket Envy

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
WITH all the variables confronting home buyers in Westchester -- cost, commute, schools, mortgage rates, taxes, termites -- it's no wonder that the local supermarket rarely enters the equation.
But after moving in, many new residents quickly come down with a social ill that seems particularly acute in Westchester: supermarket envy. 
 Retail analysts and supermarket consultants say that for years Westchester has suffered a severe lack of supermarkets and that, for the most part, the stores that are here come up short in terms of size, service and selection, when compared with their counterparts across the country.
"Westchester has one of the 10 highest incomes in the country but some of the worst supermarkets in the entire United States, regardless of income," said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn., a marketing and retailing consulting firm. "The Westchester consumer will go to the boroughs of New York and to Fairfield County rather than to experience the pain of supermarket shopping in Westchester."
In interviews with two dozen shoppers, the majority bemoaned their local market's produce section, groused about long checkout lines and universally complained about high prices.
Adjectives like "horrible," "outdated," "cramped" and "dingy" cropped up again and again. Driving another 10 minutes or even a half hour to reach a favorite supermarket or specialty store was commonplace.
Geoff Thompson, a public relations consultant who lives and works in central Westchester, rattled off a handful of supermarket choices within a 10-minute drive of his home: a C-Town in Ossining, a Food Emporium in Briarcliff Manor, a Shoprite in Croton-on-Hudson and an A.&P. in Millwood. "We kind of dance around between these various stores, not being particularly happy with any of them," he said.
The closest one is the smallish A.&P. in Millwood, a hamlet in the town of New Castle. With flourescent lights radiating from a ceiling that shows signs of water damage, it is his least favorite. "We sort of grit our teeth and get what we have to get," he said. "You won't see rats in the aisles. It doesn't feel like Calcutta. It's just that people have higher expectations."
But things are changing. Westchester is poised for a supermarket renaissance.
In just the last year, the Stop & Shop chain, based in Quincy, Mass., has made an aggressive push into the county. It has two new superstores in New Rochelle and another in North White Plains, a store under construction in the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers and approvals for stores in Port Chester and White Plains.
Last year also saw the opening of a few alternatives to traditional supermarkets, from the carnivalesque Stew Leonard's in Yonkers to the hugely popular Turco's. Beloved for its produce and fresh fish, Turco's opened a second store in Yorktown Heights after drawing shoppers for years from all over the county to the original in Hartsdale.
At the same time, the few specialty food stores already here, as well as markets eager to break into the county, could realize an opportunity to expand, given the recent bankruptcy protection filing by Grand Union. It is the third Chapter 11 filing in six years for the struggling chain, based in Wayne, N.J., and the company says it is looking for a buyer.
Supermarket consultants say the chain's nine stores in Westchester, ranging in size from 8,000 square feet to 40,000 square feet in affluent communities like Chappaqua and Larchmont, might end up being auctioned off individually to markets that do not require the kind of space a large supermarket chain demands.
"You've got upscale markets like Gourmet Garage and Fairway and Wild Oats, all looking to come into Westchester County, and you've got all these Grand Unions coming available," said Martin A. Deitch of Aries Deitch & Endelson, a leading commercial real estate company in Hartsdale. "The demise of Grand Union is here. And these Grand Unions are going to turn into some absolutely phenomenal retail and specialty stores."
Howard Glickberg, an owner of Fairway, whose two stores -- in Harlem and on the Upper West Side -- are meccas for cost-conscious foodies, said he was eying the Grand Union in Dobbs Ferry, five minutes from his home in Irvington. "I think Westchester would be wonderful," he said.
There are many reasons, it seems, for the county's stunted food-retailing landcape.
Developers cite restrictive zoning, the lack of available land, hilly terrain and the riddle that residents present by demanding a spacious, modern, supermarket convenient to them while shunning any proposed development close to home. Retail consultants like Mr. Flickinger point to the domination of the Grand Union Company and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, which owns Food Emporium, A.&P. and Waldbaum's, among other chains.
They had a "half nelson on the market for far too long," Mr. Flickinger said of the two companies, "and finally the consumers said, 'We quit, we can't take it, we'll drive as far as it takes.' "
Some say the fault lies, too, with consumers, many of them former Manhattanites who, fresh out of college, wheeled their first shopping carts through some of the tiniest, most overpriced supermarkets anywhere.
"I privately speculate that that's one of the reasons we don't have better supermarkets here, because of the low expectations of people coming out of Manhattan," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, who emphasized that he was speaking as a county resident (who happens to live in White Plains but drives outside his city's borders to shop for food).
"When I drive to Florida or New Jersey," he said, "they have splendid supermarkets -- supermarkets that far surpass anything you'll see in Westchester in terms of size and choice. Westchester is just not up to par with the rest of the metropolitan region in my opinion."
That seems to be the view of many county residents, though certainly not all. Priscilla Painton, an assistant managing editor at Time magazine and a resident of the Cedar Knolls section of Yonkers, believes she is strategically situated for first-rate food shopping. And her buying patterns illustrate just how fractured and complex food shopping has become.
"Within eight minutes of my home I have Stew Leonard's and for bulk food, Costco, and a very high-end Food Emporium in Bronxville," Ms. Painton said. "If I have a really fancy dinner party, I will drive to Fairway on 125th Street. There's no problem parking, and it has the best cheese, as far as I can tell, on the East Coast. What I like is the complete diversity in price and kind of food."
But Ms. Painton lives in the more densely populated southern half of the county where there are simply more stores. In the northern half, supermarkets are more spread out, and some communities like Armonk, Chappaqua and Millwood feel especially dissatisfied with lackluster food outlets.
A prime exception is Yorktown Heights, in northwest Westchester, which boasts a new Food Emporium, a remodeled A.&P. superstore and a new Turco's. A&P had tried without success to block Turco's from opening. But all three stores appeal to different consumers and the cluster draws shoppers from beyond the area.
Ms. Painton's colleague, Dan Kadlec, who writes the column "Your Money" for Time, calls food shopping around his Chappaqua home "abyssmal" and longs for the "palaces they have" in the Midwest where he grew up.
He and his wife do not enjoy shopping at the Grand Union in Chappaqua. ("I went in there to get a steak one time," he said, "and I think the thickest steak they had was a quarter inch.") Increasingly, they have given their business to the smaller gourmet shops in the hamlet, although Mr. Kadlec said he resents paying a premium.
"Chappaqua is supposed to be this high-end, trendy little suburb, and yet there are real basic things we don't have," he said. "For all the million-dollar houses in town you still don't have a decent grocery store. It cracks me up when I think about it."
Mr. Kadlec surmises that Grand Union has not spruced itself up because people are willing to drive only so far to shop. "Basically, you want to get it over with," he said. "It's not how you want to spend Saturday." Experts on the supermarket industry add that another reason mediocre supermarkets can stay open is that many have cheap long-term leases, allowing them to be profitable even without doing a brisk business.
But some Westchester residents say they do travel considerable distances to shop for food, regularly bypassing a supermarket around the corner with wilted red-leaf lettuce and sullen cashiers.
Cecile Rothschild, a graphic designer in Armonk, is such a shopper. "The supermarkets in Westchester are horrible," she said as she escorted her 5-year-old daughter, Lea, into the local Food Emporium, where, she said, she reluctantly goes a few times a week. Once a month she drives an extra 10 minutes to do extensive shopping at the new Stop & Shop in North White Plains, and she also visits Zabar's in Manhattan monthly for cheese and coffee. Every week or so, she drives 18 to 20 minutes to Greenwich to a Fresh Fields Whole Foods Market, a store prized for its organic produce.
It's the same for Patty Clark, a program manager in the aviation department at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. When she moved to Sleepy Hollow from Manhattan, she asked her neighbors where they shop for food. They suggested a supermarket 15 minutes north in Ossining, since there was no supermarket in Sleepy Hollow. "I remember thinking, 'You have to go all the way to Ossining to get food?' and then I realized, 'Wow, we do have to go all the way to Ossining to get food,' " Ms. Clark said.
But she soon discovered an independently owned store called Scotts Corner Market in Pound Ridge, near the home of a friend but 35 minutes from her own. She was so taken by the fruits and vegetables, whose colors, she said, are "out of a Matisse," that she drives across the county to shop there.
In most parts of the United States, experts on the supermarket industry say, such treks are unheard of. In California or in the Washington area, the average shopper drives no more than three to five minutes to get to a favorite store, but in Westchester shoppers typically drive anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes, Mr. Flickinger said.
Those contrasts have recently made supermarket developers more enthusiastic about building here, despite the obstacles.
"The market got so tight and the demand got so great that the economics started to justify greater investment that really allowed the real estate to work," said Kenneth D. Narva, a managing partner of Street-Works in White Plains, a development and consulting concern specializing in mixed-use retail projects.
Anthony Colavolpe, vice president of real estate for Stop & Shop, recalled the difficult logistics of assembling land for the new store in White Plains. Working with another developer, the supermarket chain is relocating the city's department of public works and will then raze a bowling alley and bank. "All of this to build a supermarket," he said.
Turco's seems ideally positioned to take advantage of the harried Westchester shopper, with its copious takeout selection. The store smokes its own fish, makes 100 types of pastas and 30 different salads and employs a French baker, previously with Eli's Bread in Manhattan. "It's just service and quality and reasonable prices," said Preston Turco, the president, who got his start with produce stores in the Bronx. "You give the people what they want, not what they don't want."
A.&P., of course, has seen the proliferation of alternative grocery outlets, but insists that its two-year-old campaign of self-improvement, called "Project Great Renewal," was not a response to competition but an effort to "proactively improve" both the stores and service, said Richard De Santa, A.&P.'s vice president for corporate affairs. The chain, based in Montvale, N.J., is closing underperforming stores and revamping existing Food Emporiums and A.&P.'s as well as building new ones.
The company, with 415 supermarkets in the East, wants to convert the entire store network over the next few years to one that is dominated by superstores, ranging in size from 45,000 square feet to 65,000 square feet. Indeed, the whole thrust in the industry has been toward larger and larger stores, with bakeries, pharmacies and coffee bars.
A.&P.'s chief executive officer, Christian Haub, began the campaign when he took over the company two years ago. "He said we know we're not getting the job done in terms of customer service, and the other thing that hampers us is having too many smaller, older stores," Mr. De Santa said.
Mr. De Santa said the chain still has a number of small, uninspired supermarkets that have not yet been scrutinized by the company. As leases expire on those stores, he said, the company could well decide to close them.
But such closings can create new problems for a community, as is the case in Briarcliff Manor, where an A.&P. was shuttered more than two years ago and now sits empty in a commercial district.
"Prior to the closing, the Briarcliff Manor A.&P. was overwhelmingly the most hated supermarket in the area," Keith Austin, the village's mayor, said. "I can understand the business proposition of closing marginal stores, but it's hurting us. You have a big empty storefront and the remaining stores are getting killed."
The village's insistence that whatever replaces the A.&P. be modest in scale illustrates the kind of Catch-22 facing both shoppers and the industry. Shoppers seem eager for giant stores able to offer competitive prices and a staggering selection, but they do not want them in their neighborhoods.
"Nowadays everyone wants a 65,000-square-foot big box, but we're not interested in that," Mr. Austin said. "We're trying to preserve a rather small village feel."
The ideal combination, many shoppers say, would be a specialty store down the street and a superstore maybe 10 minutes away, causing traffic snarls in someone else's neighborhood. Indeed, in Armonk two years ago, residents came out to fight proposals for two supermarkets, and Mr. Thompson, the public relations consultant who had represented one of the two developers, remembers hearing people chant "Hay Day, Hay Day."
It was a reference to a small chain of sumptuous food markets, with prices to match, owned by Sutton Place Gourmet in Bethesda, Md., which merged with Balducci's in Manhattan last year. There is a Hay Day in Scarsdale and three in Fairfield County.
In the end, the two supermarket proposals for Armonk, a hamlet in the town of North Castle, were withdrawn. Now, one of the developers, McCann Real Equities Development, has returned with a proposal for a new Food Emporium that does not require a variance, only site-plan approval. It would replace the existing Food Emporium, the one residents seem to love to hate, on a site a mile away. Although it would be small for a new supermarket, at 31,000 square feet, the store would be almost twice the size of the one there now.
Still, there is opposition, especially from residents in a new development of $700,000 houses adjacent to the charming cider mill that would be torn down to accommodate the new supermarket.
"It's one of those great Westchester dilemmas," Mr. Thompson said. "On the one hand you have people clamoring for a better supermarket, but on the other hand they don't want to have anything built. And you know what ends up happening? Nothing."

A Former Sports Star Finds Politics A Rougher Field

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: UNION CITY

 BODY:
THE rain is falling on Roosevelt Stadium, and Rudy Garcia is not happy.
Mr. Garcia, who represents the 57,000 residents crammed into this 1.4-square-mile city as their mayor and state assemblyman, is in the stands on a recent gray afternoon, hoping the skies will clear so that the Union Hill High School football team will take the field. 
 The 36-year-old mayor, a former team captain and all-state running back and linebacker during his glory days at Union Hill, also simply wants to see some action out on the turf. For a time, perhaps, it will take his mind off the pressures of running a poor, landlocked city, reviewing state legislation, starting a family, facing down a recall election campaign and having state investigators subpoena documents from the local Democratic organization about his campaign finances.
But the rain does not let up, and the gloomy atmosphere in the deserted stand lingers. Then someone tosses the mayor a football. Instantly, his body language changes. He becomes animated. The paunchy, prematurely graying politician, impeccably dressed in a dark blue suit, smiles the smile that is undefeated in nine primary and general elections.
"This is where I grew up," Mr. Garcia said, with the faintest hint of an accent from his native Cuba, which he left when he was 4.
Traffic whooshes by on Kennedy Boulevard outside the stadium's main entrance. "I lived two blocks away, on 27th Street and Central," he said. "Played Little League baseball, Bugs and Bees, Pop Warner football. At night time we used to come back and there used to be a men's softball league and me and my brothers would be the scorekeepers. We'd get two bucks a game."
Mr. Garcia has come a long way since then. Likewise, his revenue-generating schemes involving the stadium have become much more ambitious. After leaving Cuba with his mother and two brothers, the young Raul Garcia, known as Rudy, eventually led Union Hill to three state championships. He went on to play for Columbia University's perennially powerless Lions while majoring in economics. Next came law school at New York University, after which he became an associate at Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith in Manhattan.
By age 28 he was tapped for a State Assembly seat from the 33rd Legislative District by his political mentor, Bruce Walter, a Hudson County power broker who had served as county Democratic chairman and mayor of Union City. When Mr. Walter died in January 1998, Mr. Garcia was chosen to fill his mentor's seat on the Union City Board of Commissioners, whose four other members also elected him mayor. In municipal elections the following May, he led a slate in winning full four-year terms.
"I was, I guess, probably the fastest-rising star, not only in Hudson County politics, but probably in state politics," Mr. Garcia said.
But in a turnaround notable even by the standards of Hudson County's perilous politics, a majority of those same commission members stripped Mr. Garcia of his positions as commissioner of public safety and of recreation -- and most of his real authority -- at the city's reorganization meeting in July, leaving him with little more than his mayor's title. And now even that is in jeopardy, with a drive under way to gather the 6,700 signatures necessary for a recall election. The move is being led by another Union City politician who over two years went from an opponent of Mr. Garcia to an ally and to an opponent again.
That politician, Brian Stack, who represents Union City as a county freeholder, insists that Mr. Garcia has ignored the city's financial realities, granting raises to municipal employees and a tax cut to residents in his first year that have contributed to $12 million budget deficit. Mr. Stack has proposed himself as a candidate for mayor in a separate election that would be on the same ballot as the recall vote. It is a somewhat confusing two-tiered process that in 1995 resulted in a successful recall of Mayor Anthony DeFino of West New York -- and his re-election on the same ballot.
"You know what the problem is with Rudy?" said Mr. Stack, who gives the impression of a scrappy street fighter compared with Mr. Garcia's persona as a smooth operator. "Everything was handed to him."
You might say that Mr. Garcia's political career began at Roosevelt Stadium, and there is a chance that it could end there. Mr. Garcia's initial name recognition grew out of his playing days, and it was while he was still in high school -- after being chosen senior class president and captain of the football and baseball teams -- that he met his political patrons, Mr. Walter and Robert Menendez, who is now the fourth-ranking House Democrat.
At that time, the two longtime allies had recently founded the Alliance Civic Organization with the purpose of breaking from another of Union City's colorful mayors, William Musto -- who was convicted of racketeering charges while in office in 1982. Eventually, the organization would provide Mr. Garcia with his base of support. Two decades later -- in the spring of this year -- Mr. Garcia proposed selling Roosevelt Stadium, a city-owned complex, to the Union City Board of Education for $3.5 million as the main component of his plan to fill the city's current budget gap, which he put at $5 million, well below his opponents' estimate -- the sort of revenue-raising arrangement that is not uncommon in municipal finance.
Mr. Garcia said that the money to buy the stadium would have come not from local school taxes but from supplemental aid the school system receives as one of the state's 30 special needs districts.
The plan appeared to have the support of the commissioners -- until officials in the State Department of Community Affairs, which reviews municipal budgets, balked. City Commissioner Rafael Fraguela called it "voodoo economics."
Moreover, Mr. Fraguela said the effort to use education funds to fill a municipal budget gap -- that should not have been allowed to develop in the first place -- was one reason Mr. Garcia should be recalled. For his part, Mr. Garcia blames Mr. Fraguela, Mr. Stack and his other opponents for scuttling the proposed stadium arrangement and thus creating the need to raise taxes.
"These people can't even spell integrity," Mr. Garcia said, betraying what often sounds like a deep disdain for his less-educated opponents. "They can't even think of a transaction that's going to bring $3.5 million from the state without taking any money from the board of ed, stabilizing taxes. They couldn't even think of it."
Mr. Garcia further alienated himself when he dismissed the law firm of Donald Scarinci in July 1998 as the city's outside council in what the mayor said was an effort to save tax money. Mr. Scarinci -- who accused Mr. Garcia of spending more money on legal fees the following year -- said the real reason he was fired was his longtime friendship with Mr. Menendez, whom Mr. Garcia hopes to unseat in Congress.
Mr. Garcia makes no secret of his hopes to run for Congress. But he said that would only happen once Mr. Menendez chose to leave office. "I've known Bob since I was 15 years old, and I have always been very supportive of him, and he was always very supportive of me. And then, unfortunately, the turning point came when I changed the municipal attorney. It used to be Donald Scarinci, his school buddy," Mr. Garcia said. "And that's what changed our relationship, totally."
But Mr. Menendez claimed that what he saw as Mr. Garcia's mismanagement of the city bothered him most. Moreover, he said that despite his support of Mr. Garcia in the May 1998 election, the new mayor immediately began undercutting him politically. "My relationship with him changed the day after he got elected," Mr. Menendez said.
Mr. Menendez had been Union City's mayor and state senator before being elected to Congress in November 1992, and his ascension created the legislative vacancy that Mr. Garcia stepped into when Bernard Kenny, then an assemblyman from the 33rd District, moved into Mr. Menendez's State Senate seat. It was Mr. Garcia's appointment to the Assembly in January 1993 that led to his first political controversy, when opponents charged he had not lived in the 33rd District for the minimum one year before taking office. But Mr. Garcia still had the support of Mr. Menendez, Mr. Walter, and other patrons, and he emerged from the controversy unscathed.
Mr. Menendez, one of the men responsible for Mr. Garcia's rapid rise, now supports the campaign to recall the mayor. Councilman William Gaughan of Jersey City, whose political and family life overlap with Mr. Garcia's, said the mayor was learning the hard way what it is like to try to stand on his own politically.
Mr. Gaughan, whose daughter Eileen is close friends with Mr. Garcia's wife, Nicole, said Bruce Walter's death was a personal and political blow to his protege.
"I think Rudy was really taken aback, because I don't think he was ready to step in at that point," said Mr. Gaughan, whose council ward, the Heights section of Jersey City, is in Mr. Garcia's legislative district.
Another of the mayor's close friends, Mayor Anthony Russo of Hoboken, insisted Mr. Garcia had been made a scapegoat by Mr. Stack and Mr. Menendez, who alternately viewed the budget deficit as a vehicle for political gain. "I think it's unfair that they should target him," said Mr. Russo, who is no ally of Mr. Menendez.
To add to Mr. Garcia's woes, the State Attorney General's office has subpoenaed financial records from the Union City Democratic Organization, of which Mr. Garcia was chairman before Mr. Sack ousted him in June. The office also seized city billing records for a political consultant, Pat Politano, who was hired to promote its Urban Enterprise Zone and whom critics say acted as the mayor's personal spokesman, a charge the mayor denied.
Whatever he is feeling, Mr. Garcia continues to exude confidence. That much was clear from an interview in the nursery of his infant daughter, Adriana.
"I could walk away from this tomorrow and practice law and make a lot more money -- that's the difference between Stack and I in a nutshell," he said of his rival "Stack's got nowhere to go."

SEPTEMBER UNEMPLOYMENT

BYLINE: By Anne Ruderman

 BODY:
The state's unemployment rate dropped to 3.8 percent last month, down from 4.0 percent in August, the state Labor Department reported last week. The September unemployment rate marks the seventh consecutive month that New Jersey has held unemployment at or below 4 percent. The jobless rate has also been at or below the national rate since the beginning of the year and is 0.8 percentage points below a year ago. The state added 14,600 jobs in September. Of the new jobs, the Labor Department reported that 6,0000 were in the public sector and 8,000 were in the private sector. Local government also gained 8,100 jobs, offsetting a decrease in the number of people employed at the state and federal level. Anne Ruderman

Newcomers Savings and Loan

BYLINE: By SASHA ABRAMSKY; Sasha Abramsky is writing a book on prisons, to be published next year by St. Martin's Press.

 BODY:
WHEN Jemma Legall Romain moved to New York from Trinidad in 1984, she flew on a ticket her mother had bought for her through a saving system known as a susu. Years later, when Ms. Romain had to raise money toward the down payment on her three-family house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, she too saved money in a susu. After she bought the house, she made it pay for itself by renting out two floors.
Though a staple of immigrant communities, susus are little known outside of them. The name is thought to have evolved from the West African Yoruba word "esusu," which means roughly "pooling the funds." In New York, such pooled funds are staples of Trinidadian immigrant communities, and, with variants, of many other immigrant groups. 
 Susus are generally made up of groups of family members or friends, each of whom pledges to put a certain amount of money into a central pot each week. That pot, presided over by a treasurer, whose honesty is vouched for by his or her respected standing among the participants, is then given to one member of the group.
Over the course of a susu's life, each member will receive a payout exactly equal to the total he has put in, which could range from a handful of dollar bills to several thousand dollars; members earn no interest on the money they set aside. After a complete cycle, the members either regroup and start over or go their separate ways.
"It's how our parents, and their parents, used to save their money," said Ms. Romain, 39, who is the office manager at the Central Brooklyn Partnership, a community organization.
As hundreds of thousands of immigrants settled in the city during the 1990's, increasing numbers brought with them informal, bankless savings habits. With immigration showing no sign of slowing -- the New York Department of City Planning estimating that 113,000 immigrants a year settled in the city in the last decade, up from 80,000 annually in the 1970's and 1980's -- this trend is likely to accelerate.
As a new, high-tech century dawns, the susu is one of the key mechanisms helping immigrants in this city of immigrants succeed in their new world. Susu-type organizations are, quite simply, the lifeblood for much of New York's immigrant community. Even some children of immigrant families save this way, chipping in a dollar a week of their lunch money.
There is no legal penalty if a member fails to make regular contributions, which can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars per week, but the power of community sanction is strong. In the rare case that someone fails to pay, ostracism or, occasionally, violence can result. Those lacking the strength of character to save consistently on their own are propelled by a moral obligation toward other group members.
Madeline Lamour, who works with Ms. Romain at the Central Brooklyn Partnership, directs a self-help group for women from Bedford-Stuyvesant called the Sisters Lending Circle. As part of the program, Ms. Lamour enrolls her clients in a susu run out of the partnership's offices.
"It forces you to save," Ms. Lamour said. "The susu gives us a sense of, 'Yes, I can manage my own money.' It's a form of lending to ourselves, to each other. It makes us responsible for each other's dreams."
In countries in which banks were either not trusted or the preserve of the rich, informal savings networks developed as crucial support systems for poor residents.
"Susus," Ms. Romain said proudly, "sent us to school, helped my mother do renovations on her house back in my country. Susus give you an education, put a roof over your head when the bank denies you cash."
Nobody knows exactly how much money flows through these savings and loan units, but, with tens of thousands of people contributing upward of $100 at a time, a conservative estimate would put the total at millions of dollars a week. And, while this is primarily a New York phenomenon, the national figure might be tens of millions.
The terminology varies. Trinidadians talk about susus, Haitians have mens, Jamaicans save in partners, Guyanans refer to the box, and Dominicans have sams or sociadades. Korean, Portuguese and Jewish immigrants also use community-based savings systems. In some communities, virtually every first-generation immigrant participates, using the money to pay off loans, make down payments on houses or cars, and start small businesses. For many who are low on the economic ladder, susus are the first rung toward the American dream.
NEW YORK being New York, even the city's banks and mortgage lending institutions are taking them seriously, using susu membership as a criteria to help establish a person's credit-worthiness.
"We have accepted this form of nontraditional savings for the last four or five years," said Jackie O'Garrow, senior deputy director at the New York office of the Fannie Mae Foundation, which helps banks channel mortgage loans into underserved areas. "We call it a 'specific variant.' We were hearing from our members that with the growth of the immigrant community this is a very frequent practice."
Many banks have developed formal systems so participation in a susu can help someone seeking a loan.
"We'd ask for a notarized letter from the treasurer stating how long the individual has participated in the susu and how many people are involved," said John Hill, a spokesman for Dime Savings Bank. Dime is among several New York banks that consider membership in a susu when determining the financial viability of an applicant for a mortgage.
Even when banks aren't involved, immigrant savings groups propel many from being poorly paid casual laborers into self-employment.
In October, a Dominican immigrant named Victor Auzon realized a dream he had nurtured since arriving in Washington Heights 12 years earlier: he bought his own Lincoln Town Car. After working for years in low-level jobs in a factory, a sweatshop and a bodega, he went into the livery cab business, but he found himself paying $1,200 a month to rent his taxicab from a dispatch service. Now, thanks in part to money from a susu, he owns his car.
Mr. Auzon, 44, is one of 18 friends, the self-styled "corre caminos," or street runners, all of whom drive taxis in Washington Heights and have spent the last few years aggressively saving to buy their own cars. Every week, each man contributes $250 of the $900 he earns into the sociedad.
This money, combined with low-interest loans provided to immigrant business owners by an organization called Accion New York, lets the cabbies assemble the sizable down payments, more than $10,000, needed to buy their vehicles, which can cost more than $30,000. Today, most of the men are now driving their own cars.
"The sociedad," said Jose-Luis Bido, the group's treasurer, "makes us responsible. It forces us to save because we're committing ourselves to other people. Every Dominican uses sociedades. My mother, my father, my brother, my sister. Everyone I know."

Keeping Up With the Croesuses

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I FIRST became concerned two years ago, when my daughter, who was 11 at the time, came home from a house party where the children had a choice of swimming in the pool or at the family's private beach.
Today, my children's best friends sometimes aren't around because they're in Europe or skiing in Vail. My own children have been to Paris twice in the last three years. Everyone's cars are new and nobody does without. When my sons asked for the scooters that are so popular now, I said no, they were too expensive. So a boy who had three offered to give them one. 
 In a nation where many people are enjoying increasing affluence, there is some concern that our children are growing up with a skewed sense of the world -- that while they indeed see Oz, they will insist that it's real even after they wake up. In this surreal economic expansion, how do we show our children that life won't always be this easy, and how do we prepare them for economic reality if they don't believe us?
"They can end up having no sense of the value of money," said Marcee Yager, a financial planner and managing partner of Sterling Wood Financial in San Mateo, Calif. "One thing about human nature in regard to money, the more effort it takes to obtain something, the more value it has to you. With kids who are surrounded by a lot of wealth, they get stuck in a psychological prison because how do they then get anything that is valuable?"
Affluence is a problem that we all should have, but this may be a case of too much of a good thing. It's great that we can provide for our families and that money has given us more freedom to fully enjoy our lives, but are our lifestyles giving our children a goal or an excuse?
Jeffrey H. Bergstrand, associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Notre Dame, said that children were just reacting rationally to our wealth. That is especially true for teenagers, who may eschew the important experience of a summer job.
"This is a classic backward-bending labor supply curve," Mr. Bergstrand said. "The more you get paid, the more you want to work to grab that income. But as income gets so high, you want to enjoy it. In terms of children with more affluence, there is less of a need to work and make money."
Neale S. Godfrey, the author of financial books for children, including, with Carolina Edwards, "Money Doesn't Grow on Trees: A Parent's Guide to Raising Financially Responsible Children" (Fireside, 1994), said parents were often careless about how they handled money around children.
"They just see us spending," she said. "We're in a store and we want something, so we use our credit card. There is no accountability, because they don't see the bill being paid. The bill just disappears."
SHE says many children expect to live at better socioeconomic levels than their parents did.
"They think they are entitled to it," she said. "They don't understand what it means to have to work for it. If parents don't start teaching them at home and educators don't teach them in school, they will be ill-equipped to handle the $41 trillion that will be transferred to them over the next 50 years."
Alice C. Walsh, 42, of Carmel, N.Y., who raises money for Broadway, Off Broadway and film productions, became concerned four years ago, when her son, James, was about 5. As is typical of children that age, he wanted every toy he saw. "He was writing letters to Santa in April," she said.
So she started giving James an allowance and made him give part of it to charity and save a portion for college. He also was made to save for his toys.
"I'll tell you, when he saw that he could have any of those toys he wanted if he bought them himself, it was a really, really great moment," she said. "He now knows to not just ask us."
Ms. Godfrey suggested something even more radical.
To show children exactly where the money goes, parents should cash their paychecks and place the stack of money in front of their children. They should then put the cash into different stacks, one for each of the household's bills -- utilities, insurance, groceries and so on. There should also be stacks for savings and charitable donations.
"You have to involve them," she said. "You say, 'Here's the bill; here's the money.' "
It sounds unwieldy, but it's worthwhile.
My wife recently asked me why I always tell the children how much things cost. So they will know, I said. I explained that our son, Antonio, 10, recently told me about a toy he wanted, but when he saw the price tag, he dismissed it. "It was way too expensive," he said, a thought that wouldn't have crossed his mind a year ago.
And a thought that will, I hope, haunt him for the rest of his life.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Debt Debate Ignores The Country's Other Options

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
PAYING off the national debt has been elevated to an obsession. Politics does that. Vice President Al Gore, in the presidential debate last Tuesday, solemnly promised millions of Americans that he would "eliminate the debt in the next decade." So would Gov. George W. Bush. And in their unanimity, they deprive the country of a necessary debate on a crucial question: Is zero national debt healthy for the economy?
There is a strong case to be made that it is not. But rather than conduct a healthy and heated discussion of alternative uses for the growing budget surplus, the candidates close off discussion. In their hands, paying off the $3.5 trillion in public debt becomes almost a moral imperative, beyond politics. But economics often involves political choices. 
 The real issue is this: How can we invest the growing budget surplus for maximum return? Put that way, paying off the debt, or some of it, is one option. So is investing in Head Start, or child care or education or the military or an air transportation system that doesn't waste millions of hours in delays.
"Some debt reduction is a good idea," said Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economic science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But the next question is, how much? Here's the next dollar of surplus; what do I want to do with that to earn the best return?"
Think of a homeowner with $50,000 in savings, or surplus, and a $50,000 mortgage that costs $400 a month. Why pay off the mortgage, if he can invest his savings in a security that earns $450 a month? That's enough to cover the mortgage payment and $50 a month in job training to improve his earning power and, in time, his savings or surplus.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, in fact, stump for such alternatives. They would devote big chunks of the projected $4.6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years to spending programs and tax cuts. But in their reverence for paying off the debt, they never ask whether it makes sense, given the high potential return from alternatives.
Prominent on the list are expanding Head Start for preschool children and sending more young people to college on subsidized scholarships. Millions of working parents cannot afford good child care, so federal subsidies here would also pay off handsomely, raising well-being and efficiency in the workplace. There are so many high-yield opportunities, in fact, that maybe consideration should be given to increasing the debt a bit, rather than paying it down.
That politically sensitive option should be on the table in this campaign. After all, the national debt has fallen from more than 50 percent of the gross domestic product in the early 1990's to about 35 percent today, which is like saying that our homeowner's $400-a-month mortgage claims a smaller percentage of his income as he gradually pays it off and his salary rises. He can now borrow more, perhaps to buy an apartment and rent it out at a profit. Debt in America, properly invested, is a tool of enterprise.
ECONOMISTS, of course, know all this, and talk about the options among themselves. Sometimes they review for the public the pros and cons of paying off the national debt, as Mr. Solow did this month in The New York Review of Books.
Like many economists, both liberals and conservatives, he argued that zero national debt is unhealthy. The debt takes the form of risk-free Treasury securities that have an important place in the world. Many investors seek them out in hard or uncertain times, and the Federal Reserve makes use of them to help regulate credit.
Interest rates are the main reason offered for paying down the national debt. In theory, rates will fall as savings are shifted from the public to the private sector, encouraging companies to borrow and invest in more productive modern facilities. That can happen when times are good and confidence is high, as they are now. But in harder, more pessimistic times, investment falls even when rates are low. Given the uncertainties, investing the surplus in education, child care or air transportation may very well produce a higher return than retiring Treasury securities.
Still, there is a case to be made for paying down some debt in good times, to leave more room to borrow when the baby boom generation retires and pension payments soar. Mr. Solow and the economist Paul Samuelson, also an M.I.T. Nobel laureate, even suggest cautiously investing a small portion of the surplus in stocks to help pay those future Social Security benefits.
The options abound and the debate could be exciting, if only the candidates would stop proclaiming their determination to pay off the national debt, and let the debate happen.

A Legacy of Hints for Stain-Free Living

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel

 BODY:
THE instructions for refrigerator soup should have been the tip-off:
"Just open your refrigerator door, pull out leftovers, any vegetables from the bin, dibs and dabs of rice or squash, meat or chicken cut in bite-sized pieces and put it all in a saucepan and add water and some beef or chicken bouillon. Then season with your favorite spices and simmer for a few minutes. Your family won't even recognize those leftovers!" 
 They won't? Kids in New York know the difference between tuna and toro sushi; does anyone think they couldn't identify last night's meatloaf floating in the soup?
Perhaps only Heloise, that American icon of household wisdom, could get away with directions like these. But "In the Kitchen With Heloise" (Perigee Books) is her ninth book; the first eight sold 5.5 million copies (which goes to show that New York City has never been and never will be an American city). Heloise also writes the syndicated Hints From Heloise column that started in 1959 and is published daily in 500 newspapers in 20 countries.
But be advised: since the original Heloise died in 1977, the Heloise in charge has been her daughter, Ponce Heloise Cruse, 49, who lives in San Antonio with her husband, David Evans, a plumbing contractor. She has grown the franchise past the era of the housewife to encompass the house husband, the working mother and the latchkey child, all of whom write the 2,000 to 3,000 letters, faxes and e-mails to Heloise each week. Heloise Inc. employs 11 people, and its brisk, no-nonsense leader shuns "Ms. Cruse" in favor of just plain Heloise. In fact, that's all her American Express card says. Her license plate says HINTS.
Last week, Heloise came to New York, where we met in the test kitchen of the Good Housekeeping Institute; she writes a monthly column for its magazine. She planned on making a few recipes and on talking about the hints that remain the backbone of her books and columns.
As she barreled into the room with publicists and employees in tow, I must say, I had a heart-sinking moment. I grew up reading Heloise, I still read Heloise in Good Housekeeping (though I live in New York, I like to pretend I live in America) and somehow that resourceful soul who seems to cherish 101 ways to use vinegar more than life itself did not jibe with the hard-boiled Texas babe dressed in red, snapping commands to the troops. This Heloise wore four strands of pearls and a Spiderman watch. Huh? "When I'm giving speeches I can check it and it doesn't look like I am," she said crisply. She seemed to be coated in some sort of nonstick spray -- for humans.
The idea of even broaching the latest in hip New York housekeeping trends seemed absurd. This is not a woman to revere the $999 Miele vacuum cleaners that are rich people's most recent gimme. For all of Heloise's bluster, she is the real thing; the child of Depression-era parents, she wastes nothing, even lamenting the lack of a dish towel in her corner of the test kitchen; using so much paper seems wasteful to her.
While New Yorkers pay lip service to the romance of retro, paying $7 for an order of mashed potatoes in a restaurant, or $95 for a dustpan from Williams-Sonoma, Heloise -- for better or worse -- is retro incarnate. One of her hints for roasting a turkey is to slather it in mayonnaise and cook it under an aluminum foil tent. She swears it comes out moist and golden brown. Then there's her Chocolate Sauerkraut Surprise Cake. Could you imagine the proud Park Avenue owner of an Italian-made squeegee from Restoration Hardware whipping that up -- after Pilates? "The sauerkraut makes it moist, almost like brownies," Heloise insisted. Sure it does. But life has enough surprises, doesn't it?
Still, the instinct to own the fancy vacuum cleaner and the instinct to save money on Windex by combining vinegar and water are actually the same; it's the execution (and the pocketbook) that are different. But that's also why Heloise has thrived. The idea of home as a refuge cuts across all economic lines, and the idea of an uber-mommy who knows everything about stain removal and nothing about you has universal appeal. When I read Heloise, I either think, yes, what a great idea (to increase kitchen counter space, work on a cookie sheet that's been fitted into an open drawer), or I think, no, life is too short (to prevent an electric mixer from spattering, fit a shower cap over the bowl with a hole cut in it for the beaters).
"The point of the books and the columns is that I can't be all things to all people," Heloise said. "There are probably hints in this book I might think are silly, but when I get 50 or 100 letters about it, I have to address it without being condescending."
In the Good Housekeeping kitchen, she examined the ingredients for her recipes and immediately spotted errors. Since her personal staff had already left, she tapped her inner Southern belle instead.
"We're going to punt," she drawled in a suddenly syrupy accent. As she bustled about, trying to find a knife and to tame a persnickety gas burner, her voice rose to a girlish pitch, her fury funneling itself into innocent-sounding questions, flung at the other women in white coats who seemed stunned by this red tornado. When she trilled, "Do you all have a knife?" they came running. "Do you want an apron?" one asked tentatively. "No thanks," she said brusquely, back to business. "I figure I can get the stain out."
Her goal, to prepare four dishes, seemed suddenly preposterous. Even for Heloise, it's hard to cook in someone else's kitchen, so we settled on two: Bootleg Beans a la Heloise, her mom's recipe from the 1950's, which was a can of Campbell's pork and beans doctored with bacon, onion, ketchup and brown sugar; and Salmonettes, from the 1960's, which was a concoction of canned salmon, eggs and baking powder, measured out in iced tea spoons she brought from home, and deep fried.
"I do a chat on women.com on the first Thursday of every month," she said, frying an onion in bacon fat, "and the twenty-somethings from New York all love it. They say their moms worked and didn't have time to teach them, but one admitted, 'If she did, I don't think I listened.' That's really the point."
For Heloise, not listening to her own mother was never an option. Eloise Cruse was the wife of an Air Force lieutenant colonel stationed in Honolulu, when she got the idea to write a household hints column for the local newspaper. A general on base assured her she couldn't; she was, after all, only a housewife.
The housewife went to the Honolulu Advertiser, anyway, and offered the column free on a trial basis (the "H" was added to Eloise only after the column was syndicated, so it would sound better with "hints"); when she offered a pamphlet on laundry and received 100,000 self-addressed envelopes, they knew she had a hit.
"Mother was a piece of work," Heloise said simply. "She would buy theatrical hair spray in sapphire blue or emerald green and spray her hair to match her outfits. On a plane recently, I met a man who was stationed in Virginia when my parents were. L. B. J. was in office then, and he threw a party for Texans in the area at the White House. She had sprayed her hair blue and he said, 'Your mother walked in and everybody's mouth fell open, including the president's.' I said, 'Well, you remember her, don't you?' "
Her parents divorced in 1968; her mother's family had a history of heart disease and she was a heavy smoker. She was 58 when she died. Her tombstone reads "Every Housewife's Friend."
"Her hint to me was: 'You're here for a short time. Make the most of it,' " her daughter said. For her that has meant expanding the column to include hints on home offices, composting and CD storage, keeping up smartly with the times while never forsaking the classic concerns.
But after sampling her recipes, I vote to update Heloise in the kitchen, too. The salmonettes tasted like fishy croutons, and the beans didn't cook long enough for the extra ingredients to do their work.
Still, there are plenty of people who adore Heloise's cooking; after her mother died, some readers mailed her their own collections of Heloise recipes. "They thought I'd like to see them and I should send them back when I was done," she said. "It was touching. They also wrote to say that when their own relatives died, they would find Hints From Heloise tucked into the pages of their Bibles, like messages from the past."
She smiled gently. And for the first time that afternoon, it seemed as if the nonstick spray might finally wear off.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Paul A. Blaustein;
Whitehall Growth Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
AS Paul A. Blaustein sees it, investing is an evolutionary process, and flexibility is a key to success. He has used that philosophy throughout his 27-year investing career, most recently at the $173.7 million Whitehall Growth fund, which has become a standout among its peers.
"In the 1970's, the U.S. and world economies weren't growing, so I focused on cyclical stocks," Mr. Blau stein said. "The 1980's were a disinflationary period, so I focused on companies with strong brand names, especially consumer packaged-food businesses." In the 1990's, he added, opportunity was based on "the explosive growth in technology." 
 Mr. Blaustein still likes technology, despite its current volatility. But since he began managing Whitehall Growth two years ago, he has also branched out into other growth areas like health care and financials.
The fund returned 29.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 30, compared with 14.4 percent for its peers in the large blend category, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Blaustein, 52, looks for growth among American companies with market capitalizations of more than $2 billion. He evaluates each stock as if he were buying the entire business.
"I want to be a long-term owner of superior businesses that we try to acquire at attractive prices," he said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. "Over time, we should participate as owners in the increase in the valuation of the company's assets."
Mr. Blaustein does not use computer screens to identify potential purchases. Instead, he keeps a close eye on 200 to 300 stocks with which he has become familiar during his years at other fund groups, including Legg Mason, Oppenheimer Capital and Warburg Pincus.
In evaluating a stock, Mr. Blaustein looks for above-average annual growth in the company's sales and earnings, compared with its industry. Under either measure, that generally means gains of 10 to 30 percent or more. He measures profitability by reviewing return on equity or return on capital, as well as profit margins, to establish whether a company is a market leader.
Finally, he analyzes the sustainability of growth. "We want to have conviction that the company can sustain its position through various economic and product cycles," he said. "Few companies like Coca-Cola can prosper by selling the same product for 100 years."
In Mr. Blaustein's view, "superior businesses" are companies that have had strong growth and profitability for at least 10 years. Such companies also have a competitive edge, like a proprietary product or service.
He also likes to talk to a company's customers, suppliers and competitors as well as to market researchers, business consultants and other industry experts.
Mr. Blaustein works with a seven-member investment committee; it meets weekly to vote on possible changes to the 35 to 40 stocks in the portfolio.
Technology stocks now account for about half of the fund's assets -- a higher-than-usual stake and up from 26 percent two years ago. Mr. Blaustein has been a net seller of tech stocks over that period, so that increase can be attributed to their surge in value.
HE likes the Altera Corporation in San Jose, Calif., which designs and markets semiconductors. It sells a programmable logic device, or P.L.D., that lets users buy cheap chips and program them rather than investing in custom-designed chips.
The P.L.D. "drastically shortens the time to market of a customer's product, which is an enormous advantage to technology companies because prices drop so quickly," he said. The market for P.L.D.'s is growing rapidly, he added, as electronic devices become more sophisticated.
Mr. Blaustein expects Altera's sales and earnings to grow 25 to 30 percent a year, on average, over the next three years. He bought shares in August 1998 at $10.12 each. The stock is now at $39.19, or 25 times his earnings forecast of $1.55 a share for next year.
Another favorite is Cardinal Health Inc., a pharmaceutical services company in Dublin, Ohio. The company's growth rate of roughly 20 percent is driven partly by its fast-growing drug distribution business, he said. It also runs a high-margin drug dispensing business and has a strong manufacturing operation, he added.
He bought shares in July 1997 at $36.45; they now trade at $93.63, or 30 times his earnings forecast of $3.10 a share for the fiscal year ending next June.
Mr. Blaustein also likes the Costco Wholesale Corporation, the warehouse club retailer based in Issaquah, Wash. The stock sells at a significant discount to those of retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot because of Costco's shorter track record and smaller base of stores, Mr. Blaustein said. But sales and earnings should grow about 15 percent a year, on average, over the next three years, he said, because the company offers lower prices on higher quality merchandise. Costco has added services like photo processing and pharmacies, he added, and has been expanding into the southern and central regions of the United States.
He bought shares in January 1995 at $6.88. They now trade at $34.31, or 22 times his earnings forecast of $1.52 a share for the fiscal year ending next August.

Unsound Bytes?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week George W. Bush accused Al Gore of "analog thinking in a digital age." It's a terrific line; my compliments to whoever wrote it. It's also a bit unfair.
 True, Mr. Gore didn't invent the Internet -- but then, he never said he had. What he did say was, "During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet." That was a deeply unfortunate sentence -- but what makes it so unfortunate is that now it is impossible for Mr. Gore to get the credit he actually deserves. Declan McCullagh, the Wired writer who first played up Mr. Gore's remark, puts it this way: the vice president "was one of the first politicians to realize that those bearded, bespectacled researchers were busy crafting something that could, just maybe, become pretty important." 
 For what it's worth, tech-sector C.E.O.'s seem to be divided about evenly between Messrs. Gore and Bush. That is a sharp contrast with C.E.O.'s at large, who overwhelmingly favor Mr. Bush -- a preference cynics might attribute to the large personal gains that people with seven- or eight-figure incomes would receive from that tax cut.
 Still, Mr. Bush is right: Mr. Gore doesn't know how to manage the new economy. But then neither does Mr. Bush. And neither does anyone else.
 The big difference between the new economy and the old is the changed nature of investment. In the past, businesses primarily invested in the tangible means of production, things like buildings and machines. The value of a company was at least somewhat related to the value of its physical capital; to grow bigger, a business had to build new factories roughly in proportion to the increase in its sales. But now businesses increasingly invest in intangibles. And once you've designed a chip, or written the code for a new operating system, no further investment is needed to ship the product to yet another customer.
 One consequence of the changed nature of investment is a strong tendency for markets to develop into temporary monopolies. Why monopolies? Because when the required size of investment doesn't depend on how much you sell, a bigger market share is definitely better. Why temporary? Because sooner or later, and usually sooner, new technology makes your old investment worthless.
 The inevitability of monopolies in a knowledge economy -- indeed, the hope of achieving such monopolies becomes the main driver of investment -- creates new puzzles for antitrust policy. The Microsoft case poses real dilemmas, and it is surely only the first of many.
 Meanwhile, the intangibility of a company's most important assets makes it extremely hard to figure out what that company is really worth. That may partly explain the nauseating volatility of stock prices, though it's still hard to believe that enough real news arrives on any given day to justify these 7 percent or 8 percent swings in the Nasdaq.
 Michael Mandel, the economics editor at Business Week, argues in his new book "The Coming Internet Depression" that this financial instability is more than speculative froth. He warns of a sort of New Age-economic tailspin in which declining confidence crimps technology investments, which depresses productivity growth, which makes such investments even less profitable, and so on. In principle, he could be right; something like that scenario has been batted around for years by academic economists. (The possibility arises naturally in "endogenous growth theory." Aren't you sorry you asked?)
 If Mr. Mandel is right in practice -- which I doubt, but who knows? -- the next president could face novel economic challenges that defy conventional solutions.
 But while I have the horrifying suspicion that Mr. Gore has heard of endogenous growth theory, and would actually enjoy talking about it, this is not what Mr. Bush had in mind. In context, it's pretty clear he meant that Mr. Gore is an old-economy fuddy-duddy because he insists that you can't spend the same money twice -- that you can't divert Social Security taxes into individual accounts for young workers and use that same money to pay benefits to their parents.
 Well, it's a new economy, but it's not that new. The rules of arithmetic are the same, whether you use a slide rule or a supercomputer.

For Funds, Ripples From the Middle East

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
IN just two weeks this month, as investors worried whether the violence in the Middle East would escalate into war, the stock market in Israel fell 16 percent. In Egypt, the market dropped 20 percent.
The volatility of the region also affected many American investors, a great percentage of whom buy their stocks through mutual funds. 
 But for them, the impact was indirect, because few funds contain shares of Middle Eastern companies. What hurt them were the global reverberations of the conflict. And that boiled down to one word: oil.
Wall Street and other global markets were concerned that the violence would translate into higher prices for oil -- which it did, briefly -- and that those prices could lead to inflation and higher interest rates.
That thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Oct. 12 -- the day that a Palestinian mob mauled two Israeli soldiers, Israel retaliated with rocket attacks and terrorists blew a hole in a United States warship in Yemen.
Last week, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to the terms of a cease-fire after clashes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
"For American investors, the oil effect was much more significant than the direct effect on Middle East companies," said Grace Pineda, who manages the $132 million Developing Capital Markets fund for Merrill Lynch. The fund has about 5 percent of its money in Israel and about 0.5 percent in Egypt.
From late September, when the latest trouble erupted in the Middle East, through last week, the broad markets and several categories of mutual funds lost ground in the United States. In the most violent period, Oct. 5 through 12, equity income funds were down 4.80 percent, according to Lipper Inc. Growth funds were off 7.79 percent, and growth-and-income funds 6.12 percent.
Those funds generally do not contain shares of Middle Eastern companies, yet the trouble in the region was among several factors -- along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications stocks -- that brought down prices.
Emerging-markets funds declined 7.17 percent over that period. Although many of those funds invest in Middle Eastern companies, the ripple effect of the threat to oil affected them most, analysts and fund managers said. And those funds' investments in the region are still relatively small, usually less than 10 percent of the portfolios.
"Most of the markets in the Middle East are insignificant in terms of the amount of capital invested in them from the United States," said Mark Madden, manager of the $250 million Pioneer Emerging Markets fund.
Mr. Madden invests mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Korea. About 5 percent of his portfolio is in Israel and less than 1 percent is in Egypt.
EXCEPT during such tense times in the Middle East, analysts and fund managers said, fluctuations in the United States markets, the biggest and most dynamic in the world, are more likely to influence share prices in the Middle East than vice versa.
"The first thing overseas traders want to know when they come in in the morning is, 'What did the Nasdaq and the Dow do?' " said Howard Klein, an institutional broker specializing in emerging markets at SG Cowen Securities in New York.
Traders in Israel in particular have their eyes on the Nasdaq. Their country is also home to global technology, telecommunications and pharmaceutical companies, which depend on economic currents in the United States and Europe much more than on developments in the Middle East. Shares of many Israeli companies are sold as American depository receipts on the Nasdaq.
Only a handful of small funds concentrate on the Middle East. One of them, the $25 million American Israel Index mutual fund, is made up exclusively of Israeli companies, 16 traded on the Tel Aviv exchange and 19 on the Nasdaq. Like more broadly based mutual funds, its shares fell during the recent turmoil. But the fund's investors have remained confident. In the last few weeks, money flowing into the fund has far exceeded redemptions.

HEADLINE: C.E.O. ROUND TABLE;
When That Corner Office Is Also a Dorm Room

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
COLLEGE as a networking opportunity. The Internet as a protective screen, through which performance trumps age and inexperience. Trading the leisure of youth for the chance to make an impact -- and wondering whether it is worth it.
These themes emerged when four college-age founders of fledgling technology companies gathered in Boston to talk with Money & Business about the entrepreneurial urge that strikes many members of their generation. Drawn from three colleges in the Boston area and from companies at different stages of development, they had the common experience of being undergraduates and senior executives simultaneously. 
 Jeffrey Gut, 21, started CollegiateMall.com, an Internet retailing company, during his sophomore year at Boston University, because he found the process of acquiring beanbag chairs and other trappings of college life frustrating and inefficient. He returned to school this fall as a senior after taking a year off to get his company off the ground, but he continues to serve as chief executive.
Mykolas Rambus, 21, chief executive of Lobby 7, a wireless services company, graduated last spring from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the other four founders of the company, which they ran from a dormitory room during their final semester. Now based in Boston, Lobby 7 has obtained venture capital from i-Group, an affiliate of Softbank, and is now working to raise its next round of financing.
Greg Y. Tseng, 20, a senior at Harvard, started FlyingChickens.com, a price-comparison Web site, after finding that he could save $40 by buying a physics textbook online. With the motto "fly the coop," challenging students to abandon the campus's main bookstore, the Harvard Coop, Mr. Tseng introduced his site during the summer after his sophomore year. The company has since merged with Limespot, a Web portal for college students that was founded by a student at Cornell University; Mr. Tseng is now chief operating officer of Limespot.
Alastair Rampell, 19, is a junior at Harvard and the chief executive of Rampell Software, which provides a variety of software products and consulting services to consumers and corporate clients. Mr. Rampell began writing computer programs when he was in the fourth grade, and his program designed to ensure a lasting connection to America Online won him a significant following during notorious network overload problems in late 1996.
Around a conference-room table with Amy Harmon and Kevin McKenna of The Times on a sunny fall morning, they explored their experiences of entrepreneurial precocity. Following are excerpts of that wide-ranging conversation.
 
The Lure of E-Commerce
 
Q. -- What is it about the Internet that leads so many more young people to start companies?
 
RAMPELL -- People in general take me more seriously because of the Internet. On the Internet, everything is age-blind. It's ethnic-blind. It's religion-blind. If you send an e-mail to somebody, you just see a company; if they are going to do a good job, that's all that matters.
I don't think I would have gotten hired to do some things that I did at age 13, had they known I was 4 foot 11. I had only been doing this for about a year and a half, but they didn't know that.
 
GUT -- When I started CollegiateMall, I was faking being a big company. The first four or five months, I had fake e-mail accounts, and I had six fake "employees" that would send e-mails to other people at companies. What's so neat about the Internet is that you can really front things -- not to deceive people, but, for example, when people wanted customer service, they'd e-mail "customer service," and "customer service" sends back an e-mail.
That same e-mail could not come from me as president -- it just wouldn't make sense. So I would send an e-mail that would come from, you know, Joe Whatever, the customer service manager.
Shoppers on my site, for the most part, have the same experience that you can get on Amazon -- you order product; it shows up within a week. They're saving a lot of money, the customer service is good, and I'm not nearly the size of Amazon.
 
Q. -- What made you decide to start a company now, when you're supposed to be going to class and having fun before hitting the real world?
 
RAMBUS -- I started my first business when I was in 10th grade, so business has always been sort of a given. It wasn't a matter of if, but when, and it didn't make sense to wait.
 
RAMPELL -- I started programming originally to fix things that I didn't like. And then I saw that there was an enormous business potential. The margins on software are unbelievable, because there are no marginal costs whatsoever.
 
GUT -- When I was 9 years old and living in North Carolina, I invented this product called "Zip Cord." It was like a fashion accessory, and we sold it in 37 states and 3 countries. So I very early learned the thrill and excitement of starting a business. And then 10 years later, when I was in college, you couldn't help but see the Internet was revolutionizing business. I guess I just naturally saw an opportunity where I thought I could make money.
 
TSENG -- Most companies fail, and an even a greater percentage of first-timers fail. So if you're going to start your first company, it's a lot better to do it in college, so that if you fail, you're still in college. I mean, we're still Harvard students; it's not like we're, you know, toast. But if you are 40 and married with kids and a mortgage, and you fail with your first company, what are you going to do then?
 
Hearing Older Voices
 
Q. -- How did your parents and instructors react? Did anyone in your life counsel you to just concentrate on school?
 
RAMPELL -- My mom said that every day. She still does.
 
GUT -- I thought that the smartest thing was to take a leave of absence. My parents and family and close friends were all very supportive of what I was doing, but I still wasn't totally sure. Leaving school is a big decision, and when I contacted professors, a lot of them were like: "Don't leave. It's the wrong thing to do. You're riding on a technology wave that's going to crash and you're going to get burned."
But I went back to my parents, and they said, "You're doing something that's working -- stick with it." So that's what I did.
 
RAMBUS -- I stopped really focusing on school in my sophomore year. I went to two or three lectures for certain classes. I just spent time working with the resources at M.I.T. -- there's a vast array of networking opportunities, contacts you can make through professors, events to attend in the venture community. So I spent most of the past three years prior to graduation doing stuff like that, rather than focusing on classes.
 
Q. -- What happened to your grades?
 
RAMBUS -- They weren't all that bad until last semester. But it was the last semester, so that's O.K.
 
Q. -- Were your colleges and universities willing to accommodate the business demands that conflicted with your classes?
 
TSENG -- At Harvard, until last year, it was actually prohibited to start a company in your dorm room. So we had to get an off-campus mailbox and other e-mail accounts and stuff like that. My cell phone is our company phone. That rule changed last year, and now Harvard is starting to become a lot more supportive of business. But definitely, when we started, it wasn't the case.
 
Q. -- There was literally a rule against students starting companies?
 
RAMPELL -- Yeah, there was. Fifty years ago, if you were to run a business out of your room, what was it? Like, you're storing poultry? What are you putting in your room? You were actually using Harvard's resources.
Now, it's not actually a strain on the college. If you type an e-mail every now and then, and that's what running a business consists of, it doesn't really affect them at all. I think they came to that realization.
 
GUT -- B.U. has changed a lot. Had I entered school two years later, I probably wouldn't have had to take a leave. They've established something called the E-Business Hatchery -- they're choosing companies and in some form helping to incubate them, and then bringing the venture community to those student-run businesses.
 
RAMBUS -- At M.I.T. there are no rules, except that you can't have a corporate Web server running on one of their I.P. addresses. There's a statistic that BancBoston puts out, that says if you took all the companies M.I.T. graduates have started, it would create the world's 18th-largest economy over all. I think it speaks pretty well to M.I.T.'s view on new companies, and it's completely institutionalized.
 
Q. -- When you try to raise money, do people take you less seriously because you're a student?
 
TSENG -- At least in the venture capital world, they definitely see it as a much bigger risk, because you're not able to devote 110 percent to your company -- you know, maybe only 105 percent. So we've actually had a pretty tough time. All the money we have raised so far has been from private investors, friends and family.
Now, though, we have a lot of people who are out of college, who are working full time, so it's going better, and we have some more promising leads.
 
RAMBUS -- We had no difficulty raising our Series A first round of capital financing . This is while we're still in college, and with no product lines yet. We're a services company with the promise of future revenue growth; that's it, the idea.
I'm sure the M.I.T. name helps. And showing the V.C.'s that you know what you don't know -- that's very important. We recognize there's a lot to do, and we intend to recruit senior management and figure out a lot of different pieces to the business. V.C.'s are very receptive to that.
 
GUT -- Somebody once put it clearly to me. I was in a meeting with a venture capital company, and they said to me, "Are you a student or are you an entrepreneur?" And at that moment I realized you really can't be both.
That was the point when I said, "O.K., I'm taking a year off of school."
Once I did that, things completely changed. It wasn't, "Oh, he's 19, he's 20" -- it was, "How good is the business model?" And my business model was judged just like that of somebody who is 25.
 
Of Energy and Experience
 
Q. -- How does your age affect the day-to-day running of your business? Does it color your interactions with older employees or potential business partners?
 
TSENG -- All of our employees are, I think, 25 or younger. So there's really no age barrier there.
 
RAMBUS -- It's almost an advantage being young. You tend to work long hours. I work 18- and 20-hour days. A lot of my co-founders do the same thing. From that standpoint, we're able to deliver 30 percent more per week in getting stuff done.
There are experience lags, things you learn the hard way, but over all, I'd say it's a benefit. In this market, things are so operations-centric: can you deliver, what does your margin look like, etc. -- that's what is most important.
 
GUT -- There are some people who say, "When I was 19, I was out partying, and I wouldn't trust my money with somebody who is 19." But I think, by and large, those people are missing out on the new economy, and there are very few of those people left. Most people realize that a lot of the best ideas in today's economy are coming from young people.
 
Q. -- Looking back to the beginning of your business experience, what were you naive about? What did you learn the hard way?
 
RAMPELL -- Marketing is unbelievably important, and I didn't really realize that. I had a couple of great products that I thought could sell very well. But I just kind of put them there and expected: "Everybody will find it. It's a good product. People will buy it." And I was just dead wrong.
 
TSENG -- One thing I learned is that you should trust your intuition. I read a lot of magazines and trade journals, and when you are doing it for the first time, you tend to think something should be done a certain way because it's been written. It's not until you see the results that you realize: "I was right. I should have trusted myself."
A concrete example of that is when I had to hire campus representatives at different colleges. The conventional wisdom about the Internet was, "Speed is everything; expand as quickly as possible." So I hired anyone I could find, even people in high school. I hired people that I knew were unqualified just to have a presence at the school, so we'd get 30 schools instead of 10.
And what ended up happening is, of course, those 20 people that were incompetent didn't deliver anything and just wasted my time. The lesson I learned is, only hire the best people, and more generally, trust your intuition.
 
RAMBUS -- Learn your tactics before you have to use them. Looking back, rather than just strategizing about how to get into the market, I wish I had spent more time figuring out how actually to do it once we got there. Because once you are in the fray, you don't have time to think and plan what's the best way to do things.
 
GUT -- I wish I had known how important it is to write a business plan. I always felt, as with my first business, that if I do something that is successful I won't need a business plan, because it's successful and therefore everyone will be interested in it.
Yet it was still very hard to create investor interest. In today's world, you really do need a strong business plan, and I didn't do that until eight months after we were up and running.
 
RAMPELL -- When I started, I did everything, and I'm really not the best at doing everything. I had to learn that even though it's out of pocket, you're better off paying somebody to do something if they can do a better job than you can.
 
Back to School, or Not
 
Q. -- At this point, would you gain anything from getting an M.B.A.?
 
RAMBUS -- Absolutely not. First, M.I.T.'s undergraduate Sloan Program is basically a graduate program. But, No. 2, I have learned more in the last four and a half months than I ever would have in any institution. If I need someone to really know financial accounting extraordinarily well, I'll hire somebody from Wall Street.
 
GUT -- I'm planning on going to business school. I think there's a lot I can learn in graduate school. I really hope that I'll have the time.
 
TSENG -- I wouldn't go to business school for learning how to write a business plan or how to manage people. But for some reason -- I don't know if it's what you learn there or whatever else -- most of the top C.E.O.'s are M.B.A.'s. If you look at the C.E.O.'s of the top 800 companies, more than 60 of them are Harvard M.B.A.'s -- and that's just Harvard M.B.A.'s, not M.B.A.'s in general. I think that that says something.
I know people who go to business school just so they won't be replaced as C.E.O. when their company gets to a certain level.
 
Q. -- Who in the business world do you look to as a role model?
 
RAMBUS -- Craig McCaw the cellular telephone pioneer . He is a leader of the wireless communications paradigm. He's done a lot of behind-the-scenes work that has enabled the next major revolution.
 
RAMPELL -- I'd have to say Bill Gates. That's kind of a staple, but it's really amazed me how much Microsoft has affected everybody and everything. It's amazing to me how well it continues to do, because you can have an incredible software product but two years later you're done, you're finished. Microsoft has used the success of their past products to ensure the success of their future ones, which is something that I try to do.
 
GUT -- I've always been able to look up to my father as a role model for the way he runs his business. Any decision I'm not 100 percent sure of, he's the first person I go to. He's extremely old-economy -- he manufactures zippers -- whereas I'm on the opposite end. But at the end of the day, strong business fundamentals cross the borders.
 
TSENG -- I don't know if I would call this person a role model, but he's a good friend of mine and he's maybe six months older than me. He started his first company when he was 13. And every single company has been success after success. Now he's dropping out of Stanford to start what he thinks will be a billion-dollar company. He's a lot more experienced than I am, so I don't really feel all that foolish calling him a mentor. He just has such good business intuition.
 
Q. -- What do you see as the potential for your current business, and how far out in time do you look at it? A year? Five years?
 
RAMPELL -- I have a very long-term view. There are just hundreds of millions of solutions that people are looking for. If I can get everybody in this country to give me a penny, 270 million people, that's a lot of money right there. Or even a dollar.
I think you can sell a product to every single computer user in this country that they would find useful. And that's where I like to orient myself. As long as people have needs to be fulfilled, I think that I'll have a company that will be very successful.
 
RAMBUS -- Lobby 7 is in a trillion-dollar space, no question. We could be the next Microsoft, as far as scale and influence in the wireless world. That is our aspiration: global domination, very quick.
As far as my role within the company, right now we've already begun the C.E.O. search. We're looking for the figurehead to take the company to the next level. I'm sure I'll be part of the company for a long time; it's just a question of where.
 
Q. -- When companies grow, founders don't necessarily continue to run the show. Is that something you're O.K. with, or do you see yourselves continuing to run your businesses as they get bigger?
 
RAMPELL -- I would say that that's really the only thing I enjoy doing. It's "Rampell Software" because it's my company; I want to keep it that way, and I really enjoy directing things, being at the very top of things.
I don't like programming. I don't like answering e-mail. I don't like doing the marketing. I like to be able to delegate all that, and determine the overall direction of the company.
 
TSENG -- It's possible that once our company is self-sustaining and consistently profitable, the excitement won't be as great, and I might get bored with it, quite honestly. At that point, I might move on to something else.
I've heard that the first company you start is where you do your learning, and the second is where you make your money. In about 10 years, my ambition is to start the next Intel, and I wouldn't want to be replaced as C.E.O. then.
 
GUT -- I ultimately want to do what's best for the company, best for my shares in the company.
Right now I think I'm the best in charge, and that's why I'm in charge. As soon as I think that somebody else could do better, the first thing I would do is find that person and put them in charge. I'm not stuck on being in charge; I'm stuck on being successful.
 
As the Parade Passes By
 
Q. -- What sacrifices have you made to be students and business leaders at the same time? What have you missed out on?
 
RAMPELL -- Sleeping is No. 1. Sleeping is good, but I don't always have time to do it.
 
RAMBUS -- Intellectual exploration has been limited. There's not a lot of time for reading new books or worrying about this or that new technology. So at some point in my life, I'm sure I'll probably go back to school -- but not at all for an M.B.A. -- probably architecture or something like that.
 
GUT -- I have two roommates. Last night at about 11, they left, and came back about 3 in the morning. I was still in front of my computer. Then they went out again and came back about 4:30, and I had just turned off my computer. They had been out for six or seven hours having a good time.
It's in the back of your head: I'm doing all this, I'm learning a lot and hopefully I'm making money, but, you know, 40 years from now, when I'm still probably doing the same thing, working and starting companies, will I look back and say: "Why was I doing that when I was 21? I should have been out having a good time."
 
RAMPELL -- You really have to think, is the idea that you have now so unique? Is it such a timely event that you can't do it at any other time? And I'm not really sure. I don't really know enough to say no, so I want to keep pursuing what I'm doing. But I think it's definitely a tradeoff.
 
Q. -- How much are you motivated by money?
 
RAMPELL -- Obviously I like money. But I kind of view it more as a yardstick for how much I've accomplished.
If you work 80 hours a week, like some people in investment banking, you can make a lot of money, but you're really killing yourself. This summer I worked a lot, but I loved the fact that whenever I wanted, I could go play squash twice a day. And I didn't have to tell somebody I'm taking time off; I just did.
The good thing about owning your own company is that you have a financial stake. You do things because you want to. You're not going to lie to your boss and say you're sick.
 
Q. -- The markets look very different now than they did six or eight months ago. Has it cast any kind of pall on what you are doing?
 
RAMBUS -- For us, what's happened in the market has actually helped, because the focus is now on certain sectors that are doing very well, and we happen to be in one of those sectors.
 
GUT -- It's been great for me, with the exception of last March, when we were very close to closing our first round of funding and the group we were working with wanted to take time and see how things were going to settle.
But in the last nine months Col legeClub.com, which was big in our space, filed for bankruptcy and another competitor, The DormStore, just shut down. I've gotten a whole bunch of people all of a sudden with a lot of expertise in what I'm doing, who need work, and who are not so expensive to hire anymore.
We ended up just raising money privately again, and we're profitable. Our revenue has tripled now from what it was six months ago, and our profits are just behind that, so we're growing very fast. We're at 31 schools, and we hope to be at over 200 by next year, without raising venture capital.
 
Q. -- Napster, a company founded by a college student, is challenging conventional conceptions of intellectual property and copyright. Does Napster's popularity have implications for you as current or future owners of intellectual property?
 
RAMPELL -- I think it's going to be impossible to get rid of Napster and things like Napster.
I have a problem with this every day. If everybody using my software paid for it, I'd have my own jet right now. But I clearly don't, because not everybody is that honest. And to some extent, I really don't mind.
Some piracy can almost be good, because later on in life, the kid who might have pirated a program is going to need that program, and he's already been exposed to it. That's why I make all my software so you can use it before you actually have to pay for it.
 
GUT -- A year and a half ago, very few people knew about Napster, but now everyone is using it. And that's what impresses me, that something can just so quickly be in such demand that everybody wants it and can use it. Hopefully CollegiateMall will be able to figure out how to make that happen, too.
 
TSENG -- Napster's a good response to people who ask the question: "Is the Net revolution over?" This is a 19-year-old kid who is making all the big record companies shake in their boots. There's always room for innovation. That's something I'm going to believe in forever.
Not Over the Hill at 30
 
Q. -- It is a classic interview question, but it's particularly relevant with this group: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
 
RAMPELL -- A lot of what I'm doing right now is based on how computers work right now. I'm not really sure what the state of computers will be in 10 years.
There might be a paradigm shift. There might be new kinds of technology that completely change the way people interact. Computers may make my software obsolete.
But the basic idea, the premise behind what I do, is to just make things better. I plan to continue to do that.
Where I see myself going in 10 years is moving toward finding a way to sell my products as a service that you rent, or pay for every month, as opposed to buying something once and then you've got it forever.
 
TSENG -- It's interesting that you said 10 years, because that's when I'm going to start the next Intel.
Since the summer after I graduated from high school, I've been doing research in molecular electronics. What we're focusing on now is using molecules to compute. Those devices will be approximately a million times smaller than what are currently in computers.
You've probably heard of Moore's Law, which is that every 18 months the number of devices on a Pentium chip doubles. But at some point silicon just won't work any more, and that point is going to come around the year 2010.
I have a passion for science and I have a passion for business, and I'd love to combine both of those things and set up the next Intel.
 
RAMBUS -- Ten years from now, either I'll be part of a new operating unit at Lobby 7, or whatever it's called by then, or I'll be starting an international real estate investment trust with some of my friends. That's more from intellectual curiosity -- it would be fun to figure out how to do it. But 10 years to me is a long time from now.
 
GUT -- The way CollegiateMall is going, there are three options: We get bought out, we eventually do an I.P.O., or the company stays private. In all of those instances, I really love what I'm doing and I'd love to keep doing it.
But 10 years from now, I don't think that excitement, which is what I think I'm all about, will be there. I don't want to do something if my passion is not there. So I don't know where I'll be. I might be just getting out of graduate school.
 
Q. -- What about getting a job in corporate America?
 
TSENG -- I mentioned before that I'm driven by achievement, and I'm also driven by impact. Right now I'm only 20, and Limespot is not going to have the hugest impact in the world, but my professional ambition for life is to have big impact. Microsoft has big impact; Intel does, and presumably the next Intel would. But in a big machine where I'm steadily going up this ladder trying to express my views or make impact and not being able to -- I have no interest in that.
 
GUT -- I think there's been a big shift.
There's this service that B.U. has, where you can post your resume for companies that come on campus and recruit. I put my resume on there just because I like to see what I'm worth, for lack of a better word. Laughter. And it was interesting to me how a lot of these old-line companies are really trying hard to convince graduating seniors that they've changed, and that working for them is different than it used to be.
So many people today don't want to work like that. To me, it's pretty neat that there are students all around the country who have products I sold them. I want to have an impact wherever I am, and I think that corporate America has that challenge when they recruit people -- to make people feel like whatever they're doing, it is going to have an impact.
 
RAMPELL -- There's so much that I can learn from a company like G.E., which does everything well, and it's huge. It makes tons of money. Even Coca-Cola, which just sells soft drinks -- they're in the business of selling, I'm in the business of selling. We're in the same business. I can learn a lot from them, and who knows, maybe they'll be able to learn something from me someday.
 
Apart From the Crowd
 
Q. -- What special challenges confront companies like the ones you are running?
 
RAMPELL -- One problem that you have with the Internet is this idea of perfect competition. I think it's going to have the effect of commoditizing a lot of goods. It's very hard to distinguish yourself based on price, because if you try to do that, then the people who are buying your products are not going to have any kind of loyalty to you whatsoever. If someone else comes along with lower prices, because they have some kind of new efficiency, or they're in a foreign country with cheaper labor costs, then you're finished. You've lost your customer base. It's hard.
 
GUT -- I don't think any company today can ever truly say, "We really have strong barriers to entry," or "We've really put out the competition."
That's been the hardest thing for me: What can I do so someone can't come in and do what I'm doing? And I think that every company in the Internet faces that difficulty. There are no barriers to entry. Anybody can get involved, so you can never rest.

Saving Souls and Salmon

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS; Jim Robbins, a frequent contributor to The New York Times, lives in Helena, Mont.

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont.

 BODY:
ARCHBISHOP ALEX BRUNETT entered the towering St. James cathedral in downtown Seattle and walked over to a baptismal font. "The water isn't just sitting there," Archbishop Brunett said, gesturing to the small, clover- leaf-shaped pool where the holy water was circulated by a pump. "We don't baptize people in stagnant water, but flowing water, water that is alive."
So vital is the concept of living water to Catholic theology, he says, that he and seven of his fellow Catholic bishops from Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia will soon release a Pastoral Letter that calls on Catholics and others to create a new environmental and spiritual awareness about the Columbia River watershed, the region's main waterway. 
 Called "The Columbia River Watershed: Realities and Possibilities" the document came about, Catholic leaders said, because the river was in such dire straits from a century of unbridled logging, mining, grazing and dam building. About 16 million salmon once migrated from the Pacific each year to spawn in the tributaries along the 1,200 miles of the Columbia, a number that has dwindled to around 700,000.
The eight bishops are collectively the leaders of 1.2 million Catholic parishioners spread over 260,000 square miles in the United States and Canada, and the region's largest single denomination. The letter has been five years in the making and is due to come out at the end of the year.
Although the letter stops short of an opinion on some of the river's most contentious issues, like tearing out dams, it does plow new theological ground, calling the river a "sacramental commons."
"A sacrament is a moment of encounter with God," said John Hart, a professor of environmental science at Carroll University, a catholic school in Helena, Mont., and the author of the document. "To say the river is a sacramental commons means people can experience the creator in creation, outside the formal church settings." The letter, which has been circulating in draft form, injects a new element into an extremely contentious battle in the Northwest. Environmentalists, Indian tribes, fishermen and others argue that salmon in the river could be lost if drastic measures aren't taken, including the removal of four dams along the lower Snake River to restore spawning habitat. Farmers, shippers and other business interests claims such actions will harm the region's economy. The Clinton administration recently decided against removal of the four dams.
Many who work in resource extraction industries in the Northwest feel the letter has a liberal, anti-business slant. "Corporate capital intensive operations and profit maximization practices, more than environmental laws, are costing timber-related jobs," the draft letter reads. In it the bishops vow to reduce the use of gold in church adornments -- an implicit criticism of the region's mining activities.
Mr. Hart has found himself the target of angry e-mail messages and phone calls from miners. One accused him of "hiding behind the skirts of the bishop." Certainly, the bishops have not ducked the controversy they have created. Kirwin Werner is a Catholic who teaches science at the Salish Kootenai College in Montana. He attended one meeting at which a logger in opposition to the project harangued Bishop William Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., the chairman of the Pastoral Letter steering committee. "Skylstad stood up to him," Werner said. "And when he was done Skylstad told him, 'Well, times have changed."'
Environmentalists are also unhappy, believing the church was co-opted by its conservatives, and so refused to call for the breaching of dams along the Columbia.
STILL, the response to the letter from the many Catholics in the region has been mostly positive, said John Reid, a consultant in Seattle who is director of the pastoral letter project. "Seventy five percent are in favor of it and people are saying things like 'I am proud to be a Catholic' and 'My God, the Catholics are dealing with the real world,' " said Mr. Reid. He also said that about 25 percent of Catholics were telling the Church, "You've been co-opted by the eco-terrorists."
Tribal leaders seem particularly encouraged by the letter. "Maybe God has spoken to them," joked Don Sampson, a Yakima Indian who is also executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, a coalition of tribes that seeks to restore the salmon and a traditional way of life. "I hope the pope gets on board."
More seriously, Mr. Sampson said: "The church is being up front and dispelling the myth of Manifest Destiny and dominion over the Earth. That's refreshing and welcome. But I'd like to see them call for action rather than just reflect."
Will the concept of a sacred watershed be taken to heart by Catholics whose actions are degrading the river? It just may, said Jeremy Fivecrows, a Umatilla Indian and a public affairs specialist at the Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.y "It's easy to marginalize Native American religion," Mr. Fivecrows said. "It's a lot harder to marginalize your own religion."
While the Pope and American bishops have made strong statements about the environment in recent years, some wonder if the Catholics have really gotten religion on the matter. Though it is being promoted as an effort to reclaim a river, the Pastoral Letter may also be an effort by the Catholic Church not to go the way of the salmon.
"The fact that the bishops are willing to do this is a significant development," said Dieter Hessel, director of the Program on Ecology, Justice and Faith, a nonprofit group in Princeton, N.J., that helps seminaries and university religion departments integrate ecology into their teaching. "How it's followed up -- how rank-and-file Catholics respond -- is a real question."'
Some critics, inside and outside the church, say the whole exercise rings hollow since the church refuses to deal with what many consider to be the fundamental environmental problem: overpopulation.
"It's not meant to resolve questions, but to point out the importance of this great river," said Archbishop Brunett. "People say, 'Stay in church where you belong,' but that's not what we've been called to be. We're trying to establish a sacredness in the world around us."'

HEADLINE: The Nation: Voter Tune Out;
Focusing on the Few, Blind to the Many

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: SAGINAW, Mich.

 BODY:
IN the cliffhanger that is the 2000 race for president, the drama should be palpable. Suspense should be building because, with just 16 days left, either Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush could take the White House.
Why, then, in the tightest presidential contest in decades, do people seem more at the edge of boredom than at the edge of their seats? 
 The audience for the three presidential debates fell sharply from most other campaigns, and was no better than four years ago -- when the race was something of a dud. Ratings were down on the national conventions. And voting experts project that despite the closeness of the race, turnout at the polls will not likely surpass 1996, and may dip further.
It may be the candidates' own fault. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have so narrow-casted their message to a sliver of voters in swing states crucial for an electoral college victory that they have deserted the rest. Meanwhile, those in the sights of the candidates -- in fierce battlegrounds like here in Michigan -- seem to yearn for candidates who can stir more passion.
Rather than talk about the merits of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, two patrons at Dawn Donuts in Saginaw ("101 Delicious Varieties"), a Democrat and a Republican, lamented last week about how they missed a politician like Ronald Reagan.
"I didn't like him," said John Anguiano, 65, the Democrat, who explained that he never voted for Mr. Reagan "But he was a good politician because he was a good actor. He knew how to smile."
Personality aside, the problem for many people may not be a paucity of issues, but the issues that the candidates chose to discuss. More and more, the nominees are focusing on those few million undecided voters who, if they choose to vote at all, may decide the election. So even if the race is climactic, that may not be enough to make voting relevant to a wider audience. It may be similar to how some people view movie stars: they like to gossip about them but do not bother to see their movies.
"People have increasingly come to see the election as a kind of drama but one that doesn't have some direct affect on their lives," said Neal Gabler, author of "Life, the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality." (Knopf, 1998.) "There's a very interesting distinction: You can be a political junkie but not vote. That's a new phenomenon."
The wider public may also feel neglected because, as Curtis B. Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, put it: "There's a broad mass of the American people who are not involved in most of the issues at stake. The candidates are not talking to a lot of people."
The prescription drug and Medicare proposals that are so in the forefront of the campaign, for example, are designed to appeal to the crucial block of elderly voters. No wonder young people tell pollsters they feel even more alienated from the process this year. Other segments of the population feel downright left out: When was the last time one of the candidates made a speech on issues near and dear to big city dwellers?
What the candidates are talking about seems only to accentuate their similarities. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have strikingly different philosophies and stands on everything ranging from abortion to the role of government to the Supreme Court to gun laws. Yet, in the candidates' determination to be all things to all voters, it is hardly surprising that voters cannot tell the two apart (even when they are not standing side-by-side wearing red ties).
Gun control seemed a natural this year for the Democrats. But the vice president has largely stayed clear of the issue because polls suggest it will not win him any votes among undecided voters in swing states. Same with capital punishment. Both candidates favor it, but Mr. Gore has not even probed Mr. Bush's potential vulnerability by addressing racial disparities and other issues the death penalty underscores.
The truth is, the passion has been diminishing for some time, but is more obvious this year given that the closeness of the race would seem to stir some excitement. Part of reason for the lack of engagement is that there are so many other distractions. If Sundaysoccer practice is taking priority over church for some families, how can politics be sacred?
Yet factors unique to the current campaign -- namely the nominees themselves -- are also driving the lack of engagement.
An obvious explanation is that in blissful economic times, voters never have much taste for politics. That is especially true when no war-and-peace issues are brewing. In 1960, voters seemed riveted by the presidential campaign not because the economy was in the tank (it wasn't) but because there were weighty matters at stake. Somehow, the tussle over whether Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would offer more generous prescription drug benefits does not seem on par with the space race or the missile gap.
"I held out hope that the debates might energize the public and that the closeness of the race would come together," said Tom Patterson, a government professor at Harvard University and co-director of Harvard University "Vanishing Voter" project. Instead, he said, "We're seeing an accelerated movement away from politics."
It may be unfair to ridicule uninterested voters this year because it takes more than a down-to-the-wire competition to drive people to the polls. From President Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide of 1964 to Richard M. Nixon's squeaker of 1968, turnout actually declined. And turnout for the close race between President Jimmy Carter and Mr. Reagan in 1980 was no higher than in 1972, when Mr. Nixon faced a faltering challenger in George S. McGovern. Perhaps people are not moving away from politics as much as they are redefining political participation. Perhaps watching a candidate on the "Late Show With David Letterman" has somehow become a substitute for voting.
Another reason people hesitate to vote is that while the denouement of this campaign may be exciting, the two guys playing the leads are not living up to the script. "There's nobody turned on by this election," said Gov. Jesse Venture of Minnesota, the independent and former professional wrestler. "Maybe people want to be entertained. Maybe the question is: Have we become a society based upon entertainment?"
If so, the candidates are not succeeding in enhancing their appeal with a strong narrative. "No one's telling a story," said James Carville, the Clinton strategist. "There's no drama here."
Even the impressive early rallying around Mr. Bush before the primaries seemed motivated not so much by Bush the man (many of his early supporters had never met him) but by Bush the man who has the best shot at returning his party to the White House.
Neither candidate seems to leave voters exhilarated. For all of their faults, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot caught voters' attention in 1992. Their appeal may not have been on personality alone: Mr. Clinton fashioned a new Democratic candidacy by appropriating Republican ideas as his own. And Mr. Perot, while scoring points for his plain-speaking, injected himself into the campaign because he had lots of money. Senator John McCain spurred record turnout because he somehow awakened new voters with the allure of his own story.
In interview after interview in battleground states, even people who said they are interested enough to vote admitted they were not enthralled with Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore. Francis Fritz, 61, a retired Firestone store manager in Saginaw, said he was torn between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. Did the debates help him decide? "I think they were boring," he said.
Yet maybe it is too much to ask for politicians to be entertaining. Jim Lehrer, the PBS anchor who moderated the debates, said such events are for sober-minded voters, and if others tune out, so be it. Asked how much the ratings dwindled this year, he said, "I have no idea. I don't say, 'How can I make this as exciting as the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus?' You've got two men, one of whom is going to be the next president of the United States."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
The Legal Profession Smells a Rat

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
FOR at least a few centuries, lawyers have been portrayed in jokes, cartoons and other expressions of popular culture as maggots, vipers, sharks, locusts and other creatures you wouldn't necessarily ask for a dance. But these days one of the most persistent images -- the treacherous rat -- seems to be emerging as the dominant symbolic stand-in for members of the legal profession.
There are signs aplenty of the rat-lawyer correlation. Consider, for example, that jokes comparing lawyers and rats have multiplied like, well, crazy. There is even new scholarship suggesting that one particular lawyer-as-rat joke has become the most popular of all lawyer jokes. 
In addition, the Internet is virtually crawling with animated cartoons of lawyers portrayed as rats. And one cannot neglect the somewhat mysterious West Coast lawyer who goes by the pen name The Rodent and sometimes wears a rat-head costume. He has been satirizing the legal profession since the 1990's with columns in legal newspapers, a newsletter and a book including such ratly pearls of wisdom as, "Lawyers are attracted to each other because we repel everyone else."
Does this and other evidence suggest the rat's pre-eminence as a pop-culture surrogate for lawyers? The data were collected and presented to Alan Dundes, a renowned folklorist and a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley.
True, Professor Dundes was recovering from a back injury and more or less had to answer the phone next to his bed. But he did listen cheerfully to a catalog of lawyer-rat jokes and references.
Both rats and lawyers seem to multiply quickly like "a kind of plague," he noted, and are popularly associated with dishonesty and betrayal. "The fact that we have this high incidence of the association of rats and lawyers is a telling point," he said. "It is a folk judgment. Folklore, after all, is the voice of the people."
Obviously, dissenters can be found to all cutting-edge observations. So some people interviewed for this article insisted that the skunk or perhaps the weasel could overtake the rat as a legal icon. Officials at the American Bar Association had an entirely different response, but why dwell on unpleasantness?
It might be more amusing to report that a forthcoming book by Prof. Marc Galanter, who may be the nation's leading scholar of legal humor, concludes that the current front-runner among lawyer jokes is a verminous barb born in the 1980's. (Why have laboratories started using lawyers instead of rats in experiments? One: There are more of them. Two: The lab assistants don't get attached to them. And three: There are some things a rat just won't do.)
Professor Galanter teaches at the University of Wisconsin Law School and the London School of Economics. At first, he said he wasn't sure his findings on the popularity of the lab-rats joke led to any broader conclusions. "A few years ago," he said tentatively, "there was a kind of a lizard thing."
But on reflection, he warmed to the rat-lawyer correlation. It turns out his study of legal humor, "Lowering the Bar," to be published by Oxford University Press next year, contains quite a few rat references. (A prominent law firm, for example, was overrun by rats while the partners were seeing clients, and one lawyer wondered why the rats didn't wait to show up until after business hours -- as a professional courtesy.) "It has clearly become prevalent now, this lawyer-rat association," Professor Galanter said finally.
He found, for example, that the 1998 Lawyer Joke-a-Day Calendar featured 10 separate rat jokes. And he found endless permutations of the lab-rat joke (one disadvantage of substituting lawyers for rats in experiments is that, "It is harder to extrapolate the test results to human beings," though on the plus side, "Animal rights activists don't care if you torture them.")
PROFESSOR GALANTER is not alone in discovering the rat-lawyer linkage. Three weeks ago, Matt Fleischer, a reporter for The National Law Journal, turned over a rather significant rock when he took note of two ratlike animations of lawyers appearing or about to appear on different Web sites. Mr. Fleischer also reported something of a lawyer-rat infestation: he came upon an artist who said he had done four other rat-lawyer animations on the Net in recent years and knew of at least 11 in all.
The new cyberrodents cited by Mr. Fleischer are Dax, seen on shockwave.com, and Gary the Rat, set to pop up next month on Mediatrip.com. Dax is a cigar-chomping celebrity rat lawyer assisted by the able Lolita, supposedly a former law clerk for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court. Gary is a materialistic, self-centered lawyer-turned-rat whose voice will be supplied by the actor Kelsey Grammer.
In an interview for this article, the brothers who created Gary the Rat, Mark and Rob Cullen, explained why creative people are drawn to the lawyer-rat image. They wanted their animation to explore the materialism and insensitivity of modern life, they said. "Well, for me, a lawyer personified that," said Mark Cullen. "And I thought, What's the other most hated being on the planet? And that would be the rat."
The Rodent, too, agreed to an interview on the condition that his real name and the company where he works as a lawyer not be disclosed. He said the rat association seemed so natural for an underground lawyer-satirist that people rarely questioned him about his nom de plume: "If I had picked Anteater, say, people would have said, 'Why that?' "

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton for the Senate

 BODY:
When Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in their state 16 months ago, New Yorkers deserved to be deeply skeptical. She had not lived, worked or voted in New York State. She had never been elected to any public office, yet she radiated an aura of ambition and entitlement that suggested she viewed a run for the United States Senate as a kind of celebrity stroll. She seemed more at home at East Side soirees and within the first lady's question-free cocoon than in unscripted conversations with voters or the political press. She encountered civic doubt and open hostility from predictable sources, as well as a surprising resistance from feminists offended by her passive response to the marital humiliations inflicted by her husband.
But in the intervening months, Mrs. Clinton has shown herself to be an intelligent and dignified candidate who has acquired a surprising depth of knowledge about the social-services needs of New York City and the economic pain of the upstate region. Her political growth has been aided by her combat with two worthy Republican opponents, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his successor as the G.O.P. candidate, Representative Rick Lazio. With full respect for their abilities, we endorse Mrs. Clinton as the one candidate who will best fill the vast gap that will be left in the Senate and within the Democratic Party by the retirement of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
 As a neophyte, Mrs. Clinton began her campaign with a number of clumsy statements about sports teams and girlhood vacation visits to the state and with a much-ridiculed listening tour among handpicked audiences. But as her confidence mounted, she outdid her opponents in visiting the state's 62 counties. Through the collection of firsthand stories, she learned about economic deprivation, energy costs, taxes, health crises and troubled schools. She came out of those grueling months knowing more about the state than most candidates who qualify by birth as what Mr. Lazio calls "real New Yorkers."
Handshaking her way through town squares and state fairs, she also shed her earlier political shell as a cosseted, sloganeering ideologue. The first lady from Arkansas evolved into an Empire State candidate whose grasp of local issues complements a deep, if untested, understanding of national and international matters from her days in the White House. She also communicates an unfeigned empathy for the struggles of poor families, schoolchildren and professionals in the health care, education and social-service fields.
The hesitancy among some voters, however, has been understandable, and we share some of those concerns. Her health care task force failed to deliver the promised reform. The investigative literature of Whitewater and related scandals is replete with evidence that Mrs. Clinton has a lamentable tendency to treat political opponents as enemies. She has clearly been less than truthful in her comments to investigators and too eager to follow President Clinton's method of peddling access for campaign donations. Her fondness for stonewalling in response to legitimate questions about financial or legislative matters contributed to the bad ethical reputation of the Clinton administration. If she should choose to carry these patterns and tendencies into the Senate, her career there could be as bumpy and frustrating -- and ultimately, as investigated -- as her White House years.
We believe, however, that Mrs. Clinton is capable of growing beyond the ethical legacies of her Arkansas and White House years. She has shown a desire to carve out a political identity and create a legislative legacy separate from her husband's. Certainly, no one can doubt that she combines his policy commitments with a far greater level of self-control and a steadier work ethic.
In a move that should serve as an example to other campaigns around the country, Mrs. Clinton bucked the advice of old-line Democrats and agreed to a ban on soft money for this campaign. It was a bold and important step since the ban hurt her own campaign more than that of Mr. Lazio. Although she has come late to the cause of campaign reform, we believe that she would be a firm vote in support of the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban and that she would work tirelessly toward the long-term goal of full public financing of election campaigns.
Although we are endorsing Mrs. Clinton, we want to commend Mr. Lazio for his effort. He has refused to complain about getting a late start. Despite his moments of macho exuberance and his excessive persistence in trying to exploit the carpetbagger issue, he has so far resisted making this a low-road campaign. He has described himself as a Republican moderate who would fight to increase the power of his party's small, but important, centrist bloc in the Senate. On housing, banking laws and the environment, he has taken positions far friendlier to working people and the Northeastern region than those espoused by his party's Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
Even so, most Republican members of the Senate will be pulled to the right and pressed to support programs that are generally tailored to the needs of the South and West, rather than to those of Northeastern urban areas. Mr. Lazio argues that if the G.O.P. holds control of the Senate in the Nov. 7 election, it would serve the state to have him in the majority caucus. We understand the logic of that position and might find it persuasive in some races. But we have concluded that Mrs. Clinton is an unusually promising talent and it would be better for New York to fight for its causes with two powerful, progressive voices: hers and that of the state's senior Democrat, Senator Charles Schumer.
On foreign policy, Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have presented themselves as firm friends of Israel, and in our view, Mr. Lazio has not enhanced his foreign-policy credentials by trying to take advantage of Mrs. Clinton's comments on Palestinian statehood and the awkwardness of her encounter with Suha Arafat. Mrs. Clinton has, in fact, acquired a useful education in international affairs through her travels and activities as first lady. The speech that she made to the Council on Foreign Relations last week set forth a broader, more sophisticated vision of America's place in the world than anything Mr. Lazio has offered so far. He has simply stated misgivings about the Clinton administration's record of foreign engagements, while Mrs. Clinton has sketched a program that looks at environmental, health and human rights issues, as well as security concerns.
Contemplating Mrs. Clinton's campaign convinces us that she fits into two important New York traditions. Like Robert F. Kennedy, she taps into the state's ability to embrace new residents and fresh ideas. She is also capable of following the pattern, established by the likes of Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Moynihan and Jacob Javits, that finds New York senators playing a role on the national and world stages even as they defend local interests.
The building of such potent Senate careers requires a grasp of foreign and domestic policy, coupled with negotiating ability and, usually, a burning commitment to one's home state and to a few key concerns. We think Mrs. Clinton better represents the full package of skills than does Mr. Lazio. Her economic plan for upstate offers hope for an area that has not reaped its share of today's financial harvest. Her understanding of how to balance energy issues with crucial environmental protection seems sharper. Mrs. Clinton can guard against Supreme Court nominees who would compromise the constitutional right to abortion, while Mr. Lazio would be hobbled by party ideology and discipline.
Finally, on the key issues of health care and education, Mrs. Clinton has the knowledge and the instincts to make a lasting impact on the Senate, on national policy and on the everyday lives of New Yorkers. We are placing our bet on her to rise above the mistakes and difficulties of her first eight years in Washington and to establish herself on Capitol Hill as a major voice for enlightened social policy and vibrant internationalism.

HEADLINE: The Value of the M.B.A.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is not surprising that consulting firms are reaching beyond business graduates in their hiring ("A Matter of Degree? Not for Consultants," Oct. 1).
In the last decade, the number of consultants from leading firms has more than doubled, while the number of graduates from the leading business schools has grown only marginally. Economics, law and allied disciplines use problem-solving methods closely related to business and represent a pool of high intellect. 
 But consulting is more than sheer intellect and access to data and precedent. Our competitive environment demands the ability to see patterns, to discern the difference between symptom and root cause, and to navigate minefields of political and personal agendas. M.B.A. education provides both a body of knowledge in fields exploding onto the business scene and experience in viewing problems from multiple perspectives. Classes consider trade-offs between present and future and the hard and soft sciences. They can also hone team analysis and communication skills. While lifetime learning is a given, these competencies form a base for professional growth.
Consulting firms are able to hire nonbusiness students in part because of mentoring by business-educated partners and senior staff. As these new consultants advance, substance, perspective and depth of vision will become ever more important. Perhaps that is why increasing numbers of people with Ph.D.'s and other degrees are returning for M.B.A.'s, often with consulting careers in mind.

HEADLINE: 'Rosie the Riveter' Honored in California Memorial

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Calif., Oct. 17

 BODY:
It has been more than half a century since the photographer Dorothea Lange came to the bustling wartime shipyards of this long-beleaguered city across the Bay from San Francisco to chronicle the lives of real-life "Rosie the Riveters."
"I'd never worked in my life," Phyllis McKey Gould, now 79, recalled this week as she stood beside the new "Rosie the Riveter" memorial here, on the site of Kaiser shipyard No. 2. Mrs. Gould and thousands of other women came to the Kaiser shipyards to work as welders and shipfitters in the war effort. 
 "I loved the look of welding, the smell of it," Mrs. Gould said. "You'd look through really dark glass and all you'd see was the glow. You moved the welding rod in tiny, circular motions, making half-crescents. If you did it right, it was beautiful. It was like embroidery."
The memorial, built by the city and incorporating memories and photographs of Mrs. Gould and other women in its design, is the first national monument dedicated to women who worked on the World War II home front. About 200 women who worked at the shipyards here attended the dedication.
Although Rosie the Riveter was a fictitious character, the image of a musclebound woman in overalls became an enduring wartime icon, embodying the nation's can-do spirit, and was popularized in posters, war-bond promotions and the 1942 song, "Rosie the Riveter."
But in Richmond, Rosie was real. "After they bombed Pearl Harbor, the next thing you heard was, 'There's shipbuilding in California,' " said Bethena Moore, now 83, who moved from Derrider, La., where she had been a laundry worker, to become a welder. A diminutive 110 pounds, she was given the dangerous task of climbing down a narrow steel ladder, tethered to a welding machine, four stories into the ships' double-bottoms.
"It was dark, scary," she said. "It felt sad, because there was a war on. You knew why you were doing it -- the men overseas might not get back. There were lives involved. So the welding had to be perfect."
At the war's height, women, many of them African-American, made up more than a quarter of the shipyards' 90,000 workers. From 1942-1945, nearly 500,000 African-Americans migrated to California, about 15,000 to Richmond alone.
It was the "largest voluntary black westward migration in the nation's history," said Dr. Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, a history professor at California State University in Sacramento and the author of the recently published book, "To Place Our Deeds: The African American Community in Richmond, California 1910-1963" (University of California Press). With the opening of the Kaiser shipyards in 1942, Richmond was home to the greatest concentration of shipbuilding in the nation.
Like many of Richmond's Rosies, Mrs. Moore was technically not a riveter. Riveting, a laborious, highly skilled task, was replaced at the Kaiser shipyards by faster prefabrication techniques during the war. Her arms, like those of many women shipyard workers, still bear tiny white scars from "metal sparkles," hot slag that fell into her sleeves and gloves as she welded overhead. Many, including Mrs. Moore, still carry their timeworn welding certificates in their wallets.
Her photograph is part of the memorial, designed by Cheryl Barton, a landscape architect, and Susan Schwartzenberg, an artist, which is intended to recall the unfinished frame of a Liberty ship, the type of troop and cargo vessels built here.
Women's words are embedded in a granite walkway, which stretches 441 feet toward the water -- the length of a Liberty ship -- "to commemorate the scale at which women worked," Ms. Barton said. Native rock roses, "a tough variety," she said, line the path.
The war forever changed Mrs. Moore and others. "Anybody could have done what I was doing in Louisiana," she said of operating pressing machines at a laundry. "Building a ship was a different feeling."
The war also profoundly changed Richmond (population 94,000), one of the Bay Area's least-affluent communities. It was transformed practically overnight from a sleepy rural community of 23,600 to an industrial metropolis of more than 100,000, where the wartime production included tanks and torpedoes.
Over the years the city has suffered from a variety of urban ills, including high poverty and crime rates, and industrial pollution. The closing of the shipyards after the war left a host of issues with which the city is still grappling. Fifteen percent of the city's population, which is 44 percent African-American, 36 percent white and 12 percent Latino, lives below the poverty level.
"In some respects," notes Charles Wollenberg, a historical consultant with The Oakland Museum, "it's taken Richmond until now to recover from World War II."
As the new economy finally takes root here -- with technology and biotechnology companies moving in -- the memorial represents a coming to terms with the past. "We paid a big price for the war," said Donna Powers, the former Richmond City Council member who led the Rosie memorial effort, inspired by her mother-in-law, a Kaiser day care worker in the war.
"Instead of playing down what happened here, we're starting to look at it as something remarkable." She combed neighborhoods and put up notices looking for former Rosies. Hundreds of women came forward.
The city began redeveloping the site of the old shipyard No. 2 in the late 1970's, spending $15 million on the cleanup. The memorial may be only a beginning. Earlier this month, Congress passed a bill authorizing the establishment of a Rosie the Riveter/WW2 Home Front National Historical Park here. The proposed park would include and occupy historical structures, including a sprawling brick Ford assembly building and the crumbling concrete docks of Kaiser shipyard No. 3.
Time is of the essence, as the women whose memories are welded with wartime experience age. All the remaining Rosies "are getting on towards 80 years old," said Frances Tunnell Carter, who founded the American Rosie the Riveter Association in Birmingham, Ala., two years ago. The group is a national network with more than 600 members. "It's almost too late," she said.
For the Rosies of Richmond, among them Charles Etta Turner, 77, who moved from Denison, Tex., to work as a shipfitter, who positioned the parts for welding, the memorial is cause to rethink a part of their lives that until recently, neither they nor others recognized as historically important.
"You know something? I was so surprised," she said, the memorial's steel surfaces glinting in the sun. "I have a deeper feeling we're all Rosies now."

HEADLINE: Silences Are Eloquent as African Junta Runs an Election

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Oct. 21

 BODY:
At the campaign headquarters of a contender in this West African country's presidential election on Sunday, an official admitted that his party had fallen "very, very, very far from its goal of raising" about $2.7 million.
"I won't hide this from you," the official, Casimir Katia, said a few days ago, "but financially the entire campaign rests on one man: our candidate, Thedore Mel." 
 How far reality differed from expectation, Mr. Katia preferred not to say. But the silence inside the building and the absence of supporters suggested that the difference was significant. A few blocks away, at the headquarters of another little-known candidate, Nicolas Dioulo, scores of people were milling outside: there was no money to send them out campaigning.
The two are among the five candidates in a contest that the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, is not expected to lose. Almost all international observers, including those from the United States, have pulled out of the Ivory Coast, saying that voting was unlikely to be fair and that the election was inherently flawed.
Early this month, a court controlled by the general disqualified the candidates of the country's two biggest political parties, leaving only a single well-known opponent and three lightweights with not enough money to buy billboard advertising. Among those disqualified was Alassane D. Ouattara, the leader of the Rally of Republicans, who until last year had decided on how billions of dollars were distributed worldwide as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He is now a virtual prisoner inside his villa here.
The election follows a year-long political crisis in what was the most politically stable country among France's former African colonies, and is still its richest. General Guei led a coup against an unpopular president, but his own popularity began to wane after it became clear that he had no intention of leaving power. A Christian from the south, he has eliminated his former allies, most of them Muslims from the north. In a country that once stood as a model for ethnic and religious coexistence in Africa, the general has pursued policies that have dangerously widened Ivory Coast's cleavages.
Given the country's importance on the continent, Africans are watching what happens here closely. And as Election Day approached, Ivorians themselves have grown anxious. Many feared that the tense calm could erupt in violence led by General Guei's military rivals, including two generals who sought refuge in the Nigerian Embassy here and whose whereabouts now are not known. Others speculated that General Guei would hold on to power by coercing politicians to work with him, the same way he has already earned some of their support.
The two biggest parties have called for a boycott on Sunday. So has the country's largest Islamic association, because all the Muslim candidates were disqualified from running, leaving only five Christians from the south in a nation with a 40 percent Muslim population. And so more important than the election outcome itself might be the voter turnout, which can be taken as a kind of referendum on General Guei's standing.
In an interview at his office here on Thursday, General Guei said he did not believe that the boycott would work and denied charges that Muslims like Mr. Ouattara and others were being pushed out of politics and the military.
"Through dialogue we'll reach the wisest solution," the general said, dressed in a suit and sitting behind an enormous desk so wide that visitors shook his hand with difficulty. "It's a question of good faith. The Muslim community should not believe that we are bullying them. We have said that we must separate politics from religion."
Asked what he would consider an acceptable voter turnout, he said confidently: "We must have more than 50 percent for the turnout to be acceptable. It's the minimum. If it's under 50 percent, it will mean that their boycott really worked."
Emphasizing that he was willing to accept defeat, the general -- who upon seizing power last year insisted that he was not interested in power and pledged to withdraw after a short transition -- said he wanted to become president to alleviate poverty and unemployment. Above all, he said, he wanted reunify the country.
"We must reconcile all Ivoirians," he said. "There must be understanding, brotherhood and harmony."
Few believe he can do that. The general last week canceled a scheduled trip to the Muslim north over security concerns. Except for a spontaneous visit to the country's most exclusive shopping mall here, where he bought shoes and several bottles of gin, he has hardly campaigned at all. He justified his absence by saying he was letting the "people campaign for him," but most of the people took that to mean he wanted to avoid going out on the streets.
On Abidjan's streetscape, the campaign's most visible signs are billboards showing the general's smiling face. "The people are my party," says the general, who tried to become the candidate of the country's oldest and richest party, the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, but was pointedly rejected. The only other candidate with the means to buy billboard space was Laurent Gbagbo, whose party, the Ivoirian Popular Front, is considered the country's third biggest; Mr. Gbagbo has also run an ethnocentric campaign aimed at rallying Christians against Muslims.
Many of the general's billboards and wall posters have been defaced, suggesting what conversations with Ivoirians, regardless of their backgrounds, have made clear -- that they wanted a fair election and a civilian president.
Justin Kouakou, a 32-year-old worker in the fishing industry, was walking past a defaced billboard in the working class neighborhood of Port-Bouet. A Christian southerner, he supported the elimination of Mr. Ouattara, who the court ruled was not completely Ivoirian. But he did not want General Guei to remain in power.
"When he took over last year," Mr. Kouakou said, "he said it was to sweep clean the Ivoirian house. But things have gotten worse under him. Before I could drink chilled water. Now I can't even buy a box of matches."
In the shadow of the billboard, Abou Ouattara, 25, had stopped to wash his taxi. On a concrete wall someone had blotted out General Guei's eyes with black paint. "Voleur," someone had scrawled across the poster. "Thief."
The taxi driver, a Muslim northerner, was a supporter of the politician with the same name. "I've been told to boycott the election," he said. "But I would like to vote. I want to participate because if we Africans don't take part in the democratic process, in the end it will hurt us."
The campaign against Muslim leaders like Mr. Ouattara has affected him, the taxi driver said. Nowadays, he said, police harass him regularly and, looking at his name, call him a foreigner.
Diplomats based here said they were worried the anti-Muslim tide will spiral out of control, especially in the military. About 300 Muslim soldiers have left the military on their own, a Western diplomat said, and it is not known what they are doing.
"It's quiet right now," the diplomat said. "But there's a strong undercurrent of worry because of those soldiers who have left."
Amnesty International said soldiers who were arrested for their alleged involvement in an attack on General Guei's house last month had been tortured, killed or missing. Mr. Ouattara's party says that at least 40 Muslim military officials have disappeared, and party officials said they suspected that the soldiers were killed or being held illegally.
"This is a sham election -- that's why we have called for a boycott," said Ali Coulibaly, a spokesman for the Rally of the Republicans. "Whoever wins, the president will be illegitimate."

HEADLINE: 150 Nations Move to Curb Tobacco Use

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 21

 BODY:
In an atmosphere of unexpected harmony, officials representing nearly 150 governments laid the groundwork this week for a new global treaty that aims to control tobacco use and stamp out adolescent smoking.
The World Health Organization is pushing for a strong international accord with the goal of finalizing a treaty by 2003. The United Nations agency, which has made eradicating smoking the centerpiece of its global public health strategy, wants the treaty to ban multinational tobacco corporations from advertising and sponsoring sports events, increase taxes to make cigarettes more expensive, combat cigarette smuggling and introduce measures to stem the rise in adolescent smoking. 
 At the end of the six-day negotiating session, the chairman of the talks, Celso Amorim of Brazil, a tobacco exporter, warned that working out the details to come up with a treaty in two years might be tougher than it appeared right now.
For example, he noted that most governments went on record to oppose cigarette smuggling. But, Mr. Amorim said, there was no unanimity on how to combat the problem of cigarettes pouring across borders.
"Some link this with harmonizing tax systems, but others say different measures are needed," he said. Such details will have to be worked out over the next two years, although antismoking groups worried openly whether consensus in Geneva might be eroded once officials faced lobbying by well-funded tobacco forces.
Tobacco use, according to W.H.O. statistics, kills four million people annually and threatens to claim a yearly toll of 10 million by 2030.
During the six-day opening negotiations, nations were almost unanimous in calling for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorships. Countries as diverse as Sri Lanka, Trinidad, Thailand and Turkey, another tobacco grower, supported barring advertising. The American government was in the middle. "We stop short of supporting a complete ban," said top American negotiator, Dr. Thomas Novotny, of the Department of Health and Human Services. Such a prohibition would run afoul of free speech guarantees.
Even though a few countries, including Australia, already bar such advertising, a blanket ban is likely to raise free trade concerns. Earlier this month, the European Court of Justice ruled against the European Union's planned ban on grounds it blocked free movement of goods and services.
Countries have yet to grapple with complicated questions like whether the treaty would ban indirect advertisements, which include "branding" clothing and other stores with symbols like a camel for the well-known cigarette name. Other contentious issues include cross-border advertising, particularly in sports events, where cigarette ads are seen via television in numerous countries.
Antismoking groups said American negotiators had advocated tougher stands than anticipated. The American Lung Society praised American officials for backing measures against passive smoking in facilities for children, as well as in cafes, bars and restaurants. "Our model is California," Mr. Novotny, a physician, said. Only California and Vermont have sweeping bans on public smoking.
A key sticking point for tobacco-growing nations is whether they will receive any financial assistance while they wean their economies from the crop. The United States, along with Canada, proposed bilateral and voluntary assistance, instead of setting up a global fund with mandatory assessments that some poor countries favor.
Little was heard from the giant tobacco companies, although Philip Morris and British American Tobacco (BAT) tried to disarm their critics last week by admitting that their products are deadly and addictive.
Anti-tobacco groups are urging a treaty provision that would require the companies to disclose their political activities, as well as the amounts they spend on such lobbying efforts.
Among the tougher measures to be considered is a plan that the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice be expanded to decide whether tobacco companies have committed crimes against humanity.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: SPIRITUAL SEEKER;
Gore Has Explored a Range of Beliefs From Old Time to New Age

SERIES: AL GORE'S JOURNEY: Spiritual Seeker

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

 BODY:
At New Salem Missionary Baptist, the little country church in Tennessee where Senator Albert Gore's private funeral was held, folks were not at all sure that a woman should be allowed to speak from the pulpit, even if she was an Episcopal bishop, in from Washington, D.C.
And some mourners on the other side of the cultural and religious divide that day did not understand them or their point of view. "At the New Salem Bible Thumping Good News Evangelical High Hope Church -- it had one of those names," Vice President Al Gore's Harvard mentor and friend Martin Peretz said, laughing, "there was a little bit of anxiety" about whether she would be allowed to preach. 
 Mr. Gore, though, had spent all his life straddling the two worlds -- of Tennessee and Washington, high church and low, gut-level religion and Ivy League intellectualism. So when they collided, perhaps inevitably, on that of all days, two years ago in December, he knew how to bridge the gap. He suggested that the Tennessee preacher ask himself, "What would Jesus do?" And in the end, Bishop Jane Holmes Dixon did speak at the service.
Those close to the famously scientific-minded vice president, a man who by his own estimation is sometimes a little too rational, say he had not just picked up the right words to use on that occasion, but is himself a believing Southern Baptist whose faith drives him. Yet his Baptist roots are only one part of an intricate and eclectic spiritual life, one that from the start mirrored his larger experience of growing up in two places.
For two weeks every summer as a youngster, he was a regular at the revival meetings at New Salem, near his family's farm outside Carthage, Tenn. "We'd be in the middle of getting the tobacco crop in, and I'd carry Al with us," his closest childhood friend, Steve Armistead, said.
Then, come winter, he would be back at St. Albans prep school in Washington, attending daily chapel services -- Episcopalian services -- at the National Cathedral, where even whispering was not allowed. The school's hymn went, "Men of the future stand / And watch each fleeting hour / To make your lives what God has planned, / To spread abroad his power. / In work, game or play, / Suppress all fear and hate. / Show forth a generous spirit true / For God and for the state." Not only was religion here served much less raw, in other words, but it was explicitly linked to secular power.
"I had a real smorgasbord of religious experiences," Mr. Gore said in a recent interview about his faith. "On Sundays in Washington I'd go to the Presbyterian Church around the corner from the Fairfax," the hotel where his family lived during the school year, "and in Carthage we'd alternate between my mother's Church of Christ and my father's Baptist church. Except when we went to the Methodist church."
Mr. Gore has continued to branch out over the years, too, studying mysticism as well as ethics, his primary focus during three semesters at Vanderbilt Divinity School, and at least toying with New Age ideas. He also took a course called Theology and the Natural Sciences and, over time, came to see environmentalism as a religious obligation to protect creation. His 1992 book about the environment, "Earth in the Balance," is suffused with ecospirituality. And clearly, his faith is still in flux.
His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said his spiritual search reminded her of the year he spent trying to decide whether to enlist in the Army. "I remember hearing about the way he was thinking about going to Vietnam, and there's a similar strain in how he's open to religious faith," she said. "There's a discomfort with being so sure about something. I see him searching, seeking and striving and don't see his faith as static."
By definition, of course, religious belief is interior, personal, not necessarily a matter shared easily or even at all. But when Mr. Gore talks of his faith he is not so much reticent -- though he is that, too, sometimes -- as he is restless, unfinished.
Ms. Schiff suggests that even this corner of life is an avenue of self-improvement for her father. "There's such an aspirational, striving element to his," she said. "Of, on your own or in public life, reaching toward an ideal, even if we don't get there."
Though she sees the fact that he is still seeking as evidence of his openness, flexibility and tolerance, it might just as easily come across as another way in which Mr. Gore seems like a 52-year-old man who does not yet fully know himself.
"If you're Joe Lieberman, you're done, you're not searching outside the boundaries of your faith," said one of Mr. Gore's friends, adding that the vice president is not at all done and is still on that quest.
Although Mr. Gore considers himself a born-again Christian, among even close friends there is some difference of opinion about whether he is a believer or someone who believes in believing, who respects and admires faith in God but finds the required leap outside his head a long, long way to go.
And because of his spiritual openness, when he talks about being influenced by his faith it is difficult to say exactly what that means. Ms. Schiff says that faith "drives him."
"He's driven by some calling in life and I really don't know whether it's that he has to be president of the United States, but he definitely feels compelled to serve his faith," she said. But how?
Hard as it is to draw many straight lines between Mr. Gore's religious views and his public life, the one public policy exception, the single place where Mr. Gore does seem to see an explicit link between God and government, is the environment. This, for him, is where God and science seem to meet. Should Mr. Gore lose in November, Ms. Schiff said, "I could see him pursuing environmentalism and theology in some way."
He is certainly fascinated by the unseen, in science as in the spirit, and by all accounts does not see a conflict between the two. In fact, he speaks of both realms in roughly equivalent ways, reverently. And the way he talks about his spiritual life suggests he feels that this, too, is a subject in which he is taking a test with right and wrong answers.
It is also another area of his life in which much that he says is real but some is enhanced. In a recent interview, he clearly suggested that he goes to church regularly, even in the heat of the presidential campaign, though his own daughter says otherwise.
"We used to go to church every single Sunday, but since we moved in the vice-presidential house and they had a change of pastor they haven't found a church," she said. "Now we go in Tennessee and on special occasions in Arlington." They moved, of course, after the 1992 election, and the pastor she was referring to retired in 1991.
 
A Question of Interpretation
Asked if he believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible, Mr. Gore paused, took a moment and then said, "Well, I don't believe in the literal interpretation of the word 'literally.' "
Was he hedging? Joking about hedging, a la "that depends on what the meaning of 'is' is?" Or making the point that even many theological conservatives understand the Bible metaphorically? That's open to interpretation, of course, like so much about the vice president.
"Everything in the Bible makes sense to me," Mr. Gore went on. "I interpret it my own way, and that's what my tradition teaches me to do. There are poetic passages that speak eloquently to me with meanings that transcend the literal words. In Genesis, for example, God creates this, that and the other in one day, two days, and that represents an order in creation that's perfectly evident to my heart."
But are those passages symbolic stories, or based on historical events? He sighed. "They are lessons about passages in the human story that actually took place, and they're redolent with layers and layers of meaning because they represent not only the events nominally described."
Mr. Gore's daughter Ms. Schiff cut to the chase: "I remember as a teenager getting all hopped up about not wanting to go to church and literal Bible stories and religion as an agent of evil, and he always engaged me," she said.
Her father, she added, made clear that "it didn't matter at all if it was literal. Its power was in the ability to connect us, to bring out the best in each soul, and, for some, in Christianity."
Moderate Baptists like Mr. Gore generally do not take the Bible literally. But he seems conflicted, if not about his beliefs then certainly over how to talk about them. He readily agreed to be interviewed about his faith. Yet in the interview, he said he felt he had to be careful.
"The context makes it appear I'm opening up in a naked attempt to manipulate other believers by ballyhooing my relationship with God, and I'm not going to do that," he said. "To describe the innermost details in the weeks leading up to Election Day contextually invites cynicism."
The very next thing he said, though, was this: "I want people to see my experience as what it is, the most important thing in my life."
 
The Theologian in the Family
Al Gore did not inherit his faith from his parents, but came to it on his own. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, and his father, the senator, were "turned off" to organized religion, according to Ms. Schiff.
"My grandmother told me her mother was very religious and she might have reacted a bit against that," Ms. Schiff said. "My grandfather was an early supporter of Al Smith and John Kennedy and remembered the intolerance toward Catholics, and that turned him off to the old-time religion of the Bible Belt, whereas my father saw good in it."
Even as a boy, young Al was more interested in religious themes than the rest of his family. And by his early teens he was spending hours with his Tennessee girlfriend's staunch Baptist grandmother, Edna Armistead, and quizzing her about Scripture.
At Harvard, Mr. Gore's roommate, John Tyson, would sometimes find him reading the Bible, he said. "His thing was that even though man has become civilized, evil can still rise up inside a person or a group, so there has to be prayer and vigilance to cultivate the soul. The soul doesn't cultivate itself."
He does not ever seem to have had a crisis of faith, though he says he did drift a bit as a young adult. Has he never been mad at God, then? No, he said. "I don't think I've ever dared feel that emotion."
Right after his college graduation in 1969, he went into the Army. And he apparently did, as he said, drift a bit. Marny Hendrick, who worked and shared a barracks with him at Fort Rucker, Ala., said, laughing: "I don't ever remember the conversation going that way. We were 20 and 21, classically unchurched. I don't think we had a Bible in the room." Though most of them, Mr. Gore included, were headed to Vietnam, Mr. Hendrick said, "We approached it more from a political standpoint."
When he got back from Vietnam, however, Mr. Gore headed straight to Vanderbilt Divinity School, where he studied for a little over a year. He has said he was struggling to make sense of the war and the morality of his role in it.
But the former dean of the divinity school, Walter Harrelson, now retired, said he thought Mr. Gore had more practical motivations.
"He was taking stock, and the divinity school at that time was full of such people, but it never seemed to me he came with existential angst; he was much more self-possessed than that," said Mr. Harrelson, who also got to know Mr. Gore socially.
"He knew he wanted a life in public service and knew he needed to make sense of his religion -- what it was and what was its place in his life," he continued. "He was not a person in crisis. He did come with a somewhat compartmentalized perspective on life, and he was concerned to integrate his faith and his aspirations to serve society."
Vanderbilt's divinity school had, and still has, a theologically liberal reputation, and among its professors there was a lot of interest in the Social Gospel movement, which emphasizes the duty of followers of Christ to care for the poor and powerless.
Mr. Gore was much taken with this, Mr. Harrelson said, and sat in on his course on the prophets, where he appeared fascinated by the stories of Amos and Hosea and Micah and their concern for the oppressed.
For him, these prophets were ancient populists, effortlessly assimilated into his political worldview. And the Christianity he has always felt most comfortable showing in public understands the Jesus story in highly political terms.
Yet he was still straddling two worlds, still also powerfully attracted to what his daughter calls the old-time religion.
 
Born Again
At around the same time he was pursuing graduate-level theological studies, in his early 20's, Mr. Gore became a born-again Christian.
When first asked if he considers himself born again, Mr. Gore said, "I never talk about that unless I'm asked a direct question with the use of that phrase, because people have a lot of meanings they attach to that phrase." Then he waited to be asked the direct question, again, before saying, "Yes, I do."
For him, he said, being born again "means coming into a new awareness of a personal relationship with God at a time in your life you're more capable than you were as a child."
But he declined to say how it happened or what called him to renew his faith at that moment. "I'm afraid it will be misinterpreted," he said.
He was already married by then, and he and his wife, Tipper, were back at New Salem, where his grandparents had worshiped, where he had gone to revivals as a child, and where he would later decide to have his father's funeral. The minister at that time was Brother Kenneth Gibbs, he said -- "a truck driver during the week, a fire-and-brimstone preacher, and a good one."
Mr. Gore said that when he and his family moved to Arlington, Va., in 1977, after he was first elected to Congress, Karenna, then 4, cried that she did not like the Episcopal church they tried attending. "I want Brother Gibbs," she said tearfully, according to her father. ("I still kind of like those eye-popping sermons," Ms. Schiff says now.)
So they tried to accommodate her, he said, and switched to Mount Vernon Baptist, a small faith community near the Pentagon, where the congregation is relatively transient. That is where both Al and Tipper Gore were baptized by full immersion in the late 1970's.
James Dunn, former executive director of the liberal Baptist Joint Committee in Washington and now a visiting professor at Wake Forest University Divinity School, filled in at Mount Vernon Baptist when the regular minister, the Rev. Jack Turner, was away. He said of Mr. Gore: "That was his happy church. Jack had a great influence on Al and Tipper, not in some mystical, pious way, but he was the first pastor they had together who was a good friend."
"Al's parents were never in the same church and Tipper had had a distant religious experience, and that's why it was so special," Mr. Dunn went on. "Jack helped them understand what baptism meant in Baptist life -- that it's symbolic, not salvific; it's a public statement -- and they said, 'We understand this now, we do believe in the resurrection.' The purpose of it is to say to the world, 'I'm now following Jesus Christ.' "
So, wearing heavy white robes, they waded into the church's baptistry, standing in water up to their shoulders, and were leaned back into the water by Mr. Turner.
At least for a while, Mr. Gore was also a member of a small prayer group on Capitol Hill, where men read the Bible together and called one another to account when necessary. He would not talk about this either, other than to confirm that he took part and say that he got a lot out of it.
But he has often said he leaned heavily on church friends and fellow believers when his son, 6-year-old Albert Gore III, was hit by a car in 1989. According to several friends, Mr. Gore absolutely believes that God saved his son and that the power of prayer helped heal him.
"He may not use the word 'miracle,' " Mr. Dunn said, "but he believes Al's life was saved by more than medical explanation."
 
God and the Environment
It was that crisis that prompted Mr. Gore to write "Earth in the Balance," an environmental book full of spiritual references. Initially, he had envisioned an even more religious book. "I had some concern about this," said his editor, John Sterling. "How do we present this book seriously if we work a lot of spiritual stuff in?"
Though Mr. Sterling said he did his best to rein in that impulse, God remained a main character in the book. In it, Mr. Gore explains why, for him, God and environmentalism are inextricably linked: "How can one glorify the Creator while heaping contempt on creation? How can one walk humbly with nature's God while wreaking havoc on nature?"
He says Noah was an early environmentalist, after God gave him "a commandment that might appear in modern form as, Thou shalt preserve biodiversity." To Mr. Gore, the Bible carries a "strong activist message."
"It is my own belief that the image of God can be seen in every corner of creation, even in us, but only faintly," Mr. Gore wrote, in what seems to be as close to a statement of core religious belief as anything else he has ever said or written. "By experiencing nature in its fullest -- our own and that of all creation -- with our senses and with our spiritual imagination, we can glimpse, 'bright shining as the sun,' an infinite image of God."
 
A Believer and a Dissenter
Mr. Gore has not been active in church for a decade, and acknowledges a new distance from his larger faith community. The once liberal Southern Baptist Convention, which filed briefs in Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade and opposed the war in Vietnam, has more recently been dominated by fundamentalists, leaving moderates like Mr. Gore in the clear minority. Just last week, Jimmy Carter left the Southern Baptist Convention, saying he felt excluded by the adoption of "increasingly rigid" policies, including its declaration two years ago that women should be subservient to their husbands.
In a conversation over dinner months ago, the vice president suggested that he had qualms similar to Mr. Carter's. However, when asked again about those comments in the interview for this article, he said no, he was perfectly comfortable as a dissenter from the majority view on a number of questions.
In any case, like many of his generation, he is not someone whose faith seems integrally linked to a particular institution. But he is still the most prayerful member of his family, just as he was as a child; Ms. Schiff says that her father and her younger sister Sarah are more observant than she and other members of the family are.
"We try and rotate so it's not always my dad" who says the blessing before meals or at special moments, she said, "because he's always the most enthusiastic. If someone initiates it, it's always my dad."
Mr. Gore says he often turns to the Bible for answers to some of life's hardest questions. He did that, he said, after the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado.
"I read again the account of Cain slaying Abel," Mr. Gore said. As he began quoting from Genesis, he asked his interviewer to follow along -- "Do you have your Bible?" -- as he told the story of Cain, whose gift to God was rejected, killing his brother Abel, whose gift was accepted.
"If you do well, you will be accepted," Mr. Gore quoted from memory. "If you do not do well, sin croucheth at your door . . . and thou shalt rule over" sin. "Now, here's how I read it," he went on, talking about the young men responsible for the Columbine killings. "Those two boys in trench coats felt like what they had to offer in life was being rejected, and that made them vulnerable to sin." They still failed, though, he said, "in their duty to rule over it."
Mr. Gore's friend and mentor Mr. Peretz had already mentioned a discussion he had had with Mr. Gore about this very passage -- and his own question about whether God had been wrong to have refused Cain's gift in the first place. Why had God preferred Abel's live offering, an animal sacrifice, to Cain's fruits of the field?
But when Mr. Peretz's line of thinking was repeated to Mr. Gore, he batted it right down. "This passage" -- about the killing of the shepherd Abel by Cain, who tilled the ground -- "is a metaphorical reference to the move from a herding to an agricultural economy," he said, somewhat impatiently.
In the current campaign, Mr. Gore has talked about God sparingly, and, though he did quote from the book of Matthew in one debate, certainly less frequently than either his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or his own running mate, Mr. Lieberman.
When asked, though, how he had reacted when Mr. Bush answered a question in a debate during primary season by saying that his favorite philosopher-thinker was Jesus, Mr. Gore said: "I wasn't discomfited by his answer. I don't think of Christ first and foremost as a philosopher, but it's a perfectly good answer."
Could a candidate -- a theoretical candidate, of course -- have no set religious beliefs, or odd or murky ones, or rather than beliefs, just hopes? Sure, he said, and riffed for a while about the faith of presidents past. Then he added, "I have a defined set of beliefs, but I also believe the eternal truths are difficult if not impossible to capture in language."
This is the last article in a series about the life of Al Gore. The final installment of "Governor Bush's Journey" will focus on his decision to run for president.

HEADLINE: Study in Contrasts: Clinton and Lazio on Taxes

SERIES: RACE FOR THE SENATE/The Issues: Taxes

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Plowing through the tax plans of the Senate candidates in New York, it is easy to get bogged down in the arcane details, to be distracted by the mind-boggling billions of dollars involved, or to be lulled by the mind-numbing slogans employed on both sides. (Protect Social Security! Pay down the national debt!)
Boiled down to their essentials, however, the candidates' proposals reveal stark differences in their attitudes about taxes, and even their philosophies about government, tax experts say. For Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, tax cuts are a means to an end. For Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican, tax cuts are an end in themselves. 
 Mr. Lazio has proposed several sweeping changes to the tax code, which he believes will put "more of New Yorkers' hard-earned money where it belongs: in their pockets," as he said last month in a speech in Brooklyn. These general tax cuts, he says, will also create jobs and encourage investment.
Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, focuses her tax cuts more narrowly, to benefit people in certain circumstances -- with disabled relatives, say, or children in college -- or to try to achieve goals like igniting economic growth in upstate New York. More general tax cuts, she says, would be reckless and would squander the federal budget surplus.
Where the candidates seem to agree -- in their opposition to the so-called marriage tax penalty on two-income couples and to heavy taxes on the estates of the dead -- they differ sharply in their solutions. Mr. Lazio proposes eliminating estate taxes and the marriage penalty; Mrs. Clinton suggests smaller changes that would mitigate the tax burden for the less well-to-do.
The candidates' emphasis on tax cuts has been unusual for a Senate race in New York, where voters have not generally been perceived as clamoring for tax relief, at least on the federal level.
State and local taxes are a different matter, of course. Despite the Pataki administration's cuts, the state and local tax burden in New York is the second highest in the country, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Washington. That helps push the total tax burden in the state, as a percentage of income, to third in the nation, after Connecticut and Wyoming.
But New Yorkers' heavy tax burden also stems from the state's concentration of very wealthy taxpayers. Because of the high cost of living in the southern part of the state, the definition of wealthy is different in New York from what it is in other parts of the country. Nevertheless, according to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group, 2 percent of the state's taxpayers earn more than $200,000 a year and make about half of the state's annual federal tax payment.
Despite the unusual features of New York's tax situation, the candidates' positions largely echo the traditional approaches of their political parties.
Mrs. Clinton's plan is like those proposed by her husband and by Vice President Al Gore in his presidential campaign. "It's classic Democratic social policy," said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "There's a heavy tilt toward low-income working poor and the lower end of the middle class, helping people with particular needs, larger social needs."
Mr. Lazio's proposals, though similar to those backed by other Republicans in Congress, are quite different from the policy of George W. Bush, who advocates a general rollback of income tax rates. (The top rate, for example, would go to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.)
Mr. Lazio has instead supported a change that he contends would be as helpful to middle-income taxpayers without breaking the bank: making Social Security tax payments deductible for those in the two lowest tax brackets (including married couples who make up to $106,000 a year). He also advocates cutting the tax on capital gains, a change that, along with the elimination of the estate tax, would primarily benefit wealthier taxpayers with large investment portfolios.
That has prompted Mrs. Clinton's staff to argue that Mr. Lazio's tax cuts are, in fact, as "targeted" as hers -- but aimed mostly at richer taxpayers. The Citizens for Tax Justice, a left-leaning Washington research group, calculates that 30 percent of his tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those who make an average of $915,000 a year.
Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Albany, dismissed Mr. Lazio's tax proposals as "basically the Republican Congressional tax plan."
"To say that by addressing the marriage penalty you are going to be addressing economic development in upstate New York is a leap," Mr. Mauro said. "It's preposterous."
Mrs. Clinton has focused much of her campaign on upstate New York, where economic growth, though improving, has been slower than in the southern part of the state, or in much of the rest of the country.
Among many proposals she has made for improving the economy upstate are tax credits of $3,000 per job for small businesses that locate in economically distressed areas. Mr. Lazio supports a $1,000 job-creation tax credit, but has generally emphasized broad tax cuts as the way to spur economic growth.
Whether such tax credits truly make a difference is a matter of debate among economists and people in the economic development business. Consultants who help big businesses decide where to locate say that although tax incentives can be important, they are usually outweighed by other factors, like transportation, the available work force, and even quality of life.
Some critics contend that so-called targeted tax cuts or credits just make the tax code more complicated, and do not work anyway. "With targeted tax cuts, you usually find they miss their mark," said Tom E. McClusky, senior policy analyst for the National Taxpayers Union in Washington.
That conservative group, which has endorsed Mr. Lazio's tax plan, contends that Mrs. Clinton's various tax and budget proposals would increase federal spending by $242 billion a year, while Mr. Lazio's would increase spending by $39 billion.
Like most numbers that get tossed around in the discussion about taxes and the federal budget, these are not entirely reliable. For example, the group estimates that Mrs. Clinton would spend more than $75 billion a year to pay down the national debt; Mr. Lazio also favors reducing the national debt, but no such spending is included in his tally.
Retirement plans are another area in which the candidates clearly differ. Mrs. Clinton has recently endorsed a plan, modeled on Mr. Gore's, that would give tax credits to people who make less than $100,000 a year and put money away in special retirement savings accounts. Her plan limits the amount of money individuals can invest to $1,000 a year, rather than Mr. Gore's $2,000, and would cost about $120 billion over a decade, according to her campaign.
Mr. Lazio has proposed increasing the amount of money Americans can put into individual retirement accounts to $5,000 a year, from $2,000 today, and increasing the cap in line with inflation. His plan would cost about $54 billion over a decade, according to his campaign.
Ultimately, it is the candidates' philosophies that will matter, rather than the details of anything they propose during the campaign, analysts of all stripes agree. After all, a junior senator from either party is unlikely to be setting the nation's tax policies any time soon.
The new senator's role "certainly won't be as significant as the person they are replacing," said Bill Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, referring to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. "You have to be on the Finance Committee and relatively senior to have a real impact on federal tax policy."
 
The first article in this series examined the positions of the Senate candidates in New York on education.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CANDIDATES;
With Ads and Rallies, Bush and Gore Hope to Mobilize Their Core Supporters

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each sought to energize their core supporters today, with Mr. Gore reaching out to union members and black ministers and Mr. Bush telling Republican get-out-the vote meetings in Washington State that his opponent favors "meddling, overbearing government."
As the campaign entered its final weeks, both sides also unveiled new advertisements, with Mr. Gore keeping up a media campaign against Mr. Bush on Social Security and Mr. Bush releasing two soft-toned spots focused on children and education. 
 The Gore campaign said that its new advertisements were part of an all-out fight for a number of swing states, including Ohio, where earlier reports had indicated that the vice president might be pulling out to devote his resources to more fertile territory.
Gore officials said that they would double their spending on television advertisements to $4 million next week, and match the Republicans in television spending for the rest of the campaign. They said their commercials would amplify the idea that Mr. Bush was not "up to the job" of being president.
This is a theme that Mr. Gore has been building on for months, laying the groundwork with assaults on Mr. Bush's record in Texas, his tax-cut proposal and his plan to privatize part of Social Security.
He added to that today by questioning Mr. Bush's judgment in calling for the withdrawal of United States peacekeeping forces from the Balkans.
The Bush camp, meanwhile, expanded its purchases of advertising time into two new states: Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee and Minnesota. Bush aides said today that they were so confident of winning Louisiana and Ohio that they would cut back on advertising there. And a buoyant Mr. Bush even predicted today, "We have a solid chance to sweep the West Coast."
The election could well be the tightest in years, and the day's efforts reflected the recognition in each camp that the outcome in many hotly contested states could depend on which side does better in getting its supporters to the polls.
In New Orleans this morning, Mr. Gore said he was not giving up on Louisiana despite polls that showed Mr. Bush with a lead. The vice president sought to ensure a solid turnout from black voters in the state, meeting with black ministers and saying, "This election is not only about the economy, but it's about values." And he emphasized Social Security, arguing that keeping promises on issues like Social Security demonstrate the character of a campaign.
Later, in Washington, D.C., Mr. Gore called on organized labor for help. "I want you to campaign like we were one vote behind in every precinct," he told supporters from the 1.4-million-member Service Employees International Union in a get-out-the-vote rally. The event was linked by satellite to 17 similar events around the country.
Mr. Bush made his own pitch in a speech by satellite from his Texas ranch to supporters in Spokane and Seattle who were organizing a get-out-the-vote drive. Washington has voted for the Democrats in recent presidential elections, but the Bush campaign is fighting to win there.
Mr. Bush sharply contrasted his agenda with Mr. Gore's. "We are not just opposing the current administration," he said. "We are proposing something better. For over a year we have been applying creative conservative ideas to the job of helping real people and that is the meaning of compassionate conservatism. And that is the message of my campaign. And that is a cause worth waging."
Mr. Bush most pointedly focused on Mr. Gore's proposal for nearly $500 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, mostly targeted for specific needs like college education, child care or retirement savings.
"You might call it an iffy tax scheme," Mr. Bush said. "You can get a tax cut if you do everything Al Gore wants you to do. And that is the kind of meddling, overbearing government you're going to get if you vote for Al Gore."
Mr. Bush's phrase was a play on Mr. Gore's own charge that Mr. Bush's sweeping $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut was a "risky scheme."
Mr. Bush also fought back on the issue of Social Security, saying that Mr. Gore ignored the fiscal problems facing the retirement system when the baby-boom generation retires. "Social Security has long-term financial problems," Mr. Bush said. "His plan does nothing to address them." He argued that Mr. Gore's proposal to add a new retirement savings plan for the middle class on top of traditional Social Security would lead to "Social Security plus massive government debt. Social Security plus a staggering tax increase."
The Democrats' advertising drive begins today with the latest commercials in a series that accuse Mr. Bush of promising the same $1 trillion in Social Security revenue to young adults to invest on their own and current retirees. The Bush campaign disputes that charge, but the Democrats are taking advantage of ambiguities caused by the fact that Mr. Bush has never presented a detailed plan but only overall principles for individual accounts.
Tad Devine, a Gore strategist, said the campaign would use questions about Mr. Bush's Social Security plan to raise doubts about Mr. Bush's qualifications to be president. "There are some serious doubts about whether he is up to the job," Mr. Devine said, adding that Social Security "focuses those doubts."
Separately, Michael Whouley, the chief political strategist for the Democratic National Committee, said the Democrats were going on the air next week in Louisiana with a particularly heavy purchase of advertising time in African-American markets.
The Bush campaign released two 30-second television advertisements of its own that were to run in 19 hotly contested states. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that the scope of the purchase represented an "expanded battlefield" and that for the first time Tennessee and Minnesota were being included as states Mr. Bush might win.
Aimed at parents and women, the advertisements both showed Mr. Bush in an open necked green shirt, tie less and talking about child-rearing and education. Each is filled with color pictures of children of all races, at play or at school. Speaking of raising school standards, Mr. Bush says in one advertisement: "It's easy to just spend more. Let's start by expecting more."
The second advertisement is focused on cultural values, and promises Internet filtering devices, character education in the schools and more effective drug prevention and school discipline. Mr. Bush says, "I believe parents today need allies, not adversaries, to help raise moral, responsible children."
 
In His Own Words
 
GEORGE BUSH
Remarks by Gov. George W. Bush, speaking yesterday by satellite to Republicans in Washington State:
"And there was an interesting moment in our third debate Tuesday night. Responding to a question from a woman in the audience, the vice president said he will reduce her taxes as long as she manages to fit into certain categories: if you do this you may get a tax break, if you do that you may get a tax break. He spoke to her for 94 seconds, and eight times he said the words 'if you.'
You might call it an iffy tax scheme. You can get a tax cut if you do everything that Al Gore wants you to do. That is the kind of meddling, overbearing government you are going to get if you vote for Al Gore."
 Mr. Bush's phrase was a play on Mr. Gore's own charge that Mr. Bush's sweeping $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut was a "risky scheme."
Mr. Bush also fought back on the issue of Social Security, saying that Mr. Gore ignored the fiscal problems facing the retirement system when the baby-boom generation retires. "Social Security has long-term financial problems," Mr. Bush said. "His plan does nothing to address them." He argued that Mr. Gore's proposal to add a new retirement savings plan for the middle class on top of traditional Social Security would lead to "Social Security plus massive government debt. Social Security plus a staggering tax increase."

HEADLINE: As Biggest Business, Wal-Mart Propels Changes Elsewhere

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Sometime before the end of the year, a milestone in American capitalism will pass. Wal-Mart Stores' annual sales are on track to exceed those of General Motors, the largest American company for much of the last half-century.
Soaring oil prices will help Exxon Mobil edge Wal-Mart out of the top slot this year, but oil companies' fortunes routinely rise and fall with the state of affairs in the Middle East. In contrast, Wal-Mart's relentless and rapid rise is transforming whole industries, from consumer manufacturing to retailing and food processing and sales. Indeed, its reach is now so broad that Wal-Mart is lending extra momentum to important elements of the new economy, including the globalization of manufacturing and the use of technology to achieve productivity gains. 
 Wal-Mart did not seem a likely heavyweight in 1962, the year Sam Walton opened his first store in Rogers, Ark., with a sign saying "Wal-Mart Discount City. We sell for less." But the retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., has built a nearly $200-billion-a-year empire by selling astonishing quantities of all manner of items from lawn mowers to toilet paper.
Total annual retail spending in America, excluding automobiles and boats, is roughly $2.3 trillion. Wal-Mart's domestic sales for the fiscal year ended in January were $142 billion, or 6.2 percent of the total. To put it another way, Wal-Mart sells 19 million pairs of women's jeans a year and an average of 19,634 pairs of shoes an hour.
In keeping with its founder's determinedly humble and press-shy persona, Wal-Mart has no plans to celebrate its ascendancy. "We don't keep track," Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, said. Still, as Mr. Scott admits, the company has been a force behind "driving unnecessary costs out of businesses."
That is an understatement. To keep its prices low, Wal-Mart is always pushing its suppliers, an army of more than 65,000 companies, to become leaner machines that examine every penny they spend.
This ruthless drive to cut fat has clearly reshaped the practices of both businesses that have worked with Wal-Mart and those that compete against it. The Wal-Mart hallmarks for keeping costs down -- the use of cutting-edge technology, masterful logistics, reliance on imported goods and a nonunion work force -- are becoming industry standards.
Those retailers that have failed to keep up have suffered. Wal-Mart's potentially devastating effect on mom-and-pop businesses has been widely reported, but many in the industry argue that Wal-Mart is now large enough that it is also driving midsize to large players out of business and speeding consolidation among others. (Philip Morris's decision to merge the food giants Kraft and Nabisco into one entity, for example, was seen by many as a way to increase its leverage with retailing giants.)
And while Wal-Mart's business practices are greatly emulated, they are often controversial. As Wal-Mart accelerates its drive to open stores abroad, local groups have formed to protest the company's practices. Labor advocates say overseas factories that supply Wal-Mart are routinely among those with the worst working conditions. In addition, as Wal-Mart begins to compete with American businesses that are mostly unionized, labor unions, their members and some local government agencies are arguing that the company is big enough to exert downward pressure on benefits and wages across whole regions of the country.
"If you are an admirer of capitalism, they are the epitome of it," said Carl Steidtmann, an economist with PricewaterhouseCoopers who studies retailing. "They are the prime example for the good and bad."
Wal-Mart is considered so efficient that executives at retailers from Bloomingdale's to Banana Republic openly admire it. Less direct homage is paid every day by competitors. When Charles Conaway, the new chief executive of Kmart, announced last summer that his first major move with the company would be to spend $460 million to upgrade information systems, he was tipping his hat to Wal-Mart.
Doing business the Wal-Mart way means constantly figuring out how to cut costs. Some manufacturers say that Wal-Mart is heavy-handed in pressing suppliers on details of their operations, like the location of their corporate offices. (Wal-Mart, located in out-of-the-way Bentonville, hates high urban rents.) One corporate executive, who asked not to be named, tells of a vendor summit meeting called by David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive until January of this year, where the attending executives were chastised for flying in on private jets. (At the time, Bentonville had limited direct airline service.) Wal-Mart officials, asked about the story, said the company did not discuss meetings with vendors.
But most suppliers say the real pressure arises when Wal-Mart demands a particularly low wholesale price. They say the chain does not care how a supplier meets its demands. Many argue that doing business with Wal-Mart is a good thing, a trial by fire. "I went there knowing we were going to get squeezed and wrung and twisted -- all in positive ways," said Paul R. Charron, chief executive of Liz Claiborne Inc., which designs the Russ clothing brand especially for Wal-Mart.
For the Wal-Mart account, Mr. Charron built a separate staff with offices outside New York. He employs fewer people there than he does for servicing department stores and relies heavily on technology, which he calls "faster, quicker and cheaper when optimized."
Even so, Mr. Charron's staff still finds itself in frequent discussions with Wal-Mart over costs, even very small ones. "They will ask if that zipper is right, or does that piece of lace trim add value," he said.
Mr. Charron says that the lessons from Wal-Mart have made Claiborne a tighter ship.
Hal J. Upbin, chief executive of the Kellwood Company, an apparel manufacturer that does about $200 million in annual business with Wal-Mart, concurs. "They are tough," Mr. Upbin said. "They want the lowest prices, and it requires a lot of creativity and ingenuity on our part" to meet Wal-Mart's needs.
Whether Wal-Mart's demands cross the line from the obsessive to the crushing is a subject of hot debate among suppliers. But Wal-Mart's purchasing power is so great that none of its trading partners were willing to go on the record saying negative things about it.
Still, it is not hard to find companies whose bottom lines have been wounded by the retailer. In the 1990's, Rubbermaid was the leading brand-name maker of common kitchenware and household items like laundry baskets. But when the price for the main component in its products, resin, more than tripled between 1994 and 1996, Wal-Mart balked at paying increased prices.
When Rubbermaid insisted, Wal-Mart relegated the manufacturer's items to undesirable shelf space and used its market power to promote a Rubbermaid rival, Sterilite, which made lower-priced nonresin products. Profit margins fell substantially at Rubbermaid, and it has since been bought by another household goods giant, Newell.
Neither Wal-Mart nor Newell Rubbermaid would comment on their relationship.
Still, while companies complain, many economists, market analysts and even government regulators see as something bordering on heroic the Wal-Mart effort to use its formidable market share to start its own brands and to break up monopolies in price-inflated categories.
"They have done more than Alan Greenspan to lower prices," said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reaching Marketing, a consulting firm in Westport, Conn., that frequently works for the Federal Trade Commission. "In the case of vitamins, pet food and baby formula, they have broken the half-nelson" of the dominant companies.
In the mid-1990's, for example, seven companies controlled 90 percent of the market for multivitamins. Last year, a federal judge approved a settlement in which all seven pleaded guilty to charges of price collusion. But Wal-Mart changed the landscape in that business in just 15 months. It introduced its own product, called One Source, in 1997, and it is now among the top-selling multivitamins in the United States.
While economists wax ecstatic about Wal-Mart's effect on domestic consumer prices, the company has become a target of labor activists.
Wal-Mart discontinued its once heavily advertised "Buy America" program, which contained a pledge to use domestic suppliers wherever possible, in 1998 in tacit recognition of its dependence on foreign suppliers. But Wal-Mart has been caught numerous times having subcontracted work to vendors operating under abusive conditions.
"In country after country, factories that produce Wal-Mart goods are the worst," said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee. "They will cut every single corner available." The National Labor Committee, a nonprofit group that addresses concerns of global workers, was instrumental in exposing the fact that sweatshop workers were making products for Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford clothing line.
Wal-Mart vigorously disputes those charges, saying it has a strict code of ethics and that it cuts off contractors who violate them. "There will always be people who break the law," said Mr. Scott, who argues that most Wal-Mart manufacturers provide decent working conditions.
As the largest private employer here at home, with more than one million full-time and part-time employees, Wal-Mart's rabidly antiunion stance is increasingly making the retailer a lightning rod for many labor disputes, particularly over health benefits. Take the example of food workers. In 1987, Wal-Mart started selling groceries, and it is now closing in on a stunning 10 percent share of grocery-chain sales.
Most food workers in this country are unionized, however. And with labor accounting for roughly 60 percent of most grocery companies' fixed costs, differences in pay scales can be deadly. Nearly a dozen regional grocery chains have folded in the last five years. The big players say they are going to have to match Wal-Mart on wages and benefits to survive. "When a competitor comes in, you have to mimic their operations, and you get reduced to the lowest common denominators," an executive at a competing grocery chain said.
Jay Allen, a Wal-Mart spokesman, disputed that contention. "It defies logic that we attract that kind of work force, especially in a low-unemployment time, if we are not paying competitive wage and benefits." Mr. Allen said.
More broadly, Wal-Mart argues that it has lifted the quality of life for thousands of employees by giving them access to stock options and by promoting aggressively from within.
The company also says it has made life better for middle-income Americans in general.
"We have, in fact, raised the standard of living for the working person," Mr. Scott said. "Driving inflated profits out of doing business has been good for the person who works hard every day, and that will be our lasting impact."

HEADLINE: NEW FRONT OPENS IN EFFORT TO FIGHT RACE BIAS IN LOANS

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Two class-action lawsuits filed in Nashville against two of the nation's most prominent automobile finance companies have opened a critical new battlefront in government efforts to combat racial discrimination in the consumer credit markets.
The cases, filed under seal two years ago but recently unsealed on motions by The New York Times and the ABC News program "20/20," accuse the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation of participating in lending arrangements with car dealers that have resulted in blacks paying higher finance charges than whites on dealer-arranged loans for buying cars. 
 Both companies have denied that their finance charges are discriminatory, saying that the statistical studies on which the plaintiffs rely are profoundly flawed. They also assert that the interest rates paid on the loans are the results of private negotiations between consumers and car dealers, who profit directly from the higher rates. So the financing companies say they should not be held responsible for any discriminatory behavior involved in arranging the loans.
But their defense is drawing fire from the Justice Department, which has intervened in one of the cases on the plaintiffs' side. The department argues that lenders like Nissan Motor Acceptance and General Motors Acceptance should indeed be held responsible if the dealers who originate their car loans are violating federal fair-lending laws.
With its move, the government has raised the hopes of consumer advocates, who say the cases may produce supportive rulings and fresh data that can be used to combat racial discrimination elsewhere in the marketplace.
The government's stance has also put the once-obscure cases on the radar of the nation's giant consumer-credit industry. The American Financial Services Association, which represents the biggest consumer lenders in the country, has already entered the cases in support of the defendants.
And the cases are clearly significant for the companies involved. Nissan Motor Acceptance, in a recent appeal of the trial judge's refusal to dismiss the case, noted that the plaintiffs were seeking compensatory damages of at least $100 million, "an amount that would cripple N.M.A.C."
The plaintiffs in the cases are three black Nashville residents, Robert and Betty Cason, who are suing Nissan Motor Acceptance, and Addie Coleman, who is suing General Motors Acceptance. They are represented by two Nashville lawyers, Clinton W. Watkins and Michael E. Terry, with backing from the National Consumer Law Center in Boston and the New York law firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman.
In recent interviews, conducted as part of a joint reporting project by The Times and ABC News, Mrs. Cason and Mrs. Coleman said that they had initially sought legal help because they were upset with the deals they had received on car purchases made in 1995. But they were moved to turn their legal complaints into class-action suits, they said, because of the pain and anger they felt over the evidence of racial discrimination that their lawyers said they had uncovered.
"I have two children," said Mrs. Coleman, in an interview to be broadcast on ABC's "20/20" on Friday. "I don't want them to have to go through the same thing, you know, just because they are black."
One Nashville auto dealer has been sued by Mrs. Coleman while the other dealer involved has been sued by Nissan Motor Acceptance, which argues that the dealer should be responsible for any damages Nissan might incur. In court papers, both dealers have denied any discriminatory practices. They declined to comment on the cases.
Asked to comment about the cases, General Motors Acceptance and Nissan Motor Acceptance, the financing arms of their parent automakers, emphasized their opposition to any form of racial discrimination.
"The company strictly adheres to a zero-tolerance policy on racial discrimination, and will vigorously contest the allegations in the Coleman case," said James E. Farmer, a vice president and spokesman for General Motors Acceptance.
In a statement on Friday night, Nissan Motor Acceptance said that it "is confident that its commitment to fair lending and equal credit opportunity will be demonstrated at trial, and that the plaintiffs' misguided statistical analysis will be proven 'junk science.' "
The accusations of discrimination arise from an auto industry practice that allows a car dealer arranging financing for a customer to quote a higher interest rate for a loan than the lender has set. The lender then buys the loan from the dealer, paying him the cash value of the extra percentage points he added to the consumer's loan rate. The lender's payment to the dealer, which can be more than $1,000, is variously known as dealer participation, finance commission and dealer markup.
When economists working for the Casons and Mrs. Coleman analyzed the extra interest charges that dealers had added to loans financed by General Motors Acceptance and Nissan Motor Acceptance in Tennessee, they found that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to have had the interest rates on their car loans increased by the dealers, according to court records. They also concluded that the extra charges were likely to be twice as high as those paid by whites, according to the records.
Court files show that Mrs. Coleman had a rocky credit history. But General Motors Acceptance agreed to finance her 1995 car loan at 18.25 percent. Her dealer, however, quoted her a loan rate of 20.75 percent and collected the additional finance charges of 2.5 percentage points.
Citing those findings in a brief filed in early August, lawyers for the Justice Department's civil rights division argued that auto lenders, like any creditor, have "a non-delegable duty to refrain from discriminating" under the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the 26-year-old law that prohibits the denial of credit on the basis of race, gender, marital status, age and national origin.
To allow lenders to deny responsibility for discriminatory pricing of the car loans that they have approved and financed simply because those prices were negotiated by the dealers "would significantly hinder the effectiveness" of the fair-credit laws and undermine the government's efforts to enforce them, the Justice Department argued.
The brief was filed only in the Nissan Motor Acceptance case, although a government lawyer said in court that the Justice Department was prepared to file similar arguments in the case against General Motors Acceptance, one of the largest auto financing companies.
The defendants assert that the department's position is a sharp departure from earlier government views on the responsibilities of auto lenders and car dealers under fair-credit laws. They also argue that the government's position is based on a completely inaccurate picture of the relationship between car dealers and lenders who finance car purchases.
The question at the heart of the dispute is whether dealers are independent businesses beyond the lenders' control, as the lenders contend, or middlemen who originate loans in exchange for a share of the interest income from those loans, as the government asserts.
The Justice Department considers car dealers and auto lenders jointly responsible for any violations of fair-lending laws, said Carolyn A. Evans, a lawyer in the department's civil rights division who represented the government at a court hearing on Aug. 22 in Nashville.
At the hearing, Ms. Evans enumerated all the ways that finance companies like Nissan Motor influence the negotiations between dealers and customers, for example, by designing the application forms, setting limits on the dealers' share of the financing profits and steering their Web-site visitors to dealers.
Depositions in the two Nashville cases provide support for the government's position. Employees at the two dealerships cited in the lawsuits described their roles as middlemen between the consumers and the lenders. In addition, Ms. Evans said, Nissan Motor Acceptance is the only party to the loan that actually has any money at risk.
Anne Fortney, the Washington lawyer representing Nissan Motor Acceptance, disagreed. Far from being in control of what the dealers do, she said, every auto lender is competing fiercely for each dealer's new loans.
The lenders can buy only those loans that the dealers offer to them, Ms. Fortney said. Any lender that refused to let dealers play a role in setting customer loan rates would soon find that the dealers would no longer bring them new business, she said.
Interpretations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by the Federal Reserve Board staff have held that "assignees" -- lenders that purchase loans from others -- will not be held responsible for any credit law violations that may have been committed before they bought the loan, she said.
"The Federal Reserve Board was aware of what a law could do to the industry if the law attempted to make assignees liable for what somebody else was doing," she said.
The credit industry's concern about the issues in the Nashville cases is evident in the detailed rebuttal that has been submitted by the American Financial Services Association. Lawyers for the association warned that there were serious "economic dangers" inherent in holding the purchasers of car loans and other retail installment sales contracts responsible for the acts of the originating dealers.
"Competition among dealers would be reduced, as would competition among banks and finance companies for the financing business that a dealer controls," the association said. "Reduced competition would drive up financing costs for consumers, limit financing options and reduce credit availability."
H. Randolph Lively, the president of the association, said in a recent interview that he was surprised and skeptical about the accusations of racial discrimination raised in the Nashville cases.
"The finance industry has gone a long way over the past 15 to 20 years to ensure that there is no discrimination in their operations," Mr. Lively said.
Big commercial lenders like General Motors Acceptance have spent millions of dollars to design credit rating technology that is insulated from subjective bias, he said.
The accusations of racial discrimination in the Nashville cases rest on the statistical analysis of thousands of loans made by General Motors Acceptance and Nissan Motor Acceptance to Tennessee car buyers, based on documents obtained under subpoena by the lawyers for the Casons and Mrs. Coleman.
The individual loan documents were racially coded, based on state motor vehicle records, and then were subjected to a statistical analysis by Debby A. Lindsey, a professor of business at Howard University.
Dr. Lindsey said she found that the amounts that dealers added to the loan rates for black consumers over and above the rates set by lenders -- the so-called markup -- were, on average, significantly higher than those for whites with the same credit ratings.
Dr. Lindsey said that the data from Nissan Motor Acceptance showed that the average markup paid by white customers had a cash value of $507.94; the average markup for blacks had a cash value of $969.91, or $461.97 higher. In data from General Motors Acceptance, Dr. Lindsey reported the average markup for white customers had a cash value of $643.83; for blacks, the average markup was worth $959.18, or $315.35 higher.
Both finance companies have strenuously disputed the method that Dr. Lindsey used to arrive at those results, arguing that differences in credit worthiness -- not race -- explained the disparities.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: SUBWAY SERIES;
Economic Windfall Is Not Guaranteed

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.

 BODY:
No one doubts that the Subway Series has bathed New York in spiritual riches. It has lifted the morale of baseball fans all over the region and drawn national attention to the Big Apple; it is also a great spectacle, an epic contest between a long-reigning champion and a wild-card challenger.
Local politicians have predicted glowingly that the World Series will also bring material riches to the city. But many economists say the odds that the Series will be an economic boon to New York are as great as the odds that the Chicago Cubs will win a pennant.
Both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi have said that having the Yankees and the Mets in the Series will inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy and produce millions in taxes to the city.
Hevesi released a report last week estimating that a seven-game Series would add, conservatively, $137.2 million to the city's economy, or between $18 million and $20 million for each game.
The comptroller's economists arrived at this prediction by adding up rough estimates of revenues from sales of tickets, billboards, television and radio ads, and concession stands, then multiplying the sum by 1.5 to account for the second round of spending that is spurred when money is pumped into the local economy.
For his part, Giuliani has boldly predicted that the Series will bring in between $40 million and $50 million in city taxes on everything from hotel rooms and players' salaries to sales of tickets and merchandise.
But independent economists are highly skeptical of both estimates. In fact, some say that a Series pitting a New York team against a team from another city might have been more lucrative, because it would bring in more fans from the rival metropolis.
"There is no basis to think this is going to be a material lift to the New York City economy," said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economist who is an authority on professional sports. "The city would do better if the Mets were playing Seattle. Basically you have fewer people coming in bringing less money."
Hevesi's prediction rests on several questionable assumptions, many economists said. For example, many of the revenues the comptroller has counted as new economic activity would have come into New York's economy anyway, because Major League Baseball is based in Manhattan.
Take the revenues from ticket sales, the largest slice of new revenue in the comptroller's calculations. Hevesi's sports economist, John Tepper Marlin, projects at least $25 million from ticket revenues for each game at Yankee Stadium and $18.4 million for the games at Shea Stadium, counting all of it as new economic activity.
But the World Series is like a traveling show produced by Major League Baseball. Every year the commissioner's office takes a third of the gate receipts for the first four games, no matter where they are played, and a larger percentage of the last three games, if they are played. In the past, about 12.5 percent of ticket revenues went to the participating teams, along with profits from concessions, billboard ads and parking fees, sports economists said.
"The Yankees and the Mets will net about $3 million to $4 million, because they have some expenses," Zimbalist said.
Of the rest of the money from ticket sales, 60 percent from the first four games goes into a pool for all major league players in the playoffs; most of that is divided among players on the winning and losing teams in the World Series. The remainder goes to other major league players.
But there is no assurance that the money paid to players in New York will be spent in New York City or on products made here, economists said. Only a handful of the players on the Yankees and the Mets list their official residence in the state, and even fewer reside permanently in the city.
Similar troubles arise when counting revenues from television advertisements, which the comptroller has estimated at between $2.6 million and $3.5 million for each game.
Baseball officials say the playoff teams do not receive national advertising revenues. The company that does -- Fox Sports, which holds the broadcast rights to the World Series -- is based in Los Angeles. The fees paid to Major League Baseball for the broadcast rights come into the New York economy every year, no matter where the World Series is played.
Dick Netzer, an economist at New York University, said that waves of tourists coming into New York to see the games would provide a true boost to the local economy, but it is unclear how many people have come for the Series.
There are at least 1,400 reporters accredited to cover the games, many of them from other cities. There are also several thousand other people connected with Major League Baseball who get tickets, although baseball officials declined to give a precise number.
About 3,000 tickets are given to other big-league teams for their employees. Another 400 tickets go to baseball writers around the country, while 1,500 tickets go to major league players not in the Series. Corporate sponsors also get large blocks of tickets as well, and some of those tickets may go to people from other cities.
Still, the impact on New York's hotel industry is not very likely to be major, economists said, because October is already the busiest time for tourism in the city. In recent years, more than 90 percent of the city's 66,000 hotel rooms have been occupied in October, city tourism officials said.
Even if one assumes that the nearly 6,000 rooms that are usually empty at this time of year are filled because of the Series, at $300 a night it would mean about $1.8 million in extra revenue, a tiny amount in a regional economy that generates about $1 billion of business a day, economists said. Looked at in that context, even the comptroller's estimate of $20 million a day in new economic activity would be a drop in the bucket.
"This is going to have almost no effect," said Mark S. Rosentraub, an economist at Indiana University who has written extensively on the economics of baseball. "There is going to be a small gain, but you're talking about the nation's largest regional economy."
Giuliani's visions of windfall tax revenues may also be wishful thinking. The city's effective tax rate -- the ratio between its revenues and its gross product -- is about 6 percent most years and never exceeds 8 percent. Even if one accepts the comptroller's questionable estimates of new economic activity, the extra taxes the city could expect would be between $8 million and $11 million, officials at the city's Independent Budget Office said.
Among the flaws in the mayor's optimistic forecast is that income taxes on the ballplayers' additional income are not very likely to net the city much, because the vast majority of Mets and Yankees have legal residences outside New York State. Players who rent in the city pay city income tax based only on the number of days they reside here annually.
One place where there has clearly been an effect is at sporting goods stores, where souvenir clothing, hats, pennants and other knickknacks have been flying off the shelves. Fans have been crowding into Modell's Sporting Goods outlets as if it were the day before Christmas.
Mitch Modell, the chain's president, said sales at his 55 stores last Wednesday, the day after the Yankees won the American League Championship Series, were five times greater than on the comparable day last year.
"There is a fever in New York that is absolutely incredible," Modell said.
That means extra revenues for Modell's and Major League Baseball, which collects a fee on products bearing a team logo. Unfortunately for Giuliani, the city no longer taxes the sale of clothing that costs less than $110.
In the end, economists say, the real boon to New York may not be economic at all, but the less easily definable effect of upbeat news reports and free advertising for the city. The games are being broadcast in 221 markets worldwide and 19 different languages.
"This is simply a great show," said Rosentraub, a lifelong Yankees fan. "Let's just have a good time."

Lingering Harvest, Lingering Doubts

BYLINE: By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, N.D.

 BODY:
Bales of hay lie scattered across charcoal-black soil. There is a hint of winter in the wind blowing through rows of golden cornstalks and green grass, an air of peace over this prairie now that the harvest is nearly done.
Yet, the mood here is bittersweet. 
 Over the last five years, nearly 2,000 farmers in North Dakota alone and thousands more across the country have left agriculture. After leaner years and more tumultuous times for farmers here, the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency in Fargo says that by all appearances this year's harvest will be better than average.
The production of canola, corn for grain, soybeans and alfalfa hay all reflect gains over last year's harvest. The sugar beet crop is expected to be the third largest on record.
But even with a bountiful harvest, farming is still a tentative prospect for many in the business.
"Right now, it's a precarious situation as people consider their futures," said Scott Stofferahn, the Farm Service Agency's executive director in North Dakota.
"When you talk to farmers out here, they tell you that the majority of their income, darn near all of it, is coming from government payments," Mr. Stofferahn said. "They know without it they can't make their installments on their notes. So this big cloud is hanging over their heads: 'What is the future? Will I be able to survive it?' "
At 66, Albert Hefta is holding on. A farmer for all of his life, he has 2,200 acres on a spread three miles northwest of here. For him, there is something about farming, something that gets in the blood, even when the future is uncertain.
"I like to be out there in the peace and quiet," said Mr. Hefta, a short, hefty man with a tobacco-stained smile and leathery face. "You're your own boss."
His land is anchored by giant bins, a white frame house, a red barn, a fleet of machinery and several head of steer. Mr. Hefta has seen small farmers fall by the wayside. The state lost 16 percent of its farms during the turbulent 80's, and 9 percent more, or 3,000 farms, over the last decade. Mr. Hefta managed to survive, in part, on the revenue from the dairy cows he had for many years. This year, his bins, all 17 of them, are running over.
"We've got a pretty good crop this year," he said, smiling. Still, this year's harvest is not likely to translate into enough profits for his brother, Charles, 59, and him to hire the extra help they could use.
"Can't afford to hire; you'd go broke," Mr. Hefta said.
There are few things still left for the picking here. Corn mostly, burned-brown sunflowers and the last of the sugar beets. But recent rains make work a soggy proposition. Kenard Knudson, who farms about 1,275 acres southwest of Portland, was in the field until about 8 p.m. when the rains came the other night. He still has a few soybeans to harvest.
Mr. Knudson and his wife, Loretta, live on a farm with 60 head of beef cattle. Mr. Knudson, 73, grew up on a farm homesteaded in 1879 by his grandfather, Knut S. Knudson, about four and a half miles west of his own farm. The Knudsons have reared two children on farming. Their son, Kipp, 25, has a degree in economics and financial management, and their daughter, Kari, is a third-year law student at the University of North Dakota. Kipp Knudson is going to run the family farm, a prospect that frightens his mother, given these difficult times for farmers.
"He says he'll make it," Mrs. Knudson said. "I'm scared. He's not." For now, their thoughts are on the harvest.
"It's a time of optimism and hope," Mrs. Knudson, 60, said. "It's what we all look forward to after all the planning in the winter months. It's a cycle."
Mike Workin knows that cycle well. His sons, Daniel, 18, and Scott, 12, used to fall asleep at his feet in his tractor while he tended his wheat and soybeans on 1,100 acres, 700 of which he leased. Farming was nice, said Mr. Workin, 45, a soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed beard. "It gets in the blood."
But three years ago, he decided to quit.
"I had operating money for the next year," Mr. Workin said. "I just called the bank back and told them I didn't need it. The hardest thing to do was to line up the auction and watch your machinery go down the road." He remembers crying.
He is smiling now, standing on the lot of the Farmers Union Oil gas station in Portland, where he works as an attendant. It's a good job, predictable, with benefits. Mr. Workin and his wife, Judy, a certified nurse assistant, and their four children, including daughters Brittani, 14, and JoAnna, 11, still live on a 250-acre farm about 17 miles southwest of here in Steele County. He leases his land to other farmers. He sold the rest.
"I dreamed I'd hand it down to my son one day," he said of his younger son, his words somewhat slower and choked with emotion. "He would have been the farmer. He just had it in his blood."
Mr. Workin climbs into his red pickup and heads home through the cold and the lingering harvest.

Ambitious Waterfront Plan for Stamford's South End

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
THE most ambitious real estate venture undertaken since the redevelopment of this city's downtown 30 years ago, a $200 million mixed-use waterfront complex to be built on 40 acres along the west branch of Stamford Harbor, is being hailed in many quarters of Stamford as a long-sought catalyst for the rebirth of the city's troubled South End peninsula. But the project is so large that some are already questioning certain details.
Called Admiral's Wharf, the 1.2 million square foot proposal includes a 250,000 square foot office building and 516 units of rental apartments and condominiums; a 200-room conference and corporate training center; a ferry service to New York, New Haven and area airports; 50,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; and parking for 2,300 cars. The project is an expanded version of a similar development called the Strand, proposed 10 years ago by the same developer, Arthur Collins Sr., chairman of Collins Enterprises of Greenwich. 
 Except for two marinas at the southern end, the acreage, which lies across the street from a Pitney Bowes manufacturing complex on Washington Boulevard and Dyke Lane, has been vacant since the 70's, when the owner, United Illuminating, dismantled a coal gasification plant. Left behind was a stew of coal tars, cadmium, arsenic, lead, petroleum and PCB's, according to John DeVillars, executive vice president of Brownfields Stamford, the company that will do the cleanup.
The cost, to be borne by the utility, is estimated by the developer at $10 million to $15 million, and the purchase price of the property to be paid by Mr. Collins and his partners is "slightly under $40 million," he said.
When the real estate market became mired in the recession 10 years ago, financing was not available for Mr. Collins's original project, the Strand -- a $90 million development that was to have contained 85,000 square feet of offices, 200 condominium units, a 20-room waterside hotel, shops and restaurants. Mr. Collins kept his option on the property and two years ago formed a partnership with John H. McClutchy, head of JHM Ventures L.L.C., apartment developers headquartered in Stamford, and with Brownfields Stamford L.L.C., a subsidiary of the Boston-based Brownfields Recovery Corporation. Together, as Strand-BRC Group, they responded to a request by United Illuminating for new proposals and were accepted.
"Real estate market issues were very different in 1990," Mr. Collins said. "Overbuilding had caused some two million square feet of office vacancies. Our market now is very strong, with low office vacancies and a substantial housing shortage."
Mr. McClutchy said: "Arthur and I are putting together the financing and getting the land approvals. We have had discussions with interested bankers and with corporations interested in waterfront locations. The conference center was planned on the advice of Pitney Bowes, who told us there is a desperate need for this type of building." The company has been across from the Admiral's Wharf site since the 20's.
Do H. Chung & Partners of Stamford have been the architects for both the Strand and Admiral's Wharf. Mr. Chung described the new project as Georgian colonial in style with no building exceeding five stories. The commercial buildings and conference center will be built of brick, and the residential structures will be brick and clapboard or shingle. "A tower element, like a lighthouse, might be at the ferry terminal," he said, "and the conference center will be a signature building -- the first one people see coming down Washington Boulevard." The landscaped open space will include a linear park that conforms to the city's plan for a public walk along its entire waterfront.
Stamford's Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, who is committed to opening the South End to a flow of commerce and people, said, "The Collins project addresses the kind of issues in housing and public access to the water that will enable the South End to undergo redevelopment."
The peninsula, extending from Interstate 95 and the Metro-North and Amtrak railroad tracks south to the water, was once a manufacturing engine that drove the city's economy through World War II. Today, it is a patchwork of decaying industrial plants and ethnic residential neighborhoods, where the rate of home ownership has dropped to less than 10 percent.
David Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, a 20-year-old economic development agency made up of city officials, business executives and representatives of South End neighborhoods, has been involved in the site since the 80's. "At that time," he said, "we proposed that the industrial zoning be changed on the master plan to Design Waterfront District for mixed use, and we recommended the Collins organization as developers."
IN an agreement between Mr. Collins and the partnership, the developer was to supply a percentage of low-cost housing at the Strand by donating $2 million in cash or construction. He is still committed to the idea, but, he said, "Whether we go to the 70 percent market and 30 percent below-market set by the state or work something out with the city, it's too early to say."
Providing housing that middle income people can afford is a constant priority in the city. "With a median area income of more than $102,000," Mr. Anderson said, both the number of below-market-rate housing units and the income qualifications for them "that the city will accept will require some negotiation." He noted that Stamford's master plan requires developers of such special districts to submit site plans for uses and design for city approval. "That puts the city and the community in the driver's seat for what should and should not happen," he said.
Mr. Anderson criticized the proposed office building for Admiral's Wharf for "taking a bite out of downtown -- in the wrong location for a building that size." He added, "There are downtown sites that could be available for offices," naming an empty parcel behind the Stamford Town Center mall and a property approved for offices that Hines Interests never built.
Concerns that were raised 10 years ago are expected to resurface at public hearings. Many small business and restaurant owners in the central business district who regarded the Strand as a competing second city on the other side of the tracks still do.
And Pitney Bowes has questions about traffic. According to Mary Maarbjerg, executive director of real estate for the company, "any project that affects the infrastructure of the area affects us." She continued, "We have 3,000 employees in several buildings -- 1,800 in the manufacturing plant across from Admiral's Wharf." The number of cars and their comings and goings, she said, "need to be coordinated with our employees' hours and with our incoming and outgoing truck traffic."
The two marinas that will remain on the property will become tenants of Collins Enterprises. The Ponus Yacht Club and Brewer's Yacht Haven Marina currently lease about 14 acres of the tract from United Illuminating. Jack Brewer, owner of Yacht Haven and 16 additional Brewer's marinas between Mamaroneck, N.Y., and South Freeport, Me., said, "We expect to add 50 or 60 slips and install new lifts and floats."
The Strand-BRC Group has applied to the city to bring an eight-acre industrially zoned parcel of the site into conformance with the Design Waterfront District and will embark next month on public hearings, site plan approvals, many months of cleanup and certification by state and federal environmental agencies. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2002, and completion could take another four years.
Throughout its 30-year history the Collins organization has focused primarily on developing waterfront properties from Norwalk, Conn., to Norfolk, Va. "Waterfront development is harder to do," Mr. Collins said, "because of the environmental issues, but it's resistant to recessions, moves faster, and the values are higher because there is so much less of it." Between 1978 and 1990 he developed 45 acres of the east branch of Stamford Harbor with 725,000 square feet of offices, 231 condominium units and 570 boat slips in four complexes. Over all, he has developed more than one million square feet of offices and 1,500 residential units.
Richard W. Redniss, whose company, Redniss & Mead, is a land planning consultant for numerous projects in the area, including Collins's, agrees with supporters of the project. "Admiral's Wharf," he said, "marks the beginning of a renaissance in the South End. A hundred and fifty years ago it was an important port, and 75 years ago its industries provided a substantial percentage of the city's jobs. Today, gentrification has a high probability," he said, noting that commuters will be attracted to waterfront housing only one-third of a mile from the railroad station. "We need to work on managing growth with the people who live and work there and the companies that are located there," he said.

HEADLINE: AN EVENING IN STANHOPE;
At the Stanhope House, Echoes of Past and Beat of Present

BYLINE: By JILLIAN HORNBECK AMBROZ

DATELINE: STANHOPE

 BODY:
OLD-TIMERS say there's mojo in these walls," said Maureen Myers, rocking slowly in her chair and smiling at the shrine that surrounds her -- walls painstakingly covered with autographed photos of blues legends. "They feel the spirits here are very friendly, similar to when they started out in Chicago."
As the proprietor of the Stanhope House, she uses the term spirits, literally. "This house is over 200 years old -- a lot of people have died here. Previous owners have died here. And Thelma died in the back room," Ms. Myers says, pointing to what is now a billiards room. "We've got two ghosts here now. I've seen a male ghost here in the entryway, and we've got a female ghost by the console." 
 Dating from 1790 (and four decades before that, if you ask Ms. Myers, who believes that the original deed was issued by the King of England in 1752), the building has sheltered and entertained many souls. It began as a private residence for Lord Stanhope. Over the years it evolved from a stage coach stop to a post office, and some even say a brothel. Babe Ruth gambled here during Prohibition, and Daniel Webster gave a speech from the front porch, says Ms. Myers.
Since the 1970's, it has been a music club, offering its small stage to such blues greats as Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughn. These days, prominent national acts share the stage with local talent.
"This place has a great sense of history. It's amazing to stand on a stage where Muddy Waters played," said Andy Bernstein, leader singer of the New Brunswick-based VooDudes, a patron since the 70's, and a performer here for the past 10 years. "Over the years there've been different layouts, but it's always been a comfortable place. It's an adventure. For five bucks you don't know what you're going to get."
Red Christmas lights punctuate the darkness where Eva Marie Pucillo swayed to the upbeat, washboard-backed Creole rhythm of the VooDudes on a recent Friday night. "I live right down the street and I've been coming here for 20 years," she said. "There have been so many times when I've had the opportunity to move and I didn't because of this place. I can have two beers and listen to music and ride my bicycle home and feel safe."
One of only two bars in town, the Stanhope House does not serve food, and draws a late crowd. "This is Mayberry," said Ms. Myers. "There's nothing else open in this town." Before 10 p.m., the large, old house with the columned porch on Main Street is as dormant as the rest of the sleepy town. But, in the middle of the night, the old roadhouse erupts with music that shakes the dusty wood floor and ricochets off the pressed tin ceiling.
From Thursday through Sunday, the Stanhope House delivers blues, rock, bluegrass, zydeco, funk and folk music for a cover charge, usually under $10. And the club offers a three-song satisfaction guarantee. Anyone who leaves before hearing a third song can get a refund.
"This is an old roadhouse," said Ms. Myers. "You're supposed to party and have a good time. If you spill your beer on the floor we're not going to run over and clean it up." The mood of the jumping club matches that of the dress code: comfortable and relaxed, but not rowdy.
Beneath the hand-hewn beams of the low ceiling, Mary Myers pulls cold draughts and mixes drinks. "I remember when my parents bought this place seven years ago," she said. "I loved it the moment I saw it. We've made some changes, but not many. You don't want to change a place like the Stanhope House."
Joyce Bickham, a 10-year patron, said: "This place is not pretentious. A lot of people put antiques on the walls, but this place is antique. We like Cajun music, and there are not too many places around here that offer it. And it's a great mix of people. On the dance floor you'll see someone in their 20's jumping around crazily and next to them there'll be an older guy doing a beautiful two-step with his lady friend."
Ms. Bickham's husband, Brett, added: "This is not a townie bar. There's a real eclectic mix of people, from age to socio-economics. You'll see a pickup truck and a Mercedes parked side-by-side. The music quality is always consistently good -- this is the Carnegie Hall for blues and zydeco fans."
Jim Beckerman, keyboard player and co-founder of the VooDudes, appreciates his gigs at this old roadhouse. "It's not corporate -- it's a real juke joint," he said. "There are lots of corporate, fake juke joints that try to look like this. The Stanhope House is the real thing."

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE;
It Certainly Glitters, but What Is It Worth?

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS

 BODY:
PETER L. BERNSTEIN would be a wonderful dinner partner. He has an immense base of knowledge, from which he combs one good story after another. His tales are all rich with interesting characters and charmingly told. Though he has clearly done the scholarly reading, he would never bore you with minutiae. At the end of such an evening, you would understand that his stories all served his theme.
Such it is with Mr. Bernstein's most recent book, "The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession" (John Wiley & Sons, $27.95). This interesting and pleasurable work tracks the world's passion for gold from ancient Egypt to the present. 
 Mr. Bernstein is a Wall Street consultant with 60 years of experience in finance. He enjoys a reputation for explaining complex financial topics to a broad audience in an engaging way. He has written about the intellectual foundations of the capital markets and about probability theory in managing risk.
This history is about the use and misuse of gold for money or -- in the modern era -- as backing for money, the arrangement known as the gold standard. Nations relied on gold to stabilize the value of paper money by standing ready to buy or sell gold at a set price. For a long time in the United States, that price was $35 an ounce. The gold standard is history now, as ancient as the Vietnam War: in 1971, President Richard M. Nixon "closed the gold window," ending the right of foreign central banks to demand gold for dollars. Gold and the dollar are now worth whatever the financial markets say they are.
Though Mr. Bernstein is discerning and evenhanded in his writing, he shows his colors immediately. He begins with a story told a century ago by John Ruskin: A ship passenger has a big bag of gold coins. Later, when ordered to abandon ship, he straps the gold around his waist, leaps over the side, plunges to the ocean bottom and perishes. So, Ruskin asks, did he have the gold, or did the gold have him?
The pleasure of the book is in its sheer number of unknown places and interesting episodes. Mr. Bernstein introduces us to Offa, king of Mercia, who originated the first widely accepted money in Britain around the year 800. He retained three master moneyers, Eoba, Babba and Udd, to mint silver pennies by the millions, Cornwall being rich in silver. Offa's coin was in circulation for 500 years.
The Chinese invented paper money. Marco Polo marveled at Kublai Khan's currency, "as formal and authoritative as if it were made of pure gold and silver." The Great Khan had ordered every payment, anywhere in his domain, to be made in his currency. "And," Marco Polo observed, "no one dares refuse it, on pain of losing his life." Pretty good backing for a currency. Further, the Khan had ordered that treasure brought into his empire be turned over to him in exchange for paper money.
Real treasure for mere paper -- was that unfair? How different was the Khan's fiat, Mr. Bernstein asks, from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's action in 1933, barring private parties from owning gold and ordering gold turned in for dollars?
There are sugarplums throughout the book. They might be a dazzling piece of prose by John Maynard Keynes, or a description of the logistics of the huge Spanish treasure convoys, or an aside on the relative economic advantages of camel caravans and ships in the gold trade between the Mediterranean and West Africa in the 15th century. Mr. Bernstein explains why, after centuries of coexistence, gold shoved aside silver as the universal standard. (Silver was swamped by a deluge of gold discoveries in the 19th century.)
Mr. Bernstein suggests that a gold standard is a bane in bad times, an irrelevance in good. In hard times, protecting the gold stock requires high interest rates and austerity measures, deepening the downturn. In good times, a strong economy itself supports the currency.
Between the American Civil War and World War I, gold became the near-universal standard, "a symbol of sound practice and a badge of honor and decency," said Joseph Schumpeter, the great economist. The era was known for prosperity and financial stability. But Mr. Bernstein sides with Benjamin Disraeli, who said in 1895, "Our gold standard is not the cause but the consequence of our prosperity."
In a book with much fine narrative, Mr. Bernstein's treatment of gold policy between the world wars is exceptionally lucid. He calls it a horror story with no villains, only disastrous decisions prompted by an eagerness to get back to the comforting, pre-1914 ways. The British set a deadline of 1925 for restoring the gold standard, suspended during World War I. The campaign was led by the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, an elegant, forbidding man who used his high office to great effect. He more or less browbeat Winston Churchill, then the chancellor of the exchequer, into approving restoration. "I'm lost and reduced to groping," Churchill lamented among the high priests of money.
Churchill grumbled that Norman could be perfectly happy if Britain had a fine credit rating and 1.25 million unemployed. Indeed, the British paid the price in higher interest rates, an economic slowdown, stifled imports and millions more people out of work. An improvement in exports -- the object of the game -- never materialized as trade dried up worldwide. Within six years, Britain dropped the gold standard.
Mr. Bernstein sometimes condenses too much, leaving the reader dizzy. Writing about the great price revolution of the 16th century -- inflation that raged for a hundred years -- Mr. Bernstein notes that some scholars blamed the constant, costly warfare among Europe's kingdoms.
Others, he writes, have focused on population growth that rapidly outpaced food production. (On the other hand, he says, still others have asked how people paid for the food. Mere need doesn't drive up prices.)
The great Adam Smith squarely blamed the huge influx of gold and silver from America, which swelled the money supply without a corresponding increase in things to buy. But Mr. Bernstein says that others exonerated that influx: inflation had taken off before bullion arrived in quantity and continued long after imports subsided.
Rebutting the rebuttal, some objected that the fall in imports was overstated, because the customs figures left out smuggled goods. And finally -- finally! -- some insisted that everyone else had things upside down: the rapid rise in prices had prompted the avid search for gold and silver, not the other way around.
Whew. My kingdom for a one-armed historian.
Otherwise, though, with one illustration after another, "The Power of Gold" amounts to extensive, sophisticated and engrossing variations on the theme of King Midas, who was granted his wish that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was shortly in despair when his food, his belongings, even his daughter, were transformed at his touch. Mr. Bernstein believes that throughout history, people have clung to their gold and drowned.
"Gold as an end in itself is meaningless,"' he writes. "Hoarding does not create wealth. Gold and its surrogates make sense only as a means to an end: to beautify, to adorn, to exchange for what we need and really want."
Early in the book, Mr. Bernstein writes about peoples of West Africa who lived great distances from sources of salt. They developed a trade with Europeans, in which they swapped gold for salt, an ounce of gold for an ounce of salt. Mr. Bernstein wonders what the Africans must have thought of the Europeans, who were willing to trade this precious, life-giving commodity -- salt -- for a useless yellow metal.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Book Value column last Sunday, about "The Power of Gold," by Peter L. Bernstein, misstated the year of a statement attributed to Benjamin Disraeli about the gold standard used in Britain. It was 1873, not 1895.
The column also omitted part of the quotation. Disraeli said, "Our gold standard is not the cause but the consequence of our commercial prosperity."

HEADLINE: COMPRESSED DATA;
Geeks for Gore, but Bosses Choose Bush

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Two recent polls of the presidential preferences of information technology professionals provide some provocatively conflicting data.
Geeks prefer Al Gore, according to the latest weekly results at www.metricnet.com, an information technology research site created by Howard Rubin, a consultant in Pound Ridge, N.Y. 
 But people more likely to be the geeks' bosses seem to prefer the Bush ticket, according to a survey by CIO magazine. (CIO's name is the abbreviation for chief information officer.)
Metricnet's registered audience consists mostly of information technology managers and high-level programmers, Mr. Rubin said. Among the 14,500 of them voting in the survey in the last week, the Vice President was favored over Gov. George W. Bush by a 50 percent to 38 percent margin. And, in contrast to national polls of the general public which show Mr. Bush inching past Mr. Gore, the margin for Mr. Gore has been widening this month in the Metricnet poll.
But it appears to be a case of same universe, different planet for information technology executives who attended a recent symposium sponsored by CIO magazine. CIO found that 48 percent of the 210 executives at its gathering last week in Phoenix said they intended to vote for the Bush-Cheney ticket compared to just 37 percent for Gore-Lieberman.
The CIO group favors Mr. Bush by a wide margin, but they gave a slight edge -- 41 percent to 38 percent -- to the Gore team as "best suited to lead the new economy," said Karen Fogerty, spokeswoman for CXO Media, the unit of International Data Group that publishes CIO.
Mr. Rubin said that Mr. Gore has led in the Metricnet poll ever since it began in March, although his lead narrowed to a few points in August before widening again. About 217,000 votes have been recorded. However, because each is irrevocable, the trend lines reflect only new votes, and make no provision for people who might have changed their minds.
Education reform has consistently been the top public issue for those in the information technology world, according to Mr. Rubin's polling. The biggest shift in recent weeks on issues directly related to information technology has been a sharp increase in concerns about Internet privacy and security.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report;
PBS and NPR find unexpected success selling on the Web.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
LIKE many industries, public broadcasting was not exactly thrilled to add the Web to its to-do list in the mid-90's. At the time, conservative members of Congress were calling for the end to federal subsidies, cable networks like the Learning Channel were threatening to lure away public television viewers, and the competition for private donations stretched the fund-raising abilities of public radio and television stations alike.
Still, because viewers and listeners clamored for Web sites -- if only to learn more about the music they heard or to preview that night's program schedule -- public broadcasters dutifully answered the call, and set out looking for a way to pay for it. E-commerce seemed like a possibility, but it also seemed like a risky experiment for the stations within the Public Broadcasting Service and the National Public Radio network, which had scant retail expertise. 
 Now, though, with the formulas for e-commerce success starting to come more clearly into focus, the experiment looks less risky. Public radio and television stations are starting to build online stores or expand their previously modest online shops. As they do, they are looking not only to generate revenue, but to remain relevant to their audiences in an age when viewers and listeners are awash in media choices.
The public broadcasting entities, like their commercial television counterparts, have a distinct advantage over many types of would-be Internet retailers: recognizable brands. But NPR and PBS and their affiliates also have at least one apparent advantage over commercial broadcasters: an extremely loyal audience that includes millions of people who already pay to support the programming. These people are good prospects for the videos and CD's that are among the main products of public broadcasting's online stores.
PBS would not disclose how much revenue it generates from video sales, but one executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, put the figure in the tens of millions. And the market for goods related to public radio is apparently ample. Minnesota Public Radio, which produces "A Prairie Home Companion," among other shows, is particularly successful in this regard. Two years ago, it sold Rivertown Trading, which distributed MPR-related goods through catalogs, to Dayton Hudson for $120 million.
Despite the allures, public broadcasters have witnessed enough of the carnage among e-tailers to remain a bit wary -- particularly because direct sales to consumers is still not their main area of expertise. Many have hedged their bets by farming out most of the customer service and order-processing responsibilities to outside companies, which take a percentage of the revenue from each sale.
When PBS opened a shop on the PBS.org Web site three years ago, it was viewed as a way to take orders more efficiently than the 800-number operation that sold PBS videos, said Don Jalbert, who, as vice president of PBS Learning Media, oversees the PBS online store.
But the PBS Web site quickly outgrew the first humble expectations. With the help of the consulting firm KPMG, PBS rolled out a new version of the shop in June, featuring 1,500 videos, books and CD's related to its programs. Both the order-taking and the fulfillment duties are handled by outside companies, Mr. Jalbert said. "We're already profitable," he said, declining to elaborate. "It's tight, but we are profitable."
He also said revenues were growing significantly. "We're 65 percent ahead of where we were last year at this point," Mr. Jalbert said, predicting continued growth as PBS promotes the online store on the air and in its printed video catalogs.
Analysts said PBS's on-air promotion of its Web site had stirred anxiety among some member stations, which also want to drive viewers to the stations' own Web sites and online stores. Steve Behrens, editor of Current magazine, which covers the public broadcasting industry, said the issue came down to whether viewers should identify more with PBS or their local PBS stations. The PBS member stations ultimately benefit from sales to the PBS Web site, because the proceeds can reduce the membership fees that PBS needs to raise from its affiliates. But direct Web sales are a more immediate tonic for the member stations' ledgers.
"It's one of these affiliate-versus-national struggles that goes on all the time," Mr. Behrens said. "Revenue is part of what's driving this. But more important, they want the direct relationship with viewers that PBS is getting."
There are similar rumblings within the National Public Radio family, as NPR prepares to open its first Web store next month. Tom Lix, president of Public Interactive, a for-profit company that builds Web sites for public radio and television stations, said that some of the public radio stations he had created Web sites for were wary of NPR's e-commerce plans, "because they do compete with NPR."
"It's a classic new-media situation, where people are working out the models as they go along," he said. "And I think there probably will be a little tension. But I still think it's do-able, because in the end, people will stay focused on the mission."
NPR executives declined to say how the organization would divide the revenues for its online sales with its affiliates, or how NPR and its stations would handle the on-air promotions for their respective online stores. But Kenneth P. Stern, NPR's executive vice president, said, "We look at this not as how to cut the individual transaction fees, but rather, how can we develop the economics of the NPR system as a whole."
Indeed, some local stations voice few concerns about how the e-commerce revenue comes their way -- as long as it comes. One of these is WHYY, a public radio and television station and production studio in Philadelphia. Robyn Goldman, executive director of WHYY Ventures, the division that sells products related to WHYY's shows, said the company retained the rights to promote its online store on all of the programs it produced. Moreover, she said, "PBS sells some of our videos, and our stuff will also be in NPR's store."
If the goods are sold through another site or company, "we make a lot less money through royalties," Ms. Goldman said, adding, "But still, we've done quite well that way, too."
Tom Fowler, vice president of South Carolina Educational Radio, which operates eight NPR-affiliated stations covering South Carolina and parts of Georgia and North Carolina, said it did not matter which Web store was promoted on the air. "Most listeners don't know NPR from PRI from any of the other acronyms out there," he said, referring to Public Radio Internationl, which produces and distributes radio programs to more than 600 stations.
What is more important, Mr. Fowler said, is that the audience relies on his stations to get the information in the first place. Good information, not Web sales, is what will keep listeners tuning in, Mr. Fowler said.
"With all the things that are coming, with satellite radio and programming on the Internet, people will have choices," Mr. Fowler said. "So however they happen to go online and get something -- whether it's from NPR or our site, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that they hear about it on our air."

HEADLINE: Qualcomm's Shrinking Act Could Pay Off Big;
Company Prospers by Shedding Divisions and Focusing Fiercely on Patents

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Irwin Jacobs, the chairman of Qualcomm, had already left China after meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji when word caught up with him at a hotel room in Budapest last week: China's second-largest telecommunications company, China Unicom, had finally confirmed plans to construct a wireless communications network using technology patented by Qualcomm.
The announcement eased the techno-political tensions raised earlier this year after Chinese officials had seemed to assure the United States government that Qualcomm's technology would be adopted by China Unicom -- only to have the Chinese company back out a short time later. 
 More to the business point, though, the news helped drive Qualcomm's stock up 11 percent in one day last week, contributing to a 25 percent rise in the company's stock price since the beginning of last month -- a period when the Nasdaq composite index was declining by 17 percent.
Yet even as the new China deal seemed to vindicate his vision of a world in which nearly every wireless phone might one day use technology patented by Qualcomm, Mr. Jacobs, a former engineering professor, gave a characteristically matter-of-fact reply when asked to comment.
"From a revenue point of view," he wrote in an e-mail message from Budapest, where he was on a business trip, "we would anticipate an interesting impact in 2002 and beyond."
Mr. Jacobs, who turned 67 last week, is seldom showy, despite his bold ambitions for the global wireless market. The rest of the telecommunications industry may be enthralled with bigger-is-better consolidation, but Qualcomm is actually getting smaller, spinning off division after division. If the future belongs to Qualcomm, it will be on the strength of the company's intellectual creativity and a fierce defense of its portfolio of patents -- some 1,000 and growing.
Many of those patents involve a wireless transmission format called Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA, a "spread spectrum" technology long used by the United States military for secure radio communications.
CDMA competes mainly with two other wireless standards, Time Division Multiple Access, or TDMA, and the global system for mobile communications, or GSM. But last year, in industry standards-setting bodies, it began to look as if many elements of CDMA would be incorporated into the coming generation of wireless networks intended to connect to the Internet and carry massive amounts of voice and data traffic.
Suddenly Qualcomm, with its CDMA patents, was a favorite with investors. The company's share price soared 2,600 percent last year, surpassing all other major issues on the Nasdaq. And although much of those astronomic gains were negated earlier this year as technology stocks went out of fashion and Qualcomm suffered its initial setback in China, the company's shares have resumed their climb in the last three months.
"The pointy-headed professor who took battlefield technology and made it the core of an almost pure intellectual-property company is one of the great telecommunications tales of our time," said Jerry Hausman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in telecommunications issues. "If Jacobs succeeds -- and his chances look pretty good -- then his moves will be studied in detail in the years ahead."
Qualcomm owes its existence to an idea Mr. Jacobs had while driving down Interstate 5 in Southern California one day in the mid-1980's, shortly after becoming wealthy by selling his first start-up, Linkabit, a developer of wireless communications technology.
A Massachusetts native, he had left a teaching post at M.I.T. two decades earlier for one at the University of California at San Diego, where he found the region's military industry a fertile field for his interests in business and engineering. So while another person might have been thinking of how to spend his Linkabit wealth that day on the Interstate, Mr. Jacobs was musing about spread spectrum -- a military radio technology with roots reaching back to World War II.
Spread-spectrum radio signals being sent out are scattered over a wide range of frequencies and then collected back onto their original frequency at the receiver. This makes communications hard for an enemy to jam or intercept. For civilian use, the main benefits are signal clarity and the efficient use of increasingly crowded bandwidth, because scattered signals are less likely to interfere with other transmissions -- even ones on the same frequencies.
Seeing the commercial possibilities for spread spectrum, Mr. Jacobs founded Qualcomm in San Diego in 1985. Today, from a corporate campus chiseled into sun-drenched hills on the northern edge of the city, some 6,500 employees are either directly involved in or supporting the research-grounded patent-building process on which the founder has staked the company's future.
In preparing for the patents push, Mr. Jacobs began to streamline Qualcomm in 1998 by bundling its interests in various telecommunications carriers -- including Cricket Communications and a Mexican company, Pegaso -- into a holding company named Leap Wireless International.
The following May, Qualcomm sold its telecommunications equipment business to the big Swedish wireless equipment maker Ericsson. That deal resolved a lengthy patent-infringement dispute, while also effectively taming Ericsson's resistance to the flavor of CDMA technology that Qualcomm is advocating for next-generation wireless networks.
Late last year, Qualcomm announced plans to sell its handset manufacturing business to the Japanese company Kyocera, while securing a five-year commitment from Kyocera to buy most of its CDMA chips and software from Qualcomm.
Next up is Qualcomm's chip manufacturing business. The chip operation, temporarily named Spinco, is being prepared for an initial public offering and the distribution of shares to Qualcomm shareholders.
The selling off of Qualcomm's businesses has been so extensive that one analyst, John Sullivan of Phillips Business Information, questioned whether Mr. Jacobs had taken up the Japanese poetic form of haiku to express his ambitions. In a widely circulated report, Mr. Sullivan imagined the chief executive's musings might look like this:
Many business groups
Mundane thoughts weigh down my soul
Spin off everything
Whatever its literary potential -- or limitations -- Qualcomm's strategy presumes the widespread commercial use of wireless communications. Qualcomm already receives about 4 percent of the wholesale price of each wireless phone that uses CDMA technology, in addition to royalty revenue from the sale of network equipment using its technology.
In its third-quarter results, released in July, the company reported a 40 percent rise in net income, to $218 million, on revenue of $714 million. About half of that amount came from Spinco; the other contributors included OmniTracs, a global positioning system used by the trucking industry, and Eudora, an e-mail software developer.
But royalties contributed $174 million of the revenue total, up 38 percent from a year earlier. For this year as a whole, Qualcomm's royalties should total about $630 million, according to Pete Peterson, a Prudential Securities analyst. And some analysts are projecting annual royalty revenue of $3 billion by 2005.
"The combination of having the best intellectual-property portfolio with the ability to do astute deals is their forte," said Graham Tanaka, who invested in Qualcomm stock about a year and a half ago as president of the Tanaka Growth Fund.
One of the central merits of CDMA technology, according to Mr. Jacobs and some other experts, is that it handles huge amounts of voice and data with great ease. "Whether you're in the heart of Tokyo or an undeveloped corner of Africa, it's clear that CDMA-based systems make the most sense," Mr. Jacobs said in a recent interview at his modest office.
Mr. Jacobs's tendency to go off on intellectual tangents or argue at length about the merits of seemingly obscure statistical minutiae can make him seem better suited for lecturing on engineering topics than running a company that has surpassed Motorola, America's other wireless titan, in market value -- $55.6 billion as of Friday, compared with Motorola's $50.9 billion.
In fact, Mr. Jacobs, whose 3.5 percent stake in Qualcomm is worth almost $2 billion, has demonstrated a fiercely competitive side in negotiations over wireless technology standards.
CDMA systems still lag TDMA and GSM, with only about 15 percent of the global market. But CDMA is growing at a faster rate than its rivals. And the company could yet see its biggest rewards when current networks are replaced with next-generation systems using Qualcomm's technology.
Qualcomm predicts that its patented technology will be used for either CDMA2000 or W-CDMA, the two standards that have emerged as the likeliest to be adopted by carriers building networks over the next five years. But competitors, particularly Texas Instruments, are already preparing either to develop around Qualcomm's patent positions or to favor different technologies.
"We believe there are a lot of patents out there that will apply to the new generations of wireless networks, including many of ours," said Mike McMahan, director of wireless research and development at Texas Instruments, which has supplied many of the chips for mobile handsets using the GSM standard, which is widely used in Europe.
Texas Instruments insists that it is agnostic about standards and willing to work with competing technologies. But it took a step toward confronting Qualcomm's dominance in the CDMA arena in June by acquiring Dot Wireless, a San Diego company with several former high-ranking Qualcomm executives, to try to put itself on equal technological footing with Qualcomm.
The bigger threat to Qualcomm's patents strategy may come from Nokia, the Finnish wireless giant, which is seeking to promote the idea that multiple patent holders, including Nokia, will benefit from coming wireless technologies.
In an all-out effort to show that it is not willing to become a mere assembler of handsets dependent on other companies' technology, Nokia is supporting what it calls an open, global approach to wireless networks, instead of a proprietary one based on Qualcomm's patent portfolio.
"It's unclear what the final applicability of Qualcomm's patents will be," said K. P. Wilska, president of Nokia's United States operations. "Getting patents granted in multiple countries is a long and complicated process."
But Mr. Jacobs contends that specializing in research and patents will give his company the power of concentration.
"By focusing on development, and not manufacturing, we'll keep our technological edge," Mr. Jacobs said. "And we'll be the ones receiving royalties instead of paying them out to our competitors."

HEADLINE: Consolidation Skews Field In Magazine Distribution

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

DATELINE: FLORENCE, Ala.

 BODY:
Far from the gleaming steel canyons of Manhattan, where tirelessly urbane editors craft the magazines that entertain and inform the American public, the real heartbeat of the magazine industry beats in a squat office building, in a town on the banks of the Tennessee River, two hours' drive from Memphis.
Manhattan may be the Emerald City of the magazine world, but the industry's Wizard of Oz -- Joel R. Anderson, chairman of the Anderson News Corporation -- keeps his office here on North Court Street, past the Magnolia Church of Christ, the Coon Dog Cemetery, Biscuit Village and the Guns 'n' Such store on the corner. 
 "New York is far, far away," Mr. Anderson said, as he navigated the streets of Florence in his cherry-red Ford pickup. "And I have spent enough time there to know how publishers and magazine folks get a distorted view of the country."
The magazine folks are not too happy with Mr. Anderson, either. In the last five years, Mr. Anderson -- a textbook Southern gentleman, who could have walked off the pages of a Walker Percy novel -- has emerged as one of the key players in the industry as his company, Anderson News, rose to become the nation's largest magazine wholesaler.
Of every 10 magazines on a retail rack in the United States, Anderson delivers 4. If you want your publication at retail stores, you pretty much have to go to Anderson or three other companies, which deliver another 5.
Mr. Anderson is a symbol of a swift consolidation that has left a battlefield littered with defunct wholesalers, both large and small. The consolidation has drawn the attention of the Justice Department's antitrust division and has created mounting, intense consternation among publishers, who say that they are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to get their publications distributed, and are even attributing magazine closings to wholesalers. Earlier this year, magazine executives cited wholesaler consolidation as part of the reason for the deaths of Details, Mirabella and Life magazines.
The newly concentrated power of the wholesalers is a humbling reminder to publishers that whatever their pretensions, they must fight for shelf space, just like Kleenex, canned hams and Iceberg lettuce in that most brutal arena where 44 percent of all magazines are now sold: supermarkets. There, in fact, magazines that do not sell are given the same shelf life as bananas and milk.
Publishers are trying to adjust to the post-consolidation scenario. They are finding it harder to get their less successful titles onto those retail racks and wholesalers are demanding better deals from them. The Department of Justice investigation has begun to focus in recent months on the large wholesalers, in part to determine if there is any evidence of collusion between the players to keep their costs down, which would violate antitrust laws.
But Mr. Anderson's take on the situation is as different from most of the publishers as the view from his front door is from the view on the 11th floor executive suites of the Conde Nast building in Times Square. And neither side seems to agree on what the solution is.
Mr. Anderson, like other wholesalers, says he is being squeezed by the large retailers to offer more service and better prices. The wholesalers say they are finding that where their gross profit on each copy sold was once around 25 percent, it is now usually less than 20 percent.
And too many magazines are being published for the dwindling retail racks available: there are about 4,700 titles now, as opposed to about 1,300 25 years ago, Mr. Anderson said. He said publishers are printing about 1.2 billion copies a year that go straight to shredders -- without ever seeing the fluorescent light of a retail store. They are known as "premature returns" because the retail outlets, pressed for rack space, will not even let them in the door, wasting the wholesalers resources.
"You could say it is a bit of a mess right now," Mr. Anderson said of the entire distribution system, as he munched on a ham and melted cheese sandwich at The Emerald Coast Cafe in Florence.
John Harrington, the publisher of the New Single Copy, a newsletter about magazine distribution, wrote in a report in July that the industry is "on the verge of collapsing."
"The distribution system is now economically fragile," Mr. Harrington said last week. Mr. Harrington, who once headed the wholesalers' trade group, the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, said of the large wholesalers: "These are the kinds of smart companies that at some point are going to say, 'Do I see a light at the end of the tunnel? Will we make money on this ever?' And if they do not, they will get out. And where will the industry be?"
The major wholesalers all say they are losing money on magazine distribution. But they have the cushion of owning other profitable businesses. (The other major wholesalers are the News Group, which is operated by the Jim Pattison Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, with about 25 percent of the market; the Chas. Levy Circulating Company of Chicago, with about 17 percent; and the Hudson News Company of North Bergen, N.J., with about 10 percent.)
The Anderson Corporation, a privately held company, has been in the periodical distribution business since it was founded in 1917. It also owns Books-A-Million, the third largest bookstore chain in the United States, an entertainment novelty company, and the largest fireworks distribution company in the U.S. (Mr. Anderson has spent so much time in China, where the fireworks are manufactured, that he may be the only resident of Florence who can order "a cold beer, please" in Mandarin.) Anderson is a very closely held family business and keeps its officers in the family, too: Mr. Anderson's nephew, Charlie, is the chief executive of Anderson News Group.
The wholesaler landscape, which scarcely changed from 1917 until the 1990's, underwent a swift transformation in 1995 that mirrored the consolidation among the major retail chains. Safeway announced that it would stop dealing with dozens of small wholesalers to supply its national chain, and preferred to deal with only one. The other big retailers, like Wal-Mart, followed suit, creating, the wholesalers argue, an intensely competitive environment in which companies battled each other to see who could offer the retailers the cheapest deal. Anderson, one of the bigger players, survived. In 1995, when there were about 180 wholesalers, Anderson had 6 percent of the market. Now, with only a handful of players, it has almost 40 percent.
In turn, the wholesalers have gone back to the publishers to help them eat up some of the lost margins. But the publishers fear a squeeze on their own profit. And since the big retailers and the big wholesalers -- the two entities that control the retail flow of the majority of magazines to consumers -- focus on the blockbuster titles, like People, In Style or Good Housekeeping -- many smaller publishers have found themselves squeezed out of some popular spots.
Mr. Anderson said that between pressure from retailers to deliver good deals and pressure from publishers to distribute too many titles too cheaply wholesalers are living in a non-profitable purgatory.
"We went from a profitable to an unprofitable business," Mr. Anderson said. "In order to recover our profitability we had two choices. We were not able to increase our gross margins, so we had to decrease our operating expenses."
This, he said, forced him to stop sending trucks to smaller retailers, like craft stores and out-of-the-way general stores.
That move aggravated smaller publishers who depend on every sale they could get. And in an attempt to bolster their bottom lines, Anderson and the News Group instituted programs that have fired up even more controversy among the small publishers. In 1999, Anderson instituted a two-tiered system to distribute magazines.
Anderson split its list of about 4,700 magazines -- into two parts. The top 1,700 titles, which represent about 97 percent of the company's sales, are handled through the company's network of nearly 50 full-scale distribution centers. The remaining titles, if they chose to stay with Anderson, would be remanded to less efficient facilities and charged additional handling fees.
And last November, the News Group also started a program that separated core and non-core titles. The 1,400 titles that provided it with 94 percent of its sales revenue continue to receive distribution as usual. The other 1,600 titles could still be distributed by News Group but would require additional handling charges.
Small publishers were angered by the plans. "They really started to discriminate against our smaller colleagues," John R. MacArthur Jr., the publisher of Harper's magazine, said.
Norman Jacobs, the president of the Century Publishing Company in Illinois, which publishes 10 small magazines like Cruise Travel, said that he canceled his contracts with Anderson, but recently renegotiated his agreement because there are so few wholesalers available with which to do business. Even after that, he said, it is just a "break-even" situation for his magazines on the Anderson racks.
But Mr. Anderson said his room for profit is exceedingly slim. Most publishers, like Time Inc., Conde Nast or Hearst Magazines have an integrated national distributor arm -- like Time Distribution Services or COMAG, the company shared by Hearst and Conde Nast. Those companies sell magazines to the wholesalers at what is often around a 35 percent discount. They are shipped at the publisher's cost to the wholesaler's distribution depot. The wholesaler pays the national distributor, who in turn pays the publisher. With a successful magazine like People, he said, he will only make 10 cents for every copy he handles -- even when the magazine is sold to the consumer for about $3.20. Even with a successful magazine like People, he still has to bear the cost of handling unsold 2.6 copies for each one sold.
Still, that is profitable. The problems arise when the same discount applies to poorer-selling magazines that eat up his resources and on which he only make 2 cents per copy sold.
"And that just don't work, hoss," he said, poised over a spread sheet in his office, a pencil tucked behind his ear.
A key issue is that large publishers do not agree that they ought to give bigger discounts to wholesalers. Richard Jacobsen, the president of Time Inc.'s retail sales and marketing, said that the solution lies elsewhere.
"Is it as simple as me giving him more margin?" he asked. "No. Is it about me trying to simplify the activities he has to perform better and at a lower cost, and we can do that together? Maybe. But whatever we do on the economic side has to be sustainable. It cannot be something that unravels again in two years."
Some publishers have considered hiring so-called "category managers," who would monitor how many copies of Fortune, for example, sell best in which Wal-Mart, and who would cultivate close relationships with wholesalers.
On his side, Mr. Anderson said he has tried other ways to get publishers to see the error of their ways. He sees all those extra copies that never get sold as a form of overblown institutional egomania.
"The publishers are scared," he said. "They see that guy printing this amount, and they figure, well, just in case, we ought to print as many. But what they do not realize is all that overprinting costs us in shipping and handling. And the magazines are just destroyed anyway."
His solution was to buy a La-Z-Boy recliner, and set it up in front of the Anderson shredder in Birmingham, where literally tons of magazines are shredded every day. "And I called publishers in New York and I said, 'Want to come down and watch as we destroy tens of thousands of tons of your magazines?' "
He paused. "Of course, none of them came," he said. "As I said, New York is far away."

HEADLINE: Beyond Tans and Tinsel;
A New Los Angeles Museum Show Seeks to Smash California Cliches

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22

 BODY:
A surfboard from the forgettable 1964 movie "Ride the Wild Surf" rests in a corner of one gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Another gallery displays plaintive visions of Mexicans in California by 1930's muralists like Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and David Alfaro Siqueiros. A third shows harrowing photographs documenting the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
Nearby are lavish impressionist-style paintings from the early 20th century of the breaking fog in Santa Barbara and the moonrise over San Diego Bay. Stark and emotional photographs by Dorothea Lange of Depression-era migrant mothers and factory workers are steps from a gallery displaying a 1998 Playboy magazine with "The Babes of Baywatch" on the cover. 
 The culture of California -- from the serious to the silly, from the dynamic and the adventurous to the bigoted and the violent -- is the subject of an enormous landmark exhibition that opened today at the museum. Called "Made in California: Art, Image and Identity, 1900-2000," the show is not only the largest in the museum's history but also perhaps its most provocative.
The exhibition offers what the museum calls a revisionist view of the state and its cultural legacy, a legacy that has traditionally centered on the raw and lavishly beautiful vistas in the north, coupled with the Southern California world of sunny beaches, beautiful bodies and the glamour and tawdriness of Hollywood. Six years in the planning, the show also encompasses the art and the issues of the state's growing Latino and Asian populations as well as the political and social dynamism that gave rise to various movements in Northern California, ranging from the Black Panthers and hippie culture to gay rights. The exhibition also includes some of the more corrosive elements of California history, including photographs of 1,000 Mexican families being forcibly removed from their community in 1959 to make way for a new stadium for the transplanted Brooklyn Dodgers.
"They're very brave to have taken on a more inclusive and expansive interpretation of California, and in that sense the show is remarkable," said Karin Higa, director of the curatorial and exhibitions department at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, at a private opening attended by artists and other professionals on Thursday night. "It's bound to come under criticism because the more inclusive they are, the more you realize what's missing from standard exhibitions and interpretations of California art and culture."
Ms. Higa said that the Asian-American experience in California, generally ignored in other exhibitions, had been integrated into this one.
Paul J. Karlstrom, a specialist in California who is regional director of the archives of American art at the Smithsonian Institution, said the show was bound to result in omissions and hurt feelings.
"There'll be artists who'll be disappointed," said Mr. Karlstrom, based at the Huntington Library in Pasadena. "That's inevitable." But he added that the museum's goal was all-inclusive.
"Instead of gathering a list of the 100 great hits in California art history, it's trying to seriously examine what distinguishes the art and culture of this state," he said.
Michael Dear, director of the Southern California Studies Center at the University of Southern California, said he walked into a gallery on the 60's in California and burst out laughing. "A lot of people were laughing," he said. "It was a vibrant display of beach culture, of the cars, all these things that comprised the 60's. There's everything there from high art to public art to stuff from the street, if you like."
What makes the show resonant, he said, is that it deals with the political, social and economic fabric of California as well as its art and culture.
"Made in California" includes more than 800 works of art -- paintings, sculpture, photographs, furniture and costumes -- and 400 documents, ranging from anti-Japanese propaganda posters from 1941 to a copy of the first paperback edition of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" from 1958. Museum officials declined to discuss the cost of the project, which was underwritten by the S. Mark Taper Foundation.
The show is divided into five segments, each covering 20 years. For visitors the dates that the exhibition will be up are a bit confusing. The first four sections, covering 1900 to 1980, opened today. The final section, covering 1980 to 2000, will open on Nov. 12. Although the closing date for most of the show is Feb. 25, the first section, 1900 to 1920, will remain up through March 18.
Stephanie Barron, the museum's vice president for education and public programs and its senior curator of modern and contemporary art, acknowledged that the exhibition would probably stir debate.
"Everyone will come with the expectation of what the show could be and should be," said Ms. Barron, who organized it. "It's inevitable that we'll delight people at times and surprise them and confuse them and irritate them. But that's O.K. That's what an idea show is about."
As she spoke, she walked past a gallery displaying bathing outfits and zoot suits of the 1940's as well as the original Barbie doll. Not far away was David Hockney's classic canvas "The Splash," one of that British-born artist's wittier images (circa 1966) of lawns and swimming pools.
"There are two themes that seem to dominate the century in California," Ms. Barron said. "One is the dialogue with the land, the beautiful rolling hills and majestic landscapes, or urbanism and suburbia or the blight. The other is California's ongoing relationship with Asia and Latin America."
She pointed to the unusual mix of video monitors that show archival films of figures as diverse as Mario Savio, the leader of Berkeley's Free Speech movement, to former Gov. Ronald Reagan to hippies congregating in San Francisco. Visitors can also view scenes from film noir set in Los Angeles. And then there are paintings by artists like Ed Ruscha, Billy Al Bengston, Edward Kienholz and Judy Chicago that seem to embrace -- and perhaps mock -- Southern California culture.
One of her concerns, Ms. Barron said, was whether critics and the artistic community would accept a mix of high and low culture in a show in an established Los Angeles museum. "Everyone was prepared to put up examples of fashion," she said, "but it's a whole different thing to put a surfboard in there."
"It's going to be disturbing for some people," she added. "On the other hand, I'm sure people who will be attracted to the popular-culture aspect of it might have a moment, I hope, to look at fine art."
The idea developed in 1994 when Ms. Barron, together with Ilene Susan Fort, curator of American art, and Sheri Bernstein, the show's exhibition associate, met with other museum officials to create a millennium project that would deal with the culture and image of Southern California. Meetings with historians, writers, architects and artists led the museum to expand the exhibition.
The reason was simple: the San Francisco area dominated the artistic and social worlds of California in the early part of the century, and the social and political ferment there in the 60's and 70's influenced the state's -- as well as the nation's -- culture and politics.
"The idea was to explore the image of California but not just the one that is known," Ms. Fort said. She added: "We wanted to avoid the traditional boosterism promoted by the white culture and the white artists, especially in the early part of the century. We wanted to see other interpretations of California and how they differed from white myths."
The result is that some relatively unknown Asian, Latino and black artists and photographers are represented in the show, and some well-known Californians like Clyfford Still, Alson Skinner Clark, John Alton and Emerson Wolfler are not shown.
"This is a thematic show; it takes risks, and people may not understand why we put in certain works of art but leave out others," Ms. Fort said.
The show handles Hollywood culture as a glamour industry -- with photographs by George Hurrell of Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford, among others -- as well as a source of postwar political tensions, with newsreels of blacklisted writers appearing before Congress.
Developing the show thrust the museum into new territory because the program was not shaped by one or two people, but by more than a dozen curators.
Kevin Starr, a historian and State Librarian of California who served on one of the show's advisory panels, was an early opponent of focusing the show on Southern California.
"To me this exhibit is exhilarating," he said. "It challenges us to ask, 'Is there a California culturally?' " Mr. Starr said that the cliche that California was culturally barren was absurd. "The sheer range and variety of California is extraordinary, and that's what this show addresses too," he said. "It has the sixth largest economy in the world. The state, in many ways, is the distilled essence and conflicts of America itself. This show is trying to reassemble the imaginative visual materials of California into some coherence. And that's a big challenge and a big task."
What gives the show additional significance, he said, is that it tacitly underscores the power of Los Angeles and Southern California over the rest of the state and perhaps even the nation. "It bespeaks the maturity of Los Angeles and the dominance of Los Angeles in the cultural mosaic of California," Mr. Starr said. "This is using a Los Angeles-based show to define the entire culture of the state. This was traditionally done by the Bay area. This is the first time that Los Angeles has, in fact, taken the lead."

HEADLINE: Time, AOL and Early Illusions

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
As the wedding day moves closer for America Online and Time Warner, it is worth asking whether this couple seems as right for each other as they did when the engagement was announced in January.
As in many engagements, the partners were seeking different things. AOL's motives seemed pragmatic while Time Warner's tended to be romantic. 
 AOL hoped to link up with a respectable blue-chip corporation that could help it settle down and get out of the fast lane. Time Warner, by contrast, hoped that its rich and debonair suitor would provide more excitement and the fashionable trappings of success that would impress Wall Street. While both may yet find what they seeking in this marriage, given the events of the last nine months, AOL's satisfaction seems more likely.
For one thing, the Internet may not be such a lucrative arena after all. America Online, which had made quite a bundle selling big advertising contracts to swashbuckling dot-coms flush with venture capital, is now realizing that many of those clients can be found lining up in front of bankruptcy court -- if they can be found at all.
And the plans for a broadband dream house, bringing America Online's Internet service and Time Warner's cable networks under one roof, may be impaired by surprisingly tough zoning rules imposed by federal antitrust officials.
Then there is the matter of dowry.
The AOL stock that Time Warner shareholders would receive was worth $110.62 for each Time Warner share when the deal was announced -- 70 percent more than the $64.75 at which Time Warner's stock was trading at the time. The AOL stock value to be exchanged has since fallen to $69.86 -- about 8 percent above the predeal price of a Time Warner share and hardly the sort of premium that a company with the pedigree of Time Warner might expect.
In other pairings, such as the Terra Networks acquisition of Lycos, a sharp drop in the buyer's stock has prompted an increase in the number of shares offered. But no provision for such renegotiation was included in the AOL-Time Warner prenuptial agreement. Indeed, merger experts say the contract is so tough that there is almost no way for either party to get out now, even if they wanted to.
Since the deal has received approval by both companies' shareholders and European regulators, what remains is clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. The companies expect to receive these by the end of the year.
Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, insists that he is as committed to the merger as ever, in bull market and bear. And he said he did not regret the lack of a provision in the agreement that would adjust the ratio of 1.5 AOL shares for every Time Warner share to compensate for a drop in AOL's share price.
"Whether AOL's stock is $45 or $95, I stand by the exchange ratio," Mr. Levin said in a brief interview after Time Warner announced its earnings on Wednesday.
Indeed, for Mr. Levin, analysts say, the point of this deal was never simply to get the most money for Time Warner shareholders now. Rather, it was to use the combination with America Online as a catalyst in solving some of his toughest strategic and management problems. Of course, the deal promised a fast way to adapt the company's print and television assets for Internet use, something Time Warner had found frustratingly difficult despite years of trying. And even though Time Warner is more than triple AOL's size by revenue, AOL is still growing so quickly the combined company should be far zippier than Time Warner is alone.
More important in many ways, the far-reaching changes such a deal would presumably cause holds the promise of shaking up and integrating a company that was largely a federation of fiefs -- Time Warner's movie studio, the cable systems, the magazine business and so on.
Executives of both companies tried last week to show investors the potential for selling advertising to their existing clients by noting that of the 100 biggest advertisers on AOL, the top 100 in Time Inc. magazines and the top 100 on Turner cable networks, only four were on more than one list. Of course that may say as much about the lack of coordination at Time Warner as it describes an opportunity for the new company.
"There are a lot of reasons we didn't do it before, but those reasons have evaporated," Mr. Levin said of his company's previous inability to coordinate ad sales. At the merged company, he said, there will be a new operating committee of top division executives charged with finding ways for the divisions to work together better.
As for America Online and its chairman, Stephen M. Case, the deal was in many ways as conservative and defensive as it was bold to Mr. Levin. Mr. Case was worried that the balance of power on the Internet would shift from those that simply aggregated content created by others -- as AOL and Yahoo have done -- to the content creators like Time Warner. And Time Warner's cable systems would guarantee AOL a stake in the market for high-speed Internet connections.
But most important, the deal allowed Mr. Case to capitalize on the remarkable opportunity provided by the then-soaring stock market and use his rich stock to buy a top-tier company with solid assets on terms that might not be available again.
So more than nine months later, how well does the deal meet these various objectives, given the more hostile environment the companies now find themselves in?
The only negative surprise for AOL has been the unexpected regulatory scrutiny, which might impair its ability to profit from high-speed services using Time Warner's cable systems. European regulators have already forced Time Warner to pull back from a proposed combination of its Warner Music unit and the EMI Group of Britain.
The discussions in Washington are heated, but the worst case for AOL and Time Warner is a regulatory regimen that forces it to let competing Internet service providers use the combined company's cable systems on terms that are not quite to its liking. Analysts and executives of the two companies say such a requirement would hardly be serious enough to scuttle the deal or even significantly affect the profitability of the combined company.
Whether Time Warner can achieve a cultural transformation is unknowable and depends largely on how the executives of the two companies get along. So far there have been no unexpected resignations or other visible signs of discord.
The question that investors wrestled with last week, however, was how to evaluate the real potential of AOL's advertising business, given the lower market, especially in with dot-com companies.
Some analysts said the fears were overblown and a combined AOL-Time Warner would have a diversified base of advertisers and would weather a downturn better than smaller competitors.
"In the year after an election and the Olympics, it's no surprise that advertising growth would slow from 18 percent to 8 percent," said Chris Dixon of PaineWebber. "But 8 percent growth is still faster than the economy as a whole, and the big media companies like Time Warner, Disney and Viacom will get more than their fair share."
What is more, the dynamics of America Online's core Internet service business are far better in this environment than those of a purely advertising-based Internet company like Yahoo. To the surprise of many who had written off the AOL service as overpriced and a dinosaur, the company has been able to add subscribers and maintain its $22 monthly fee, even as its telecommunications costs fall 18 percent a year. Advertising has grown to one-third of AOL's revenue but it is still the gravy on top of the subscription fees.
What about the exchange ratio for the companies' stocks? That is essentially a zero-sum game, because it governs what portion of the company is allocated to Time Warner's shareholders and what portion to AOL's.
Whether he was lucky or smart, Mr. Case struck the deal with Time Warner at a time it would give him the most advantage. Indeed, AOL shareholders walk away owning 54 percent of the combined company.
 Consider a back-of-the envelope calculation to see how different the terms might be if the deal had been agreed to on Friday. If Time Warner's stock had performed as the average media-company stock has this year, it would have closed on Friday at $51.15. (In fact, it ended at $69.91.) AOL's shares, assuming they fell as much as the average Internet company, would be at $37.61. (They did close at $46.55.)
The question is if AOL were bidding today, what sort of premium it would have to pay. With its stock down, a 70 percent premium for Time Warner's shares may not be expected. If AOL paid a more typical 40 percent premium, that would be a price of $71.61 for each Time Warner share.
To reach a bid of that level, the company would then need to exchange 1.9 of its shares for each Time Warner share. With that deal, Time Warner shareholders would wind up in control, with 52 percent of the company.
Analysts who cover Time Warner say they do not see this gap as a black mark against Mr. Levin. At the existing exchange ratio, said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, the deal enhances the per-share cash flow of Time Warner stock.
But Mr. Wolzien has a much cruder way to reassure himself that the deal is not so bad. "Time Warner's stock is up this year," he said, "when almost every other media company is down."

Fear of Cutbacks Rattles Papers In Philadelphia

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
By almost any business measure, the Knight Ridder newspapers in Philadelphia would be deemed a success. Since 1995, profit margins at The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News have more than doubled, reaching close to 19 percent after years of single-digit doldrums.
Good? Absolutely. Good enough? Not for long. For 2001, the target margin is 21 percent. And now there is talk about 5 percent budget cuts at the papers, if not more. Anxiety is as plentiful as oxygen in The Inquirer's newsroom. 
 The anxiety on North Broad Street is hardly unique in the industry. Publicly traded companies like Gannett, The New York Times, the Tribune Company, McClatchy and A. H. Belo all pay some attention to the Wall Street analysts whose judgments push their stock prices around.
Most big-city papers no longer have strong local rivals left to battle for advertising and circulation, so publishers and owners now see their competition more and more as the financial results posted by other large papers and chains across the country.
At the newspapers of Knight Ridder's rivals, profit margins are rising, analysts say, like skyscrapers in a boom town -- into the low 20's (at The Baltimore Sun), to 30 (at The Chicago Tribune). The Tribune Company, which owns those two newspapers, doesn't even have the highest profit margins. some Gannett newspapers have achieved margins in the mid-30-percent range, analysts say.
For the analysts who follow the newspaper industry, profit margins are the metric that is never ignored. By that measure, single-digit returns that Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the parent of both papers, achieved in the mid-1990's made it "a laggard" and an "embarrassment," analysts said last week.
Rather than live in anyone's financial shadow, Knight Ridder executives felt they needed, if not parity, at least steady improvement in Philadelphia. But the broadsheet Inquirer and the smaller tabloid Daily News, since summer, have been caught between a local advertising downturn and a 14 percent uptick in newsprint prices, which are expected to rise by $18 million in 2001. Making 19 percent in 2000 will be hard. Making 21 percent in 2001 without budget cuts, probably impossible.
The Inquirer's journalists know the drill -- buyouts, cutbacks, retrenchment, defections by high-profile reporters and editors. They also know things are not as bad as in 1995, when a buyout cut 7 percent of the staff -- more than 200 jobs. This time, the buyout goal is a 3 percent reduction in staff, or about 100 people. Overall the budget cuts at both newspapers are likely to be 5 percent to 7 percent range.
Some of The Inquirer's rank-and-file journalists have a grudging understanding of the financial realities, and many say that the best of The Inquirer's journalism today is as good as it has ever been -- though a few dispute this point. But they still fear for the paper's 25-year tradition of politician-pounding, institution-busting journalism. This muckraking is the yardstick many of its journalists hold it to. How often, some reporters ask, can the place can go through these budget and staff shakedowns and still keep its journalistic ambitions intact?
"The scope of what's going on is not nearly as big as in 1995," said David Zucchino, an heir to the paper's prize-winning tradition (he won a Pulitzer prize in 1989 and was a finalist in 1985 and 1995) who continues to write or edit ambitious projects. On the other hand, some people in the newsroom are concluding that there will be no end to the cutbacks.
"Probably the worst thing about this," Mr. Zucchino said, "is that we hit a 19 percent profit margin, which seems to me fantastic, and it's not good enough."
Mr. Zucchino and other editors and reporters argue that this year's work -- like a wrenching series on the long-term health effects of a toxic waste fire -- shows The Inquirer has not lost a step. Those who disagree tend to remain anonymous.
But the new pressures are a reminder of how long it has been since The Inquirer enjoyed special cachet inside Knight-Ridder, getting a pass on some of the financial requirements imposed on its smaller cousins. The Philadelphia newspapers have traditionally contributed more revenue than any of the company's other 30 newspapers, generating close to 19 percent of the chain's total revenue.
Now, their operating profit margins are approaching those of other papers in the chain, like The San Jose Mercury News.
So of course Wall Street has taken notice. On Tuesday, when Knight Ridder executives talked to analysts about the company's third-quarter earnings, one of the first questions -- after a discussion of the prospects for Knight Ridders's online ventures -- was about profit margins.
Peter P. Appert of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, asked, "Are you confident of your ability to sustain newspaper margins" in the coming year?
P. Anthony Ridder, the company's chief executive, responded quickly: "Not only to sustain them. We're working to improve them."
The importance of margins, of course, is nothing new. But, said Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, revenue growth was easier to achieve in the industry in the 1970's and 1980's, when newspapers dominated local media markets.
Back when advertisers had fewer options, he said, circulation was reaching a historic peak, and newspaper advertising departments raised their rates at twice the rate of inflation. Newspaper executives, Mr. Beebe said, "did not have to worry a whole lot about their cost structure." Even when competition from catalogues, direct-mail, and inserts grew during those years, one morning newspaper after another -- The Inquirer among them -- found themselves in a monopoly position, as their afternoon competitors died. Then came the market crash of 1987, accelerating the death of major retail businesses and tougher competition from local television news programs. The newsprint price spike of the mid-1990's hit as the industry was finally shaking off its hangover from a wrenching recession.
Then the Internet came along.
Competition for investor favor grew keener. Not only could Wall Street choose between a dozen newspaper companies, investors' other options just kept increasing as initial public offerings multiplied, and old industries like telecommunications developed new dynamism. And from one industry to the next, companies whose stock prices lagged tended to become takeover targets.
"At the end of the day," Mr. Beebe said, "Tony Ridder is trying to manage a very, very delicate balance: between pleasing the public markets, which are fickle and demanding and difficult to please, and doing the right thing for the quality of his news."
"Sometimes you have to trade off economic benefit for journalism," he added. And sometimes, investors and analysts will demand better margins --- or migrate to those, like the Gannett Company, which consistently achieve such profit levels.
In Philadelphia, Bob Hall, the publisher of both The Inquirer (weekday circulation 405,000) and The Daily News (weekday circulation 161,000) has two options -- persuading Mr. Ridder to relax his proposed profit-margin goals, or finding a way to meet them. But he is working in a region whose economy has grown slowly in recent years, and has, like other markets, lost some major retail advertisers to bankruptcy. This year, after two or three years of strong performance in the high-margin help-wanted ads, The Inquirer's recruitment advertising began to dwindle.
That, combined with the decline in dot-com advertising, helped push down the newspapers' advertising revenues about $17 million below the goal of more than $560 million. Mr. Hall is putting into place a plan to offer advertisers options like fine-grained, targeted placements across his nine-county market or the ability to reach every home in the market, if they choose -- an approach called total market coverage. But his older, dependable revenue dwindled before he could tap this new source.
The advertising initiative was one of a variety of ways the newspapers have been rethinking their strategy. The Inquirer has focused on hyperlocal coverage.
In Southern New Jersey and Chester County the existing, zoned local news sections have been refined, pumped up with more high school sports and opinion pages, and heavily marketed as a "paper within a paper."
The effort has yielded circulation gains. How about the journalism? Robert J. Rosenthal, the editor, said: "There are fine stories in there. It's not schlock."
The downside is heavy production costs, which raise the marginal cost of every new subscription gained. That has made some of The Inquirer's business executives wary of expanding the initiative to other regions, like Montgomery County. The final decision belongs to Mr. Hall. He will not tip his hand but he speaks of the "paper within a paper" initiative in bullish terms.
That may come as a relief to some newsroom editors, who are frustrated with the new hesitation by some of their counterparts on the business side. They were once skeptical of the initiative, and some senior reporters did not enjoy reliving their youths at suburban zoning meetings. But with the project paying off in circulation gains, more editors supported it. So now they find it disconcerting to see its further expansion called into question.
Lots of things are being called into question, and not just for economic reasons. In January, well before the revenue leached away, Mr. Rosenthal launched a group of high-ranking editors on a project to examine how the paper could use its journalists better. "These were not budget-driven meetings," Mr. Rosenthal said. "We talked a lot about the reader and his time demands."
As a result, the entire Sunday newspaper is being rethought, Mr. Rosenthal said, with an eye to consolidating a number of entertainment and other features, along with the television listings, into the Sunday magazine. The magazine, recently a persistent money-loser, would expand to 70 to 80 pages, "with some of our best Sunday content," Mr. Rosenthal said.
As those options were being discussed, the budget troubles hit. After the revenue shortfall and the challenge of meeting the 2001 goal became clear, Mr. Hall this month announced a buyout proposal.
Several Inquirer editors said the fiscal stringency provides a useful spur in the effort to set priorities. But they could not resist asking why it is being imposed after Knight Ridder has reported 11 straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. And some journalists are nervous about the future.
Craig McCoy, a reporter, said, "There's been a lineage, a tradition, of real quality journalism." What will happen, he wondered, if the news executives, like Mr. Rosenthal, who come out of that tradition, become defeated by the push for financial improvement. My biggest worry," he said, is that this demand for return would lead someday to a management team here" that would massively cut back on the editorial product."
But Mr. Rosenthal, the editor, said that such worries, while understandable, were unfounded. Whatever the financial load is he added, "I'm going to do my damndest to make sure we can carry it" while keeping The Inquirer's brand of journalism intact.

HEADLINE: Mitchell Sviridoff, 81, Dies; Renewal Chief

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Mitchell Sviridoff, a national leader in urban social policy and philanthropy who played an important role over three decades in developing strategies for lifting people out of poverty and reviving decaying neighborhoods, died early Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 81.
The cause of death was kidney failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Sviridoff, known as Mike, had several careers. He was an assembly plant worker, a labor organizer and the architect and administrator of antipoverty programs, both in his native New Haven and later in New York. He was a Ford Foundation official and a professor of urban policy at the New School.
His most important contribution was in the field of community development.
An early and enthusiastic proponent of grass-roots organizations as the engine for rebuilding poor neighborhoods in places like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Mr. Sviridoff persuaded foundations, government agencies and corporations to recognize such groups and provide them with millions of dollars.
He was the first president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, an organization that pools technical and financial resources to help so-called community development corporations create jobs and build housing for low-income residents.
Unlike many champions of the poor, Mr. Sviridoff was a pragmatist without a political agenda, a trait that enhanced his effectiveness in corporate boardrooms.
"He always wanted to figure out the most practical and sensible way of getting something done," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group, and a regular in the weekly poker games that Mr. Sviridoff used to hold in his apartment.
Mr. Sviridoff was born in New Haven on Nov. 4, 1918. After graduating from Hillhouse High School, he went to a vocational school. At 19, he took a job at an aircraft parts plant in Stratford, Conn. That led to a succession of posts in the labor movement, and he eventually became president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. Despite his lack of a college education, he was appointed president of the New Haven Board of Education.
In the early 1960's, Mr. Sviridoff worked for a State Department program that administered aid to Latin America. But what people were calling the crisis of the cities had captured the public spotlight, and Richard C. Lee, the mayor of New Haven, summoned Mr. Sviridoff home.
Two years before President Lyndon B. Johnson declared the war on poverty, Mr. Sviridoff became the executive director of Community Progress Inc., an antipoverty program in New Haven that was set up with a Ford Foundation grant. In its first 30 months, the program found employment for 1,500 people and became a national model.
Rather than trying to supplant community groups, Mr. Sviridoff tried to help them achieve their goals. He and his staff were so adept at writing grant proposals to federal agencies that people in New York began referring to New Haven's "magic at getting money." In 1965, the program received one-third as much federal antipoverty money as New York, a city 50 times its size.
By then, New York had a mayor, John V. Lindsay, who wanted his antipoverty efforts to win similar notice. Mr. Sviridoff was recruited to study a hodgepodge of programs dealing with welfare, employment training, youth programs and the poor and consolidate them in the Human Resources Administration. In 1966, Mr. Sviridoff became the agency's first administrator.
It did not take him long to discover that New York was not New Haven, and that its problems were too big to be solved by the neat organizational charts and other strategies that had worked so well in Connecticut. His staff rebelled. Nearly 200 frustrated employees protested in a memo to Mr. Lindsay that the agency was so chaotic and the working conditions so intolerable that the human resources agency should be disbanded.
Only nine months after assuming his new duties with the city, the Ford Foundation offered Mr. Sviridoff a position as a vice president for national affairs, and, much to the chagrin of the mayor, he accepted it.
In later years, some people said Mr. Sviridoff had repaid the city when Stanley Brezenoff, who had been Mr. Sviridoff's assistant at the Ford Foundation and was one of many New Yorkers in public service who regarded him as their mentor, became the city's human resources administrator.
"I think that ought to settle the score once and for all," Mr. Sviridoff said when his protege's appointment was announced in 1979. "I think that the city is getting the better part of the bargain."
By that time, Mr. Sviridoff had become disenchanted with the unwieldy structure he had helped design, saying that such efforts were doomed because of turf battles, bureaucratic inertia and other obstacles.
At the Ford Foundation, Mr. Sviridoff helped nurture a wide variety of programs to address the problems of the cities, some of which were later spun off, including the Vera Institute for Criminal Justice; the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a social policy research organization; and the Police Foundation.
"He was extraordinarily supportive of innovative work,"said Herbert Sturz, the founding director of the Vera Institute.
One innovation was the Local Initiatives Support Corporation. When a Ford trustee asked Mr. Sviridoff what he would do with $25 million to spend on declining cities, he answered by recalling a suggestion by Franklin A. Thomas, then a Ford trustee (and later its president). Mr. Thomas, who had run the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, had proposed identifying 100 communities with promising self-help groups and getting money to them.
In a year, the program was up and running. In 1980, Mr. Sviridoff resigned from Ford to work full time for the local initiatives group.
"And the results speak for themselves," Mr. Sviridoff wrote recently. "Community development, something that in the 1970's and early 80's was really just a movement, is something we now quite properly call an industry."
During the last two decades, corporation officials say, they have raised $3 billion, money that has been used to produce more than 100,000 units of housing, more than 10 million square feet of commercial and industrial space, and projects like a Pathmark store in East Harlem, the neighborhood's first full-size supermarket in three decades.
In 1985, Mr. Sviridoff resigned from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation to teach at the New School for Social Research, where he was director of the Kaplan Center for New York City Affairs at the Milano Graduate School. He was also founder of the school's Community Development Research Center.
He had a steady stream of guests at the vacation home on Martha's Vineyard that he shared with his wife, Doris, whom he married in 1940. Until his recent illness, he swam and played tennis almost daily and often cooked for his friends.
The couple had two daughters, Karen Segal of Los Angeles, and Michele of New York, one grandchild and one great-grandchild.
At a 1985 party to celebrate his years of public service, Mr. Sviridoff recited lines from a poem by William Butler Yeats:
 God guard me from those thoughts
men think in the mind alone.
He that sings a lasting song
thinks in a marrow bone.
He said the lines expressed his own approach to helping people.
"That is the way I function," he told an interviewer after the party. "I do things that do not seem logical at the beginning and sometimes fail. But when they succeed, they tend to be lasting songs."

HEADLINE: Chinese Official Beats Albright to North Korea

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 22

 BODY:
China's defense minister flew to North Korea today for "friendly talks," just hours before Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was due to arrive in the North Korean capital.
Minister Chi Haotian was accompanied by senior military officials and will spend five days in North Korea, according to the New China News Agency. 
 The visit had been long planned -- its official purpose is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of China's entry into the Korean War, which falls on Wednesday. But the sudden departure this weekend was unexpected, perhaps related to Dr. Albright's impending arrival.
The visit is "intended to improve the existing friendship and cooperation between the two countries," the agency said.
In recent months, China's leaders have served as quiet mentors to Kim Jong Il, the formerly reclusive North Korean leader, as he has sought to expand his foreign ties and perhaps loosen his country's rigid planned economy.
Outwardly, the Chinese have been extremely supportive of his efforts to establish diplomatic ties with Western nations, including the United States. "China welcomes any progress in the relations between the Democratic People's Republic of China and the U.S.," Zhu Bangzao, a foreign ministry spokesman, said last week.
But some Chinese military analysts have worried about the possibility that better relations between North and South Korea -- perhaps eventual reunification -- could give American troops stationed in South Korea free access to the Chinese border.
Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, China has been the only major power to maintain friendly ties with Pyongyang. And despite a long history of "socialist brotherhood," the Chinese leaders in recent years have clearly grown weary of supporting a government that could not support itself.
Foreign health experts say that more than 1.5 million people have died as a result of food shortages in North Korea over the past six years. Many of the country's factories are at a standstill because it has little gas or electricity.
China is a major donor of coal and corn to North Korea. And, in the past few years, more than 100,000 North Koreans have sneaked over the common border into China in search of work, food and money, putting a strain on the local Chinese economy.

HEADLINE: Buffalo, Often Butt of Jokes, Is Serious Senate Battleground

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Queen City is finally being treated like one, at least until Nov. 7.
The jokes -- about snow in June, the struggling Buffalo Bills, dat accent -- have been put in a lockbox. New York's candidates for the United States Senate have lavished attention and resources on this city and its suburbs, mindful of recent statewide campaigns that have established Buffalo and surrounding Erie County as an electoral touchstone. 
 Political analysts say that it would be very difficult for a Democrat to win statewide office without winning Erie, to compensate for the bedrock support Republicans can count on in the rest of upstate. So both candidates are trying to capitalize on the shifting, unpredictable political dynamics here, a classic bellwether "swing" area that, were it not for New York City, would be the dominant region of the state.
Although Democrats hold a 132,000-person margin over Republicans in voter registration, the county is filled with a sizable number of what were once called Reagan Democrats, working-class Catholics of Polish, Irish and Italian ancestry without a firm allegiance to either party.
Ed Kolenko is a registered Democrat who twice voted for Gov. George E. Pataki and is now leaning toward Hillary Rodham Clinton. "I trust what Hillary's saying more than Lazio," he said.
Peter Marini, a Democrat who has voted for Mr. Pataki, President Clinton, former Senator Bob Dole and last year, for Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, for senator, said he now leaned to Representative Rick A. Lazio. "I'm tired of the Clintons," he said. "Hillary is smart and I may go with her, but there is something about Lazio and new blood that I like."
With a laugh, he added, "And Lazio is Italian like me."
He was only half joking. Ethnic politics do play a big role here.
That is why Mr. Schumer two years ago brought his own Brooklyn sausage to a light-hearted taste test at the renowned Polish festival in Cheektowaga, a working-class Buffalo suburb that gets nearly as much attention from candidates as Buffalo.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Schumer, who won Erie County and the election in 1998, called his appearance at the festival a "breakthrough" event in that "it really made a splash."
"It said to voters: 'He gets it. He understands what is going on here.' You know if you do well in Erie you may not win upstate, but you certainly come close," Mr. Schumer said.
Mrs. Clinton, following that strategy, brought a Democratic Irish stalwart, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to a rally here the other night. "The Kennedys are gods up here in the Irish community," said Gerald M. Goldhaber, a professor at the State University at Buffalo who has conducted polling for Democratic and Republican candidates and is the president of Goldhaber Research Associates.
And Mr. Lazio is suddenly invoking his Italian heritage -- telling stories about his grandmother Rose's journey here decades ago -- at stop after stop, not just here but also in other Italian enclaves. (His schedule today included "Rigatoni With Rick" events in Rochester and Rome, N.Y.)
Recently, he posed for pictures with Bishop Henry J. Mansell of the Diocese of Buffalo, and with his bus blaring the Italian folk hit "Lazy Mary," dined at a "Rigatoni With Rick" event here the other week that his campaign claims drew more Democrats than Republicans.
He attended Mass this morning in nearby Sloan at St. Andrew Roman Catholic Church, which has a predominantly Polish congregation, and met with the editorial board of the Am-Pol Eagle, a newspaper geared toward Polish-American readers.
Both camps say that by Election Day they will have visited Erie County more than two dozen times since May, when they received their parties' nominations.
Both campaigns have saturated the airwaves here with commercials -- a recent Lazio ad included people wearing Buffalo Bills caps -- and say their internal polling shows they are running strongly here.
An independent poll of 400 likely voters in Erie and Niagara Counties, conducted by Goldhaber Research Associates, suggested that Mrs. Clinton was leading 50 to 36 percent, with 13 percent undecided. The poll, conducted Oct. 17 to 19 and released on Friday, had a margin of sampling error of 4.9 percentage points.
Some high-profile victories in recent years have cheered Republicans and, Mr. Goldhaber said, buttressed the theory that "people here don't vote party line, they vote economic issues."
In 1994, Mr. Pataki won Erie County by nearly 40,000 votes over Mario M. Cuomo, the first Republican gubernatorial victory since Nelson A. Rockefeller's. Mr. Pataki also won in 1998.
Republicans in the last decade have taken control of three prominent countywide offices -- county executive, comptroller and sheriff -- although Democrats have maintained a majority in the 17-seat County Legislature since 1982.
The victory of Joel A. Giambra as county executive last year in particular bears closer inspection.
Mr. Giambra, the former Buffalo comptroller, who had been a Democrat until the year before, when he switched parties, ousted a three-term Democrat, Dennis T. Gorski, by 54 to 43 percent.
He did so largely by a calculated appeal to ethnic Democrats, particularly Italians, who had flocked to unions and to the Democratic Party when Buffalo was a manufacturing powerhouse, but who lost their party allegiance as the steel and other industries went bust.
Mr. Giambra's television advertising stressed his concern over the economy, with spots depicting emotional farewells to young people forced to move out of the area for jobs. He deplored what he calls "the runway of tears" at the Buffalo airport, in keeping with his campaign slogan, "keep our kids."
"The Reagan Democrats were concerned about pocketbook issues," said the Erie County Republican chairman, Robert E. Davis, "and we were able to address pocketbook issues that Democrats recognized."
Mrs. Clinton, like Mr. Schumer, has seized on the economy as an issue here, unveiling a plan in February aimed at bringing relief to the area, and knocking Mr. Lazio at every turn for his more optimistic outlook on things. Her campaign has used a Buffalo News editorial to buttress commercials that said Mr. Lazio was "orbiting another planet" for his views on the economy, though Mr. Lazio has said his views have been misconstrued to suggest that he did not believe economic aid was needed.
"The issues piece is vital, here and the issue is the economy," said Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio. "It's astounding he hasn't changed his tune."
Mr. Davis, who helps to coordinate Mr. Lazio's campaigning in Erie County, said: "The issue has been so spun by the Clinton folks that we need to be a little bit more aggressive on these things. Lazio has had to spend more time defining what his plan is. Frankly, it's similar to 1994. It's not brain surgery here. Cut taxes and create jobs. We have direct mail pieces that address that. We need to build on that."
Asked if Mr. Lazio had enough time left to persuade people of his concern for the economy, Mr. Davis replied, "We don't have a choice, do we?"
Such sentiments arose the other night at a bar Mr. Lazio visited to watch the first game of the World Series. Rising property taxes have irritated many people to the point that they are itching for someone -- if not the mayor, then perhaps the United States senator -- to do something.
"Property taxes have to be lower so small businesses can come in here," said David W. Gacioch, 34, an independent who owns a property management company and is supporting Mr. Lazio.
Others had chosen their candidate based on other issues, though the fluid nature of their party affiliation was evident.
John Maney, 60, who worked as a police officer and correction officer in New York City before retiring, said he considered himself an "independent" registered Democrat. He had intended to vote for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose place Mr. Lazio took when the mayor dropped out for cancer treatment. Now, Mr. Maney favors Mrs. Clinton.
"I would've preferred Giuliani," he said. "I liked what he did in New York City. No one really knows Lazio, he's from the wrong end of the state for me now."
