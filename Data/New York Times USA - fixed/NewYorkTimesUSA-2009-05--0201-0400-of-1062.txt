HEADLINE: Obama Seeks a Global Health Plan Broader Than Bush's AIDS Effort

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama asked Congress on Tuesday to spend $63 billion over the next six years on a new, broader global health strategy that would reshape one of the signature foreign policy efforts of his predecessor, George W. Bush.
 Mr. Bush made combating global AIDS a centerpiece of his foreign agenda. The program he created -- the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar -- is regarded as one of his most significant achievements. But the plan Mr. Obama outlined Tuesday envisions a more far-reaching approach to global health that would focus not only on AIDS, but also on tropical diseases and other treatable and preventable illnesses that kill millions, many of them children, each year.
 ''We cannot simply confront individual preventable illnesses in isolation,'' the president said in a statement released by the White House that cited the swine flu outbreak as an example. ''The world is interconnected, and that demands an integrated approach to global health.'' 
 In announcing the request, the White House said Mr. Obama was seeking $51 billion to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria during the six years and $12 billion for other global health priorities. His budget proposal calls for $7.4 billion for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in 2010, an increase of $366 million over this year.
 But as a candidate, Mr. Obama promised to expand Pepfar ''by $1 billion a year in new money over the next five years'' and said that he would provide ''$50 billion'' by 2013 to fight the pandemic.'' The White House said Tuesday that Mr. Obama would meet the $50 billion goal, but over six years instead of five. The White House did not provide additional specifics on how the money would be spent in future years.
 ''We continue to support Pepfar,'' Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew said. ''We're saying we want to take what we know works and expand it because we can make a big difference in the world.'' 
 But some AIDS advocacy groups were furious on Tuesday and accused Mr. Obama of breaking his promise. Officials at the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which represents infectious disease specialists, called the increase ''meager'' and said poor countries were cutting back on their health budgets because of the worldwide economic crisis. 
 ''They are expanding the mandate, but not expanding the pie,'' said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group. ''To me, this is a betrayal of trust.''
 But Mr. Obama's plan drew praise from Bono, the rock star and antipoverty advocate. ''Today, 'Doctor Obama' leads the next chapter in the U.S. response to global health crises,'' he said in a statement released by One, the advocacy group he founded.
 The White House released the numbers on Tuesday to provide a preview of a more detailed budget proposal it plans to release on Thursday. Two senior advisers to Mr. Obama -- Gayle Smith, an expert on African affairs and developing nations, and Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a health policy expert -- briefed advocacy groups on the plans on Tuesday, while Mr. Lew made a surprise appearance at the regular White House briefing to talk to reporters.
 The plan appears to closely reflect the thinking of Dr. Emanuel, who is the older brother of Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. Last year, Dr. Emanuel and Colleen C. Denny published a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which they argued for a broader global public health approach.
 ''By extending funds to simple but more deadly diseases, such as respiratory illnesses and diarrheal illnesses, the U.S. government could save more lives -- especially young lives -- at substantially lower cost,'' they wrote, adding that Pepfar ''fails to address many of the developing world's most serious health threats.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama, Mr. Zardari and Mr. Karzai

 BODY:
We suspect that there will be a lot of uncomfortable moments when President Obama meets on Wednesday with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. 
 American officials don't have much confidence in either leader -- a fact they haven't tried to conceal. Most Afghans and Pakistanis share their doubts. But if there is any hope of defeating the Taliban, Mr. Obama will have to find a way to work with both men -- and find the right mixture of support and blunt pressure to get them to do what is necessary to save their countries.
 To pull that off, Mr. Obama also needs the backing of Congress, where members of his party have become increasingly impatient. Representative David Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, says he will give the White House one year to show results. 
 We agree that President George W. Bush wasted far too much time and money enabling Pakistan's former president, Pervez Musharraf, and to a lesser extent Mr. Karzai. There must be accountability. But Mr. Obama must also be given a chance to test his plan to deal with the two countries as an integrated regional problem. 
 Congress must act quickly on two aid packages. A request for supplemental funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars includes $400 million in military aid and $500 million in economic aid to Pakistan, plus $980 million to encourage development in Afghanistan. 
 The second request would provide $7.5 billion, over five years, to Pakistan. Under President Bush, aid to Pakistan went overwhelmingly for military uses. The bipartisan proposal by Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar is intended to improve the lives of Pakistanis -- and gain their support for the fight against extremists -- by investing in schools, hospitals and water projects. It imposes reasonable conditions to ensure the military aid goes to fight the insurgents -- not India. The five-year commitment is also intended to persuade Pakistan's leaders that if they are finally willing to take on the Taliban, Washington will be there with them. 
 We have long worried that Pakistanis see this fight as America's and not their own. But Congress must remember that this is also this country's fight. Afghanistan cannot be ceded to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Nor can Pakistan -- its ungoverned border regions or its dozens of nuclear weapons. 
 Last week, militants came within 60 miles of Islamabad before the Pakistani army began to fight back. A bankrupt peace deal, in which the army ceded the Swat Valley to the Taliban, has now collapsed, and Pakistan's leaders say they are readying a new offensive. One of Mr. Obama's key tasks will be persuading Mr. Zardari and Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, to keep that commitment and sustain operations. 
 Mr. Obama is sending 20,000 more American troops to fight the Taliban. Other challenges also require urgent attention. Afghans are fed up with the rampant corruption of Mr. Karzai's government and its failure to provide basic services. A plan is needed to shut down the opium industry that is the Taliban's main source of cash. Mr. Obama will need to help Mr. Zardari and Mr. Karzai finally understand that their only hope is in working together and with NATO forces -- sharing intelligence and coordinating military operations on both sides of their border. Pakistan must do more to protect its nuclear weapons. 
 The Obama administration has sought to build ties with Pakistan's opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif. Now the president must encourage Mr. Zardari to find a way to work with his rival. To take on the Taliban, Mr. Zardari will need all of the political support he can get.

HEADLINE: Corzine Allies' Plan: Trip G.O.P. Leader First

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Allies of New Jersey's Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine, are so worried about his re-election prospects that they are going to start spending and advertising heavily -- in the Republican primary.
 Mr. Corzine's allies plan to attack the Republican they consider more formidable, the former federal prosecutor Christopher J. Christie, in an attempt to knock him out in the June primary, according to people briefed on the matter. 
 That would leave Mr. Corzine facing Steven M. Lonegan, a former small-town mayor from the party's right wing, whose support for a flat income tax and a ban on abortion are popular with conservative voters, but could be a problem in the general election. 
 Mr. Corzine's popularity has nosedived along with New Jersey's economic fortunes, and recent polls show him trailing Mr. Christie, the former United States attorney for New Jersey.
 Mr. Christie has based his campaign almost entirely on his credentials as a corruption fighter, having obtained convictions of some 130 New Jersey politicians and public employees. and promises to bring the same forceful leadership to tackling the state's fiscal problems. The Democratic assault, according to one of the people briefed on the plans, will aim to tarnish that image.
 The strategy could benefit Mr. Corzine even if it does not result in Mr. Christie's defeat in the primary, if the Republican is significantly damaged before the general election. 
 The Democratic intervention in a Republican primary would be reminiscent of a much more brazen move by Gov. Gray Davis of California in 2002. That year, Mr. Davis openly poured $10 million into a blitz of television commercials portraying Richard J. Riordan, the runaway Republican favorite and a moderate, as having changed his positions on abortion, the death penalty and other issues. The ads battered Mr. Riordan, who lost the primary to a conservative neophyte, Bill Simon Jr., and the unpopular Mr. Davis pulled out a win in November.
 Mr. Corzine's standing reached new lows in an April 22 Quinnipiac University poll. It showed that 54 percent of voters disapproved of the job he was doing, and that he trailed Mr. Christie and was tied with Mr. Lonegan.
 The assault on Mr. Christie, which is being planned by a group including officials at the Democratic Governors Association and other Democratic donors and strategists, is not being coordinated with the governor or his aides, said the people briefed on the plans.
 ''It's the first I'm hearing of it,'' said Robert Asaro-Angelo, executive director of the Democratic state committee. ''We'll focus on our opponent when the Republican primary is over.''
 Mr. Christie's top strategist, Michael DuHaime, greeted the Democratic plan like a badge of honor. ''This move is unsurprising, given that Chris Christie is the only Republican who can beat Jon Corzine,'' he said.
 A spokesman for Mr. Lonegan did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
 Because the Washington-based Democratic Governors Association is a so-called 527 group, it is restricted from advocating for or against specific candidates but, subject to rules that vary state-by-state, is allowed to engage in issue advocacy. But those issue ads can be almost indistinguishable from traditional attack ads, absent a specific appeal to vote for or against the candidate.
 The Democratic Governors Association has made independent expenditures in several gubernatorial elections in recent years, but under self-imposed rules it has acted only through intermediary groups and limited itself to financing less than half the cost of such efforts, to counter the perception that it or its member governors were orchestrating them.
 In 2007, the association funded the Bluegrass Freedom Fund, which blasted Gov. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky over ethics lapses; Mr. Fletcher, a Republican, was trounced by 18 points.
 Last year, the association financed a 527 group called Evergreen Progress, which ran ads attacking Dino Rossi, the Republican challenger to Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, who won re-election. The association also financed the Alliance for North Carolina, which spent $2.4 million on ads attacking Pat McCrory, the Charlotte mayor and a Republican, who was defeated by Gov. Beverly Perdue.
 Nathan Daschle, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, declined to comment on the group's strategy in New Jersey.
 But one of the people briefed on the strategy, who insisted on anonymity because it was still being formulated, said the group intended to aim squarely at Mr. Christie's reputation as a corruption fighter by calling attention to his awarding of lucrative, no-bid contracts to friends to monitor companies as part of settlements in criminal cases.
 In one such instance in 2007, Mr. Christie, who was appointed United States Attorney for New Jersey after serving as a major fund-raiser for George W. Bush, appointed former Attorney General John Ashcroft, his onetime boss, as the monitor of a medical-supply company that had been accused of paying kickbacks to doctors; the contract was valued at $28 million to $52 million.
 In settling a similar case, Mr. Christie awarded a contract to David N. Kelley, another former United States attorney appointed by President Bush. Mr. Kelley, as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, had declined to prosecute Mr. Christie's brother, Todd Christie, in a 2005 stock-fraud investigation involving his trading firm, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg.
 Reports about such contracts have put Mr. Christie on the defensive in recent weeks. He has insisted he hired monitors based only on their qualifications and that his brother was not charged because he was blameless, not because of any favoritism.
 The issues surrounding the contracts, however, have given Mr. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, in Bergen County, an opening to question whether Mr. Christie would be the stronger Republican nominee in the general election. 
 It is unclear how much Democrats will spend attacking Mr. Christie in the primary. There are no limits on how much donors can give the Democratic Governors Association, and it is free to take money from all comers, including corporations and unions. The group reported $11 million on hand at the end of 2008 and said it raised $5.3 million in the first quarter of this year.
 Last year it received hundreds of thousands from pharmaceuticals, labor unions, oil companies and telecommunications giants like AT&T and Verizon.
 It also received $100,000 from Mr. Corzine himself in late 2007.
 Outside groups have often made independent expenditures in New Jersey races, but less frequently in primaries, and seldom if ever has a group associated with one party weighed in with an independent attack in the other party's primary.

HEADLINE: Plan to Sell Chrysler Clears a Bar

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Chrysler on Tuesday took a significant step toward allowing the sale of most of the automaker to Fiat, approving the bidding procedures advocated by the company and backed by the Obama administration.
 The decision by the federal bankruptcy judge, Arthur J. Gonzalez, is a setback for a group of Chrysler creditors who have argued that liquidation of the company or some other transaction could yield greater value. These lenders, primarily investment firms, have said that the plan for the Fiat transaction ran afoul of bankruptcy law and would chill efforts by others to produce competing, potentially higher bids.
 But Judge Gonzalez disagreed, saying, ''The court concludes that the bidding procedures are appropriate and necessary.'' 
 The judge's decision was a victory for Chrysler and the government, which together argued that a speedy sale was the only way to protect tens of thousands of jobs and help along the American economy.
 ''It's a very big first step,'' said Howard Seife, the head of the bankruptcy practice at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke. ''It's clear that the company is moving down the road to a Fiat sale.''
 The judge's decision was the second blow dealt to the holdout lenders during a marathon hearing on Tuesday that began mid-afternoon and ended at 11 p.m. 
 Judge Gonzalez earlier ordered the disclosure of identities of the Chrysler creditors, who had said making them public could lead to retaliation. A lawyer representing them claimed that the creditors had been harassed, and some had even received death threats.
 Judge Gonzalez, said that their lawyers had not presented enough evidence of risk and gave the creditors until Wednesday morning to reveal their identities. The primary evidence cited by their lawyers was a set of anonymous comments on The Washington Post Web site.
 In a plan worked out with the Obama administration, several Chrysler assets would be sold to a new entity held by the United Automobile Workers union, Fiat, and the United States and Canadian governments.
 Corinne Ball, the lead lawyer for Chrysler, argued that there was no time to wait to solicit additional bids for the company. ''It's not perfect, and no one is saying it is perfect,'' she said of the sale proposal. ''But we believe we're doing what is appropriate and necessary.''
 Thomas E. Lauria, the chief lawyer for the dissident creditors, said that any time pressure for the transaction had been created by Chrysler. The company's strategy, he said, was to file for bankruptcy after it had run out of resources.
 ''Then you can do whatever you want to because there's no time to do anything else,'' he said. ''I'm not sure that makes a lot of sense.''
 Mr. Lauria argued that the proposed sale procedures would preclude other potential bidders, although Chrysler's lawyers said that they will consider them. 
 Robert Manzo, an executive with the Capstone Advisory Group who is advising Chrysler, testified Tuesday that based on an analysis he conducted in January, updated with the carmaker's current cash levels, the company could fetch as little as nothing if it were liquidated today.
 The dissident creditors said Tuesday in a filing that they hold about $300 million of Chrysler's $6.9 billion of secured debt. 
 Witnesses presented by Chrysler said that the company had explored forming a corporate alliance with another carmaker, such as General Motors and Nissan, over the past two years. 
 Lawyers for Chrysler, a committee for its unsecured creditors and the government did agree to extend the deadline for bids for the company's assets. A sale would still take place by the end of May.
 If the judge approves the sale, ''the case is pretty much over,'' Scott Van Meter, managing director of LECG, a consulting firm, wrote in an email message.

HEADLINE: As Unemployment Growth Slows, a Recovery Could Take Root

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Ben Bernankesounded more optimistic on Tuesday than he has in a long time, and President Obama has talked about glimmers of hope. The stock market has risen 34 percent from its 2009 nadir.
 On Friday morning, we will get the clearest sign yet of whether these glimmers are real. That's when the Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report, the single most important economic indicator out there. As bad as the job market is, it no longer seems to be getting worse at an accelerating pace. In both February and March, the economy lost fewer than 670,000 jobs; in January, it had lost 741,000. 
 In past recessions, a slowdown in the rate of job loss has been a telling sign. A few months after that, the economy typically began growing again. The vicious cycle turned virtuous.
 After a stretch of unrelenting bad news, dating to last year, the economic signals have been more mixed lately. In just the last week, data on home sales, manufacturing and the service sector have all been better than expected. This welcome news has caused many of us who are pessimistic about the economy's near-term fortunes to reassess. 
 ''At the moment,'' says Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, a New York research firm, ''those forecasting nearer-term recovery have the recent data on their side.''
 There is still a strong case to be made that the economy won't feel truly healthy anytime soon, not this year or perhaps even next. 
 The overhang from the 20-year bubble in stocks and then real estate won't simply go away. As Mr. Shapiro says, ''Wage and salary growth has evaporated, credit is very tight, home prices continue to decline, financial asset values have been decimated and household balance sheets are extremely stressed.''
 But the difference between a bad economy and a depression is real. We've taken a few steps away from depression lately. If Friday's jobs report shows more progress, it will suggest that Mr. Bernanke's optimism is legitimate.
 Wall Street has a notoriously bad forecasting record. It almost always predicts that the economy will grow by something like 3 percent a year, which happens to be correct most of the time. But when a forecast would most be useful -- when the economy is turning -- Wall Street doesn't offer much guidance. Amazingly enough, Wall Street's consensus forecast has failed to predict a single recession in the last 30 years.
 A small firm in New York called the Economic Cycle Research Institute has a much better record. It was founded by Geoffrey Moore, an economist who helped invent the idea of leading indicators. He used historical patterns to predict the economy's direction, and unlike most Wall Street forecasters, he wasn't afraid to stand apart from the crowd. In 2006, while most forecasters were still talking about 3 percent growth, Mr. Moore's proteges were issuing warnings (though they were still too optimistic).
 Today, they think the economy is on the verge of turning. ''We're in the worst recession since World War II,'' says Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. ''However, the days of this recession are limited.'' 
 The main reason, he says, is the economy's normal self-correcting mechanism. That mechanism, I realize, is somewhat counterintuitive. You often hear -- and we in the news media often write -- about the vicious cycle of job cuts, spending cuts and yet more job cuts. Eventually, though, the cycle always ends, and momentum reverses.
 How? Prices fall by enough to tempt households to spend. Businesses cut their costs, become profitable again, and begin to expand. Spending begets more spending. This is what's happening now, Mr. Achuthan argues. The stimulus plan is also making a difference, he says, and so are the government's efforts to reduce the cost of borrowing. 
 Obama administration officials have been a bit more circumspect. They have said, as you would expect them to, that more disappointments are likely. But Lawrence Summers, the top economic adviser, has also been talking lately about the economy's tendency to self-correct. 
 To replace worn-out vehicles and accommodate a growing population, Americans need to buy roughly 14 million vehicles a year, Mr. Summers says. Recently, they have been selling at an annual pace of only nine million. At some point, more people will have to start buying. 
 The Economic Cycle Research Institute's data show that, in every previous downturn in the last 75 years, the economy has started to grow no more than four months after its pace of deterioration has unquestionably slowed. So that's what the institute is forecasting: the Great Recession will most likely be over by Labor Day. 
 Friday's jobs report, covering April, will support this case if, at the very least, it shows job losses of no more than 650,000 a month. The average forecast among economists is roughly 610,000. The Labor Department's revisions to its February and March numbers will also be worth watching. 
 Still, even most optimists, including Mr. Achuthan, are not predicting a fabulous recovery. The forces weighing on the economy are too strong. 
 Stock prices, despite their dizzying fall, are only slightly below their historical average, relative to long-term earnings, which suggests that a true bull market is unlikely. Home prices still have some way to fall. Eventually, the government will need to bring down the budget deficit, and doing so will hold back economic growth. 
 Morgan Stanley's economists put out a thoughtful report this week, pointing out that the aggressive steps taken by the government have so far muted the impact of ''deleveraging'' -- the paying down of debt by households and Wall Street. But this debt repayment is still happening, and it will be a drag on growth for a long time. The debt and the severity of this recession also raise the risk that the recent signs will turn out to be a false dawn, much as the economy slipped back into a deep downturn in the mid-1930s.
 And whenever the economy begins growing again, it won't feel good for a while. Slowing job losses aren't the same as job gains. The unemployment rate may continue to rise into 2010 -- and not come down to a healthy level until even later. 
 As a point of reference, the recession of the early 1990s ended in March 1991, but Americans were still so dissatisfied that they removed George H. W. Bush from office a year and a half later. 
 So the situation is not as dark as it was a few months ago. Maybe Friday's jobs report will bring more reason for hope. But the Great Recession, or at least its impact, still has a way to go.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Obama Announces New Fund to Aid Nonprofits

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
The first lady, Michelle Obama, ventured publicly into the policy realm on Tuesday, announcing that the Obama administration planned to create a $50 million ''social innovation fund'' to help finance and expand promising nonprofit agencies. 
 The fund would offer financial support to nonprofit and community groups that focus on education, health care and economic mobility, among other issues, officials say. The administration plans to encourage foundations, philanthropists and corporations to help raise additional money for the program.
 ''The idea of the fund is simple: find the most effective programs out there and then provide the capital needed to replicate their success in communities around the country,'' Mrs. Obama said Tuesday in New York City, where she was honored at Time magazine's gala for its ''100 Most Influential People.''
 ''By focusing on high-impact, results-oriented nonprofits, we will ensure that government dollars are spent in a way that is effective, accountable and worthy of the public trust,'' she said.
 It was a striking departure for the first lady, who has carefully highlighted her domestic persona during her first months in the White House, emphasizing her focus on motherhood, getting her family settled in the White House, health and nutrition and inspiring young people. 
 But Mrs. Obama, a Harvard-trained lawyer and former hospital executive, remains passionately committed to public policy. And she has focused her attention on increasing volunteerism through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which was enacted last month.
 Congress will have to sign off on the $50 million that the president plans to allocate to the fund. But Mrs. Obama made it clear on Tuesday that she and administration officials believe the fund may have a crucial impact ''at a time when our nation is facing unprecedented challenges.''
 Her announcement came at the end of a busy day in New York City. Mrs. Obama started out by taping a public service announcement about the importance of nutrition and healthy eating with Elmo and other characters from ''Sesame Street.'' (''I never thought I'd be on 'Sesame Street' with Elmo and Big Bird, and I was thrilled,'' she said.)
 Later, she stopped to offer words of encouragement to American diplomats, praising them for linking ''the world to America and American ideals.'' 
 ''There are people around the world counting on the success of your efforts,'' Mrs. Obama told employees of the American mission to the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Fed Sees Mild Recovery Starting by End of Year

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jack Healy contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Tuesday that the economic free fall of the last nine months was nearing an end and that the United States should begin a fragile recovery by the end of this year.
 In his most upbeat assessment in a long time, Mr. Bernanke said a wide array of indicators, from consumer spending and home sales to a revival in the credit markets, now suggested that the economy was stabilizing. 
 But the Fed chairman also warned that the recovery would be slow. He predicted that job losses would probably continue until sometime in 2010, and that unemployment was virtually certain to climb from its current rate of 8.5 percent.
 In normal times, that kind of forecast would hardly be comforting. But Mr. Bernanke's view reinforced the growing consensus among private forecasters that the worst of the crisis might be past.
 Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the Fed chairman noted a wide array of encouraging data in recent weeks. The hopeful signs include a jump in consumer spending in the first quarter of this year; steadying sales of new and existing homes; and a modest revival of the credit markets.
 ''I think we are in much better shape than we were in September and October,'' Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers.
 Taking care not to encourage false hopes, he stopped well short of predicting that good times were around the corner.
 The recent data ''suggest that the pace of contraction may be slowing,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We continue to expect economic activity to bottom out, then to turn up later this year.'' 
 A growing number of private forecasters say they are convinced the statistical hints of revival, though fragmentary and fragile, are too numerous to be dismissed as a fluke.
 ''There's enough evidence to suggest that the free fall of the economy has passed, and that is the first step toward finding the bottom,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 Mr. Zandi said he was particularly struck that consumer spending increased in the first three months of this year, before President Obama's economic stimulus package had time to take effect. 
 But economists also said that the United States has a lot of ground to make up. Consumers have lost huge amounts of wealth as a result of the collapse in housing prices, and tens of thousands of jobs in the automobile and financial services industries have been permanently wiped out.
 On top of that, business investment remains anemic -- a sign that employers are not ready to expand or to start re-hiring in large numbers. 
 ''Even after a recovery gets under way, the rate of growth of real economic activity is likely to remain below its longer-run potential for a while,'' Mr. Bernanke predicted. ''We expect that the recovery will only gradually gain momentum and that economic activity will diminish slowly.''
 On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to release another blast of bad news when it estimates the pace of job losses in April. Analysts estimate that the economy lost at least 600,000 jobs and possibly more than 700,000 jobs last month, after having already lost five million jobs since the recession began more than a year ago. 
 But job creation usually lags behind changes in the economy, because employers try to retain workers when a downturn begins and are reluctant to resume hiring until they are certain that demand for their goods and services will keep growing.
 Economists said their fears of a second Great Depression have waned as some important gauges of the economy began to stabilize. Prices for raw materials like copper, oil and aluminum appear to have hit a bottom, showing that there is still demand for commodities used in industrial production. Surveys show that consumer sentiment is healing, and that people are slightly more optimistic about the economy and the job market as they look ahead.
 ''It's all moving in the right direction,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. 
 Mr. Bernanke, in his testimony, warned that his prediction of a mild recovery late this year depended on continued stability in the financial system. Acknowledging that the Treasury Department's program to bail out troubled financial institutions is extremely unpopular among voters and in Congress, he said that the program was an essential part of the government's strategy for recovery.
 On another issue, Mr. Bernanke suggested many of the nation's 19 biggest banks would be told to raise more capital when the Fed announces the results of stress tests on Thursday. The tests are to determine whether banks would have enough capital if the economic downturn is worse than expected.

HEADLINE: Free Trade, Green Trade

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. PRICE. 
Daniel M. Price, a lawyer, was an assistant to President George W. Bush for international economic affairs.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 PRESIDENT OBAMA and the other leaders at the Group of 20 meeting last month vowed to both pursue a ''green'' economic recovery, and not turn inward. They can fight protectionism and climate change at the same time by unilaterally eliminating tariffs on clean technology products. 
 The United States should call on each of the major economies to choose any of the products from the World Bank's list of 43 climate-friendly technologies -- for example, solar and wind energy equipment -- and end tariffs on them. The only requirement would be that each country reduce the tariffs collected on these 43 products in total by at least 20 percent. 
 This proposal is simple and easy to put into place, and need not await the outcome of drawn-out international trade negotiations. Countries merely need to choose the products on which they want to cut tariffs, and reduce those tariffs to zero. 
 This can be done through the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change -- an initiative that began with the Bush administration -- that brings together the 17 G-20 countries that together constitute 80 percent of the world's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. These cuts should be made before the leaders of these countries meet in conjunction with the Group of 8 summit meeting this July in Italy.
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting of the climate change forum on April 27 that the United States is ''ready to lead'' on climate change. It's time to demonstrate that leadership. 
 According to information collected by the World Trade Organization, the United States imposes tariffs (topping out at 5.2 percent) on 32 of the 43 climate-friendly technologies identified by the World Bank. China imposes duties on all but two of the product categories, with a maximum rate of 35 percent. These tariffs, while not the only barrier, are an impediment to trade and hinder the spread and development of clean technologies. 
 Tariff reduction would have clear trade and climate benefits. Getting all major developed and developing economies back in the habit of reducing barriers is good practice if we want to have any hope of concluding the current world trade negotiations, known as the Doha Round. If the United State leads this effort, it would help alleviate our trading partners' concerns about mixed signals on trade sent by ''Buy American'' provisions and the administration's ambivalence on pending free trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea. 
 Even on climate change, the trade message has been muddled. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu is open to tariffs on countries that do not adopt satisfactory emission reduction targets, while the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, has written a letter to Congress indicating opposition to such measures, at least for now. The United States now has a chance to provide an unambiguous signal of its commitment to trade liberalization.
 Cutting tariffs on clean technologies is a constructive, rather than confrontational, approach to trade and climate change.
 Some developed countries have considered border taxes or tariffs on the products of major emerging markets that aren't curbing the growth of their greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries rightfully cry foul on talk of such punitive trade measures and at the same time call for financial assistance to support clean energy projects. But developing countries can hardly expect financial support if they tax green goods entering their own borders. Encouraging trade, rather than trade sanctions, is a more effective way to combat climate change. 
 Eliminating tariffs on clean technology goods can help achieve the twin imperatives of economic growth and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The solution lies in the development and deployment of affordable cleaner technologies. 
 To be sure, tariff cuts alone won't do it. We need both national legislation and international commitments by all major economies to reduce their emissions. But as a start, President Obama should use his personal popularity with world leaders to call upon his colleagues to join him in tearing down tariff walls.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris Meeting Mixes Tobacco Profit and Protests

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
It was a meeting of big numbers. 
 Philip Morris International emphasized its 2008 profit: $16.3 billion on the sale of 850 billion cigarettes outside the United States.
 But antitobacco advocates in the audience chose to cite the estimated 5.4 million people around the globe who died last year from smoking-related causes. 
 The meeting in Midtown Manhattan was the first annual shareholder event since Philip Morris split off its international unit last year as a separate business from the American tobacco operations. 
 Louis C. Camilleri, the chairman of Philip Morris International, noted that profits rose from a range of price increases, even as sales of cigarette units were virtually flat. Highlighting figures previously released, Mr. Camilleri said the company's revenue was up 6.6 percent last year, to $25.7 billion, excluding excise taxes.
 ''We have demonstrated our ability to use pricing in order to improve profitability even in recessionary times,'' Mr. Camilleri said. First-quarter 2009 sales increased another 6.3 percent, he said, ''driven by price increases across a broad range of markets.'' 
 While many in the audience of about 200 shareholders seemed pleased with the data, about 30 dissidents in the room used the event to protest smoking's toll. 
 One woman asked for a minute of silence for people who died last year from smoking-related causes. 
 The ballroom fell silent. 
 Then Mr. Camilleri said, ''Thank you'' and took the next question, from a supportive shareholder, whom he promised handsome dividends. He said the company, midway through a two-year, $13 billion share repurchase program, would return more than 65 percent of earnings to stockholders this year.
 During the meeting, six people in the audience, their heads covered with black hoods, held signs about the death toll from smoking. 
 Among items up for vote, shareholders approved Mr. Camilleri's eligibility for $9.4 million in incentive pay for 2008, making his total compensation $32 million, up from the $24 million in compensation Mr. Camilleri made the previous year, as chairman of Philip Morris's parent, Altria.

 BODY:
Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students consider the growth of religious schools in rural Pakistan and their impact, then draw connections between recent current world events, their own experience and prior knowledge. 
Author(s):Sandhya Nankani, The New York Times Learning Network
Suggested Time Allowance: 1-2 class periods
Activities / Procedures: 1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Invite students to think about what values are taught and promoted in schools, either implicitly or directly. Have them begin with their own specific schools, then expand to American education overall and finally to other educational systems in the world. They should think about the subjects studied, the rules that students are subject to, the rituals and traditions they observe and participate in and the skills which are emphasized. If they need more scaffolding, you might have them begin by brainstorming subjects, rules, etc. and then create a web of values for each one. For example, the civics curriculum might yield such ideas as individual rights and freedoms, democracy, democratic elections, debate, discussion, inference, civilian participation in public life, etc. They may share their associations in a large group setting or by creating mind maps (see mymindmap.net for examples and free downloadable templates) that they then share with one another. Have students consider the similarities and differences in their responses, then ask them what they value most about their educational system. Ask: How do you think the American educational system compares with those of other countries? What do you know about other school systems? Draw upon the diversity in your classroom for a nuanced discussion. Wrap up by telling students that they are going to be reading an article about the condition of education in Pakistan. 2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS: As a class, read and discuss the article "Pakistan's Islamic Schools Fill Void, But Fuel Militancy", focusing on the following questions: a. According to this article, what is the problem with Pakistan's educational system? b. How do madrasas, or Islamic schools, help families and children? c. Why are madrasas a problem for Pakistan? Highlight at least two quotes in the article to support your answer. d. What statistics in the article stand out to you about education in Pakistan? Why? e. Is this article about the entire country of Pakistan or a particular region? How is knowledge of geography important to understanding this news? What questions does this article bring up in your mind that go unanswered? 3. ACTIVITY: Note to teacher: This article does not provide a historical context for the term "madrasa" and may be criticized for two generalizations: that all madrasas provide radical Islamic instruction, and that if a school or educational setting is Islamic in nature, it therefore promotes terrorism. The following activity is designed to encourage students to delve into the story further by reading it in context of their own knowledge, experience or community as well as some resources and news stories of the recent past. You may wish to share the following definition of "madrasa" with your students, from a Congressional Research Service report at the Library of Congress: The Arabic word madrasa generally has two meanings: 1) in its more common literal and colloquial usage, it means "school"; 2) in its secondary meaning, a madrasa is an educational institution offering instruction in the Islamic subjects including, but not limited to, the Quran, the sayings (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad, jurisprudence (fiqh), and law. Historically, madrasas were distinguished as institutions of higher studies and existed in contrast to more rudimentary schools called kuttab which only taught the Quran. Recently, "madrasa" has been used as a catchall denoting any school - primary, secondary, or advanced - that promotes an Islamic based curriculum. However in many countries, including Egypt and Lebanon, madrasa refers to any educational institution (state-sponsored, private, secular, or religious). In Pakistan and Bangladesh, madrasa commonly refers to Islamic religious schools. You may also find the first few pages of this report helpful in laying out a context for the article and this activity, as well as the follow-up discussion. When you are satisfied that students have a good understanding of both the definition of the word madrasa and the nature and role of the madrasas in Pakistan today, distribute copies of the handout Connecting the New York Times to Your World to students. Divide students into small groups and instruct them to re-read the article and answer the questions on the handout. The "Connecting to World" activity is designed to give students the chance to engage in metacognitive reader response in a guided manner, by connecting new information to information they may already have. Remind students that their choices and responses are entirely personal; there are no right or wrong answers, as they are using the exercise to bring their own background and outside knowledge to a topic about which they may have either very little experience or a very different experience from that which is depicted in the article. The handout asks students to engage with the article on three levels: 1. Text to Self: This can be their own memories of education, whether religious or secular, that the article remind them of, or can be some emotional reaction they have to the text. 2. Text to Text: This might be any connection they can make between the article and a book, film, newspaper article, song, television show or any aspect of pop culture that the article reminds them of for any reason. 3. Text to World: This can sometimes overlap with the other two categories, but can be, say, a response about how post 9/11 concerns about terrorism have registered in their community, or about what they know or don't about Islam. If students are stuck for connections, instruct them that they can also write down questions. Following are some ideas for starting an in-depth discussion of the article with students. Introduce students to the best-selling book "Three Cups of Tea" (which is now available in a middle grade version), the philanthropic work of Greg Mortensen, and the initiatives of the nonprofit started by children, Pennies for Peace. Mortenson, the son of Lutheran missionaries from Minnesota, has built hundreds of schools across Pakistan and Afghanistan that serve poor boys and girls over the past ten years. (Text to Text) Have students investigate the controversy surrounding the opening of the Khalil Gibran school in New York City in September 2008. (Text to World) Invite students to read the 2005 New York Times Op-Ed The Madrassa Myth Ask students to talk to a Muslim member of their community about their experience with Madrasas and their opinion of the article. Have students consider the notion of separation of church and state as it manifests in the United States and elsewhere. (Text to Self) When students have completed their handouts, come together as a large group to discuss their insights, comments, and connections drawn. Ask: Did this article and activity make you think differently about or question your own educational system and the things you take for granted? If so, how? If not, why not? What questions did it raise in your mind? 4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES: Individually, students read some of the online reader comments on this article and choose a comment to respond to, drawing on today's readings and activity. Alternatively, they may wish to write a letter to Sabrina Tavernise, the journalist who reported this story, or to write a letter to a student in Mohri Pur, Pakistan. In a future class, have students share their responses and letters.

HEADLINE: Made in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
TOMORROW, the seventh annual show of designs created in Brooklyn -- Bklyn Designs -- will open in Dumbo, drawing renewed attention to this neighborhood of former factories and warehouses, and its vibrant design scene.
Over the last six years, the juried show, which features contemporary furnishings, lighting and accessories designed, and in most cases made, in Brooklyn, has grown from a Chamber of Commerce exercise in borough boosterism into a high-profile event and an effective springboard for local designers. This year, it has 45 exhibitors and is attracting attendees from as far away as Milan, the Netherlands and Japan.
The show in Dumbo offers a good place to begin exploring what Brooklyn offers in the way of home furnishings. Just as the borough has become a center for locally produced, handcrafted food, it has also developed a broad population of independent, often artisanal designers. 
The evolution has been rapid. Six years ago, David Alhadeff opened the Future Perfect, a showroom for cutting-edge conceptual design, in Williamsburg. It was a place that drew anyone who was interested in the newest thinking in design, with pieces like Jason Miller's antler lighting, Lite Brite Neon's chandelier profile, Piet Houtenbos's grenade oil lamp and tables by Scrapile and Hivemindesign. This year, the neighborhood reached another benchmark when Voos, an expensive high-end showroom with furniture designed almost entirely in Brooklyn, opened a few blocks away.
''Brooklyn has become a space and a place where the thoughts and the ideas matter,'' said Courtney Sloane, the principal at Alternative Design, who helped judge the Bklyn Designs entries. ''At this moment, there's definitely a shifting from what's in Manhattan, to what's happening in other boroughs.''
Park Slope also has a number of interesting venues, including Matter, Jamie Gray's design store that so perfectly captured the ironic, modern aesthetic of the last few years and continues to present fresh work. But arguably the most provocative design sensibility right now can be found in Red Hook, at Erie Basin, a showroom for Russell Whitmore's jewelry and vintage furnishings that reflect his brooding viewpoint.
Indeed, good design can be found throughout the 72-square-mile borough, and the most vociferous consumer can have a hard time keeping up with what's out there. Not only have many new stores opened, designers themselves have lately been establishing new enclaves of creativity in spaces often unknown even to local residents.
Over the last five years, for example, the Old American Can Factory, sandwiched between Park Slope and Carroll Gardens (near the Gowanus Canal), has become a community of more than 200 working designers, artists and performers, where neon light fabricators intermingle with textile designers and filmmakers.
Furniture and product designers are also working in an old foundry at 160 Van Brunt Street in Red Hook, and in the six rehabilitated industrial buildings that make up the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center. While it can be hard to see past the security guards at the entrance to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, inside scores of designers, fabricators and craftspeople work in 40 buildings spread out over 300 acres, rendering the site one of the two hottest locations for up-and-coming design talent, along with 3rd Ward in Williamsburg, a membership club where burgeoning designers have access to woodworking and metalworking equipment they otherwise could not afford.
''Ten years ago, it would have been inconceivable that Brooklyn could support a place like 3rd Ward, but now there's such a burning desire by so many young creative people to be part of the design economy that places like this can exist,'' said Jonah Zuckerman, the founder of City Joinery, a longtime Dumbo furniture studio. ''People are coming to Brooklyn to make stuff in much greater numbers than when I came to Dumbo 11 years ago. Even though the economy is down, the scene is still booming.''
For those interested in exploring that scene, the following guide offers a list of just a few of the many stores in Brooklyn that carry interesting design. Some are new, some are old and many are open only a few days a week, so be sure to check store hours in advance.

HEADLINE: Recalculating Happiness In a Himalayan Kingdom

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
THIMPHU, Bhutan -- If the rest of the world cannot get it right in these unhappy times, this tiny Buddhist kingdom high in the Himalayan mountains says it is working on an answer.
''Greed, insatiable human greed,'' said Prime Minister Jigme Thinley of Bhutan, describing what he sees as the cause of today's economic catastrophe in the world beyond the snow-topped mountains. ''What we need is change,'' he said in the whitewashed fortress where he works. ''We need to think gross national happiness.''
The notion of gross national happiness was the inspiration of the former king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in the 1970s as an alternative to the gross national product. Now, the Bhutanese are refining the country's guiding philosophy into what they see as a new political science, and it has ripened into government policy just when the world may need it, said Kinley Dorji, secretary of information and communications. 
''You see what a complete dedication to economic development ends up in,'' he said, referring to the global economic crisis. ''Industrialized societies have decided now that G.N.P. is a broken promise.''
Under a new Constitution adopted last year, government programs -- from agriculture to transportation to foreign trade -- must be judged not by the economic benefits they may offer but by the happiness they produce.
The goal is not happiness itself, the prime minister explained, a concept that each person must define for himself. Rather, the government aims to create the conditions for what he called, in an updated version of the American Declaration of Independence, ''the pursuit of gross national happiness.''
The Bhutanese have started with an experiment within an experiment, accepting the resignation of the popular king as an absolute monarch and holding the country's first democratic election a year ago.
The change is part of attaining gross national happiness, Mr. Dorji said. ''They resonate well, democracy and G.N.H. Both place responsibility on the individual. Happiness is an individual pursuit and democracy is the empowerment of the individual.''
It was a rare case of a monarch's unilaterally stepping back from power, and an even rarer case of his doing so against the wishes of his subjects. He gave the throne to his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who was crowned in November in the new role of constitutional monarch without executive power.
Bhutan is, perhaps, an easy place to nimbly rewrite economic rules -- a country with one airport and two commercial planes, where the east can only be reached from the west after four days' travel on mountain roads.
No more than 700,000 people live in the kingdom, squeezed between the world's two most populous nations, India and China, and its task now is to control and manage the inevitable changes to its way of life. It is a country where cigarettes are banned and television was introduced just 10 years ago, where traditional clothing and architecture are enforced by law and where the capital city has no stoplight and just one traffic officer on duty.
If the world is to take gross national happiness seriously, the Bhutanese concede, they must work out a scheme of definitions and standards that can be quantified and measured by the big players of the world's economy.
''Once Bhutan said, 'O.K., here we are with G.N.H.,' the developed world and the World Bank and the I.M.F. and so on asked, 'How do you measure it?' '' Mr. Dorji said, characterizing the reactions of the world's big economic players. So the Bhutanese produced an intricate model of well-being that features the four pillars, the nine domains and the 72 indicators of happiness.
Specifically, the government has determined that the four pillars of a happy society involve the economy, culture, the environment and good governance. It breaks these into nine domains: psychological well-being, ecology, health, education, culture, living standards, time use, community vitality and good governance, each with its own weighted and unweighted G.N.H. index.
All of this is to be analyzed using the 72 indicators. Under the domain of psychological well-being, for example, indicators include the frequencies of prayer and meditation and of feelings of selfishness, jealousy, calm, compassion, generosity and frustration as well as suicidal thoughts.
''We are even breaking down the time of day: how much time a person spends with family, at work and so on,'' Mr. Dorji said.
Mathematical formulas have even been devised to reduce happiness to its tiniest component parts. The G.N.H. index for psychological well-being, for example, includes the following: ''One sum of squared distances from cutoffs for four psychological well-being indicators. Here, instead of average the sum of squared distances from cutoffs is calculated because the weights add up to 1 in each dimension.''
This is followed by a set of equations:
= 1-(.25+.03125+.000625+0)
= 1-.281875
= .718
Every two years, these indicators are to be reassessed through a nationwide questionnaire, said Karma Tshiteem, secretary of the Gross National Happiness Commission, as he sat in his office at the end of a hard day of work that he said made him happy.
Gross national happiness has a broader application for Bhutan as it races to preserve its identity and culture from the encroachments of the outside world.
''How does a small country like Bhutan handle globalization?'' Mr. Dorji asked. ''We will survive by being distinct, by being different.''
Bhutan is pitting its four pillars, nine domains and 72 indicators against the 48 channels of Hollywood and Bollywood that have invaded since television was permitted a decade ago.
''Before June 1999 if you asked any young person who is your hero, the inevitable response was, 'The king,' '' Mr. Dorji said. ''Immediately after that it was David Beckham, and now it's 50 Cent, the rap artist. Parents are helpless.''
So if G.N.H. may hold the secret of happiness for people suffering from the collapse of financial institutions abroad, it offers something more urgent here in this pristine culture.
''Bhutan's story today is, in one word, survival,'' Mr. Dorji said. ''Gross national happiness is survival; how to counter a threat to survival.''

HEADLINE: The Pension-Go-Round

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The sprawling investigation into New York's pension investments hints at a much bigger problem than the handful of indictments so far would suggest. 
 What started as an investigation by the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, into the state comptroller's office -- where Mr. Cuomo says favors were being exchanged for contracts to invest pension money -- has mushroomed into a broad look at more than 100 firms by attorneys general in at least 30 other states. 
 A survey of practices across the country portrays a far-reaching web of friends and favored associates: political contributors, campaign strategists, lobbyists, relatives, brokers and others, capitalizing on relationships and paying favors. These influential figures can determine how pension funds are invested, as well as state university endowments, municipal bond proceeds, tobacco settlement funds, hurricane insurance pools, prepaid tuition programs and other giant blocks of public money. 
 ''What has developed is a corrupt system, where Wall Street, various fiduciaries, politicians and corporate managers are draining America's savings,'' said Frederick S. Rowe, a hedge fund manager who serves on the Texas Pension Review Board, an oversight body. 
 In Texas, lawmakers have been working on a bill to strengthen the state pension board and outlaw outside payments to public pension officials. But the bill has been drastically weakened by local pension officials who argued the law would strip them of their independence. 
 That may leave it up to the Securities and Exchange Commission to strengthen controls at the federal level. The commission has jurisdiction over investment firms, but not local politicians.
 Investing public money on the basis of political considerations, rather than merit, heightens the risk of waste and loss, an urgent issue given the market losses of the last year. In 2007 the Government Accountability Office studied a group of pension funds known to be advised by consultants with conflicts of interest, and found their average yearly investment returns were 1.3 percent lower than those of other pension funds. 
 That may sound small, but it can severely erode a fund over time because the losses multiply. 
 ''If compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world, then it's the plague of all time when it's working against you,'' Mr. Rowe said. 
 Mr. Cuomo has said it is too early to estimate the size of any losses caused by the improprieties in New York. Even if the losses cannot be measured, though, he considers it essential to stop the uncontrolled peddling of access.
 ''You can't put a price tag on public integrity,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a recent news conference. ''We have to be sure the system works and people have trust in the system.'' 
 In recent weeks, the New York comptroller and officials in other states have issued rules barring the use of intermediaries -- often called placement agents -- who are paid by money managers to open doors and help them win allocations from state and local governments. But even those restraints, long resisted, may not work well. Across the country, an examination of practices suggests that time and again pension officials are making poor investment choices and incurring losses because personal connections skew their decision-making. 
 Consider DV Urban Realty Partners, which won $68 million from five public pension funds in Chicago. The firm was founded by a nephew of Mayor Richard M. Daley and proposed using the money to improve neglected neighborhoods that were central to the city's 2016 Olympics bid. 
 So far, the investments have lost money. Now the city inspector general is investigating whether the mayor's nephew exerted improper influence, but is having trouble because some of the pension funds have declined to respond to subpoenas. Robert G. Vanecko, the mayor's nephew, has said he did not trade on his family connections.
 In Texas, the city of Fort Worth's pension fund decided to diversify into hedge funds. To help choose which ones, it hired Consulting Services Group of Memphis, which recommended that the city create a custom basket of hedge funds that paid management fees to Consulting Services Group. 
 Fort Worth embraced its recommendations and invested in the Bayou Fund, a fraud scheme that was exposed in 2005, and then in the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff. RuthRyerson, who has since joined the Fort Worth pension fund as chief investment officer, says that Consulting Services was conflicted because it was collecting fees from both parties in the deal. 
 In New Mexico, the former chief investment officer of the state teachers' pension fund has filed a lawsuit saying he was forced out after he opposed a $40 million investment in mortgage-related securities. The investment was made anyway, and the securities are now worthless. The lawsuit describes an informal network of state officials, political insiders and campaign contributors stretching to Illinois. 
 The disgruntled officer, Frank Foy, says these people worked in concert to talk him into making the investment, then worked together to remove him from office when he did not cooperate. His lawyer, Victor R. Marshall, said the campaign was orchestrated by David Contarino, a chief strategist to Gov. Bill Richardson. Mr. Contarino denies the accusations. 
 As Mr. Foy describes it, Mr. Contarino also exerted his influence to persuade another state funding pool to put $50 million in similar mortgage securities. That was the State Investment Council, headed by Governor Richardson. 
 Gary B. Bland, the state investment officer, denied the accusations in a court response in February, calling Mr. Foy's lawsuit ''a political witch hunt.'' Since then, the New Mexico state council has begun reviewing whether investment firms paid fees to anyone in connection with obtaining the state's business. That review was prompted by the New York investigation of placement fees.
 The New Mexico council recently disclosed that a top fund-raiser and political ally of the governor, Marc Correra, was paid a placement fee by the investment firm that sold the toxic mortgage securities criticized by Mr. Foy. The records also show that Mr. Correra has been paid roughly $11 million as the placement agent for more than 20 other investments -- all private equities, hedge funds and complex structured debt -- that have come through the investment council's door since Governor Richardson took office in 2003.
 Investments like those promoted by Mr. Correra, called alternative investments, are controversial for public investment funds to invest in because there is not a ready market for them should the government suddenly need money. They are hard to value, too, and they carry higher risks in the pursuit of higher returns. The investment firms that offer them tend to earn much higher fees, which means a bigger cut for the placement agents. 
 Mr. Correra's lawyer, Ronald L. Rubin, said his client earned his fees through hard work and believed he had complied with all the rules. ''He wants to follow the law,'' said Mr. Rubin, with the firm of Tannenbaum, Helpern, Syracuse & Hirschtritt in New York. 
 Governor Richardson has suspended new investments in private equity firms, hedge funds and other alternatives. 
 The current investigations into influence peddling across the country are virtually all connected with investments that expose taxpayers to the greatest risks, and that pay money managers the highest fees, cutting into future returns.
 ''Money that's gone can't compound,'' said Mr. Rowe, the hedge fund manager on the Texas Pension Review Board. ''The savings pool can't grow to the extent that it should.''
 Mr. Rowe, who has been outspoken about the need for tighter controls on public pension money, was chairman of the Texas Pension Review Board until last year, when he was removed by the governor of Texas, Rick Perry.

HEADLINE: Antiques Dealers Still Scoring Big Sales

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
For some people, the notion that any chair, let alone one upholstered in puffy brown leather with dragon-shaped arms and offered for sale during an economic crisis, might be worth $28.3 million would be far-fetched. Robert and Cheska Vallois, however, recently paid that sum, more than seven times the preauction estimate at Christie's, for a 90-year-old chair created by a pioneering designer, Eileen Gray.
 The sale appears consistent with a trend that antiques dealers around the country have noted: despite the recession, demand remains strongest for the best and most costly items. That may seem counterintuitive, but the dealers say that people who have a lot of money still must do something with it -- and some of those people are a little down on the stock market these days. 
 ''There's still plenty of money,'' said John Keith Russell, a dealer in Westchester County, N.Y., who specializes in Shaker goods and is president of the 100-member, invitation-only Antique Dealers' Association of America. ''We obviously have seen a slowing in the market, but we have not noticed any weakness in the highest end of the market. The commitment by collectors is still as aggressive as it was two years ago.''
 Wealthy buyers are still attending prestigious events like the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan and making major purchases, said Mr. Russell. He cited a recent buyer from Philadelphia who said she had felt uneasy about investing in real estate or stocks but purchased two significant pieces of furniture. High-end antiques, dealers like to assert, tend to hold their value and can sometimes appreciate enormously over time.
 ''Our clients feel more comfortable investing in art glass and furniture right now than in the stock market,'' said Waltford Gonzalez, store manager for Valerio Antiques, a 29-year-old business in Coral Gables, Fla. Many of his buyers are over 35 and from countries like Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, whose currencies and economies have been volatile in recent years. By contrast, he said, ''buying antiques is a safe bet for them.''
 Recent auction prices confirm that the high end is holding up well, said S. Clayton Pennington, editor of the monthly national trade publication Maine Antique Digest. ''I think the middle market has been down for a while, at least a year,'' he said.
 ''The business has changed,'' agreed Ronald Kinney, owner of R & S Antiques in Houston, a 30-year-old firm. ''The lower-end buyers are getting squeezed out, generally speaking. Those who used to spend that kind of money either don't have it anymore or aren't willing to spend it.''
 But they may have some goods they're looking to sell. Marvin Lowensteiner, co-owner of the Chester Antique Mall in Chester, N.J., said he had been getting six calls a week from people looking to sell their jewelry; he used to average one such call a week. ''They're selling gold and silver to raise $400 or $500,'' he said. ''They need it to pay their bills.''
 The economic crisis, dealers say, has made this a terrific time to find newly affordable merchandise. ''We're buying like fiends,'' said Camilla Dietz Bergeron, a Madison Avenue purveyor of estate jewelry who has been in business for 20 years and whose items range from $475 to $200,000. ''Our doors are open and our checkbooks are out. We're buying some pretty fabulous stuff.''
 Mr. Pennington agreed. ''The time to buy is now,'' he said. ''You can get really good things at the $800 to $1,000 price level right now.''
 Robert Aibel, a Philadelphia dealer who specializes in the handmade mid-20th-century wooden furniture of George Nakashima, says his business declined in December 2007. As a result, he gradually cut back his purchases, spending only $600 to acquire merchandise from October 2008 to last February. Recently, however, he has been buying again, looking to restock his 20,000-square-foot store.
 Joe Ley, who has been selling antiques for 43 years in Louisville, Ky., said, ''It's a wonderful time to buy.'' Mr. Ley has seen a 20 percent drop in revenue of late but is relieved that business has not been even worse. Wealthier buyers, he said, still pay for top-quality pieces, but clients who once eagerly spent $1,000 to $1,500 have disappeared. 
 Perspective helps, the antiques veterans agree. ''We've weathered a lot of storms,'' said Mr. Ley. ''When eBay started, we really saw a downturn in the market. When gas was $4 a gallon, we saw a big drop-off in traffic.''
 But his business recovered and now, with eight full-time employees depending on his success, he remains cautiously optimistic. 
 ''Kids today are buying things made of pressed cardboard imported from Thailand instead of aged wood,'' he said. ''A lot of young people don't want anything older than a pizza box. But you can't sell that cheap chain-store junk at a yard sale in two or three years, while good furniture holds its value. Good is always good.''

HEADLINE: New Effort Reopens A Medical Minefield

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
A back-pain researcher, Dr. Richard Deyo recalls the uproar the last time federal officials tried to suggest how doctors should practice their profession. 
 It was in the mid-1990s, when Dr. Deyo helped develop federal guidelines urging surgeons not to perform spinal fusions to treat acute pain. The reason was simple: There was little evidence that the fusions worked in many patients.
 Spine specialists quickly attacked the report, calling it flawed. One medical device maker, Medtronic, sued unsuccessfully to block its release. Republican lawmakers tried to kill the agency that issued the report. It survived, but its funding was drastically cut, and it decided to stop issuing guidelines. 
 Now, 15 years later, the Obama administration is entering this same medical minefield. And once again, opponents are gearing up for a fight. 
 The administration plans to spend $1.1 billion over the next few years on studies like the one conducted by Dr. Deyo, to compare the effectiveness of competing treatments for common conditions like back pain, heart disease and prostate cancer. The studies will be publicly released, to help doctors and patients decide which treatment options they want to pursue. 
 Supporters include many medical researchers, consumer groups, unions and insurers. They say such studies are essential to curbing the widespread use of ineffective treatments and to helping control health care costs, which totaled $2.2 trillion in 2007, or 16 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
 The New England Journal of Medicine published several articles Wednesday supporting the federal effort and rebutting arguments raised by critics. 
 But potential opponents -- which include medical products companies, some doctors and their political allies -- warn that the comparative effectiveness movement could lead to inadequate treatment for some patients and even the rationing of health care.
 ''It is not difficult to see how you can get on a slippery slope very easily,'' said Tony Coelho, a former Democratic congressman who is head of a new industry-backed Washington group called the Partnership to Improve Patient Care, formed to lobby on the comparative effectiveness effort. 
 The group's backers include major trade organizations that represent producers of drugs, medical devices and biological treatments. 
 Critics like Mr. Coelho also point to a British government agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE, which considers costs in judging a treatment's effectiveness. Based on NICE's findings, the British government has denied some patients access to costly drugs like those used to treat cancer.
 Whether cost should be a factor in this country was a hot-button issue during the Congressional debate in February, when the comparative-effectiveness funding was approved as part of the economic stimulus package. A legislative report by Congressional lawmakers who negotiated the final version of the bill said that they did not intend the research money to be used to ''mandate coverage, reimbursement or other policies for any public or private payer.'' 
 Despite that assurance, even supporters of the effort say one goal in identifying effective medical treatments is to stop wasting money on those of little value. 
 For now, proponents and critics are warily circling one another, as the first administrative steps of the process unfold.
 A panel of government health experts is holding a series of public hearings at which people can suggest medical conditions for comparative effectiveness reviews. Then, in late June, that federal panel and the Institute of Medicine, a part of the National Academies of Science, will issue reports recommending priorities for comparative research. Past combatants like Dr. Deyo expect the fighting to start as soon as such studies start identifying winners and losers. 
 ''If this research is done in a rigorous way and doesn't pull strings, then a lot of pressure will come to bear,'' on the process, said Dr. Deyo, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.
 Some conservative and libertarian research groups, as well as commentators like Rush Limbaugh, have attacked the comparative effectiveness effort as a step toward socialized medicine. Some medical experts have also raised concerns that the program may slow the drive toward so-called personalized medicine -- an approach in which treatments are tailored to a patient's genetic makeup. But for now, Mr. Coelho's opposition group and drug and device makers are using more measured rhetoric. 
 Mr. Coelho, a former House Democratic whip who resigned in 1989 over a controversial junk-bond investment, says his organization does not oppose the concept of comparative effectiveness. But the group is concerned, he said, that such studies could lead to a type of cookbook medicine that will ignore the needs of specific patients, including members of minority groups. 
 His organization includes patient advocacy groups like the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which also receive financing from medical products companies. Those groups argue that their members are underrepresented in formal clinical trials of drugs and treatments, and so there is not evidence enough on which to draw conclusions on what works for them and what does not, they say. 
 Mr. Coelho, a driving force behind the Americans with Disabilities Act, points to his own experience with epilepsy, which he has had since he was a teenager, as an example of how patients need to be treated individually. 
 Under the comparative effectiveness program, the Department of Health and Human Services and two agencies under it --the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- will finance studies that will look at various treatments and will pay for the development of information-gathering tools, like databases of patients being treated for a certain condition.
 Right now, ''there is no place that helps you sort through a specific option and how that compares to another,'' said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, the director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
 The agency, back when it was known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, was the federal body Dr. Deyo worked with in drafting the back-pain guidelines in the mid-90s. 
 More recently, officials of the Oregon Evidence-Based Practice Center began producing reports a few years ago comparing the effectiveness of competing drugs, both brand-name and generic, in treating specific conditions. The work was meant to help purchasers like state Medicaid programs lower their costs, said Dr. Mark Helfand, director of the center, which is part of the Oregon Health and Science University. 
 Wherever they went, Dr. Helfand said, he and his colleagues met resistance from drug makers and some patient groups that had rallied to the companies' side, who raised the same arguments that critics of comparative effectiveness are raising today. The Practice Center's research, which is continuing, is now used by 14 states. Dr. Helfand said groups representing African-American, Hispanic or elderly patients were right to argue that they were underrepresented in clinical trials. But he added that the whole point of comparative effectiveness was to move medical practice beyond the limits of such trials, by looking at a broader range of evidence that includes the actual experience of patients undergoing treatment. 
 ''Ironically, the motivation for comparative effectiveness is to see what works in practice,'' he said, ''rather than overgeneralizing from a few unrepresentative studies.''

HEADLINE: Hotels Court the Few Who Are Still Traveling

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
AS the recession lingers and travel continues to dip, hotels are rolling out a lot more than red carpets to attract guests.
 Discounts, free nights, upgrades, waived fees and loyalty-program perks are some of the main ways hotels are trying to get heads in beds.
What is less clear is whether these deals and promotions actually spur business travel, which has experienced significant cutbacks this year. 
 ''Whereas leisure demand can be stimulated by pricing, that really is not the case for business travel,'' said Bjorn Hanson, associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''If the boss says, 'We've eliminated our travel budget,' it doesn't really matter if the employee says, 'But I can get a really good deal on a hotel room.' ''
 Even so, hotels are competing with one another to capture those customers who are still traveling, which has led to some remarkable offers in recent months.
 ''What many hotels are doing is coming up with ideas just to get attention,'' Mr. Hanson said.
 Hula-hooping for 20 seconds or playing ''rock, paper, scissors'' for a chance at a room upgrade may be among the more innovative examples of this trend.
 ''Guests can play these games and, depending on how they do, they'll get upgraded upon check-in,'' said Niki Leondakis, chief operating officer for Kimpton Hotels, which plans to begin the promotion this summer. 
 Another Kimpton promotion, valid through December, offers guests either a cocktail or continental breakfast for $1. 
 Ms. Leondakis said these specials were designed to enhance Kimpton's image as a fun place to stay and that such deals did resonate with guests, who often hear about promotions through Twitter and e-mail blasts.
 ''It's hard to differentiate at a time when everybody's offering value and packages, but in the last three months, we've been able to increase our market share and we believe these promotions have been a big part of that,'' she said.
 According to Smith Travel Research, hotel occupancy levels in the United States declined to 51 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared with 58 percent during the same period in 2008. While average daily rates fell only $8 nationwide, to $100 a night, the drop has been steeper in markets like New York City, where rates averaged $195 in the first quarter of 2009, versus $241 in the first quarter of 2008. Miami, Phoenix, Orlando, San Francisco and Oahu, Hawaii, also experienced big price declines.
 While hotel executives acknowledge that discounts and promotions are often more likely to spur leisure travel than business trips, many chains are using loyalty program enhancements to sway point-obsessed travelers their way.
 Members of Starwood's Preferred Guest Program who stay at any of the chain's hotels twice before the end of July can earn a free weekend night, redeemable through September. Another deal, aptly named Better Tomorrows, gives guests 50 percent off a second night for every night they stay through September.
 Meanwhile, Hilton is offering members of its HHonors reward program 1,000 bonus points every night for stays through June. And Hyatt's Big Welcome initiative is offering Gold Passport members the chance to enter a contest (through May 13) to win 365 free nights or one of 10,000 free nights Hyatt is giving away in the United States.
 John Wallis, Hyatt's global head of marketing and brand strategy, said that through these types of promotions, the chain was focusing on loyalty and customer service to attract guests, rather than simply slashing prices.
 ''We cannot just crash rates,'' he said. ''It might be good in the short term, but it doesn't make sense in the long term if you're in the hotel business.''
 Another benefit of the contest, Mr. Wallis said, is that the questions guests answer on the entry form give Hyatt data about who is still traveling after widespread layoffs, while the contest raises awareness about Hyatt. 
 ''Over the last five years, on a Tuesday or Wednesday night in many cities around the world, every hotel was running at full occupancy,'' he said. ''Now, your first choice of where you want to stay is much more available.''
 Guests aren't the only ones benefiting from this shift in the balance of power. After years of hotel price increases, companies that negotiate corporate rates with hotels finally have the upper hand at the bargaining table, and many travel managers are renegotiating deals made late last year, before prices really started to decline.
 ''It's our job for our customers to make sure their rates continue to be competitive,'' said Neysa Silver, director of hotel solutions for Carlson Wagonlit Travel, which manages travel programs for corporate clients.
 However, Ms. Silver said, because these negotiations take place annually, pushing too hard for savings now, when hotels are hurting, can have repercussions when the situation changes.
 ''You have to be conscious of looking at the savings versus your relationship with the hotels,'' she said. ''It's a very careful scale because prices will upswing again, and then it will be tough for the clients.''
 According to the latest projections from hospitality research companies, that is not likely to happen soon, so business travelers have plenty of time to enjoy all the perks and deals while they last.

HEADLINE: Priest Known as Padre Oprah Strays in South Florida

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
They called the Rev. Alberto Cutie ''Padre Oprah'' for his insightful advice about relationships. Now his parishioners, his television and radio audience, and readers of his best-selling book, ''Real Life, Real Love,'' know he speaks from experience. 
 On Tuesday, photographs in a Spanish-language tabloid showed the 40-year-old priest with deep blue eyes lying shirtless beside, and cuddling with, a dark-haired woman on a North Florida beach. Within hours, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami removed him from his post as pastor of a Miami Beach church, and now all of South Florida seems to be abuzz with discussions of celibacy, celebrity and temptation. 
 Radio and television news programs, in Spanish and English, have spent hours parsing the case. The original pictures, from TVNotas, have been reproduced all over the Web, while on Wednesday at his former church, St. Francis de Sales, camera crews hovered on the sidewalk as a secretary hung a ''no trespassing'' sign.
 ''He was held up as an example of something different,'' said Carlos Saladrigas, a well-known businessman here who has known Father Cutie since he entered the seminary at age 18. ''It's like any icon -- when they breach the trust of society, it hurts.''
 Father Cutie, born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, grew up in Miami. He developed an international following of millions with his television show, ''Padre Alberto,'' which was first broadcast on Telemundo in 1999. 
 Wealthy, famous local figures also considered him a friend: when the Latin music legend Israel Cachao Lopez died last year, it was Father Cutie who conducted the service. 
 And even now, many of his supporters have remained loyal. Along with fans who have started online petitions or called into Spanish-language radio shows to say he should be quickly forgiven, there are parishioners like Yohayra Dajud De la Fuente, who parked herself in front of St. Francis on Wednesday to praise the priest for the television cameras. A tall Colombian woman, 44, with multicarat diamond earrings, she said, ''He is a brilliant man who is needed by this community.'' 
 She cited his efforts in working with local youth -- and his role officiating at her wedding -- and she questioned the motives of the woman involved. ''She never came to this church,'' Ms. Dajud De la Fuente said. ''I'm sure it's someone who wanted to destroy his reputation.''
 Father Cutie's parish sits in the heart of South Beach, where even the mannequins have extra-large breasts, and many here have also questioned whether this was the time or place for Catholic priests to stay celibate. It remains unclear exactly how far Father Cutie fell; statements released by him, and by Archbishop John C. Favalora, were vague on details. 
 Father Cutie did ask ''for the forgiveness of those who may be hurt or saddened by my actions,'' but he also said ''the commitment that I made to serve God will remain intact.''
 Archbishop Favalora, in turn, said, ''Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy, and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God.''
 The celebrity status of Padre Oprah seems to be coloring the community's response. Without it, tabloids would not have been following him to the beach, nor would supporters be planning to march Thursday on his behalf.
 But just a few feet from the church with the slogan ''when you come to the beach ... don't forget who made it,'' Ruben Garcia had reservations about the mix of fame and faith. Standing outside his apartment, he said the church was always packed on Sundays, and he argued that requiring priests to be celibate was outdated. 
 The problem, he said, is that Father Cutie's sandy tryst suggests an arrogance that conflicts with piety. 
 ''This man, he's not a God,'' said Mr. Garcia, 45, an unemployed laborer. ''He's an instrument of God. He needed to be more careful.''

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Seeks a Monitor for 'Too Big to Fail' Entities

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress should create an oversight council made up of the nation's top financial regulators to scrutinize ''too big to fail'' institutions for risky practices that could lead to the next financial crisis, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation told a Senate committee on Wednesday. 
 It was the second significant regulatory proposal offered in recent weeks by the chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, who suggested last week that her agency be given greater powers to take over and close bank holding companies, not just the failing commercial banks.
 The Senate committee seemed impressed with Ms. Bair's idea for a ''systemic risk council'' whose members would include the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, Treasury Department and F.D.I.C., perhaps avoiding a predicted turf fight if a single agency were assigned the task.
 The current regulatory structure is too fractured to identify dangerous practices that can, with little notice, cause a global financial institution like Lehman Brothers to collapse, Ms. Bair said.
 ''Part of the problem is nobody really has a mandate for the whole system right now,'' she said.
 One major unresolved question raised at the hearing was if the council would have the power to order financial institutions to take corrective actions or if it would simply be an adviser to regulators, like the Office of Thrift Supervision or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 ''That is very critical,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat and chairman of the banking committee, said. ''What kind of authority do you invest in it?''
 Ms. Bair and Gary H. Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who also testified, suggested that the new council should have the power to require actions by other regulators.
 Ms. Bair also said that Congress should create incentives to shrink the size of the nation's too-big-to-fail institutions, perhaps by demanding that they set aside far greater capital reserves or contribute more money to insurance programs that would help in closing them if they stumbled again. 
 She did not name names, but institutions like Citigroup and Bank of America fit the description.
 ''Academic evidence suggests that benefits from economies of scale are exhausted at levels far below the size of today's largest financial institutions,'' she said in her written testimony.
 Perhaps most important, she said, is the need to create a mechanism to take over and shut down too-big-to-fail institutions, so that the next time an investment bank like Lehman Brothers gets into trouble, it can be closed without devastating markets worldwide.
 She advocated giving the F.D.I.C., or some other entity, the legal authority to quickly manage the closing and resolution of ''systemically important institutions'' -- in addition to giving the F.D.I.C. the power to shut down bank holding companies -- just as it now has with individual troubled banks.

HEADLINE: Plan to Shut Consulate Irks Swedes

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It would no doubt be a gross exaggeration to describe New York's Swedes these days as being as gloomy as a Bergman film, as tormented as a Strindberg character, as lonely as Garbo. Things aren't that bad.
 Nonetheless, some of the estimated 30,000 Swedes who live in and around the city feel forlorn because their country's consular office, in a building on Second Avenue near the United Nations, may soon close. They've heard that a decision in Stockholm could come as early as Friday. 
 Granted, Sweden does not loom large for many New Yorkers, even if a son of Swedish parents, Jonas Bronck, lent his name to our northernmost borough. Sweden, however, is no arriviste in these parts. It has posted a consul general here since Andrew Jackson was president and Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence became the city's first directly elected mayor. That is to say, since 1834. Not many nations can make that claim.
 So from a historical perspective as well as pragmatic concern, Swedish citizens here have reacted with dread to word that their consulate may hit the canvas as hard as Ingemar Johansson did in his last two fights against Floyd Patterson. Plain and simple, the Swedes don't get it.
 ''I think it's very unfortunate for the whole image of Sweden,'' said Renee Lundholm, president of the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce New York. ''We have had such a great momentum in the last couple of years. In 2008, we were mentioned quite often as being the greenest nation in the world. I've never seen so much written about Sweden as I did in 2008. This year, we are mentioned as a model for the bank crisis, and in July we take on the presidency of the European Union.''
 ''Not everybody is thrilled,'' Ms. Lundholm said with admirable Nordic understatement.
 The root of the problem, you will not be shocked to hear, is money. Like everyone else, the Swedish government is feeling pinched.
 To save roughly $5 million, Carl Bildt, the foreign minister and former prime minister, has suggested shutting some consulates, including the ones in New York and Los Angeles. Consular services -- passports, visas and tending to Swedish citizens who run into trouble -- would be shifted to the embassy in Washington.
 Sweden's mission to the United Nations would stay open. But if Mr. Bildt's plan were to become reality, the East Side residence of its United Nations ambassador would be sold, and he would move into a nearly-century-old mansion at Park Avenue and 64th Street where Swedish consuls general have lived.
 The very idea flummoxes Swedish officials here, though they are understandably reluctant to speak for attribution; there are careers to think about. ''What can I say?'' one of them said. ''It's all about priorities. Of course, the government could prioritize in another way. We haven't got any explanation except that they have to save money.''
 Swedish businesses fear that a shutdown would hurt them, a point that Ms. Lundholm made to Mr. Bildt in a letter that she wrote with the chairman of her organization, Tomas K. G. Ericson.
 Mikael Tornwall, a reporter for Dagens Industri, a Swedish financial newspaper, said business leaders had told him that a counsel general was an important ''door opener'' for them when they call on American companies and government agencies.
 BUT this is about more than business. It is not just a Saab story. Pride is on the line. Among European countries, only unprosperous types like Albania and Moldova have no consular representation here.
 Cultural concerns rank high, too. Promoting a country's art, music and literature is a vital function of any consulate, and where more so than in this city? ''There is a reason New York is named the capital of the world,'' Ms. Lundholm said. Similar thoughts were expressed in letters sent to Mr. Bildt by New Yorkers, including several Nobel Prize winners (who collected their awards in Stockholm).
 Being New Yorkers ourselves, we naturally assume that this is about us. Isn't everything? Does this possible move by the Swedes somehow reflect on us?
 Not at all, said Marjorie B. Tiven, the city commissioner in charge of relations with the 110 foreign consulates here. Her office has no role in this matter, Ms. Tiven said, adding that she hoped that the Swedes stay put. But even if the consulate closes, she said, ''I don't see a trend here.'' In other words, any desire to leave is only a Stockholm syndrome.

HEADLINE: Flowers's Power?

 BODY:
The banks need money, and J. Christopher Flowers, a private equity maven who is one of the world's richest men, wants to provide it. And why not? As reported on Wednesday by Eric Lipton of The Times, Mr. Flowers and a few other multibillionaire investors formed a ''club'' last year to buy IndyMac, the failed California bank, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 The government agreed to take most of the risk of future losses on the loans acquired by the investors -- leading Mr. Flowers to quip at an investor gathering in January that ''the government has all the downside and we have all the upside.''
If you've had a nagging feeling that the banking mess is a colossal raw deal for taxpayers, consider the suspicion confirmed.
 Now, in exchange for big investments in sick and dying banks, Mr. Flowers's firm and other giant private equity firms are not content with potentially fabulous returns on government-subsidized fire-sale-priced bank assets. They are lobbying to gain control of the banks.
 That would require the Federal Reserve to loosen regulations and responsibilities that come with bank ownership. One can only hope that the Fed and the Obama administration are not so desperate to recapitalize the banks that they make that deal. 
 Federal rules on bank ownership exist to prevent conflicts of interest and concentration of economic power. They protect consumers and businesses, as well as taxpayers, who stand behind the government's many subsidies and guarantees to banks. To relax the rules would be to put expediency above long-term stability. 
 Mr. Lipton reported that, so far, the Fed is resisting the private equity lobbying. But Mr. Flowers is confident. He said part of the strategy was to persuade the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, to pressure the Fed to back down. ''Lowlife grave dancers like me will make a fortune,'' he said earlier this year.
 This is the moment private equity firms have been waiting for. The Fed and the Obama administration should ensure they're kept waiting.

HEADLINE: Hurt by Economy, Plastic Surgeons Find Hope in New Products

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
They can lift breasts and firm up thighs, but the nation's cosmetic surgeons admit they are powerless over a sagging economy.
 And yet, hope is rising, along with the Dow, what with the first competitor to Botox just approved last week and potentially revolutionary new treatments on the horizon, including stem cell injections and a cream that can remove unwanted facial lines.
 ''Business has definitely been flat,'' Dr. Brian Kinney, a Los Angeles surgeon, said at the annual meeting of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, which concludes here Thursday. ''I can think of a particular woman who said in October she wanted a facelift but she said, 'Well, I need to sell a house because I want to make sure I'm secure.' And then she told me in March she was still waiting, the real estate market's down.'' 
 The number of cosmetic procedures in the United States last year fell 12.3 percent from 2007, to just over 10.2 million, according to the organization. That is a setback for a business that had seen unabated growth since 1997, when about two million procedures took place.
 The biggest growth area has been nonsurgical procedures, owing largely to the success of Botox, a botulinum toxin that works by numbing and relaxing facial muscles that create wrinkles. Yet the company that markets Botox, Allergan Inc., is bracing for new competition now that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the second botulinum toxin for similar use, Dysport, produced by the French drugmaker Ipsen Biopharm Ltd.
 ''Everybody is excited about it because it's the first competitor to Botox in seven years,'' said Dr. Z. Paul Lorenc, who practices in Manhattan and who views Dysport as a faster-acting, longer-lasting and potentially less-expensive option. ''It's also a softer look.''
 Also pending are studies into topical versions of these muscle-numbing medications, although none are expected to come to market for years. Already, though, doctors here are debating how useful or practical it might be. 
 ''There's a concern that if you were to give the patient the cream to take home, they'd just keep putting more and more and more on, and you'd have a dosing problem,'' Dr. Kinney said. ''And patients might start putting it on other places, like around the mouth, and then they might not be able to move their mouths properly.''
 Stem cell treatments were on the minds of many as well, although the potential applications are vague. The thinking seems to be that doctors may some day be able to extract stem cells from a patient's own fat and use them in lieu of breast implants to produce self-regenerative tissue that would provide a more natural feel than silicon-gel or saline, now the standard. No one is sure yet if it will work and several doctors voiced concern as to whether it is safe and how they would be able to regulate the tissue growth. 
 Another potential growth area is in nonwhite patients, who have long been underserved, said Dr. Julius W. Few, a surgeon from Chicago who lectured at the conference on how to provide nose jobs for non-Caucasian patients while preserving their ethnicity.
 ''We know by our statistics that this is a growing group by interest in plastic surgery,'' said Dr. Few, who performs as many as 40 nose jobs a year on nonwhite patients. ''Being African-American, when I was growing up, it was said at my house and a lot of other houses that plastic surgery was only for wealthy white people. That seemed unfair to me.''
 The four-day event was a serious medical conference of nearly 2,500 practitioners and exhibitors attending live demonstrations, listening to debates over newer techniques and browsing countless models of implants and needles that were on display.
 Still, the convention offered provocative sessions like ''137 Rhinoplasties in 20 Patients: What Went Wrong?'' ''The Weird Smile After Facelift Surgery: A Dynamic Investigation'' and ''The Role of Chin Augmentation in Achieving Facial Harmony.'' 
 Doctors at the conference hoped to get out the message that they were far from the stereotypes of predatory practitioners who take advantage of patients' insecurities. They resent portrayals like that from a ''Sex and the City'' episode in which Samantha Jones, played by Kim Cattrall, is worried about aging and wants a small operation but is told by a physician that she ought to consider several other procedures. She eventually decides on ''aging gracefully.''
 Of the fictional surgeon's behavior, Dr. Robert Singer of San Diego said, ''That never happens.'' Dr. Singer added: ''I generally will turn that question in a different way when a patient asks me what I think she needs done. It's not a matter of what I say. It's what bothers you.''
 Dr. Singer said that part of the challenge was managing patient expectations.
 ''The public wants something that has essentially no down time, that has maximum improvement, that is non-invasive, that has no discomfort and that has no cost,'' Dr. Singer said. ''They want magic. That magic pill doesn't exist.''

HEADLINE: In Crisis, Mothers Take Up Offers From Temporary 'Parents'

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
After resolving to leave her longtime but violent partner in March, Janai Parahams, 25 and jobless, wanted to make a fresh start. But she felt trapped: she was tending four small children with no family support or child care. She could scarcely leave her house, let alone find a job and a new place to live. 
 ''I needed stability so I wouldn't go back into an abusive relationship,'' she said of those first days of confusion and fear. 
 A social worker told Ms. Parahams about a nonprofit group, Safe Families for Children, that places the children of parents in crisis with volunteer families, on a temporary basis -- from a day to a year or more. Ms. Parahams could approve the caretakers, see her children whenever she wanted and get them back with no courts involved. 
 This unusual offer of extended respite to overwhelmed parents is part of a broader national trend in child welfare to keep many cases out of the courts and foster care systems. State agencies traditionally had a stark choice between breaking up families in turmoil or leaving children in potentially risky homes. Now many are doing more preventive work to forestall abuse and neglect. 
 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio are among the states redesigning official programs to identify families at risk and offer counseling or parenting classes. Other states are making intensive efforts to help families in more serious trouble stay together, placing a social worker in the home for weeks at a time to assess and advise parents, refer them to needed therapies and secure help with day care, housing and even emergency cash. 
 The group that Ms. Parahams turned to, Safe Families for Children, takes a different approach, finding mentoring families to take children temporarily, without the formalities and potential legal battles of foster care. 
 ''It's consistent with the whole movement in child-welfare agencies to find a broader range of responses for families in need,'' said Mark Courtney, a family expert at the University of Washington.
 Safe Families, which was founded in Chicago about five years ago, says that requests for help have accelerated this year along with the rise in unemployment and foreclosures.
 Not all child welfare experts agree that removing children, even temporarily, is a good idea if there is no imminent risk.
 Started by David Anderson, a child psychologist who heads a Christian service agency, Safe Families draws mainly on churches to find families who will take in children, with no compensation or expectation of adoption. 
 The approach has recently spread to Atlanta; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Davenport, Iowa; Los Angeles; Milwaukee; and Rockford, Ill.; with the blessing of state welfare officials. 
 ''Where parents recognize issues they need to address and ask for support before abuse or neglect takes place, it's a great thing,'' said Erwin McEwen, Illinois director of child and family services. 
 In the Chicago area, Safe Families has placed more than 1,200 children, helping out single mothers who are suddenly homeless, fleeing domestic violence or, in one case, seeking a home for a baby born in prison while the mother served out her term. 
 Richard Wexler, director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, criticized the removal of children from homes with no evidence of abuse. ''Volunteers could bring the respite to the mom's home by baby-sitting or mentoring there, instead of taking the children away,'' he said. 
 Mr. Anderson said some Safe Families programs were planning to experiment with in-home mentoring, but stressed that all the parents involved had decided themselves that they needed a break from child-rearing to get back on their feet. 
 Removing children from parents should be avoided when possible, experts in child welfare agree. Placing them with relatives is next best, but when there are no acceptable alternatives, encouraging contact between parent and child during the separation, and friendship between the two families, can minimize the trauma, said Peter J. Pecora, director of research with Casey Family Programs, a nonprofit group in Seattle that develops child welfare programs. 
 Safe Families must deal with many of the safety and legal concerns of foster care. It makes background checks of potential hosts, visits homes to make sure things are going well and carries insurance in case of accidents. Mr. McEwen said he had not heard of any safety problems or other complaints in Illinois. 
 Legal arrangements vary: in Illinois, parents must sign over formal guardianship, while Indiana requires only a temporary placement agreement, with power of attorney granted for emergency medical decisions. 
 In Chicago, Safe Families expects to place 1,000 children this year, for average stays of 45 days. Administrative costs total $350,000 a year, with $100,000 coming from the state and the rest from churches and foundations. If those children ended up in foster care instead, Mr. Anderson noted, the cost to the public would be millions. 
 In Indianapolis, where several dozen children have been placed in the last year, and elsewhere, the group screens the children and does not take those with major behavioral problems, who need trained therapists. 
 Ideally, and as often happens, Mr. Anderson said, the hosts ''become like extended family,'' helping mothers and staying in touch with the children. 
 Such ties appear likely in the case of Brenda Bailey, 51, of Indianapolis, who has lung disease and lost her lease in October. She moved into a women's shelter but could not provide for her sons, then ages 10, 16 and 17. 
 ''I decided the kids would be better off without me,'' she said, recalling the night she took handfuls of Valium. But when she woke up the next morning, she said, she swore she would reunite the family. 
 Her middle son moved in with an older half-sister, while the oldest and youngest sons were taken in by Safe Families. Then Ms. Bailey's lung collapsed, requiring months of recovery. Her youngest son, Elijah, now 11, stayed with one family for four months, and in February moved into the suburban home of his gym teacher, J. T. Crook, and his wife, Samantha. Ms. Bailey, largely recovered and planning to rent an apartment, has become friends with the Crooks, and agreed that Elijah would stay with them until school ends, then spend weekends with them in the summer. 
 Ms. Parahams, the woman seeking a fresh start, used her month away from her four children to finish a job-preparation course. On April 20, she started work with the Census Bureau, and three days later, her children moved into her new home. 
 The families that looked after her children, she said, ''helped me at a time of great need.'' 
 ''They showed real love, which is all you need,'' Ms. Parahams said.

HEADLINE: Mets Alerted on Citi Field Bonds

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The Mets' trouble on the field may not be the only headache for the team. Higher interest rates may be on the horizon, too.
 On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said that $613 million worth of the municipal bonds that were issued to pay for the construction of Citi Field could be downgraded to junk status. 
 Moody's cited the recent downgrade of Ambac Assurance Corporation, which was hired to guarantee that bondholders are made whole in the event that the Mets miss a debt payment. Now that Ambac has been downgraded to junk status, it is theoretically less able to meet its obligations.
 ''Ambac has been downgraded, and they are less able to meet their contracts,'' said Andrew Cleary, an associate analyst at Moody's.
 Moody's did not foresee the Mets missing any interest payments, but the team will have to decide how to compensate for Ambac's weaker rating, Cleary said.
 The 40-year bonds sold in August 2006 have a coupon rate of 5 percent. They are rated by Moody's at Baa3, the lowest investment grade. If they are downgraded to below investment grade, or junk, the team may have to pay higher interest rates if it issues new debt.
 Another $82.28 million worth of bonds issued this year were not in danger of being downgraded, Moody's said.
 The New York City Industrial Development Agency issued the tax-free and taxable bonds on behalf of the Queens Ballpark Company, which was created to finance the construction of the $800 million stadium.
 The Mets said in a statement: ''This is related specifically to Ambac and is not reflective of anything else related to club business or the strength of the underlying credit. It has no impact on our operations.''

HEADLINE: Detroit's New Mayor Faces A Shortened Honeymoon

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
In replacing their previous mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, voters here have chosen someone as different from him as they could find.
 At 31, Mr. Kilpatrick was the youngest mayor in the city's history when he took office in 2002, a smooth-talking, larger-than-life politician who wore a diamond earring and relished the power and luxuries that came with living in the mayoral mansion. But after lying under oath about an extra-marital affair, he ended up resigning and serving jail time, heaping embarrassment on his troubled hometown.
 Dave Bing, 65, a member of the pro basketball Hall of Fame who was elected on Tuesday, will be the city's oldest mayor. He is a quiet, humble political newcomer who has run an auto parts manufacturing business and vowed to save Detroit money by not collecting a salary. 
 ''You have voted for change,'' Mr. Bing, who played 10 seasons with the Detroit Pistons, told supporters at his victory party late Tuesday. ''I will bring efficiency, transparency, honesty and integrity back to the mayor's office.''
 Mr. Bing ousted the interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., 52 percent to 48 percent in a special mayoral election, the city's first in 79 years; both are Democrats. Mr. Bing was the top vote-getter among 15 candidates in a February primary, but his victory surprised some because polls consistently showed Mr. Cockrel, the former City Council president, leading in recent weeks.
 Mr. Bing also overcame his admission in March that he had made false claims about his educational background.
 Not since 1890 has Detroit elected a political novice as mayor. Never in the city's 308 years has it been led by someone who moved in from the suburbs specifically to run for mayor. And Mr. Bing will be the first Detroit mayor to battle for re-election just three months into the job.
 Winning the election Tuesday allows Mr. Bing to serve only through the end of the year, when Mr. Kilpatrick's term was scheduled to end. The regularly scheduled election in November,and a nonpartisan primary in August, will determine whether he stays in office for a full, four-year term.
 That quirk means Mr. Bing will face pressure to produce results quickly, something Mr. Cockrel apparently failed to do in the eyes of most voters during his seven months as interim mayor. Just 14 percent of the city's registered voters cast ballots Tuesday, about half the average rate for a municipal election, meaning busier polls in August or November could produce different results.
 But Wednesday morning, Mr. Bing, who is expected to be sworn in next week, tried to assure residents that he was focused on fixing Detroit's problems rather than on re-election.
 Mr. Bing faces challenges like curbing violent crime, reducing one of the nation's highest unemployment rates, cleaning up trash and fixing thousands of burned-out streetlights. The recession and the tumult at City Hall have stalled revitalization efforts downtown after years of progress, and the annual Detroit auto show, the city's biggest economic event, is threatening to move to the suburbs after the City Council refused to let a regional authority fix up the downtown convention center.
 Mr. Bing said Wednesday that reviving the convention center project and seeking regional cooperation were top priorities.
 ''Everybody's got to think differently,'' he said on the public radio show ''The Takeaway.'' ''We have to come together. We can't continue to operate in a microcosm and say it's Detroit against the world. We need help, and I'm going to reach out as best I can.''
 To achieve his goals, Mr. Bing will be working with Mr. Cockrel, who will resume his duties on the City Council. Mr. Cockrel is expected to be among those trying to unseat Mr. Bing.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the new mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing, overstated the historical significance of his election on Tuesday. While Mr. Bing was elected in his first try for political office, he is not the first political novice since 1890 to win the post. Jerome P. Cavanaugh was elected mayor in 1961, having never run for office before.

HEADLINE: Market Points to Banks in Need

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
Everyone seems to have taken a stab at predicting which banks will need more capital as a result of the government's stress tests. Few have been on the money -- witness the surprise of the public over Bank of America's $34 billion shortfall. But most analysts ignore one simple, all-encompassing metric: where the banks' shares are trading as a multiple of book value, or assets minus liabilities. This shows what investors think about banks' prospects. 
 Sure, markets have been wrong about the accuracy of book value before. But it can still be a handy guide. After all, the stock market should be the best place to digest all the analysis, guesstimates, rumors and leaks with which investors are being bombarded. It indicates that investors reckon there are two tiers of banks in the group being tested -- those that can withstand the economic downturn with little problem, and those whose health will need to be bolstered. 
 Seven banks in the lower tier traded at discounts ranging from a quarter to half of their per-share book value on Tuesday: Citigroup, Regions Financial, Capital One, Fifth Third, SunTrust, Bank of America and KeyCorp. Clearly shareholders are wary of how these banks value their assets, reckon losses will be overwhelming, are expecting a common equity issue that will dilute their stakes, or are expecting a mix of all three. 
 Eleven others are all trading around or above book value, implying investors feel they're relatively safe, including those that some press reports say will need to raise more capital, like PNC and Wells Fargo. GMAC, the 19th institution subject to the stress tests, does not trade publicly.
 Capital ratios don't play much of a role in distinguishing between the two tiers. In fact, Bank of America and Citi aside, the lower-tier firms have some of the best tangible common equity ratios of the 19. Instead, the stock market seems to give a higher ranking to banks that have posted fewer losses and manage to earn money without the help of a boost from too many one-time items. 
 In short, the market seems to be doing its job of separating the wheat from the chaff. 
 Asian Funds Rise
 Greenwich and Mayfair, the hedge fund capitals of the United States and Britain, may be shrinking. But a new hedge fund center is sprouting in Hong Kong. More funds opened than closed in the territory last year, according to the Alternative Investment Management Association. 
 Asia is rich and still growing, so it is little wonder hedge fund start-ups see it as fertile territory. The newcomers fall broadly into two camps -- refugees from investment banks' shrunken proprietary trading desks, and hedge fund managers from big firms whose funds are so far below water that they can earn fees only by starting anew. 
 The opportunity for those who get it right could be huge. Asia-based funds account for just 8 percent of global assets under management. There's also appetite among investors for Asia-focused strategies in nonequity asset classes, like macro and distressed debt. The number of macro strategy start-ups tripled in the region between 2007 and 2008. 
 But raising capital is tough. The Madoff scandal means any new hedge fund faces an uphill struggle to convince investors of its trustworthiness. That may explain why the new Asian hedge funds are not looking to funds-of-hedge-funds for capital. Instead, they tend to be rich individuals who can afford to put in seed capital of their own. Most new funds are around the $20 million to $50 million mark, bankers say. 
 Some new firms have turned to specialist providers of seed capital. But the terms for this type of money are onerous. New managers have to offer favors such as a cut of profits or equity in the parent company, say some fund advisers. Some have even promised new investors ''side letters,'' which give them preferential terms over future investors, like the right to pull money out first while others are locked up tight. 
 That might be the only way to get ahead. But the more special treatment is granted to early investors, the harder it will be for new funds to outgrow their friends-and-family beginnings. Potential clients may be deterred by being given unequal rights. Meanwhile, Asia's relatively shallow markets don't favor big trading bets. This reduces the odds that new megafunds will rise in the East. 
 Still, there's one consolation. Even if Hong Kong isn't the new Mayfair, running a $50 million boutique hedge fund beats being jobless in London or New York.

HEADLINE: Keeping It All in a Day's Work

BYLINE: By SUSAN CATTO

 BODY:
FIRST flight out, last flight back. That's a mantra for Matthew Corrin, a master of the same-day business trip. It's not unusual for Mr. Corrin, the founder and chief executive of Freshii, a chain of health-conscious quick-service restaurants, to start his day before 4 a.m. and get home at midnight or later -- long after he would have gone to bed if he had caught a flight the next day. 
 But Mr. Corrin, who is based in Chicago, is so determined to avoid overnight stays -- both to reduce hotel costs and to minimize time spent away from his wife and 1-year-old daughter -- that he sometimes books flights on multiple airlines in case one is canceled. 
''In bad weather seasons and in instances where I know it's extremely important for me to be back in my city the next day, I hedge my bets,'' Mr. Corrin said.
 That strategy paid off during a business trip to Toronto last fall, when O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was backed up because of stormy weather. Mr. Corrin canceled his United Airlines flight from Pearson International Airport in Toronto to O'Hare, taking a credit, and instead boarded another flight he had arranged on Porter Airlines, from another Toronto airport to Chicago Midway Airport.
 It's not uncommon for business travelers to fly to and from their home airports on the same day, especially when their flights are short and they can meet business commitments early enough to be able to return home at a reasonable hour. 
 But there's another class of travelers who routinely pack into a one-day journey what for most people would constitute an overnight trip, either to save money or to spend more time at home. For them, the usual inconveniences and stresses of travel are compressed and thus magnified. 
 While it is difficult to gauge how much the tough economic times have contributed to an increase in same-day travel, the online travel service Orbitz found in December that more business travelers had reported flying to and from destinations on the same day. 
 An American Express Business Travel spokeswoman, Tracy Paurowski, says more of the company's clients are reducing two-day trips to one.
 Yet while demand for same-day trips may be increasing, airline cutbacks are limiting the number of routes that have early-morning or late-night flights. 
 ''The shuttle between New York and Washington, D.C., still works great, but if you're trying to do a same-day trip between New York and Kansas City, that's become a lot more difficult now,'' said Tom Botts, a partner at Hudson Crossing, a travel advisory firm. (Craziest one-day trip: New York to Paris and back. ''It's possible to do, but it's not for the faint of heart,'' he said.) 
 Every month from February 2008 through February 2009, 24 to 27 percent of trips booked through the Sabre computer reservation system were completed in one day, according to the Sabre ADI database.
 Within that number, there's a dedicated cadre of travelers who wouldn't want to fly any other way. Scott Hanselman, a principal program manager for Microsoft, works remotely from his home in Portland, Ore., and travels often to give lectures and meet with other members of his team, which is scattered around the country. (Craziest one-day trip: a planned 36-hour sprint from Portland to Mexico City and back at the end of this month.) 
 His company would pay for a hotel, Mr. Hanselman said, but as a diabetic and a father of two children under the age of 5, he's more comfortable at home. ''I would rather stay up until 3 in the morning than sleep in a strange bed and show up at noon the next day,'' he said. 
 While Mr. Hanselman, 35, admits that he's not always in peak condition upon his return -- ''the older I get, the more I'm destroyed the next day,'' he said -- he has found ways of making the journeys smoother.
 Like many same-day travelers, he has adopted technologies and habits that can make his long days more pleasant and his connections easier.
 For instance, he travels with a printout of all the flights to his destinations and contact numbers for airlines traveling his route. He also subscribes to cellphone text message alerts from the airlines he's traveling with, so he can be among the first to negotiate alternative flights if there are delays. 
 He carries a portable GPS device and a four-outlet mini-power strip to charge his laptop and cellphone in coffee shops or airports. ''And water,'' he adds, ''two liters a day.'' 
 Likewise, Mr. Corrin has also found ways to simplify his one-day trips. (Craziest one-day trip: Toronto to Los Angeles and back.) He paid a hefty fee to join the elite tier of his business credit card, which gives him membership privileges at a chain of business centers so he can freshen up before meetings. (This is especially important if you've left your house half asleep at dawn, he said.) 
 He subscribes to a portable Internet service -- a wireless card for his laptop -- so he can work securely in cabs and airports, and his BlackBerry is loaded with an application that provides the kind of real-time flight information that helped him rework his Toronto-Chicago plans last fall. 
 But he still gets stranded overnight. ''Those are the lessons, where you regret not packing an extra pair of socks and underwear,'' he said. But for now, Mr. Corrin says he has no plans to end his workday in a hotel any time soon. ''Call me a glutton for pain but it's worth it,'' he said. ''It allows me to get everything I need to do done -- and I save money.''

HEADLINE: Europe and Canada Reach 'Open Skies' Pact on Air Travel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The European Union and Canada agreed on Wednesday to liberalize airline travel between the two regions in a pact that goes further than a similar ''open skies'' agreement between Europe and the United States. 
 The agreement allows airlines from Europe and Canada to fly point-to-point without restrictions. Previously, such arrangements were governed by bilateral agreements, which limited routes, and eight European Union countries did not have such deals. 
 It will also allow European Union investors over time to acquire up to 49 percent of their Canadian rivals; foreign ownership rights had previously been restricted to 25 percent. Ultimately, full ownership rights are envisaged. 
 The United States limited foreign ownership rights at 25 percent in its deal with the European Union, which allows American investors to take 49 percent of European carriers. 
 The deal ''will stimulate aeronautical industrial activity, cut costs and alleviate the administrative burden in air transport,'' leaders from the two sides said in a joint statement signed at a meeting in Prague. 
 The accord also opens the way for more code-sharing agreements, lifts most restrictions governing the setting of ticket prices and establishes a joint committee to adopt and monitor the deal. It will also avoid the need for double checks on safety and security by authorities in Europe and Canada, allowing for joint inspections. 
 It will take effect immediately, but the steps to open up the two markets will be carried out in four phases. No deadlines were immediately provided. 
 In 2007, nine million people traveled between Europe and Canada. Despite the current slump in air travel as a result of the economic downturn, the European Commission estimated that the deal could increase that number by half a million during the first year, generating 72 million euros, or roughly $95 million, in additional business and adding 1,000 jobs, as flights are added between the regions. 
 The agreement between the United States and the European Union, which came into force in March 2008, also allows airlines to serve any point-to-point trans-Atlantic route. 
 That agreement will allow any American carriers to fly among European cities, though not between a pair of cities within an individual country, while European airlines will not be allowed to fly between two American cities.
 This accord is also being carried out in phases, the first of which will automatically end if there is no agreement between negotiators from the United States and the European Union on a second phase of the pact, which is scheduled to be in place by 2010. 
 At the meeting in Prague, Canada and Europe also agreed Wednesday to start talks on a broader trade pact, estimated to be worth more than $27 billion a year, despite a looming trade dispute between the two partners over a European Union ban on seal products. 
 Canada and the European Union first agreed in October 2008 to seek a ''comprehensive economic partnership agreement'' to lift two-way trade by lowering tariffs on goods and services, and encompassing areas like investment, regulatory cooperation and rules of origin. 
 The two sides set a deadline of two years in which to reach the broad deal. It would be the most significant trade agreement for Canada since the North American Free Trade Agreement.

HEADLINE: Schools Chief Bans Hiring Of Teachers From Outside

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Anticipating significant budget cuts to New York City schools in the coming year, Chancellor Joel I. Klein ordered principals on Wednesday to stop hiring teachers from outside the system, a move that will force them to look internally at a pool that, according to an independent report, includes many subpar teachers.
 The Education Department suggested that principals could fill spots with teachers in the so-called absent teacher reserve pool, which includes educators whose jobs have been eliminated because of school closings or downsizing. 
 Mr. Klein's order marked a turnaround for the department, which had resisted efforts to find permanent teaching jobs for the 1,100 teachers in the pool, many of whom came from poor-performing schools and were six times as likely to have received an unsatisfactory rating than teachers not in the pool, according to the independent report. The Education Department had been content to pay their salaries while they worked as substitutes.
 Mr. Klein said the dreary economy had forced him to order the hiring restrictions, which he said were needed to avoid layoffs. The report, released last year by the New Teacher Project, which recruits and trains educators for school systems, estimated that the pool cost the city $81 million over two years.
 The hiring restrictions seem to throw a wrench into what has been a hallmark of Mr. Klein's education reform efforts: giving principals the freedom to hire educators of their choice as they try to create high-performing schools.
 Education officials said that vision had not been undermined. They said that as principals trim their budgets, less experienced teachers are likely to be cut and placed in the reserve pool, giving principals more hiring options. And principals will still be able to hire teachers seeking to transfer.
 Under the restrictions, the city will no longer hire thousands of teachers for the start of school in September, though they may make exceptions for teachers who specialize in high-needs areas like bilingual special education. 
 In 2008, the city hired 5,725 teachers, including about 2,000 rookie teachers from programs like Teach for America or the city's Teaching Fellows program. Larry Becker, who oversees human resources for the school system, said the city expected a large enough demand in certain high-needs areas that it could still hire about half the number of teachers it usually does from Teach for America and the Teaching Fellows program.
 Timothy Daly, who runs the New Teacher Project, said he was worried that principals would no longer be able to find the best fits for their schools.
 ''Schools are going to have great teachers who they would like to hire, who they won't be able to hire,'' Mr. Daly said. ''It can't be best for kids.''
 Mr. Klein said his staff would closely monitor the availability of teachers in the pool and could lift the ban if, say, there were not enough teachers there who specialized in science or special education.
 Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union, said she was pleased that the department was encouraging the use of reserve teachers. ''I give them credit for seeing what a waste of talent and money this is, and for actually now switching gears,'' Ms. Weingarten said. 
 The reserve pool was created in a pact between the city and the teachers' union that ended seniority rights in staffing decisions and stopped the automatic transfer of teachers whose positions were eliminated. 
 School officials had said they would rather absorb the cost of the teachers in the pool than force principals to accept teachers they did not want. Last year, education officials, after negotiating with the union, agreed to make up the difference between the salaries for experienced teachers and rookie teachers.
 Mr. Klein said the hiring restrictions, which do not apply to new schools, was better than allowing layoffs, which would mean cutting teachers in order of seniority and essentially restoring forced placement of teachers in schools. 
 Mr. Klein has been giving principals more oversight of school staffing and budgets. In exchange, principals are punished or rewarded for their progress in creating high-performing teams and institutions.
 Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for the principals' union, said Mr. Klein's decision was ''fiscally prudent.''
 ''If this were the way it was going to be permanently, we would be concerned,'' she said. ''But we know that it is temporary, and there's going to be give-and-take from all of us right now.''

HEADLINE: Always in Her Element

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
LEGENDS die hard around Norma Kamali. In the fantasies of longtime fans, she is a 1970s-era disco siren, stalking into Studio 54 on dagger heels. Others imagine a vixen with darkly fetishistic leanings. Myths have sprung up, too, around Ms. Kamali's designs, especially her puffer coat, made, it was reported, from the sleeping bag she curled up in at night after her divorce. 
 Embellished over time, such stories make her smile. But over tea last week near her shop on West 56th Street, Ms. Kamali was prepared to set the record straight. Her disco days are decades behind her, she said. And, despite an archive that includes studded skirts and bondage-wrapped playwear, she does not harbor a fondness for latex and lace. 
 As for that fabled sleeping-bag coat: After splitting with her husband, Mohammed (Eddie) Kamali, in the mid-1970s, she took to camping in the woods with a boyfriend. ''It was cold,'' she recalled, ''and I was always getting up at night to go to the bathroom.'' On one particularly nippy night, she threw on her sleeping bag and sprinted for the bush. ''As I was running,'' she said, ''I was thinking, 'I need to put sleeves in this thing.' '' 
 The rest is rag-trade history. Variations of that seminal Kamali design have inspired generations of puffy down coats. An emblem of urban survivalist chic, the original spiked in popularity after 9/11. ''When it really looked like slim pickings for selling anything, we were making sleeping-bag coats out of every piece of fabric we had,'' Ms. Kamali recalled. ''That coat is what kept us in business.'' 
 Even now, it appears to be recession-proof. Much like Ms. Kamali herself. An enduring presence in an industry that has brusquely disposed of many of her peers, she has hung onto her business and to OMO (On My Own), her gallerylike Manhattan flagship, through more than three decades and several economic downturns. Fashion's current infatuation with the 1980s has sparked a run on her vintage designs. And her updated spin on Grecian draped jerseys and sexy fleece activewear, priced to sell at every level of the marketplace -- including Wal-Mart, of all places -- have made Ms. Kamali a go-to designer for lean times.
 At 63, she remains ''one of those perennial American favorites, with both the general shopper looking for style at a great price and the hardcore fashionista who wants that special something,'' said Constance White, the style director of eBay, where vintage Kamali pieces are steadily sought after. 
 The auction site could double as a catalog of Ms. Kamali's pioneering concepts. They include cocoon-wrap fleece coats, backless jersey jumpsuits and a ruched one-shoulder dress. More unexpected is a little black shirtdress made of stretch jersey, which sold for $39, nearly double its original price at Wal-Mart, where Ms. Kamali's designs made their debut 15 months ago, showcased in more than 400 stores under the NK for Wal-Mart label. 
 Her innovations include a string of minifilms taped in the early 1980s, precursors to contemporary fashion videos. Around that time she dispensed with major runway shows. (''They seemed so old-fashioned to me,'' she said.) As far back as 1996, she introduced a company Web site. And in 2005, well before such partnerships became an industry commonplace, she teamed with Everlast and Spiegel to sell modestly priced capsule collections. But of all her endeavors, Ms. Kamali's collaboration with Wal-Mart is perhaps the most audacious. 
 First, she has seen fit to work with a discounting behemoth that has fared disastrously with fashion in the past. A dreary Mark Eisen collection in 2006 failed ignominiously.
 Ms. Kamali has also bet -- correctly, to judge by her Wal-Mart best sellers -- that admirers of her batwing fleece jackets, pinup-worthy swimsuits and shape-shifting jersey tunics will buy modified versions of those cutting-edge styles from a merchant of pork chops and pans.
 Wal-Mart declined to provide sales figures but said that the sporty looks were the top sellers in the NK line, which is licensed through the Cherokee apparel group. A swimsuit collection will appear in mid-June. 
 Perhaps most significantly, Ms. Kamali is offering career-wear and activewear for $20 or less, prices that steeply undercut comparable items by Vera Wang for Kohl's or Matthew Williamson for H&M. Her decision to partner with Wal-Mart ''is radical, but not too surprising'' said David Wolfe, the creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts fashion and retail trends. ''Her thinking has always been out of the box, even at times outrageously subversive.'' 
 Ms. Kamali insists she is not hiding a defiant streak. ''I'm pretty transparent,'' she said. ''What you see is what there is.'' 
 What you see, peering at her closely for signs of wear, is a sultry hybrid of Vargas vamp and comely vestal priestess draped in a one-shoulder tunic of her own design. Her milky skin and toned physique are, she indicated, the products of unyielding discipline -- that and lots of green tea, rigorous workouts at the gym and weekly tai chi sessions with her staff in Central Park.
 When she talks about her beauty secrets, Ms. Kamali exudes a girl-to-girl warmth that belies an impatience and flinty tenacity. She never has had much use, she said, for the orthodoxies of her trade. ''The idea of branding, we have to rethink that,'' she said. ''Sometimes a label only gets in the way.''
 As a way to feel out the marketplace, she offers a small selection of Kamali designs, cherry-picked by her staff -- and minus a label -- to a handful of indie boutiques. 
 She also tests the market by selling Kamali designs at private parties across the country. Participants selling more than $10,000 worth of merchandise get half back, Ms. Kamali said. ''It's as if you were a wholesale account.'' And, for the designer, part of a growing grass-roots sales force. 
 At times her maverick streak has raised hackles in the industry. After a much publicized imbroglio with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, in 1987, Ms. Kamali was fined $10,000 by the state Labor Department for illegally employing workers to cut and sew for her at home. She paid the fine, then shut down her wholesale operation; and, in a move that further inflamed union sentiments, moved a portion of her manufacturing to Italy. 
 Two years ago, in a dispute over pricing (Ms. Kamali wanted to go cheaper), she severed ties with Everlast. As a retailer once anonymously remarked, ''She's a tiger when it comes to doing business.'' 
 Ms. Kamali, who says she has never had a business partner or investor, and will not disclose her earnings, is the first to acknowledge that she can be fearsomely uncompromising. ''I struggle with fit,'' she said of working with the suppliers of her Wal-Mart line. ''I thought those people were, like, going to put a hit out on me because I was so relentless.''
 Early in her career, which began to thrive in 1974, when she started selling her designs at her upstairs shop on Madison Avenue, Ms. Kamali, a native of Manhattan, made her name as a fashion world MacGyver. A nimble thinker, she improvised many of her looks from commonplace materials: jumpsuits snipped from parachute silk, with rip cords intact; evening dresses reminiscent of Hollywood's Golden Age made from gold lame curtains; a kimono fashioned from an Appalachian quilt; and bloomers, ballet skirts and tunics cut from lowly sweatshirt fabric. 
 Snobbery is as alien to Ms. Kamali as the little bourgeois sheaths and matching handbags that, even in the '60s, she never could bring herself to wear. 
 ''She's never been depressed by working with inexpensive fabrics,'' said Caroline Rennolds Milbank, a fashion historian. ''She's put as much design effort into something made with sweatshirt material as she has with matte jersey.''
 That 1980 fleece collection, which introduced the notion of activewear as everyday clothing, was itself the product of an economic downturn, Ms. Kamali recalled. ''It came out of people needing to have something that was affordable but fun.'' 
 Working with Wal-Mart takes her back to her improvisational roots. Her designs for the chain are tweaked, streamlined versions of the styles she sells through OMO and Bergdorf Goodman, which carries Kamali swimsuits. She confines the plunging necklines, effusive draping and geometric cutouts that define her high-end looks mostly to her New York shop. 
 But, she said: ''I haven't compromised anything. If I think of something as lesser, it's insulting to the consumer.'' Even some of the fabrics, she added, are like those of her signature label. 
 When the NK line was unveiled last year at Wal-Mart in Westbury, N.Y., customers rushed past store clerks and models in skyscraper platforms to greet the designer. 
 ''I cried,'' Ms. Kamali recalled. ''People were asking me to sign their receipts -- $30 sales slips. It was cool.''

HEADLINE: Increasingly, It's a Tight Squeeze in the Air

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
THEY have less headroom, legroom and elbowroom than wide-body jets, but smaller planes are playing a growing role in American air travel, whether business travelers like it or not. 
 With fewer people flying as the economy has slowed, airlines are increasingly using smaller jets and turboprops known as regional aircraft, or planes with 100 or fewer seats, flown by airlines like American Eagle, United Express, Comair and Pinnacle.
 Three-quarters of the airports in the United States are now served entirely by smaller aircraft, according to the Regional Airline Association. The number of passengers on regional aircraft has grown about 40 percent since 2003, and although traffic for all carriers fell in 2008, regional planes still make up half of all flights and carry 23 percent of passengers, according to the association. 
 ''If you're not in the top 12 hub cities, you're most likely on a regional jet,'' said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com. ''If you're not in a top 70 city, you're probably on a prop.'' 
 Smaller planes allow airlines to fly to cities that might not warrant larger planes, particularly in a shrinking economy, or that are unable to accommodate wide-body jets. They also allow airlines to schedule more flights per day because their turnaround time is faster than that of larger jets. 
 Regional planes ''have been a huge benefit for the consumer because it's one ticket, one Web site visit, you get the frequent flier miles, and you can connect to flights all over the globe,'' said Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association. ''In many cases, the R.J.'s are newer'' than wide-body jets, he said, and furthermore ''they can get into airports that larger airplanes can't.''
 Business travelers like Richard Reinhardt might be less than enthusiastic about flying on smaller planes, but they are learning to cope. A management consultant from Memphis, Mr. Reinhardt, 64, travels two weeks each month, flying to places like Pensacola, Fla.; Joplin, Mo.; and Beaumont, Tex.
 Whenever possible he books on Northwest Airlink and other regional carriers that fly nonstop, to avoid changing planes in hubs like Atlanta or Chicago (traveling to some destinations can still require connecting at a hub, regardless of whether you are taking a regional or major carrier).
 But smaller planes have disadvantages. They often have only one class of service, even for passengers with a business- or first-class ticket who are connecting to a flight to, say, London. 
 And as Richard Strauss, president of Strauss Radio Strategies, a public relations firm in Washington, has learned, regional planes often park far from jumbo jets at airports like Washington Dulles International, so connecting with an international flight can more often mean changing terminals. To avoid mishaps, Mr. Strauss, who says he flies about twice a month, tries to leave more time between connections. ''If you're taking a small plane to connect to an international flight, you can miss your flight,'' Mr. Strauss said. And standby seats are harder to come by on smaller planes, he added. 
 Lack of personal space is another problem. ''I used to do a lot of work on the plane, but if I'm on a smaller regional jet, you can't plan on doing any work because you can barely use your arms,'' Mr. Reinhardt said. 
 Aisle seats are a must, he said, adding that ''if the person next to you is asking for an extender belt, you want to find another seat.'' Mr. Reinhardt also says he sits in the front of the plane so he does not have to wait, stooped over in the back, for others to disembark. 
 Storage limitations on smaller aircraft can also contribute to delays. Many airlines have begun charging $15 or more for checking bags, so more passengers are choosing the carry-on option. But regional flights lack adequate room in the cabin for some of those bags, so passengers must sometimes check them as they board and wait for them on the tarmac or in the jetway after the flight has landed. To avoid these delays, Mr. Reinhardt says, he packs light and uses a collapsible garment bag that just fits in the overhead bins on smaller planes.
 Despite these drawbacks, Mr. Reinhardt says he appreciates the fact that regional aircraft allow him to fly nonstop to hard-to-reach places. But flights of more than two hours test his patience.
 Indeed, the United Express flight from San Antonio to San Francisco on a regional jet is just under four hours. The US Airways flight from Memphis to Phoenix, operated by Mesa Air, lasts about 3 hours and 27 minutes. Often, the only way to fly on a larger jet on such routes is to connect through another city, making the trip longer, sometimes much longer. 
 In fact, regional aircraft are increasingly flying longer trips. In 2008, they flew 461 miles per flight on average, 23 percent farther than they did in 2003, according to the Regional Airline Association.
 And those collecting frequent flier points can take advantage of those miles. Through code-sharing agreements, passengers on regional planes accrue mileage just as they do on larger aircraft, although some airlines like American have eliminated the 500-mile minimum award per flight.
 When booking travel, flights on regional aircraft are easy to spot. Tickets sold online will include the words ''operated by'' beside flight details. And ''if it's being operated by an airline you've never heard of, it's a pretty good bet it's a regional carrier,'' said Tom Botts, a partner at Hudson Crossing, a travel industry consultant in New York.
 Sometimes choosing between a major and a regional carrier comes down to where you live. 
 Some fliers, particularly on the East Coast, can choose from several airports. A New Jersey traveler, for instance, could drive to Philadelphia or Newark to catch a flight on a larger jet, if that was a priority. 
 Most people, though, must decide between flying on a larger plane and flying nonstop. Many business travelers say that avoiding a stopover is the way to go.
 ''At the end of the day, if I can fly nonstop from La Guardia'' to Jacksonville, Fla., ''instead of schlepping through Atlanta, I'll take that any day,'' Mr. Botts said.
 Still, he said, flying on regional aircraft means that ''you do spend a lot of quality time with your arm touching the person next to you.''

HEADLINE: In These Halls of Power, Earplugs Are Required

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
The ultimate source of power in New York is a perennial and profoundly puzzling question. Some say it is wielded by a banking cabal; others by a fraternity of real estate developers. Tradition holds that power flows downward from the mayor and his aides in City Hall; cynicism that it has always bubbled up, often from the covert machinations of unions or the mob.
 But for 20 percent of New York City, real power -- 1,300 megawatts a day -- comes from the 9,000-square-foot turbine room at the Astoria generating station, a huge industrial plant that burns each day like a tiki torch at the lonely farthest edge of northern Queens. Six stories high and barnacled on the floor with hulking steam-fed engines, the room brings electrical convenience to a sweeping half-moon of the city that extends more or less from Myrtle Avenue in Queens to the stands of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. 
 ''It's pretty impressive,'' said Tom O'Connor, the plant manager for the U.S. Power Generating Company, a large man with a hard hat and a soft-spoken manner. Electrical men are known to have a wolflike self-possession and a low-watt sense of humor. They grin and nod and don't say much. They like to joke that their transformers are always humming mostly because they can't remember the words. 
 Such natural composure is due to daily dealings with obstreperous machinery that does not take kindly to a rough or jittery touch. The turbine room -- of a 1950s vintage -- is loud enough that your brain shakes in your head despite protective earplugs; it is large enough that its employees do not walk -- or even run -- to cross it; they ride a three-wheel bike. 
 Consider New York's power supply as coming from a giant boiling kettle. Every day, 80,000 gallons of fresh water rush down from reservoirs upstate. The water fills boilers, 10 stories high, which heat the liquid to 2,500 degrees and pressurize it to 2,000 pounds per square inch. The steam produced turns the turbines at speeds approaching 4,000 revolutions a minute. The turbines drive generators, which are housed in metal cases, and the generators plug into Con Edison's sprawling grid. 
 ''It's the real world,'' Mr. O'Connor said, a world of watts and voltage, of natural gas and gantry cranes, where, when things go wrong, there is no time for stimulus plans or bailouts. ''When things go wrong'' is a category that on any given morning might include disasters from a blackout to an electrical explosion. On foggy days, for instance, the air collects electrons, which are sometimes trapped near the transformers. ''It's sort of like plugging in your toaster and getting a small shock,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''Except this shock's not so small.''
 There are, of course, precautionary measures, mostly seen to by men in the control room, a little, glassed-in alcove off the turbine room. But then there is that goofy, understated, stoic sense of humor (for example, former Con Edison employees are known as ex-Cons), which is itself a version of defense.
 ''We know what we're doing here,'' said Mr. O'Connor, who agreed that economic or political clout has little to do with power in the real world.
 ''You don't understand what power really is,'' he said, ''until one of those safety valves pops open with 2,000 pounds of pressurized steam. It's humbling. That's the only word I know of to describe it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 12, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Rooms feature in some editions on Thursday, about the turbine room at the Astoria generating station in Queens, referred incorrectly to the amount of power it produces. It has a maximum capacity of 1,300 megawatts -- not 1,300 megawatts a day. (A megawatt measures the rate of energy generation; ''megawatts per day'' is not a valid unit for measuring power output.)

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Measure to Reduce Home Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would expand federal efforts to prevent mortgage foreclosures, shield mortgage service companies from lawsuits if they participate in federal loan modification programs, and give renters of foreclosed properties at least 90 days' notice before eviction. 
 The bill included an expansion of federal efforts to combat homelessness, which has risen during the economic downturn. 
 The Senate bill, however, did not include Democrats' most ambitious proposal to aid troubled homeowners: a provision that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of primary mortgages. That provision, championed by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, failed last week to get the 60 votes needed to advance. 
 The broader housing measure, which the Senate approved on Wednesday, 91 to 5, must now be reconciled with similar legislation approved by the House in March. The House version included the bankruptcy provision but the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said it would be removed. 
 So far, the federal programs to reduce foreclosures have largely fallen flat, particularly the Hope for Homeowners program approved by Congress last summer. Only one mortgage was modified under the program, which lawmakers had hoped would help as many as 400,000 homeowners. 
 The new Senate bill does not include additional money to aid mortgage borrowers, but it does draw $2.3 billion from the Treasury's $700 billion financial bailout fund for various provisions. 
 The bill also would increase the borrowing authority for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to $100 billion from $30 billion, a move that will save banks billions of dollars by reducing the extra premiums that they would have had to pay to shore up the deposit insurance fund. 
 The bill also extends through 2013 the $250,000 maximum value of deposits insured by the F.D.I.C. Before the financial crisis, the maximum amount insured had been $100,000. 
 ''This bill is principally designed to provide that long sought-for relief for people who are facing foreclosure,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said at a news conference after the vote. ''The bill does other things, but certainly, a major target is to deal with peoples' housing issues and try to stem the tide.'' 
 Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, a main proponent of the bill, had a strong role in the homeless prevention provisions and others that would give the Treasury secretary more latitude in deciding when to use taxpayer money to buy stock in financial institutions receiving bailout assistance. 
 Mr. Reed, at the news conference with Mr. Dodd, stressed the effort to fight homelessness. ''We're facing the greatest crisis in homelessness since the Great Depression,'' he said, citing news accounts of tent cities appearing. 
 The Senate bill would provide $2.2 billion for homelessness assistance and up to $440 million for prevention.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Recovery Chief to Leave

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Edward J. Blakely, the New Orleans recovery director, who was given enormous power to steer the city's rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina, will leave his city government post this summer after two and a half years, he told The Times-Picayune on Wednesday. 
 When he was hired, Mr. Blakely, a former chairman of the department of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, was known as a prominent expert on post-disaster recovery, and he freely proclaimed his own importance to the city. But many residents quickly grew frustrated with the slow pace of rebuilding.
 Mr. Blakely, who was chairman of urban and regional planning at the University of Sydney, in Australia, and commuted from there despite his $150,000 city salary, quickly came under scrutiny for spending time away from the city while neighborhoods languished. 
 In recent news interviews he has defended his record, saying almost all of the federal block grant money has been allocated and 400 rebuilding projects were in the pipeline. Mr. Blakely did not return phone calls to his office on Wednesday. 
 Ceeon Quiett, a spokeswoman for Mayor C. Ray Nagin, said the projects ranged from playgrounds to the restoration of the Mahalia Jackson Theater for the Performing Arts, which reopened in January. 
 In November, Mr. Nagin announced that he would begin dismantling the Office of Development and Recovery Administration, an agency formed to consolidate Mr. Blakely's power over multiple aspects of rebuilding. 
 But Ms. Quiett said criticism of him was unfair. ''Unless you have walked in those shoes, you cannot grade that it was too slow, too fast, pass or fail,'' she said. ''We are a model for other cities in disaster response and recovery.''

HEADLINE: New Inks Cut Costs Of Office Color Printing

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Xerox thinks it has hit on something big to breathe life into the ailing market for high-volume office printers: It's called color. 
 After years of research, Xerox will release the first in a new series of large machines this month that it claims will change the economics of printing large volumes of color documents at offices. Unlike traditional laser printers that use cartridges of powdery, sometimes messy toner, the revamped products rely on hunks of ink that remain solid at room temperature and then melt when heated. 
 Xerox, based in Norwalk, Conn., bills the solid ink technology, which lets it create machines with fewer parts, as the biggest shift in the industry since it sold the first laser printer in 1977. 
 ''This is something they have been working on for forever and a day,'' said Brian Bissett, the editor of the MFP Report, a publication about office printers and copiers. ''It does have the potential to be fairly important.''
 Traditionally, printer makers have charged big corporate customers a per-page fee for printing services: up to 8 cents a page for a color document and less than 2 cents a page for black-and-white. 
 Xerox and its main competitors, Canon and Ricoh, typically bill customers for a color page if there is any pigment on it, whether it's a full-color replica of a slide from a presentation or a page that just has a colorful company logo and mostly black text. 
 Because of the higher cost, only about 15 percent of the more than two trillion documents printed every year in offices worldwide use color. 
 ''This isn't because people don't like color but because there have been lots of barriers to color,'' said Ursula M. Burns, the president of Xerox. ''The last barrier is that it's expensive.''
 With its new ColorQube solid ink systems, Xerox says it can pull the average cost of color documents down to about 3 cents a page. A portion of the price break comes from better tracking of how much color is used on a page. But the principal breakthrough with the solid ink technology stems from the overall simplicity of the machine's innards. Solid ink machines need about one-third as many parts as laser printers, which require various mechanisms to fuse toner onto paper that must be replaced over time, adding materials and services costs. 
 And instead of putting clunky cartridges of toner into the printers, customers just pop in the sticks of ink. Once that ink runs out, another stick goes in, and there's nothing that needs to be thrown away or recycled. Over all, Xerox claims that it takes about 272 pounds of material to produce one million pages with a solid ink machine versus 965 pounds of material with a competing laser product.
 Hewlett-Packard has tried to disrupt the high-volume printer market with a different type of innovation: its Edgeline machines run on liquid ink instead of toner. Software and hardware tracking systems within the Edgeline products also make it possible to offer customers different prices per page based on how much color ink is actually consumed. 
 However, analysts say that H.P. is at a disadvantage because the technology is unfamiliar and because H.P. lacks the sales reach of Xerox in this category.

HEADLINE: Facebook Status? In Town and Wondering What to Do

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
IN sailors' parlance, it's called local knowledge -- the invaluable and detailed insights into a location's prevailing winds, hidden shoals and tricky tides and currents, accumulated through firsthand experience. Without it, visiting mariners can find themselves in peril. 
 Business travelers, whether they are government workers, small-business owners, entrepreneurs or professionals, need to tap into specific and timely intelligence as well. They are increasingly doing so through social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Yelp, using the expertise and wisdom of the residents of places they visit to help them find their way around.
 Whether they are heading to Bangor or Bangkok in search of an obscure boutique hotel, a vegan restaurant or professional contacts, business travelers say social networking offers benefits that no travel agent, tourist Web site or guidebook can match.
 ''I find social media invaluable,'' said Ruth Clark, who designs and sews custom clothing for wheelchair users and runs her business from Kamloops, British Columbia. ''It enables me to meet people from around the world who have an interest in my work.'' 
 Thanks to social networking, on a trip to California she found out about an evening lecture at Stanford University and through online contacts was invited to the program and the dinner beforehand.
 While attending a conference in Charlotte, N.C., for six days, Ms. Clark stayed with three hosts she had met through the Web site CouchSurfing.com and said she planned to do business with two of them.
 For Daniel Winslow, a law partner with Duane Morris in Boston, entertaining current and potential clients demands detailed knowledge of cities from Hanoi to Miami. He travels one week a month and has been using Yelp for a year, typically twice a week to set up appointments and to research the best places to meet.
 ''I got hooked on Yelp as a way to find places on the road, and even in Boston, for clients,'' he said. ''For example, I needed to find a vegan restaurant for a Hollywood actor who was in Boston shooting a TV pilot. Even though I live here, I'm not vegan and so I had no idea where to take him, but Yelp helped me find a great place. Part of the feel of any meeting is the feel of the restaurant, especially for a first meeting. So much of client development is the social aspect.'' 
 Mr. Winslow said he had ''no clue'' about how to ferret out such information away from Boston. ''Our firm has 25 offices worldwide, so it's been a great resource on the road,'' he said. 
 In a tough economy, clients also want to be reassured that their dollars will be carefully spent, which he signals by meeting them in affordable restaurants that offer good value, not $50 steaks, he said, adding, ''People aren't interested in hiring the gold-plated lawyer.''
 James Benham, president of the software consulting firm JBKnowledge, based in College Station, Tex., travels often to Argentina, where he employs eight people in the northwestern city of Salta. He says he relies heavily on LinkedIn and uses Facebook and Twitter to find and increase business. 
 These sites also help him stay in touch with acquaintances. Whenever he departs for an out-of-state event or meeting, Mr. Benham posts this information, enabling friends, colleagues and clients to contact him wherever he is that day. 
 Clients do respond, often resulting in new business, he said. ''I'm very careful with my time, but I do attribute sales to my use of these sites thanks to my visibility to my client base there,'' he said, estimating that 5 percent of his revenue this year had come from social media contacts.
 Meanwhile, frequent e-mail messages keep him close to the clients he doesn't often see in person. And in some cultures, like Latin America, the gradual cultivation of personal relationships before doing business is more important than it is in the United States, Mr. Benham said. 
 More introverted people need to reach out consistently, he added. ''You have to 'friend' everyone you meet,'' he said. ''You have to have a lot of contacts. I'm that guy on the airplane who tries to meet everyone on the plane and get to know them.''
 Along with this proliferation of business contacts, however, can come the need for privacy. Mr. Benham, who has also been using Twitter since December, says he limits the personal details that he shares and reads. ''I'm not interested in your daily life,'' he said. ''I am intensely interested, though, in the important things in your life and in how you think.''
 Mr. Benham, who has more than 300 connections on LinkedIn, said social media had given him ''a good way to stay in touch with them and know what's going on with them.'' 
 ''I try to treat every person I meet as someone who can have an impact on my life, even in a 10-minute airport conversation. Because I've kept up with them through social media, they become good friends or good business relationships.''
 Kelly Fallis of Toronto, who runs an interior design business and also stages homes for the real estate market, says she constantly uses social media. ''I have two companies that exist virtually, one with 10 people, the other with 40,'' she said, referring to employees who work outside the office. Social-networking sites are important to her because her clients send her photos of their homes, and she offers advice over the Internet.
 ''Social media sites enable me to have a presence to clients, accounts and staff alike,'' she said. ''It doesn't matter where I am, but they know I'm there and they are connected to me via these sites.'' 
 Social networking can also take some of the loneliness out of business travel by fostering spontaneous gatherings. ''Sites like Twitter and Facebook are genius for people who don't like business travel,'' Ms. Fallis said, ''as suddenly you've gone from sitting in a hotel bar alone after work to having an engaging dinner with an old friend or potential client.''
 You can start with your Facebook status line, which lets the world know what you're doing. ''Beyond arranging plans, if you need an answer to something or are looking for a person who does X, changing your status to a question is incredibly helpful,'' Ms. Fallis said.
 For instance, if you're in New York and ask on your status line how to find a retail store that sells carpet, ''suddenly you'll have 10 fans/followers write back and say, 'Check out X,' '' Ms. Fallis said. ''You can have three on-the-spot meetings that you couldn't possibly have set up that quickly if you tried.
 ''We live in a world where new products and services are created daily, so it's next to impossible to have your finger on every pulse.'' 
 Sarah Browne, a networking strategist based in Carmel, Calif., who travels often on business, said social media had made her ''look smarter'' to her clients.
 ''Staying relevant and delivering relevant information to my clients is a huge part of my success on the road,'' she said. On an overnight trip to Denver, for example, Ms. Browne used Twitter to gather information from locals before she arrived. ''People are shooting you links that can steer you to something you might never find,'' she said.
 Albert Ko, 24, who runs CheapCheapCheap.com, a Web site for bargain hunters, relies heavily on Twitter, gathering helpful business intelligence from, and setting up meetings with, his 2,000 contacts. ''I use it a lot to form tweetups,'' or meetings where fellow Twitter users spontaneously gather, he said. He also uses his network to re-tweet, or spread his message through his users' individual networks, thereby creating local viral campaigns wherever he is visiting.
 ''By meeting just one person, you can reach thousands of people,'' he said. ''Even one re-tweet can be really powerful.''

HEADLINE: Group Renews Fight for Same-Sex Marriage in California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
As the California Supreme Court mulls the fate of a 2008 ballot measure outlawing same-sex marriage, one of the state's largest gay rights groups is laying the groundwork for a campaign to overturn the measure, perhaps as soon as next year. 
 The announcement by the group, Equality California, comes almost a year after the court's initial decision to legalize same-sex marriage, a ruling that voters negated in November when they passed the ballot measure, Proposition 8. The proposition has since been challenged in court, but gay rights advocates worry the court will uphold it, and are preparing for the next stage of the fight. 
 ''We're hoping the court rules the right way, but we're not counting on it,'' said Marc Solomon, Equality California's newly hired marriage director. ''And we believe that 2010 is the right time to go back to the ballot.''
 The possibility of a ballot measure to overturn Proposition 8 has been floated online and elsewhere since the election, but the announcement is a concrete signal that California might soon be embroiled in another electoral fight over same-sex marriage. The November campaign ranked as one of the most divisive and expensive ballot measure fights ever, with the two sides spending more than $80 million combined. 
 Opponents of same-sex marriage said a second campaign would be a mistake. ''The fact is that the people of California have already spoken,'' said Brian S. Brown, the executive director in National Organization for Marriage, in Princeton, N.J. ''And they don't like being told they were wrong the first time.'' 
 Mr. Solomon, who came to California after several years of working on behalf of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, the first state to legalize such unions, in 2004, stopped short of announcing of a formal campaign to put the issue on the California ballot, which would require an extensive signature-gathering effort. 
 But his group appeared to be ramping up. It announced a statewide advertising campaign starting Monday, which will feature gay and lesbian couples talking about marriage. The group also said it would open outreach offices in conservative parts of the state in coming weeks -- including Orange County, the Central Valley and the so-called Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles -- where voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 8. (An outreach office is also planned for San Francisco, one of the state's most liberal enclaves.) 
 The group also expects to begin canvassing neighborhoods as soon as this weekend, using an on-the-ground approach to elicit voters' views about same-sex marriage and try to sway opponents, an approach that worked well for the opposite side in the November election. ''You can call it taking a page from their playbook,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''I'd prefer to call it taking a page from the playbook we used in the Northeast.'' 
 California advocates of same-sex marriage have been astonished at recent developments on the East Coast, including in Maine, where Gov. John Baldacci signed a bill on Wednesday legalizing same-sex marriage in the state, though Mr. Brown said opponents would pursue a public referendum to overturn the law before it becomes official. Even so, Maine joined a roster of states that have legalized gay marriage in recent months, including Iowa and Vermont. Connecticut began allowing same-sex marriages last fall. 
 All of which has supporters here feeling cautiously optimistic, even those for whom the Proposition 8 victory still stings. 
 ''Usually we measure social change on controversial issues on, at a minimum, years, and more often, generations,'' said Kate Kendell, the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who served on the ''No on 8'' executive committee. ''On this issue, we're measuring it by days.''
 The court has several more weeks to decide on Proposition 8, which passed with 52 percent of the vote. But critical lines of questioning from several judges during oral arguments in March seemed to suggest that the measure would be upheld. 
 Frank Schubert, a spokesman for Protect Marriage, the leading group behind Proposition 8, said he had expected that the measure would eventually be challenged at the ballot box but was surprised that it could come so soon. ''But,'' he said, ''if they think it's right for them, we'll meet them on the field of battle.'' 
 While Mr. Schubert said the recession might cause fund-raising problems for both sides, he noted that anti-Proposition 8 protests after the election and recent support for same-sex marriage elsewhere had generated enthusiasm among Californians in the opposing camp. 
 ''There is this sense of activism that has arisen from folks that were not in their campaign in the fall,'' he said of the ''No on 8'' camp. ''And I'm sure they want to capitalize on that while passions are high.''

HEADLINE: The Manure Chronicles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
I have no truck with chickens. I don't eat them and I don't like them. They are, to my eyes, savage and prehistoric, a fluffier breed of lizard. And yet, on a recent Friday afternoon I had an appointment to keep with 30 of them, on an odd little river island in downtown Minneapolis. The chickens had a glut of droppings -- manure -- and I had a new vegetable garden that needed fertilizing. I was hoping we could come to terms. 
 If I had started my garden at almost any point after 1940, I likely would have fertilized it with bagged chemicals from the store. These products come with clearly labeled dosages of the three essential plant nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. Without this trinity, my starter garden would be a stunted garden -- or a cemetery. 
 Initially, I'd been willing to experiment with chemistry. There's nothing ''natural'' about a vegetable garden, after all; my patch would be the product of thousands of years of human meddling. But a few calls to green-gardening evangelists convinced me that spreading synthetic fertilizers is now considered roughly the equivalent of spanking a child: bluntly effective, but verging on criminal. And definitely not something you want to do in the front yard. These products work quickly but their effects don't last, and they have a dirty habit of trickling into waterways. 
 If that weren't bad enough, atmospheric nitrogen doesn't just jump into the fertilizer bag on its own. ''The estimate bandied around is that 1 percent of the world's power goes into fixing'' -- or processing -- ''this nitrogen,'' said Jeff Gillman, a professor of horticultural science at the University of Minnesota, and the author of ''The Truth About Organic Gardening'' (Timber Press, 2008).
 The so-called organic fertilizers that have filled store shelves in the last dozen years seemed to provide a natural alternative. But some sources may strike urban gardeners as a little stomach churning: fish emulsion (ground-up seafood), for example, or blood meal (pulverized cattle). Seabird guano is another source, and I liked the idea of an albatross taking a 3,000-mile detour to deposit nutrients on my Midwestern lawn. But seabird guano is mined and shipped from distant shores. 
 ''Some organic fertilizers aren't as great as people think they are,'' Mr. Gillman said of products made from guano and rock phosphate. ''We're using up this resource, which, although it's natural, is not quickly renewable.''
 As the father of a 1-year-old, I thought I already had enough poop in my life. But after a few calls to soil scientists and hardcore home gardeners, I started to believe that I might need more. Beyond manure's nutrient value, gardeners credit it with improving the soil's ''tilth,'' or loose crumb. 
 ''It's kind of a nebulous term,'' explained Carrie Laboski, a professor and extension soil scientist at University of Wisconsin, Madison. ''Manured soil over time may have a little more structure to it. Water penetrates it nicely, and it drains nicely.''
 Barnyard animals don't pay for market research, but there are signs that manure use is growing more popular among gardeners. Credit it to the faddishness of city chickens (whoever thought we'd be using that phrase?) or to the new presence of products like Moo-Nure at big-box outlets. 
 ''I've been doing research on manure since the 1980s,'' said Michael Schmitt, an extension soil scientist at the University of Minnesota, ''and I don't remember seeing this stuff -- manure -- in the stores. Bags of composted manure in Home Depot or Menards. It's there!'' 
 Many gardeners are holding their noses and going closer to the source. ''More and more people are keeping traditional farm animals in urban settings now,'' said Leslie Finical Halleck, a horticulturist and garden blogger in Dallas who is also the general manager of an independent garden center. ''I was talking to my friend Julie the other day and she said, 'Do you want to take chicken poop home with you?' And I said, 'Of course I do!' This is what we talk about now.''
 I knew I could scare up some big-animal manure on the far side of the beltway. But I didn't like the idea of trekking in the minivan with my two tots -- and hauling the stuff back with the windows closed. I remembered, then, meeting Greg McFarlane, an innkeeper and reggae drummer who built a chicken coop at his sister's home day care center on the city's north side. But when I called him about making a manure pickup, he had distressing news. 
 ''Just the other week, my sister found all 13 birds spread out across the yard,'' Mr. McFarlane said. ''Some kind of raptor got them. Guts everywhere.''
 I began hearing manure-gathering ideas from other urban gardeners. In New York, registered community gardeners can pick up composted ''zoo-doo'' from the parks department; on the West Coast, an East Bay Area farming activist has collected rabbit droppings from a pet store and soiled straw bedding from a racetrack; and a New Orleans educator has tried splashing her own urine on the compost pile beneath her fruit tree. 
 Call it prudery, but I wasn't going that route. Instead I ended up on Nicollet Island, a stone's throw from downtown Minneapolis. 
 The Nicollet Island Cooperative Henhouse is a low complex of sheds, wire fences and netting behind the garage of Phyllis Kahn, a veteran Democratic representative in the Minnesota State House. It's home to those 30 chickens, as well as a dozen ducks and three geese, many of mixed breeding and outre plumage. 
 When I arrived, the birds were loose in the yard. ''Now is actually a good time to visit us,'' said a neighbor, Peat Willcutt, a 24-year-old farmer's market manager (and ''one of Minneapolis's only male burlesque artists,'' he added). ''After the winter, the bedding is starting to smell,'' Mr. Willcutt said, ''and we try to keep the neighbors happy.'' 
 In part, Mr. Willcutt and his confederates make nice by liberally passing out eggs -- and manure for gardening. Today, they were ready to move some product. 
 Though four neighboring households share responsibility for the coop, Mr. Willcutt may be the cock of the walk. A few days earlier, he'd helped to heap straw and manure into a 12-foot-long pile that stood 3 feet high. Mr. Willcutt and his confederates call it ''le fumier,'' which is French for ''compost pile'' (and perhaps also a barnyard epithet). Inside le fumier, a reaction between the nitrogen from the manure and the carbon from the straw was heating up the mound: a thermometer poked into the center registered 135 degrees. The pile smelled like chicken manure -- only more so, if that's possible -- and it was steaming in the crisp April air. This ''hot composting'' process, applied over a fortnight, would destroy weed seeds and dangerous pathogens like salmonella, which can otherwise survive in the soil for as long as eight months. 
 The specter of salmonella and E. coli (from horse and cow manure) may have scared gardeners off manure in the past. I'm not immune to a little hysteria, so I called half a dozen researchers -- microbiologists, poultry experts and soil scientists -- to ask about the potential health risks of introducing manure to my little dirt farm. The consensus view was that there is no consensus view. 
 ''Those diseases seem to be fairly rare,'' said Mr. Gillman, adding that the possibility of their appearing was something to avoid. 
 While acknowledging that there are ''different philosophies on the subject,'' Mr. Schmitt said, ''from a scientist's perspective, I think that sometimes people are overly concerned about the materials in manure.'' 
 Ultimately, cautious gardeners probably can't go wrong by following a short list of manure guidelines. Stay away from dog and cat excrement, which is especially loaded with pathogens. Avoid raw manure or add it to soil at least four months before planting (or six months for leaf plants like spinach or root crops like carrots). Use hot-composted manure, or manure that has been cold-composted for at least a year. And definitely don't add raw manure next to vegetables that are already in the ground. (For more about manure safety, see the Starter Garden blog at nytimes.com/home.)
 Mr. Willcutt and his neighbors helped shovel some aged compost into a pair of five-gallon buckets. The henhouse keepers -- all of them save for Representative Kahn -- are also members of an affordable housing collective on the island and they like to work outside the cash economy. In exchange for the fertilizer, callers typically provide everything from fresh tomatoes to gin. I offered some on-demand copy editing, and we had a deal. 
 We walked around to the front of the 1881 gingerbread fourplex where Mr. Willcutt's housemate, Leslie Ball, showed me her raised vegetable beds. I'd simply need to spread my compost over the top layer of sandy soil in my yard, she told me, mixing it in a bit with a digging fork. The high tan husks of last year's vegetables attested to her success. Here, practically in the shadow of the sterile glass towers of downtown, she had raised sweet corn that grew seven feet tall.
 With that image fixed in my mind, I made a plan. Next week, I thought, I'm going to return to Nicollet Island with those empty dung buckets -- and a few Mason jars of homemade banana wine. And I'm going to ask for more.

HEADLINE: Deal Reached to Keep Boston Globe in Print

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The stare-down between The New York Times Company and workers at The Boston Globe reached its crucial moment Wednesday when the newspaper's largest union agreed to vote on a package of painful wage, benefit and job security concessions that would head off the threatened closure of one of America's premier newspapers, but could also presage significant layoffs.
 The potential deal by no means resolves The Globe's -- or the company's -- problems. Globe workers said it was not clear to them that their colleagues would approve the givebacks, and even with concessions tentatively made by all the company's unions, the paper would still be losing tens of millions of dollars a year and the company would still be struggling. 
 The Boston Newspaper Guild said Wednesday that it would put the deal before its members for a vote at an undetermined date, but people briefed on the union's plans said it would not make a recommendation on how its members should vote.
 The concessions would make it easier for the Times Company to sell The Globe, a prospect that has been discussed with a handful of potential buyers and their intermediaries, according to people briefed on those discussions, some of whom said the company had been actively shopping the paper around. The company declined comment, but executives have said that the company is open to selling The Globe for a small fraction of the $1.1 billion it paid for the paper in 1993.
 But this tentative deal appears to forestall the imminent death of a civic institution that, even after years of cutbacks, remains the dominant news organization in New England and a local fixture as central to Boston's self-image as white chowder and the Green Monster. 
 ''My reaction is pure relief,'' said Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ''The Globe is essential to Boston and New England and it would have been a catastrophic thing for it to have shut down.''
 For the more than 600 Guild members at The Globe, whose pay has already been frozen for several years, the price of survival is steep, as described by several people briefed on the possible deal, who were given anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The company and the Guild, which represents workers in the newsroom, the advertising department and some other offices, said Wednesday that they would not discuss the details until a union membership meeting to be held Thursday night.
 But the people briefed on the deal said the package included a pay cut of at least 8 percent -- as much as 8.5 percent by some accounts -- and an unpaid, one-week furlough this year, equivalent to an additional 2 percent pay cut. Company contributions to retirement plans would be eliminated, with limited exceptions for older employees.
 Perhaps more important to the company -- and to a potential buyer -- the Guild would agree to end lifetime job guarantees for employees who started working at The Globe before 1992, in return for improved severance packages for those workers. That would make it easier to lay people off. Union leaders have said the company has made it clear that more layoffs are on the way.
 The Globe's other unions tentatively made similar concessions in all-night talks that wrapped up Monday morning. The immediate concessions on pay and benefits would cut operating costs by $20 million -- half of that coming from the Guild -- while the end of job guarantees could save millions more, depending on the extent of any downsizing. But that would merely lessen the red ink at a paper that company executives say lost $50 million in 2008, and is on track to lose $85 million this year on less than $500 million in revenue.
 ''I think everyone understands that no one would buy The Globe with the lifetime job guarantees in place, and everyone understands that there will be downsizing,'' said Dan Kennedy, an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern University. ''I'm certainly relieved that the worst didn't happen, but the alternative is pretty ugly, as well.''
 Ken Doctor, an industry analyst with Outsell, a research company, said, ''there's not much prospect of getting The Boston Globe into the black in the short run,'' but it made sense to minimize losses, whether the company planned to sell or not. ''As I look out 12 to 18 months, the economy will rebound, advertising for real estate and cars will rebound and the fortunes of the surviving, downsized newspapers will look somewhat better.''
 When the Times Company bought The Globe, it was the highest price ever put on an American newspaper. Analysts said at the time that the price was excessive, but The Globe was highly profitable for several years. Boston benefited from the dot-com boom and so did The Globe, which swelled with help-wanted ads, until the paper was hit hard when that bubble burst.
 The Globe also has a relatively high cost structure, experts say, in part because of the lifetime job guarantees for some of the paper's unions before the Times Company takeover, and still enjoyed by about 430 employees, including about 190 Guild members. While most major cities have just one newspaper, The Globe competes for readers and ads with The Boston Herald.
 The Globe has a paid circulation of 303,000 on weekdays and 466,000 on Sundays. Those figures rank 17th and 13th in the country, but they are down more than a third since 2000. The Herald is at 151,000 on weekdays, and 95,000 on Sundays.
 Like nearly all of the nation's top regional newspapers, The Globe has shut bureaus, closed sections, focused more on local news, stopped delivering to far-flung areas and shrunk its news and business staffs -- including a round of newsroom layoffs completed barely a month ago. The newsroom has about 340 people, still one of the largest in the country, but down from more than 500 earlier in this decade.
 But all the cutting by the Times Company and the industry as a whole has not kept pace with collapsing revenue. The company's newspaper ad revenue fell 28.4 percent in the first quarter and 31.6 percent in its New England segment, dominated by The Globe. Other newspapers and publishing companies have reported similar declines.
 Despite cutting thousands of jobs in the last few years, the Times Company reported a net loss of $57.8 million for all of 2008, and $74.5 million for the first quarter of 2009.

HEADLINE: Do Sports Creams Rub the Pain Away?

BYLINE: By SARAH TOLAND

 BODY:
CAROLYN LUMBER, a 56-year-old retired tennis pro, experimented with different over-the-counter sports creams for more than five years in the hope that one might ease the pain she had suffered since having knee-replacement surgery. Nothing worked until Ms. Lumber, who lives in Portland, Ore., started using a prescription product along with the over-the-counter pain-relieving cream ALCiS.
 ''I used to be very limited in what I could do, but now I can go for a two-hour hike around the mountains,'' Ms. Lumber said before she was scheduled to play tennis one day. ''ALCiS has managed to keep everything very comfortable.'' 
 ALCiS is one of several successful new products to enter a large, longstanding and lucrative market for over-the-counter topical analgesics, or pain creams, an industry that includes Bengay, Icy Hot, ThermaCare and Aspercreme, and has been part of United States retail since before the turn of the 20th century. Indeed, the medicinal smell of many of these creams is ubiquitous in locker rooms (that smell comes from methyl salicylate, an ingredient ALCiS does not include). 
 Last year, external analgesic rubs had approximately $275 million in sales in the United States, excluding sales at Wal-Mart, according to the Chicago-based market research firm Information Resources. But despite Ms. Lumber's experience, and despite those big sales numbers, there is scant evidence that any of the creams actually work. Some doctors point out that no physical changes occur at the spot where the creams are applied -- even if they give the not-unpleasant sensation of heat or cold -- and suggest that the only real benefit could be that of a placebo.
 Studies have found only limited evidence that over-the-counter topical analgesics are helpful for any type of pain. The research is so minimal and inconclusive that doctors at the Sports Medicine Center at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota refused to comment on the efficacy of topical analgesics, saying in an e-mail message, ''There is no science to either support or refute the effectiveness'' of the products.
 Representatives of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis agree. 
 ''We try to treat based on the scientific literature, and I personally haven't seen a lot of good literature supporting the use of topical analgesics,'' said Dr. William O. Roberts, a spokesman. ''So unless someone does a double-blind study with lots of proof, we really don't have good evidence that these products make any difference.'' 
 Ed Ryan, who was the director of sports medicine for the United States Olympic Committee for much of the past decade, estimated that at least 70 percent of the athletes he treated had experimented at least once with over-the-counter pain creams. But he did not think the products helped to heal injured or fatigued muscles or joints.
 ''From a physiological standpoint, there's very little benefit that occurs in the tissue where you're applying a cream,'' he said. ''They don't cause a change to occur that would result in any pain decrease or any physiological change that would hasten healing.''
 Not all consumers purchase pain creams for sports-related problems. Many try them to alleviate muscular or joint pain associated with arthritis, age-related stiffness and conditions like fibromyalgia, in addition to sports injuries and fatigue from physical activity. 
 These users, like athletes, may benefit from the creams' placebo effect, a few doctors said, which can cause patients to feel that an inert medication works simply because they are told it will. 
 ''If you give somebody a medication and tell them it's going to work, it's going to work for a few people,'' Dr. Roberts said. 
 Dr. Robert Sallis, immediate past president of the American College of Sports Medicine, agrees. ''Do topical analgesics help heal the injury or get an athlete back to activity any quicker?'' he asked. ''The answer is no. But can they help people feel better because there is a placebo effect? Sure, but there's no evidence to support that topical analgesics actually work.'' 
 A handful of medical pain authorities argue that over-the-counter creams do have a place in treatment.
 ''We don't always know how things work, but that doesn't mean they're a placebo or a sham,'' said Dr. Mark A. Kallgren, medical director of pain medicine at the Oregon Anesthesiology Group in Portland, who published research last year on the success of topical salicylate cream for muscle and joint pain. ''I've tried lots of products with my patients that are completely worthless. But some work, and if they do, I don't care if the Mayo Clinic says there's no study to prove it.''
 ''There are people who use creams and swear by them, and others who say they don't work at all,'' said Dr. Lonnie Zeltzer, president of the special interest group on pain in childhood for the International Association for the Study of Pain. ''I think that has to do with how often you apply them, the penetration and patient persistency and expectations.''
 Manufacturers of topical analgesics, not surprisingly, say they work. Steve Cagle, president of Alterna, which makes the topical analgesic JointFlex, pointed to several clinical studies, including one published in The Journal of Rheumatology in 2003. 
 The study showed that ''people who used JointFlex over time continued to experience pain relief,'' Mr. Cagle said of the 2003 research. ''It's not necessarily that we're arguing against what any doctor would say, but the product itself has been shown to be very effective against a placebo over a term of time. Does it work for every person who uses it? No, but nothing does. But do the majority of people find it to be effective? Yes.''
 But in sour economic times is the notion that a topical cream might work for some people some of the time enough to prompt consumers to purchase -- or continue to purchase -- a product? 
 ''There's no clear evidence that these creams work,'' Dr. Sallis said. ''But anything that sticks around for as long as some of these products have must have some benefit or else athletes wouldn't continue using them.''

HEADLINE: On the Agenda: Modernizing the Meeting

BYLINE: By SUSAN CATTO

 BODY:
DON'T tell Marge Anderson that the era of the business meeting is over. As the associate director of the Energy Center of Wisconsin, a nonprofit institute in Madison that provides training in sustainable energy, she is still planning meetings -- the big kind, involving travel, attendance fees and hundreds of people. 
 There's just one problem: many of the contractors, architects and engineers who could most benefit from the training can no longer afford to travel to get it. 
 ''Our customers are affected by the economy; they've lost jobs and profits are down,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''They have less money, and we have had to adapt.'' 
 First, the energy center is taking its seminars to customers. One example is the daylong course ''Understanding and Managing Electrical Power Quality.'' In previous years, the center might have offered it once in Madison. But this month, it's being offered four times -- in Madison, La Crosse, Eau Claire and Green Bay. The center has also increased online educational offerings and made most of them available at no charge. 
 When the center held its first Web seminar in March, about 700 people logged in -- far more than anticipated, Ms. Anderson said. 
 So far, this kind of outreach has not reduced attendance at events held in person: more than 900 attended a recent two-day conference on green energy issues in residential construction, up 25 percent from last year. 
 The economic crisis and a backlash against perceived boondoggles present a minefield for corporate meeting planners. But the need to justify meetings -- with explanations, for example, of why they exist, how much they cost and what they achieve -- is seen by some professional organizers as a long-overdue opportunity to modernize how meetings are conducted.
 Mary Boone of Essex, Conn., who specializes in corporate communications and large-scale meeting design, said, ''That's what we need to focus on now: how we can create strategic value with meetings, looking at not only what we're spending but at their effectiveness.'' 
 At Bacardi U.S.A., Victoria Ascione, the director of corporate meetings and events, said the new attitude had ''made us stop to think if there is a value in actually having people sitting together in a room.'' 
 Significant changes resulted. At some Bacardi meetings, executives whose input might be needed for only a portion of the sessions now phone in, rather than attending, and the company plans back-to-back events to make the most of its travel budget. 
 ''If we're going to bring our sales vice presidents from across the company to Miami, where we are headquartered, we might do two different meetings,'' Ms. Ascione said, ''a companywide leadership meeting, for instance, and immediately afterward a marketing meeting for those who have traveled in.'' 
 The heightened attention to cost and appearances, as well as the introduction of government rules for companies receiving bailout money, has also highlighted the benefits of centralized meeting planning and policies. 
 ''Companies are looking for processes to ensure that whatever meetings or events they pursue don't come under public criticism,'' said Kevin Iwamoto, vice president of enterprise strategy at StarCite, a company in Philadelphia that offers Web-based meeting management software. 
 Mr. Iwamoto said he believed the time was right for travel managers to start using comprehensive meeting policies. There are also opportunities for business travel-management companies, which offer tools to compare vendors, track the cost of meeting-related travel, gather feedback and ensure compliance with regulations of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and other policies.
 According to Ms. Boone, many corporate travel planners have been trying to focus executives' attention on streamlining meetings for years, only to be told when times were good that the topic was not a priority. ''The silver lining in all this is that it is raising the concept of meeting planning to a senior level,'' she said. 
 Another benefit might be that videoconferencing could finally come of age, as the drive to cut costs has dovetailed with the availability of less expensive, more sophisticated systems. The Regus Group, which operates a chain offering business facilities, has seen the demand for videoconferencing services increase by as much as 40 percent over previous years, said Guillermo Rotman, the chief executive.
 At Procter & Gamble, which several years ago started using Cisco's life-size videoconferencing product called TelePresence, the demand has been higher than anticipated. ''Two years ago we planned to have 43 locations,'' said Laurie Heltsley, director of strategic projects for Procter & Gamble's Global Business Services. ''Now we expect to have 50 to 70 by the end of the year.'' 
 ''Recently we had our C.E.O. and his core leadership team together for a conference over TelePresence, linked to locations around the world for the first time ever, across nearly every time zone,'' she said. Saving money on travel is an advantage for the company, but employees also like being able to go home at night to their families, she added.
 Similarly, at the accounting firm of Deloitte, which began adding high-definition videoconferencing equipment to its offices about a year ago, it's no longer unusual for as many as 80 employees in 10 cities to meet without the expense of airfare or hotels. 
 And according to Larry Quinlan, a principal at Deloitte, once employees and management overcome their initial resistance, they're happy to forgo travel -- perhaps indefinitely.
 ''In previous downturns, as soon as you got travel money in your budget again you'd get back on the planes because the videoconferencing experience wasn't that good,'' Mr. Quinlan said. But with better systems in place, he said, ''you can now scheme to reduce travel on a permanent basis. The economic downturn merely provides management with the mandate to do it.''
 Like so many other beleaguered industries, the meeting business is unlikely to return to its former pace, even after the recession lifts. But companies that have adopted new approaches to meetings could emerge in better shape than those that slashed their budgets and canceled their plans.
 ''We know the economy isn't going to stay like this forever,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''We don't want to lose our connection to our customers between now and when the economy comes back.''

HEADLINE: A Morning in Her Shoes

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
A MORNING
 In Her Shoes
 If you were wedged inside Car 5306 of the A train from Brooklyn to Manhattan on Tuesday morning, you might have witnessed a political blind date. 
 There, standing near the door, was Annie Davis, a security guard at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. There, standing next to her, was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, with whom she had just had breakfast in her apartment, in East New York. For the better part of the half-hour commute, they chatted about everything from health care (her insurance plan is not good, she said) to crime (the streets are safer, he said) and the economy (we're doing our best to help all New Yorkers, he said). 
 ''People need a hand up, not a handout,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at one point. 
 ''Exactly,'' Ms. Davis said.
 It was an unusual kind of endorsement interview. Ms. Davis's union -- Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ -- is asking candidates for public office to spend part of a day with one of their members to help them relate to these working-class constituents. Last week, Lateef Rivers, a 25-year-old security guard at the Brooklyn Municipal Building, spent part of his shift with the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., a Democratic candidate for mayor. Later they had a Chinese takeout dinner at a desk in Mr. Rivers's bedroom, since there is no dining table in the apartment he shares with seven roommates. 
 ''Walking a day with a working New Yorker shouldn't just be a prerequisite for our union's endorsement, but a requirement for the job,'' said Mike Fishman, the president of the union, which endorsed Mr. Bloomberg in 2005 and has 70,000 members.

HEADLINE: National Security Adviser Takes Less Visible Approach to His Job

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On a foreign policy team of supersize egos, Gen. James L. Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, is flying below the radar. Compared with his immediate predecessors, Condoleezza Rice and Stephen J. Hadley, General Jones is rarely seen at the president's side. Neither does he serve as a gateway to the president, in the way that Samuel R. Berger was viewed because of his close friendship with President Bill Clinton.
 By his own account, General Jones favors more of a ''bottom-up approach,'' one very different from what has usually been practiced from the national security adviser's corner office in the West Wing. During a National Security Council meeting in March on Mr. Obama's new Afghanistan strategy, General Jones, although seated next to the president, seldom voiced his own opinions, according to officials in the room. Instead, he preferred to go around the table collecting the views of others. 
 He has also kept a low profile with the news media; he first addressed a White House news conference on Wednesday.
 Inside the administration, the fact that the 6-foot-5 former Marine Corps commandant has left only the faintest of footprints has prompted some early sniping, including the argument that he is not using his position to wield influence or to bring policy debates to resolution. At the recent Summit of the Americas in Trinidad, General Jones did not even take his reserved seat behind Mr. Obama during a major public session. 
 In an interview on Monday, General Jones responded that low profile did not necessarily mean low impact. ''You can be a leader that takes charge of every meeting and takes charge of every issue and rides it to its conclusion and plays a very, very dominant role,'' he said. ''For me, that has the effect of muting voices that should be heard.''
 He added, ''I don't think that in order to satisfy everybody's view of the national security adviser to the president that I have to be hovering around him all the time.'' 
 That point remains open to debate. ''The national security adviser needs to be behind the president'' both literally and figuratively, said David Rothkopf, author of ''Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power.'' General Jones, Mr. Rothkopf said, is not ''seen as the guy in the room.''
 But General Jones's style suits Mr. Obama, close aides and friends of the president said. To the general's credit, there has so far been no evidence of serious clashes on a team that includes not only Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton but also Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., both national security experts in their own right. ''I look at the result of our national security policy and I'm pretty pleased so far,'' said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to the first President Bush.
 General Jones has delegated a lot of the operational details of the job to his deputy, Thomas Donilon, and to a couple of Obama campaign veterans, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. In addition, he has sent staff members to Oval Office briefings with the president, aides said. 
 In London last month, General Jones left the staffing of Mr. Obama at the Group of 20 summit meeting to Michael Froman, an economics expert on the National Security Council. General Jones attended Mr. Obama's meeting with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, but left during dinner so that he could mediate an argument over Turkey's distaste for the European candidate for NATO secretary general.
 By the time Mr. Obama arrived in Strasbourg, France, two days later for the NATO summit meeting, General Jones had presented the outlines of a deal, one that Mr. Obama sealed after a final huddle with the Turks. 
 General Jones skipped the climate session in Trinidad so that the energy secretary, Steven Chu, could sit in his seat. Instead, he huddled with Brazil's minister of defense and national security adviser, talking about how Mr. Obama and the United States should engage with Venezuela and its president, Hugo Chavez. 
 General Jones described that behind-the-scenes ''teeing up'' process as an example of how he could be helpful to the president. He maintained his cool even when asked about sniping from staff members that he went biking at lunchtime and left work early, although he did, at one point, seem about to crush his coffee cup.
 ''I'm here by 7 o' clock in the morning, and I go home at 7, 7:30 at night; that's a fairly reasonable day if you're properly organized,'' he said. What about officials who pride themselves on being at the White House deep into the night?
 ''Congratulations,'' he said. ''To me that means you're not organized.''
 Some of General Jones's critics say that his practice of keeping a schedule separate from Mr. Obama's suggests that the former four-star general and supreme commander of NATO ''thinks like a principal'' rather than as a member of the staff of the president of the United States.
 But Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that General Jones was ''a Marine, and he believes in team-building,'' an approach that Mr. Holbrooke said had produced ''a sophisticated, multilayer decision structure at the N.S.C. that did not exist before.'' 
 It has been General Jones, Mr. Holbrooke said, who has served as an important filter between the president and the military, particularly in advising Mr. Obama during the debate over when military requests for more troops were warranted for Afghanistan.
 One of the big unanswered questions is how the relationship between General Jones and Mr. Obama is evolving. The two men see each other every morning, when Mr. Obama receives the presidential daily briefing, and talk several times a day, administration officials say. ''This president is very deliberative,'' General Jones said. ''He likes to know that there is a process to teeing up these very big issues, and that process fits his style.''

HEADLINE: White House Is Firm on Shaking Up Military Spending

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
When the Obama administration outlined its plans to cut big weapons programs, some of the military industry's allies in Congress assumed, as they have in the past, that they would have the final say.
 But over the last week, the White House has prodded Congressional leaders to strip several billion dollars' worth of extra equipment out of a wartime spending bill. 
 Experts say that effort suggests that President Obama should be able to reshape the Pentagon's spending practices. 
 The developments have shaken up the industry. In the past, military contractors have routinely beaten back attempts to cancel weapons programs by lobbying Congress. But Mr. Obama's popularity and the financial crisis are changing this well-choreographed dance. The White House is trying to demonstrate that when the president says no, he means it.
 ''It's the best possible moment politically to exercise this kind of budget discipline,'' said Gordon Adams, a professor at American University in Washington who closely monitors military spending. 
 Even Democratic Congressional leaders who want to protect defense jobs are falling in line. ''They are saying, 'Let's not go too far,' '' Mr. Adams said.
 The White House has not blocked everything that Congress wanted to add to the supplemental war-spending bill, which is expected to be approved by the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday. And Congress will have another chance to reverse some of the cuts when it considers the administration's budget for the 2010 fiscal year, also expected to be released Thursday.
 The administration wants to shift money from futuristic weapons to simpler systems needed by the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other political changes also appear to be helping the Obama administration overturn past practices.
 In the House, Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has long been the point man for contractors seeking extra money, has been weakened politically by a string of federal investigations of contractors or lobbyists close to him. 
 Congressional aides said that during the negotiations over the bill, the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who leads the House Appropriations Committee, to insist that they strip out some of the extra spending on planes and combat vehicles that Mr. Murtha had sought.
 The result was that Mr. Murtha, who is chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, had to call his panel together to say he could not deliver some of the things he had promised.
 House aides said the White House wanted to head off possible Republican criticism over earmarked spending and to ensure that the bill was clean enough to pass quickly to avoid disrupting the war financing.
 The Senate on Wednesday began considering a bill to strengthen the Pentagon's contracting process. One of its chief sponsors, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was Mr. Obama's Republican rival in the presidential race last year, strongly supports many of the changes that Mr. Obama wants to make. 
 Senate aides say Mr. Emanuel also asked Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader from Nevada, to limit the amount of money added to the Senate version of the war bill.
 House leaders cut about $3 billion from the $7.5 billion to $8 billion that Mr. Murtha had wanted to add for weapons systems. Mr. Murtha had proposed buying 15 Boeing C-17 cargo planes, but the House cut that to eight. It also eliminated proposals to buy more Boeing F/A-18 fighters. 
 But the House panel also plans to add $2.5 billion to accelerate purchases of mine-resistant vehicles and armored Stryker ambulances that the Pentagon could use in Afghanistan.
 Analysts said that once the debate turned to the 2010 budget, legislators were likely to pitch other efforts to add more money as vital to covering shortages of crucial equipment.
 James McAleese, a military consultant in McLean, Va., said the Army was hit hard by plans to cancel a troubled program to develop new combat vehicles. He said officials were concerned that it could take two to five years to create replacements.
 But analysts said the Pentagon had also limited criticism by focusing many of the cuts on programs still in the research stage. It also would add money to new programs that would offset some of the losses contractors face in other areas.

HEADLINE: How We Tested the Big Banks

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY GEITHNER. 
Timothy Geithner is the secretary of the Treasury.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THIS afternoon, Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve will announce the results of an unprecedented review of the capital position of the nation's largest banks. This will be an important step forward in President Obama's program to help repair the financial system, restore the flow of credit and put our nation on the path to economic recovery.
 The president came into office facing a deep recession and a damaged financial system. Credit had dried up, forcing businesses to lay off workers and defer investment. Families were finding it difficult to borrow to finance a new house, buy a car or pay college tuition. Without action to restore lending, we faced the prospect of a much deeper and longer recession. 
 President Obama confronted these problems with dramatic action to address the housing crisis and to restart credit markets that are responsible for roughly half of all business and consumer lending. The administration also initiated a program to provide a market for legacy loans and securities to help cleanse bank balance sheets. These programs are helping to repair lending channels that do not rely on banks, and will contribute to fixing the banking system itself. 
 However, the banking system has also needed a more direct and forceful response. Actions by Congress and the Bush administration last fall helped bring tentative stability. But when President Obama was sworn into office in January, confidence in America's banking system remained low. 
 Because of concern about future losses, and the limited transparency of bank balance sheets, banks were unable to raise equity and found it difficult to borrow without government guarantees. And they were pulling back on lending to protect themselves against the possibility of a worsening recession. As a result, the economy was deprived of credit, and this caused severe damage to confidence and slowed economic activity. 
 We could have left this problem as we found it and hoped that, over time, banks would earn their way out of the mistakes they had made. Instead, we chose a strategy to lift the fog of uncertainty over bank balance sheets and to help ensure that the major banks, individually and collectively, had the capital to continue lending even in a worse than expected recession. 
 We brought together bank supervisors to undertake an exceptional assessment of the strength of our nation's 19 largest banks. The object was to estimate potential future losses, and ensure that banks had enough capital to keep lending even in the face of a deeper recession. 
 Some might argue that this testing was overly punitive, while others might claim it could understate the potential need for additional capital. The test designed by the Federal Reserve and the supervisors sought to strike the right balance. 
 The Federal Reserve marshaled hundreds of supervisors to spend 45 days rigorously reviewing the banks' detailed loan data. They applied exacting estimates of potential losses over two years, along with conservative estimates of potential earnings over the same period, and compared them with existing reserves and capital. The results were then evaluated against strict minimum capital standards, in terms of both overall capital and tangible common equity. 
 The effect of this capital assessment will be to help replace uncertainty with transparency. It will provide greater clarity about the resources major banks have to absorb future losses. It will also bring more private capital into the financial system, increasing the capacity for future lending; allow investors to differentiate more clearly among banks; and ultimately make it easier for banks to raise enough private capital to repay the money they have already received from the government. 
 The test results will indicate that some banks need to raise additional capital to provide a stronger foundation of resources over and above their current capital ratios. These banks have a range of options to raise capital over six months, including new common equity offerings and the conversion of other forms of capital into common equity. As part of this process, banks will continue to restructure, selling non-core businesses to raise capital. Indeed, we have already seen banks, spurred on by the stress test, take significant steps in the first quarter to raise capital, sell assets and strengthen their capital positions. Over time, our financial system should emerge stronger and less prone to excess.
 Banks will also have the opportunity to request additional capital from the government through Treasury's Capital Assistance Program. Treasury is providing this backstop so that markets can have confidence that we will maintain sufficient capital in the financial system. For institutions in which the federal government becomes a common shareholder, we will seek to maximize value for taxpayers and enable these companies to attract private capital, thereby reducing government ownership as quickly as possible.
 Some banks will be able to begin returning capital to the government, provided they demonstrate that they can finance themselves without F.D.I.C. guarantees. In fact, we expect banks to repay more than the $25 billion initially estimated. This will free up resources to help support community banks, encourage small-business lending and help repair and restart the securities markets. 
 This crisis built up over years, and the financial system needs more time to adjust. But the president's program, alongside actions by the Federal Reserve and the F.D.I.C., is already helping to bring down credit risk premiums. Mortgage interest rates are at historic lows, putting more money in the hands of homeowners and helping slow the decline in housing prices. Companies are finding it easier to issue new debt to finance investment. The cost of borrowing for municipal governments has fallen significantly. Issuance of securities backed by consumer and auto loans is increasing, and the interest rates on these securities are falling. The Federal Reserve reports that credit terms are now starting to ease a bit.
 This is just a beginning, however. Our work is far from over. The cost of credit remains exceptionally high, and businesses and families across the country are still finding it too hard to borrow to meet their needs. We are continuing to execute our programs to relieve the burden of legacy assets, help small businesses and community banks, and tackle the mortgage and foreclosure crisis. The ultimate purpose of these programs is to ensure that the financial system supports rather than impedes economic recovery.
 We have not reached the end of the recession or the financial crisis, but the bank stress tests should advance the process of repairing our financial system and provide a better foundation for recovery.

HEADLINE: Why Small Businesses Still Can't Borrow Money

BYLINE: By DARREN DAHL. 
This interview was conducted and condensed by Darren Dahl.

 BODY:
Despite billions of dollars of bailout and stimulus money, the credit squeeze that kicked off our current economic crisis shows few signs of abating. Generally speaking, banks still aren't lending, and small businesses are still struggling to find ways to finance their operations. To get a better feel for how business owners are coping, Darren Dahl recently spoke with Doug Tatum, co-founder and chairman emeritus of Tatum, an Atlanta-based consulting and executive search firm that specializes in helping growing companies with finance issues. In recent years, Mr. Tatum, the author of ''No Man's Land: What to Do When Your Company Is Too Big to Be Small and Too Small to Be Big'' (Portfolio, 2007), has spent considerable time on Capitol Hill pitching a tax-deferral plan of his design that has had the support of two United States senators, John Kerry and Olympia J. Snowe, who have long been active in small-business issues.
 Q.What's your advice for businesses looking to borrow money these days? 
 A. Quit trying. The credit markets are tougher than I've ever seen them, aside from the Carter years. 
 Q.But it takes money to make money, right?
 A. Entrepreneurs have a limited amount of bandwidth, and they have to quit wasting their time chasing the impossible. They need to think about how they can change their business model to become profitable. That's where the capital to grow will come from. I just spent some time with a health care consulting company that pulls in $6 million in [annual] revenue with plans to grow to $10 million. They are just bobbing, weaving and growing despite how hard it is out there.
 Q.Why hasn't the government been able to open up the credit markets? 
 A. Banks have become cautious about what they have on their balance sheets. They still don't know what their portfolios are worth. That means they're waiting for the next shoe to drop, which could be the commercial markets. I talked to the C.E.O. of a community bank who told me that they have the regulators telling them when and where they can lend money. So while you might have politicians saying, 'Lend, lend, lend,' the regulators are holding the banks back. 
 Q.What else should the government be doing?
 A. Congress needs to be temporary, targeted and timely -- three issues in a piece of legislation I supported called the ''Bridge Act,'' which stands for Business Retained Income During Growth and Expansion. The idea is to allow entrepreneurs to defer paying up to $250,000 in income taxes so they can reinvest that money in growing their business. 
 Q.Where does the legislation stand?
 A. Good question. Nobody seems to know. We had a lot of support four years ago. But I don't understand the politics behind it. Now that we're in a crisis, we need it more than ever.
 Q.What would the plan cost taxpayers?
 A. Nothing. When the plan was scored when it was in committee, it showed that there would be no cost to the Treasury over 10 years. It would be a net positive to the economy. This would put $4 billion in the hands of entrepreneurs to reinvest in their companies.
 Q.Clearly, though, the legislation would cost the government revenue in the early years. Is that why it hasn't passed?
 A. The Bridge Act doesn't get the support it needs because too much time and effort is spent on the extremes, either on big business or on small businesses like a dry cleaner. But neither is where jobs get created. Dr. Don Walls, an economist at Harvard, has done research that shows that 50 percent of new employment in the country comes from companies with between 20 and 200 employees. Companies with fewer than 20 employees add only 12 percent of new jobs while companies with 2,500 or more employees add only 3 percent. But policy makers don't talk about that middle majority. You have all the focus on saving large corporate America, the too big to fail, or looking after the kinds of small businesses represented by the N.F.I.B. The businesses in the middle don't have lobbyists. That's why I spend so much of my time on Capitol Hill trying to raise awareness of this problem.
 Q.Has the Small Business Administration played a useful role in helping companies or banks through the credit crisis?
 A. Based on my interactions with companies and the capital markets, I don't see the S.B.A. as a factor. 
 Q.Why do you think that is?
 A. I don't have any data, but my instincts tell me it's because the S.B.A. lends to smaller companies like Laundromats rather than growth companies.
 Q.You also advocate on behalf of private equity groups, correct?
 A. I'm on the board of the Association for Corporate Growth, which represents about 3,500 middle-market private equity firms. These are the firms that are providing the capital to those growing firms. But there's a misperception on Capitol Hill about them. When people think about private equity, they think of the big boys like Blackstone and K.K.R. They think that everyone is like Stephen Schwarzman and hires Rod Stewart to show up at their birthday party. The truth is there has been a sea change in the way that companies get funded. Private equity funds far more companies than the public markets these days because the cost of capital is now cheaper through private equity than through an I.P.O. And companies with between 20 and 250 employees are where all the action is. That's why it's so important for the government to be wary of any taxes or regulations that could disrupt the ability of these firms to fund growth companies.
 Q.Do you expect the economic crisis to produce other sea changes?
 A. After the recession that came after the dot-com boom, I came across some additional research done by Dr. Walls at Harvard. He found that there was a spike in the number of start-up companies founded in that time -- more than 2.5 times the historical average. I'm betting that there will be a huge number of companies that get started over the next few years. There are far too many talented and educated people out there that don't want to watch Oprah all day. Innovation happens on the cliff's edge.

HEADLINE: A One-Night Auction Trend Ends, and Picassos Sell Again

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Two Picassos painted late in the artist's career and a Giacometti bronze brought solid prices at Christie's on Wednesday night in what was a surprising reversal of tastes and trends. 
 Where Sotheby's had failed to sell its top Picasso and Giacometti at its Impressionist and modern art auction on Tuesday night, just 24 hours later Christie's received bids from around the world. 
 A day can make all the difference in the life of auctions. Buyers appeared afraid to shop on Tuesday night, unsure of whether there was a market. But by Wednesday evening, fears of conspicuous consumption had apparently evaporated, with multiple bidders for most of the works. And Christie's experts had the benefit of adjusting their pricing in the wake of Sotheby's results. 
 ''I was surprised to see people spending money,'' said Mark Fisch, a Manhattan real estate developer and collector who was sitting in the second row at Christie's. In this economy, he added, he thought bidding would have been more tentative. 
 The evening brought $102.7 million, in the middle of Christie's estimate of $87.6 million to $125.2 million, with 10 of the 48 works failing to sell. By comparison, Sotheby's total on Tuesday night was $61.3 million. 
 Riding the current craze for late Picassos, Christie's had put a 1968 painting by him on the cover of its auction catalog. The work, ''Musketeer With a Pipe,'' was being sold by Jerome Fisher, a founder of the footwear company Nine West and a victim of the Bernard L. Madoff swindle. The brightly colored canvas was expected to fetch $12 million to $18 million. Four bidders sought the painting, which went to Nemo Vedovi, a Brussels dealer, for $14.6 million. 
 On Tuesday night, Sotheby's tried to sell its star Picasso -- a 1938 portrait of the artist's daughter Maya -- that was also being sold by a Madoff victim, William Achenbaum, who runs the Gansevoort Hotel Group. It was a more expensive work, estimated at $16 million to $24 million, and it went unsold. 
 On Wednesday, the artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel was also selling a late Picasso, ''Woman Wearing a Hat'' (1971). It was expected to bring $8 million to $12 million, but David Nahmad, a New York dealer, snapped it up for what seemed like a bargain -- $7.7 million. 
 (Final prices include the commission to Christie's: 25 percent of the first $50,000, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
 In recent seasons, sculpture has been a sure bet. But in these precarious times nothing is certain: Sotheby's failed to sell its pricey Giacometti sculpture of a cat. At Christie's on Wednesday, another Giacometti, ''Bust of Diego (Stele III),'' was offered. The work, conceived between 1957 and 1958 and cast in 1958, portrays the head of the artist's brother perched on a tall plinth. It was expected to fetch $4.5 million to $6.5 million, but ended up selling to a telephone bidder who fought off three contenders and paid $7.6 million. 
 Sotheby's sold a group of paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on Tuesday night with varying results. Christie's had two on Wednesday night as well, including ''Portrait of Madame M.,'' a classic Art Deco canvas from 1932 that depicts the wife of a lawyer. It sold to a telephone bidder for $5.4 million, or $6.1 million including Christie's fees. The final price, although just around its low estimate, was a record for the artist. 
 Pretty Impressionist paintings that came with pristine provenances and reasonable prices were enthusiastically sought all week. On Wednesday night, Christie's had Pissarro's ''Picking Apples,'' an 1881 canvas depicting four peasant women in a half-shaded orchard, which was being sold by the family of Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall, a New York arts patron who died four years ago. Six bidders went for the painting, and it finally sold to a telephone bidder for $3.3 million, well above its $1.8 million high estimate. 
 Although Christie's declined to name names, officials there said 42 percent of the buyers were from the United States and 44.7 percent were European, a group that includes Russians.

HEADLINE: Some Big Banks Are Seen in Need Of More Capital

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The results of the bank stress tests have been trickling out for days, from Washington and from Wall Street, and the leaks seem to confirm what many bankers feel in their bones: despite all those bailouts, some of the nation's largest banks still need more money.
 But that does not necessarily mean the banks will get that money from the government. The findings, to be released Thursday by the Obama administration, suggest that the rescue money that Congress has already approved will be enough to fill the gaps. If so, the big bailouts for the banks may be over.
 All of this assumes that the economy does not take another turn for the worse, which would result in even more losses at the banks -- and the need for even more money to prop them up. But hopes that the tests will be a turning point in this financial crisis electrified Wall Street on Wednesday and some overseas markets the next day. Financial shares soared, lifting the broader American stock market to its highest level in four months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 101.63, or 1.2 percent, to close at 8,512.28 Wednesday, while Japan's Nikkei index rose more than 4 percent by midday Thursday. 
 How well many of the banks fared in the tests seems to have become something of a open secret on Wall Street, where the results, and mere whispers of them, have been the subject of intense speculation. 
 After news this week that Bank of America and Citigroup would be required to bolster their finances again, word came Wednesday that regulators had determined that Wells Fargo and GMAC, the deeply troubled financial arm of General Motors, would need to do so as well. But regulators decided that American Express, Capital One, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and MetLife would not need to take action. The official word is due at 5 p.m. Thursday. 
 The results so far seem to suggest that the 19 institutions that underwent these exams will need less than $100 billion in additional equity to cope with a deep recession, far less than some investors had feared. The question now is, where will banks get that capital? 
 Most of them would prefer to raise money privately, either by selling shares to the public or a big investor, or by selling some of their businesses. But if that is not enough, the odds are the government will step in. 
 The thinking is that some banks will ask the government to convert preferred shares that it bought last year, at the height of the financial crisis, to common stock. As a result, the government would become a significant shareholder in a number of banks besides Citigroup. 
 But under that assumption, no new taxpayer money would go to the banks. The government would merely exchange one investment, its preferred stock, which is much like a loan, for ordinary common shares. The move amounts to shifting public money from one pot to another to ensure that these big lenders -- those deemed too big to fail -- have enough common stock to cushion their potential losses. 
 This would represent a riskier deal for taxpayers. Whether they get out whole would depend on the stock market. And by exchanging its preferred shares for common stock, the government would also forgo dividend payments on its preferred shares. 
 ''What is positive is that there's a line being drawn,'' said Jim Reichbach, a vice chairman of United States financial services at Deloitte. ''There's a number being put on the table.'' 
 To help cover a huge shortfall, Citigroup has announced plans to convert a portion of the government's $45 billion investment to common stock, which would give the government a stake of as much as 36 percent. Regional lenders like Fifth Third Bank of Ohio or Regions Financial of Alabama could find themselves in a similar boat. 
 The banks are eager to avoid having the government increase its stake drastically because that would dilute the holdings of the banks' existing shareholders. Bank of America, for instance, is looking to sell businesses and to cash in investments to help cover a shortfall of nearly $34 billion.
 Morgan Stanley plans to meet an expected shortfall of $1 billion to $2 billion by selling assets or stock to private investors, a person briefed on the plan said. Citigroup has also sold several big businesses, reducing its large capital deficit to around $6 billion.
 In fact, after so much talk of nationalizing banks, the administration's stress tests and capital programs seem to be intended to encourage lenders to take steps to minimize government ownership. The Treasury Department plans to offer a special type of preferred stock that banks can convert to full-voting common shares only as needed. To use it, they will first have to try to raise private capital or do similar exchanges with private investors.
 What is more, any gains from asset sales, stock sales or larger-than-expected profits over the next two quarters can be used to offset the shortfalls. That might encourage banks to take bolder action, although some have struggled to find buyers for their businesses, or at least ones willing to pay the prices they seek. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said Wednesday that the results of the stress tests might be comforting news. 
 ''It will help lift this fog of uncertainty over the financial system, and I think the results will be, on balance, reassuring,'' Mr. Geithner said Wednesday on ''The Charlie Rose Show.'' 
 Critics say the tests have eroded confidence rather than bolstered it. The tests have occupied banking executives for months and fed the Wall Street rumor mill, adding to the volatility in the markets. Some also ask why the banks were able to negotiate with regulators behind closed doors over the tests and the results. 
 ''The banks are healing themselves, and it could have been done a lot faster if government had gotten out of the way instead of parking the emergency equipment in the middle of the road,'' said Gary B. Townsend, a former banking regulator who now runs his own investment firm. 
 It may come as a surprise to many people that by most standards, all of the banks that underwent these tests are already adequately capitalized. But regulators are focusing on the amount of capital made up of common stock, the first layer to absorb losses on bad loans.
 The government is betting that if banks have a bigger buffer of equity, private investors will be confident enough in the banks' health to pour money in. That should encourage the banks to start lending again. 
 ''This is sending a message that the banks need more capital, but their losses are manageable and the system itself is solvent,'' said Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill. ''Whether it sticks is something else.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: WHICH BANKS FACE BIGGEST PROBLEMS: Regulators have determined that some of the nation's largest financial institutions need more equity capital to withstand a prolonged recession. The banks are expected to plug some of the shortfalls by selling assets or raising new money from investors. But the banks may also use bailout money that they have already received, by converting some of the government's preferred stock into common stock, increasing the government's stake but diluting existing shareholders.

HEADLINE: Rangel Bars Any Taxes On Workers' Health Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The top tax-writer in the House of Representatives said Wednesday that there was ''no way'' he would support taxing employer-provided health benefits, Americans' leading source of coverage.
 The comment came from Representative Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, after a committee hearing with the new secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius.
 Mr. Rangel's remark was the clearest indication yet of the difficulties Democrats may have in raising money to fulfill President Obama's campaign promise of offering health insurance to all Americans. 
 The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, has expressed interest in the idea of limiting the tax break for employee health benefits. Some politicians of both parties, as well as many economists, say the tax break is inequitable because its benefits go disproportionately to people with higher incomes.
 ''It's too regressive,'' Mr. Baucus said in March. ''It just skews the system.''
 Mr. Rangel, a New York Democrat, did not suggest any specific way to finance coverage for more than 45 million people now uninsured. In response to a question, he said, ''I would not want to get involved in cutting hospital payments.''
 Hospitals are a mainstay of the economy in the New York metropolitan area, and for years Mr. Rangel has been attentive to the needs of teaching hospitals and those that care for large numbers of poor people.
 Under current law, employers can take tax deductions for their contributions to the cost of employee health insurance, and the benefits are not counted as taxable income to workers.
 Critics say that by subsidizing the purchase of insurance, the tax break insulates people from the cost of care, increases the demand for it and leads to more health spending.
 In the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assailed the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for supporting the taxation of employee health benefits. But in March, some of Mr. Obama's economic advisers indicated that he might be open to the idea.
 Since then, labor unions have stepped up their criticism of it, saying it would impose a tax increase on working families and undermine employer-sponsored health coverage. Testifying on Wednesday before Mr. Rangel's committee, Ms. Sebelius affirmed the president's opposition to the idea but did not completely shut the door on it.
 Eliminating the tax break ''has a huge potential of destabilizing the private market and leaving more Americans uninsured,'' Ms. Sebelius said. Still, she said, Mr. Obama is open to ''all serious discussions'' of it and other ideas with members of Congress.
 On another volatile issue concerning the health care overhaul, Ms. Sebelius defended Mr. Obama's proposal to create a government-sponsored insurance program, which would compete with private insurers. Republicans and insurance companies strenuously oppose the concept.
 Representative Wally Herger, Republican of California, asked if a government-run health plan would force private insurers out of business, causing people to lose coverage they already had.
 Ms. Sebelius, former Kansas insurance commissioner, said it all depended on how the government program was configured. She said Mr. Obama did not support ''dismantling the private market'' and relying entirely on a public program. Indeed, she said, ''the president and I want to stabilize the private insurance market.''
 In more than two dozen states, she said, state employees have a choice between traditional private health insurance products and a public plan. Such competition does not destroy the marketplace but simply gives people an additional choice, she said.

HEADLINE: Obama Will Propose Cuts Of $17 Billion From Budget

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Thursday will unveil nearly $17 billion in additional budget cuts for the coming fiscal year to showcase what a top adviser called a ''constant'' effort to find savings at a time when the government's costs for bailouts, health care and wars are mounting far faster. 
 The savings for the budget year starting Oct. 1 represent the sum of Mr. Obama's promised ''line by line'' scrubbing of the federal budget. But, underscoring the nation's fiscal plight, the proposed cuts represent about 1.4 percent of the $1.2 trillion deficit that is projected for the fiscal year 2010. 
 The president's 10-year budget outline, released in February, shows the deficit declining by his final year in office to $533 billion, mostly through assumptions about when the recession will end and the pace of renewed economic growth that many economists consider somewhat optimistic.
 The $17 billion would be saved through terminating or reducing 121 federal programs, ranging from $632,000 to eliminate the post of an attache for the Education Department in the American Embassy in Paris to $142 million by ending a program to clean up abandoned mines. 
 But the money for abandoned mines as well as proposed cuts in farm subsidies illustrate the difficulties the administration will face in Congress, where, as administration officials acknowledged, every program has its patrons. When Mr. Obama proposed cuts in the mine and farm programs as part of his budget outline, lawmakers from rural and Western states objected. 
 An additional $66 million would come from ending the education program Even Start, which Congress has protected against past assaults; the administration will argue that other childhood education programs like Head Start are more effective.
 ''None of this is going to be easy,'' said Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
 That is certainly true for roughly half of the savings that administration officials say will come from military programs. Those savings proposals are mostly known, having been outlined in April by Robert M. Gates, the secretary of defense, as part of a comprehensive reordering of military spending priorities -- to the howls of some lawmakers and the military industry. Among Mr. Gates's targets are missile defense programs, the Army's Future Combat Systems, Navy shipbuilding, the advanced F-22 fighter jets and a state-of-the-art helicopter fleet for the president.
 Most of the 121 savings proposals are new, Mr. Orszag said. Many represent a pittance relative to the government's $3.5 trillion annual budget, but the budgetary minutiae served to dramatize the administration's green-eyeshades approach. It would save $35 million from ending the Loran-C long-range radio navigation system, now obsolete with the development of GPS, and shave millions from grants for public broadcasting, rail line relocations, education and fellowships. 
 ''This is a product of going through the budget line by line,'' as Mr. Obama promised since his presidential campaign, said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. ''It's a constant, cumulative effort on this front to find savings and find reductions.''
 Mr. Orszag emphasized that the $17 billion in proposed savings would be on top of other savings that the president called for in February. Those include proposed reductions in a Medicare program and a limit on deductions that wealthy taxpayers can claim, both of which have been attacked by senior Democrats in Congress.
 The $17 billion is also separate from $100 million in savings that Mr. Obama called for in April, after directing his cabinet secretaries to find new reductions. That announcement was met with some derision, given the size of the deficit, but administration officials insisted that even small steps would reassure taxpayers.
 Amid growing worry about the debt, some lawmakers are pressing the administration to take aim at Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which are the biggest and fastest-growing domestic programs, and the chief reason that future deficits are projected to balloon. Administration officials argue that Mr. Obama's cost-saving initiative to overhaul the health care system would in turn reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 On Wednesday, the House majority leader, Steny H. Hoyer, of Maryland, called for a bipartisan effort to fix Social Security's long-term finances, although other Democratic leaders are opposed to addressing the politically charged issue now.

HEADLINE: Where the Ocean Meets the Catskills

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER. 
''Storm King Wavefield'' is on permanent view at Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y.; (845) 534-3115, stormking.org. ''Maya Lin: Bodies of Water'' remains on view at the Storm King Art Center Museum through Nov. 15. A traveling survey of Ms. Lin's work, ''Maya Lin: Systematic Landscapes,'' organized by the Henry Art Gallery of the University of Washington, Seattle, is on view at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, through July 12.

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
MOUNTAINVILLE, N.Y. -- When the painter Winslow Homer left New York City for this Hudson Valley hamlet in the summer of 1878, he was reported to be ''a little under the weather.'' He was probably suffering a nervous breakdown. Whether the cause was a failed romance or despair at seeing the Gilded Age shatter around him, we don't know. But he felt unmoored and clung to the natural world. The dozens of watercolors he did that summer were landscape-filled, with sloping pastures and wall-like mountains dwarfing human figures, idylls so perfect that they look unreal.
The New York State Thruway buzzes through that landscape now. Most of the pastures are gone, but the mountains are still here: Schunnemunk, behind a series of ridges; Storm King, running high and long before dropping into the Hudson. And recently, some new additions, baby mountains, have appeared: seven undulating, grass-covered ranges of them.
These mini-Catskills were conceived and built -- molded is really the word -- by the artist Maya Lin as a permanent installation at the Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park that for almost half a century has been devoted to the display of outdoor works either designed for the location or too large or strange to fit comfortably elsewhere. 
Ms. Lin's ambitious piece, ''Storm King Wavefield,'' was commissioned by the center, and installation of it, under the supervision of David R. Collens, an artist and Storm King's director, began two years ago. Set in a shallow, amphitheaterlike depression, once a gravel pit supplying material for the Thruway, it covers 11 acres. Its seven parallel rows of rolling, swelling peaks were inspired by the forms of midocean waves but echo the mountains and hills around them.
Marine references make sense in a part of the world carved and smoothed by glaciers, and terrestrial themes have been central to Ms. Lin's art. ''My affinity has always been toward sculpting the earth,'' she wrote in her autobiographical book ''Boundaries'' (2000). ''This impulse has shaped my entire body of work.''
That impulse was little remarked upon at the beginning of her career, when she was known mostly as a creator of urban commemorative sculptures, the first and most famous being her Vietnam Veterans Memorial for the Mall in Washington. Designed when she was still a graduate student in architecture at Yale, this long, low chevron of buffed black granite inscribed with names of the war dead was as much a monument to healing and humility as to heroics, and it became a flashpoint for American feelings about a divisive war and a disorienting era.
A few years later she completed the Civil Rights Memorial for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., again using black stone, this time a circular, tablelike slab of it incised with a historical timeline and rinsed by fountain water. In 1993 she returned to that format for her ''Women's Table'' at Yale. Dedicated to the many women who had been underacknowledged presences at the university since the 19th century, the stone was carved with an open-ended spiral of numbers, each marking the enrollment of women in the university in a given year, with 1969 footnoted: ''Yale admitted women into the undergraduate college.''
Initially, the political content of these works defined them. Now it is possible to step back and reassess them in light of Ms. Lin's subsequent career, which took her out of the memorial business and in the more directly earth-sculpturing direction, a direction that, it turns out, she had been following all along.
Ms. Lin's originating image for the Vietnam memorial, with its plain, straight slant like a Hudson Valley hillside, was of a blade slicing into and wounding the earth. The Civil Rights Memorial and ''Women's Table'' were both based on a single natural process: the slow but certain shaping of earth, in the form of stone, by water. All three pieces were meant to interact organically, even sensually, with their viewers, inviting them to run their hands over stone, feel and hear the trickle of water.
In short, Ms. Lin was making a species of ''earth art'' from the start. And she has done so unequivocally since, most strikingly in a small series of ''wave'' pieces formed from piled and packed soil.
The first, ''Wave Field,'' installed at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1995, is a 10,000-square-foot grouping of earthen mounds, the highest six feet, their shapes based on those of scientifically measured ocean waves. The second piece, ''Flutter,'' covers 30,000 square feet of a plot near the Federal Courthouse in Miami; the undulant shapes, child-size at three to four feet high, were inspired by the textures made in sand by the action of waves.
Small working models for these works are on view, along with several indoors pieces, in the exhibition ''Maya Lin: Bodies of Water'' in the Storm King Art Center Museum.
The ''Storm King Wavefield'' is the third and last of the series and by far the largest at 240,000 square feet, with heights of 15 feet. Like its predecessors, it is made of natural materials: dirt and grass. Like any landscape, it is a work in progress. Vegetation is still coming in, drainage issues are in testing mode, and there are unruly variables: woodchucks have begun converting one wave into an apartment complex.
But the piece is already a classic. It has the gravity of Ms. Lin's commemorative sculptures and the sociability of the earlier ''wave'' pieces, which lent themselves to picnics, play and privacy. And, more immediately than almost any of her other outdoor projects, it is inextricable from nature, which is where, as I say, all her art starts.
Born in 1959, Ms. Lin was raised in rural Ohio, and as a child visited the great Serpent Mound and other American Indian earthworks in the Midwest. Through her father, a ceramicist who grew up in a Japanese-style house in China, she developed an affinity for the nature-saturated, but also nature-framing, aesthetic embodied in the Zen rock-and-sand garden, and in the Chinese ink-and-brush landscape, with its misted and surreally scaled vistas.
As a distillation of nature, the Zen garden is highly controlled: you view it from a fixed point and from a distance; you don't physically enter it. In that sense, it is an image rather than an environment. By contrast, the ''Storm King Wavefield'' is embracingly environmental.
Seen from a slight elevation, it complements its hilly setting but interrupts it. (There is, after all, something a little freakish about these slinky, reptilian swellings in the ground.) Because the work does both, it sharpens your eye to existing harmonies and asymmetries otherwise overlooked.
When you descend into the troughs between the lines of waves, you may experience an entirely different set of sensations. You lose sight of all the other waves and of the larger prospects beyond them. Now you are down in the earth; it is rising over you, not you over it. You're suddenly smaller, but also protected. Outside sounds are muffled, large-scale distractions reduced. The grand vision of hills upon hills, recession upon recession, drops away.
With it gone, you're encouraged to concentrate on the details of what's around you. That's what, I suspect, all of Ms. Lin's outdoor work is asking you to do: touch the stone, feel the water, smell the air, see how that patch of grass is different from another.
I suspect that the search for a similar kind of focus, and the relief from boundlessness it brings, is what Homer was after in Mountainville that summer. Whether he found it, I don't know. He ended his life in a very different landscape, on the coast of Maine, where he produced painting after painting of waves crashing on rocks, water demolishing land, ceaseless natural destruction frozen in time.
In its own way, some of Ms. Lin's most recent work has a similarly adamant, end-time character. I refer to the long-planned, multipart project she calls ''The Last Memorial,'' with which, over decades, she plans to monitor globally the corruption and demise of the natural environment that has been her subject and source.
What forms she will call on remain to be seen. But ''Storm King Wavefield'' is a different kind of work. Neither fatalistic nor utopian, commemorative nor history-free, natural nor artificial, unstable nor fixed, it is a puzzle to ponder but also -- first things last -- a soul-soothing place of retreat.
Correction: May 9, 2009, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art review and headlines on Friday about a new installation by Maya Lin at the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y., misidentified the region of New York State where the center is. It is in the Hudson Valley, not the Catskills.

''Storm King Wavefield'' consists of seven ridges, with their mounds reaching heights of 15 feet. Installation of the project, which was a Storm King commission, began two years ago.
 ''Wavefield,'' where the vegetation is still coming in, is only the most recent of Maya Lin's projects to explore the wave theme in earthworks.(PHOTOGRAPHS BY LIBRADO ROMERO/THE NEW YORK TIMES)(pg. C28)

PERSON: Raymond J. Saulnier 

HEADLINE: Raymond Saulnier, Adviser to Eisenhower, Dies at 100

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Raymond J. Saulnier, the staunchly conservative chief economic adviser to President Eisenhower in the 1950s, died April 30 in Chestertown, Md. He was 100.
His death was confirmed by his son, Mark McA. Saulnier.
Raymond Saulnier, who preferred to be called Steve and pronounced his surname SONE-yay, had lived since 1992 in a retirement home in Chestertown, where he continued to write, broadcast, advise and correspond into his 90s, often in defense or explication of his record, stressing balanced budgets and contained inflation.
Even as a centenarian, Mr. Saulnier remained conversant with current affairs, expressing horror at how increasingly far policy makers of both parties had strayed from the tenets of budget balance he espoused from 1956 to 1961 as a member and then chairman of the president's three-man Council of Economic Advisers. 
After leaving office, he also served as an adviser to the presidential campaigns of Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater and worked in Ellen R. Sauerbrey's unsuccessful 1998 Republican campaign for governor of Maryland. Four decades of teaching at Columbia University and Barnard College bracketed his Washington career.
As recession worsened in 2009, Mr. Saulnier complained in an interview with The New York Times about the government's contribution to the burst credit boom through its encouragement of greatly expanded lending, particularly through Fannie Mae.
He also ruefully recalled how, as a member of a commission charged by President Nixon in 1970 to recommend ways to ease restrictions on financial institutions to make them more competitive -- widely cited as another factor in the crisis that began under George W. Bush -- he had failed to voice doubts about relaxing Depression-era reforms.
''I was not as vigorous pushing the minority view as I might have been,'' he said in the interview. ''I wish I had.''
Sometimes called Dr. No by liberal and other critics who decried his resistance to tax cuts, even as the economy slipped into recessions in the summer of 1957 and the spring of 1960, Mr. Saulnier said he never found a propitious time to advocate them.
One noteworthy occasion was in 1959, when the economy was weakened by a steel strike and the Federal Reserve under William McChesney Martin Jr. was pursuing a relatively tightfisted monetary policy.
''What were we supposed to do?'' Mr. Saulnier asked a half-century later. ''Cut taxes in order to offset the effect of a tight money policy? Why not change the money policy?''
He contended that monetary policy was generally more ''suppressive of growth'' than necessary during most of the two Eisenhower terms. Gross national product averaged a subpar 2.4 percent from 1953 to 1960 compared with a historic norm of 3 to 3.5 percent, but Mr. Saulnier pointed to reduced military spending after the Korean War as a significant factor.
Raymond Joseph Saulnier was born Sept. 20, 1908, in Hamilton, Mass., near Gloucester, and as a teenager decided to use Steve instead of Raymond or Joseph, neither of which ''fit my personal style,'' he said.
He graduated, as president of his class, from Middlebury College in 1929. One faculty member urged him to produce weekly commentaries on the soaring stock market as a senior thesis, but the idea was vetoed and ''I did a pretty dull paper on farm price supports'' instead, he later wrote.
By the time he had finished a master's degree at Tufts College (later Tufts University), and taught introductory economics there, the nation was deep into the Depression. A $1,600 fellowship from Columbia became his lifeline, and he produced a doctoral dissertation, ''Contemporary Monetary Theory,'' eventually published in hardcover, that ''reads well even today,'' Mr. Saulnier declared more than 60 years later, in 2000.
''At the time, the conventional wisdom was Keynesian, but I was persuaded that the great man overrated the antirecessionary effect (in the face of a downcast public confidence and a doggedly anti-inflationary money policy) of the government spending and tax cuts that he favored, and underestimated the capacity of an enterprise system to heal itself,'' Mr. Saulnier concluded.
Although fiscal discipline was always his chief priority, Mr. Saulnier said he insisted only that the budget should be in structural balance, meaning that deficits could be justified temporarily during recessions.
With doctorate in hand, Mr. Saulnier joined the Columbia faculty, but when he found himself assigned to teach more required contemporary civilization courses than he liked, he managed a transfer to Barnard, Columbia's sister institution, where he taught finance and economics until 1993, except for his six years in Washington. He was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years and its chairman for four.
As a graduate student, having led until then what he called ''a pretty monkish life,'' he met Estelle S. Sydney, a political polar opposite, with whom he joined in a marriage that ended after 62 years with her death in 1996. Besides their son, Mark, Mr. Saulnier's survivors include their daughter, Alice Ritchie, and seven grandchildren.
At his wife's memorial service, Mr. Saulnier recalled that when they first became acquainted he had just cast a vote for Herbert Hoover, for which he had no apologies then or since, and that she was looking to ''socialist Russia for an answer'' to human ills.
But with some earnest tutelage on his part, he added, ''we were soon close enough together -- somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum -- to make life reasonably harmonious.''

HEADLINE: The Great Divide

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH; Graham Bowley and Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At one bank in Alabama, the problem is a construction bust. At two in Ohio, the trouble is real estate. And in San Francisco, at Wells Fargo, the worry is credit cards -- a staggering 26 percent of that bank's card loans, federal regulators have concluded, might go bad if the economy takes a turn for the worse.
The stress tests released by the Obama administration Thursday painted a broad montage of the troubles in the nation's banking industry and, for the first time, drew a stark dividing line through the new landscape of American finance.
On one side are institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which regulators deemed stronger than their peers -- perhaps strong enough to repay billions of bailout dollars and wriggle free of government control. 
On the other side are weaker institutions like Bank of America, which now confront the daunting challenge of raising capital on their own or accepting increased government ownership, along with whatever strings might be attached. Time is short: the banks have only until June 8 to draw up their plans for regulators. As the results of the tests streamed in from the Federal Reserve, banks began racing to raise money.
Broadly speaking, the test results suggested that the banking industry was in better shape than many had feared. Of the nation's 19 largest banks, which sit atop two-thirds of all deposits, regulators gave nine a clean bill of health. The remaining 10 were ordered to raise a combined $75 billion in equity capital as a buffer against potential losses should the economy deteriorate. That amount is far less than many had forecast. But the potential losses that federal regulators projected, even at the soundest banks, are eye-popping.
Under regulators' worst-case assumptions, the 19 banks might suffer $600 billion in losses through 2010, on top of the hundreds of billions that have already vaporized in this financial crisis. About 9 percent of all loans might sour -- a figure that is even higher than it was during the Great Depression. One in five credit card loans could go unpaid, more than double the typical loss rate. Approximately one in 10 mortgages could sour.
The tests also left some crucial questions unanswered, including the big one: What happens if this recession turns out to be even worse than that worst-case situation, and the banks' losses start growing? The results suggest the big bailouts for the banks are over. But many wonder if banks will be in a position to make the loans needed to revive growth, even under rosier economic assumptions.
''Everybody should breathe a sigh of relief,'' said Peter J. Solomon, who runs a boutique investment bank and early in his career worked at Lehman Brothers. ''Now the question is, So what? Will they lend?''
The results shined an uncomfortable spotlight on the most troubled financial institutions: GMAC, the finance arm of General Motors; Bank of America; Wells Fargo; and Citigroup. Several large regional banks -- like Regions Financial in Alabama and SunTrust Banks in Georgia, and Keycorp and Fifth Third in Ohio -- were also deemed to need large sums of capital.
But many banking executives, free to discuss the results publicly for the first time, sought to put a positive spin on the tests. In a rush of conference calls with analysts, they generally characterized the results as a sign that their institutions could weather another downturn in the economy. Many said federal regulators were overly pessimistic in their assessments and insisted that they would move quickly to repay bailout money.
''Our game plan is to get the government out of our bank as quickly as possible,'' said Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America.
But even Mr. Lewis acknowledged that his bank faced some serious challenges. Regulators determined that Bank of America needed to raise about $34 billion in equity capital. The bank hopes to raise half of that by selling common stock and converting preferred shares to common stock. It hopes to raise the rest by selling assets like First Republic Bank and Columbia Management, its Boston-based investment unit, and using its future earnings. If that fails, the bank will have to convert some of the $45 billion of preferred stock that the government owns into common shares, increasing the government's stake.
Even before federal regulators announced the results of its stress tests, Wells Fargo announced that it would offer $6 billion in common stock. The government is requiring the bank to raise an additional $13.7 billion.
Wells executives -- who balked at accepting bailout money last autumn -- said they expected to raise the remainder largely through revenue growth that they say they believe will far exceed the expectations of government regulators.
But Wells Fargo officials also disputed the government's conclusions, arguing that the government's revenue forecasts were ''excessively conservative.''
''In our analysis, we thought we didn't need any capital,'' said John Stumpf, the bank's president and chief executive.
Citigroup, which for many has come to symbolize the problems plaguing the financial industry, has already been moving quickly to address its problems. Regulators determined that the bank must raise $5.5 billion, on top of recent efforts to raise capital by selling businesses and converting just over half of the $45 billion in bailout funds to common stock.
Vikram S. Pandit, the bank's chief executive, said he would expand the company's offer to exchange preferred shares of stock for common stock to a broader assortment of private investors. The moves will severely dilute the bank's shareholders and will leave the government with a 34 percent ownership stake, slightly less than investors expected.
''We have had to make some very tough decisions,'' Mr. Pandit said. ''We are kind of happy we did them along the way.'' But a handful of stronger banks are pulling away from their weaker peers and emerging as institutions that could dominate the industry.
Goldman Sachs, for instance, has said that it hopes to return the $10 billion it received from the government as soon as possible. On Thursday, regulators said Goldman did not need more capital.
JPMorgan Chase, which was also deemed to have enough capital, is pushing to return bailout money as well. Yet it, too, took issue with the results, arguing it was in an even stronger position than the results suggested.
''We think we can handle an even more significantly negative environment and still make a profit,'' Michael J. Cavanagh, chief financial officer, said.
For Washington and Wall Street, the main question is whether investors and depositors will take solace from these results. Banks and administration officials are eager to persuade private investors that the banks are stable enough to invest in.
''The golden ring here, if you can catch it, is confidence,'' said Tanya Azarchs, the bank rating analyst at Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: An Upturn At Wal-Mart Lifts Spirits In Retailing

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The nation's retailers endured another tough month in April, but there were signs that at least some consumers were coming out of hiding.
 Over all, retail sales for the month climbed 1.2 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. But Easter shopping, warm weather and Wal-Mart's performance were responsible for much of that increase, rather than an across-the-board rebound in sales.
 The Easter holiday fell in April this year, a boost for stores selling children's clothes and for pharmacies and discounters that sell Easter candy. Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, reported that its sales at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent in April compared with those in the same month a year ago. 
 Without Wal-Mart, retail sales fell 2.7 percent last month. Still, several clothing stores reported that their sales also grew last month -- or at least fell at a slower pace than before. Many of the results were better than analysts' expectations, burnishing hopes that the consumer economy was no longer in a free fall.
 ''People are feeling a little bit more confident and optimistic,'' said Linda Tsai, a specialty retail analyst at MKM Partners.
 April was still difficult for high-end stores like Saks, which reported a 32 percent drop in sales at stores open at least a year. Abercrombie & Fitch said its sales fell 22 percent in April compared with the same month last year -- a stark decline, but less than the 34 percent drop it reported in March. 
 The numbers offered retailers some encouragement after a brutal few months. After one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in decades, companies cut their costs, reduced inventories, laid off employees and started conserving cash to survive a long freeze in consumer spending. 
 But the days of 20 percent sales declines seem to be over, at least for now. Sales at Gap Stores, which were off 23 percent in January, fell a mere 4 percent in April compared with the same month last year. Sales at American Eagle were off 5 percent, compared with a 22 percent decline in January. And double-digit declines at department stores like JC Penney, Kohl's and Dillards narrowed. 
 Figures released on Thursday in the SpendingPulse report from MasterCard Advisors showed declines in nearly every category of clothing retailers, but on a more moderate scale. Apparel sales fell 15 percent in April from a year earlier, compared with a 23 percent drop in March. 
 ''They're really the best numbers we've seen in anywhere from three to five months,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president of SpendingPulse, which estimates sales using data and computer modeling.
 Although consumer spending has shown some signs of stabilizing, growing 2.2 percent in the first three months of 2009, shoppers do not seem likely to return to their spendthrift ways anytime soon. Unemployment is still rising, incomes are falling, and while consumers are not as frightened as they were a few months ago, they are still wary about the economy.
 All that has been good for discounters like Wal-Mart, BJ's Wholesale Club and Target, where sales rose 0.3 percent in April after nine straight months of declines.
 Many stores are already offering 20 percent discounts and two-for-one deals on spring clothing, eager to compete for a smaller pool of customer dollars. Stores like Aeropostale, where sales rose 20 percent from last April, are capitalizing on the new thriftiness, and others are stepping up emphasis on value and customer service, analysts said.
 ''We believe that value is the new fashion chic,'' said Jennifer Black, president of Jennifer Black & Associates, which tracks apparel retailers. 
 During the holiday season, stores were so desperate to unload their stocks of electronic gadgets and sweater sets that they began offering discounts of 80 percent and three-for-one sales. Consumers who paid $5 for jeans now expect routine markdowns and bargains, and shoppers are still scarce enough that stores will fight for their business, analysts said.
 ''That discounting in the fourth quarter changed consumers,'' said Kimberly Greenberger, specialty retail analyst at Citigroup. 
 Stores that usually begin clearing spring and summer merchandise around Father's Day in June may start marking down items in the third of fourth week of May this year, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Taxing Those With Insurance to Pay for Those Without

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It is an alluring way to pay for the ambitious plan to expand health coverage to the nearly 50 million people who are now uninsured. Simply put, the government would tax the people who already have the most expensive health benefits, as provided by their employers.
 By one Congressional estimate, taxing this ''Cadillac coverage,'' as some call it, could yield $100 billion in revenue over five years. No wonder Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is a leader of the health reform effort, seems keen on the idea. And although the candidate Barack Obama criticized the notion last year when Senator John McCain promoted it, the concept now has some support in his administration as part of an overhaul of the health care system. 
 ''There aren't that many pots of gold to pay for health reform,'' said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy expert at the University of North Carolina. 
 But Mr. Oberlander and some other experts say Congress may have a difficult time devising a new tax on health benefits that does not threaten to do more harm than good. 
 If the plan is not designed carefully, they say, the additional taxes could affect many workers who are far from affluent and put the cost of adequate coverage further beyond the reach of many Americans. Some critics also warn that the taxes could undermine the employer-based coverage that is the bedrock of the nation's health insurance system. 
 The details have not yet been worked out. But critics say a tax could add to the burden of many employees, who already pay a hefty portion of their own insurance premiums and have additional out-of-pocket costs in the form of deductibles and annual co-payments. 
 And many people have high-priced insurance that is expensive for reasons unrelated to the quality of the coverage because they live in a high-cost city or work for a small business with old or sick employees. 
 ''We too often equate expensive health insurance with generous health insurance, and they're not the same,'' Mr. Oberlander said. ''It's not clear that you are going after 'Cadillac' health plans at all.''
 Right now, the amount that an employer spends on a worker's health insurance is not taxed as income, and employees can pay their share of premiums with before-tax earnings. The proposals being debated in Congress would start considering some part of the value of the health benefit as income and tax it accordingly. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which presides over tax legislation, made clear on Wednesday that he opposed a change in the tax treatment of health benefits. 
 And employer groups and labor officials have also come out against the idea. They say taxing benefits could endanger the current system of employer-based coverage, which now is responsible for insuring nearly two-thirds of Americans who are under 65 years old and have coverage. 
 ''If we began to tax employee benefits, there would be mutiny at the gate,'' said J. Randall MacDonald, an I.B.M. executive who is chairman of the HR Policy Association, which represents corporate human resource professionals. ''It's just counterintuitive to the problem we're trying to solve.''
 The challenge for Congress, aside from the political battles already stirring, is whether policy makers can come up with a proposal that addresses opponents' concerns, by limiting the tax to the wealthy, or otherwise fine-tuning it. 
 Proponents argue that the revenue could be raised by taxing only the most expensive policies for those people who can afford the few hundred or thousand dollars at stake -- money they say is essential to government's ability to provide basic coverage to more people. 
 ''We need the money,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist at the New America Foundation, which supports overhauling the current insurance system to give more people access.
 Some supporters of these plans say the current system gives an advantage to people who get coverage from their employer and to people with high incomes. 
 ''There is a huge consensus that this is inequitable and unfair tax treatment,'' said Robert E. Moffitt, a policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, which has long supported changing the tax laws and contends this is an area that might have significant bipartisan support. 
 What is more, some economists and policy analysts say the current system encourages overly generous coverage, which they say helps drive up the cost of medical care by keeping patients insulated from the true costs. ''One of the arguments for doing it is trying to achieve higher value through the health care system,'' said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health.
 But the political opposition remains fierce. 
 Union officials, for example, say that the proposed policy could translate into higher taxes for some of its members, many of whose contracts call for generous health benefits. ''Capping the tax exclusion would undermine the place where most Americans now get their coverage, before we have built a proven effective, sustainable alternative to employer-based plans,'' said Gerald M. Shea, an official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in recent testimony before Congress. 
 And there is little doubt that more expensive coverage does not always mean more generous coverage. Small companies, for example, typically pay more for the same benefits than large employers do. And some companies pay more in premiums because more of their employees are older or sicker. 
 Moreover, the cost of insurance varies in different parts of the country, so that someone with the same plan in New York or California will pay more than someone in North Dakota. 
 Congress may be able to balance these issues. But the problem, some policy analysts say, is that if a grand compromise ends up too narrowly defining the group of people who will end up paying the new tax, the amount of money raised might not be enough to make a difference in paying for health reform. 
 ''I think it's got some traction, but what happens when push comes to shove?'' asked Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, who recently completed a lengthy analysis of changing tax policy. 
 ''If it's not going to buy them much, why do it?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: DuPont to Trim 2,000 More Jobs as Profit Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
DuPont, the chemical company, said Thursday it would cut an additional 2,000 jobs as economic conditions continued to hurt some of its biggest customers. 
 The company had already announced 2,500 layoffs, in addition to eliminating about 10,000 contractor jobs.
 When DuPont released its first-quarter earnings results in January, executives said the severe downturn of 2008 had not abated, and that it was being forced to cut costs further.
 Profits through March tumbled 59 percent, to $488 million, or 54 cents a share, down from $1.19 billion, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier.
 Sales in construction and heavy industry, especially the auto sector, have been hit hard.
 ''What has happened since December is that the severity has escalated,'' a company spokesman, Anthony Farina, said. ''All you have to do is look at our first-quarter report, where volumes were down significantly, to see fundamental shifts in market.''
 DuPont said it would increase fixed-cost cuts to $1 billion, from $730 million.
 DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., said it would take a charge of $340 million to $390 million in the second quarter, about 40 percent of it noncash.
 The company said it would realize about $225 million in annual savings by the end of 2010.

HEADLINE: Wildfire Is Out of Control on Hills by Santa Barbara

BYLINE: By REBECCA CATHCART

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif. 

 BODY:
A wildfire on the hills near this oceanside city was only 10 percent contained on Thursday, and firefighters struggled to pen in the flames, which had destroyed 75 houses since they began on Tuesday. 
 Faltering winds slowed the fire's spread through the day, but officials worried that the blaze could worsen as the humidity dropped, temperatures rose and the evening winds returned.
 ''Firefighters have been building lines in pieces around the perimeter,'' said Mike Carr, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ''Now they are working to connect the dots.''
 The fire has burned about 2,793 acres, and 15,000 people have been evacuated from the area, which is known for its sprawling mansions and ocean views. A mandatory evacuation order was in effect for about seven square miles from the Santa Ynez foothills to just outside downtown Santa Barbara, the police said. Hotels in the area were near capacity, with families unable to return to their homes. 
 Mr. Carr said strong winds expected Thursday evening could threaten 3,500 homes and 100 businesses in the area.
 At a news conference here Thursday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said that the state's budget woes would not affect efforts to fight the fire but that the blaze presented a ''great challenge.''
 ''Seventy-five percent of the response cost'' would be covered by the federal government, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, after his declaration of a state of emergency on Wednesday.
 ''This is very, very helpful for us,'' he said, ''because, as you know, we have a financial crisis in California. But I want to reassure you all that even though we have this crisis, we will not be short of money when it comes to fighting this fire.''
 More than 9,000 elementary and high school students were evacuated from schools in the county on Thursday, said Barbara Keyani, a spokeswoman for Santa Barbara's two largest school districts. Ms. Keyani said 12 schools remained closed. 
 Ten firefighters have been injured, officials said, although most of the injuries were minor. No injuries were reported among evacuees.
 At 2 a.m. Thursday, as the winds that had fanned flames rapidly Wednesday afternoon slowed to fitful gusts, a few hundred firefighters slept between shifts in trucks and tents at the city fairgrounds. Sixty or so lay in sleeping bags scattered like blue cocoons over the trim lawn near their command post. 
 The air smelled of acidic, sweet wood smoke, and ash flakes fluttered to the ground. Crews from across Southern California had come to assist, said Capt. David Sadecki of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
 Geege Ostroff, 65, walking out of a Red Cross shelter in a high school down the road, said he and his wife, Carole, decided to evacuate ahead of orders on Tuesday, when they saw smoke plumes and orange flames near their home at the Santa Barbara Botanic Gardens, where he is a caretaker. 
 ''We knew that with the winds what they were, this would grow,'' Mr. Ostroff said. 
 He said he was sure his house had burned.
 ''Sometimes I think it's there,'' he said, as he held his hat in a gust of wind, ''then I realize it's gone. I miss the stupidest things now, like my coffee grinder. I want to be home.''

HEADLINE: Ready or Not, Katrina Victims Are Losing Temporary Housing

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Earnest Hammond, a retired truck driver, did not get any of the money that went to aid property owners after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
 He failed to qualify for one federal program and was told he missed the deadline on another. But he did get a trailer to live in while he carries out his own recovery plan: collecting cans in a pushcart to pay for the renovations to his storm-damaged apartment, storing them by the roomful in the gutted building he owns.
 It is a slow yet steady process. Before the price of aluminum fell to 30 cents a pound, from 85 cents, he had accumulated more than $10,000, he said, almost enough to pay the electrician. But despite such progress, last Friday a worker from the Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered a letter informing him that it would soon repossess the trailer that is, for now, his only home.
 ''I need the trailer,'' said Mr. Hammond, 70. ''I ain't got nowhere to go if they take the trailer.'' 
 Though more than 4,000 Louisiana homeowners have received rebuilding money only in the last six months, or are struggling with inadequate grants or no money at all, FEMA is intent on taking away their trailers by the end of May. The deadline, which ends temporary housing before permanent housing has replaced it, has become a stark example of recovery programs that seem almost to be working against one another.
 Thousands of rental units have yet to be restored, and not a single one of 500 planned ''Katrina cottages'' has been completed and occupied. The Road Home program for single-family homeowners, which has cost federal taxpayers $7.9 billion, has a new contractor who is struggling to review a host of appeals, and workers who assist the homeless are finding more elderly people squatting in abandoned buildings. 
 Nonetheless, FEMA wants its trailers back, even though it plans to scrap or sell them for a fraction of what it paid for them.
 ''All I can say is that this is a temporary program, it was always intended as a temporary program, and at a certain point all temporary programs must end,'' said Brent Colburn, the agency's director of external affairs. He said there would be no extensions.
 As of last week, there were two groups still in the agency's temporary housing program: more than 3,000 in trailers and nearly 80 who have been in hotels paid for by FEMA since last May, when it shut down group trailer sites. Most are elderly, disabled or both, including double amputees, diabetes patients, the mentally ill, people prone to seizures and others dependent on oxygen tanks. 
 Of those in trailers, more than 2,000 are homeowners who fear that the progress they are making in rebuilding will come to a halt if their trailers are taken. 
 ''They had helped me out up until this point, and I couldn't believe that they suddenly decided, no, we're not going to let you finish the house, we're just going to take the trailer, and you can sit here on an empty lot,'' said Philipp Seelig, 70, a retired handyman. He said he was about two months from being able to move back into his duplex in the Broadmoor neighborhood. A grant to elevate his house to the required height did not come until December.
 Progress on renovations has been slow for many reasons: contractors who did shoddy work or simply absconded with money, baffling red tape and rule changes, and inadequate grants. The opening of new rental units began to accelerate this year, but many projects have been stymied by the recession.
 FEMA says it has done everything it can to help those in temporary housing. But, as is so often the case when it comes to Katrina issues, the agency's clients give a different account. Agency officials insist, for example, that they have been working ''extensively'' to help families in trailers and hotels find permanent solutions. 
 ''A lot of people are involved in the process of making sure that no one falls through the cracks,'' said Manuel Broussard, an agency spokesman in Louisiana. ''Everyone's been offered housing up to this point several times. And for various reasons, they have not accepted it.''
 But the dozen temporary housing occupants interviewed for this story said they had received little if any attention from FEMA workers and were lucky to get a list of landlords, much less an offer of permanent housing.
 In Baton Rouge, Troy Porter, 47, had been staying in virtual isolation at a $100-a-night Courtyard Inn by Marriott since last June. There, his normally manageable depression deepened until, he said, he would go for weeks without leaving his room. 
 ''The only time I've seen FEMA workers was in the last couple of weeks, where they come and give you the paper saying this month is your last month,'' Mr. Porter said. ''They handed you the paper, and they turned around and walked off.''
 Mr. Porter perked up last week when he was visited by Sister Judith Brun, who has been working with Katrina evacuees. In her view, the type of case management endorsed by FEMA -- which primarily involves handing someone a list of phone numbers for other overtaxed agencies and, according to numerous Katrina victims, declining to return phone calls -- lacks the type of personal engagement that someone like Mr. Porter needs to become self-sufficient. 
 ''Because nobody comes in at a personal level to help him recover,'' Sister Judith said, ''it costs us tons of money.''
 Last year, the Louisiana Recovery Authority was supposed to unveil a more intensive caseworker system for people in temporary housing, but it never materialized. The authority has now asked homeless service organizations like Unity of Greater New Orleans and the Capital Area Alliance for the Homeless in Baton Rouge to help find stable housing for the hotel occupants.
 FEMA officials also say that residents can buy their trailers, sometimes for as little as $300. But virtually all of the residents interviewed said they had offered to do so and been told they could not.
 Residents said FEMA workers had started visiting them in the past two months, advising them not to move out and saying extensions would be available to those who showed hardship or progress in rebuilding. But agency officials said that was not the case. 
 Jane Batty, Mr. Seelig's longtime tenant, who has her own trailer next to his, was not surprised. ''There is only one way to categorize this kind of behavior: it's crazy making,'' she said. ''They've always had a different answer or had a different ploy to get us out of trailers that we had already agreed to buy.''

MARILYN MINTER
 'Green Pink Caviar'
 Salon 94 Freemans
 1 Freeman Alley, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side
 Through June 13 
 Id and superego fight it out on the lush picture planes of Marilyn Minter's conceptually canny painting, photography and video. Erotic attraction is the immediate effect. The centerpiece of this show, a billboard-size enamel-on-metal painting, reproduces with a lovingly sensuous touch (Ms. Minter finishes her surfaces with her fingers) a close-up, hugely enlarged, soft-focus photograph of a young female model licking beaded cake decorations off glass. Because the illusory glass is coincident with the painting's actual surface, it is as if the model were painting from the other side, using her tongue. 
 Hans Namuth's film of Jackson Pollock painting on glass comes to mind. Ms. Minter also captures tongue-painting action in her video ''Green Pink Caviar.'' As she languorously licks and kisses the glass, the video borders on pornography, a subject Ms. Minter has dealt with explicitly in the past.
 In its hedonistic excess, however, Ms. Minter's work also implies a Barbara Krugeresque critique of decadence in contemporary art, fashion and consumer culture. An 8-by-5-foot photograph called ''Chewing Pink'' shows from below a model with heavily shadowed eyes hungrily lapping up granulated pink candy, punning on powdered drugs like cocaine and heroin. 
 Ms. Minter's works are as much about addiction as about pleasure. The paintings of beautiful women blowing shimmering pink bubblegum bubbles? They're not about oral sex -- they're about the economy. KEN JOHNSON

BANK TEST RESULTS Announcing the results of the federal stress tests, regulators ordered 10 of the 19 largest financial institutions to raise a total of $75 billion in extra capital. 
 The results of the examinations drew a line in the banking industry between the stronger and the weaker. But the findings are hardly that clear cut. [B1.] 
 GMAC, the finance arm of General Motors, must raise $11.5 billion in capital, or roughly half its current equity, according the stress test evaluators. [B1.] 
 WHAT'S THAT NAME AGAIN? The Kindle electronic book reader has been praised as a technological advance, but its pronunciation feature still needs to catch up on some current events. [A1.] 
 BLEAK G.M. NUMBERS General Motors, which has received $15.4 billion in federal loans, is losing more money and sales than it was in late December, when it received its first bailout. Its sluggish quarter has some analysts expecting it to file for bankruptcy protection. [B1.] 
 HEALTH CARE TAXES Senator Max Baucus, below, Democrat of Montana, is a leader of a health reform effort that would tax people with the most expensive health benefits. The proposal has no shortage of critics, who say it could affect many workers who are far from affluent. [B1.] 
 MICROSOFT'S STRATEGY Microsoft is said to be planning to argue against a European Commission proposal, part of an antitrust inquiry, that it promote competing browsers in its operating system. Its argument will be that such a move would strengthen Google's dominance in the global search-ad market. [B7.] 
 EUROPEAN FARM SUBSIDIES Newly released figures show that an elite class of beneficiaries received more than 700 payments of at least 1 million euros each in farm subsidies from the European Union last year. In that group was an Italian bank, which received slightly more than 180 million euros. [B7.] 
 EUROPE RATE CUT The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point, to 1 percent, and the Bank of England held its interest rate at 0.5 percent. [B7.] 
 A.I.G. LOSS The American International Group lost $4.35 billion in the first quarter, but it said that it did not need any more government assistance and that its losses had slowed. [B5.]

HEADLINE: Recipients of Europe Farm Grants Disclosed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The largest beneficiaries of European Union farm subsidies include an Italian bank in Milan, a French chicken giant and an Irish producer of Weight Watchers meals and Yorkshire pudding, according to previously undisclosed data for 2008. 
 The statistics, for subsidies in 2008, show that an elite class of beneficiaries got more than 700 payments of at least 1 million euros ($1.33 million). The largest payment, 140 million euros, went to the Italian sugar company Italia Zuccheri. An Italian bank, ICBPI, got more than 180 million euros in five payments.
 The list shows that an Irish agribusiness called Greencore, which produces Weight Watchers meals in the United States and Europe, received more than 83 million euros in 2008, the fourth-largest subsidy. The French chicken giant Doux earned almost 63 million euros. 
 Under pressure from the 27-nation European Union, 26 countries published the information. Farmsubsidy.org, a nonprofit group that campaigns for transparency in the reporting of subsidies, compiled a list of the top recipients in 18 of those countries. The group said it could not include data from nine countries for technical reasons. Germany has not disclosed recipients. 
 The list reflects the way huge agribusinesses in the European Union receive the biggest slices from a farm subsidy pie that is worth more than 50 billion euros a year across all member nations.
 ''There is no argument for these larger payments,'' said Harald von Witzke, a professor of international agricultural trade and economic development at Humboldt University of Berlin. ''If they are designed to be part of social policy, there is no justification. If they are meant to compensate farmers for having higher environmental standards in the E.U., then they are being paid too much.''
 Simon Michel-Berger, of Copa-Cogeca, which represents European farmers and agriculture cooperatives, disagreed.
 ''We think it's justified that larger farmers receive larger single farm payments than smaller ones because they are also taking care of a larger area of land,'' he said. ''In addition, one should also consider that we have a progressive income tax in all E.U. member states, and so larger farmers will already be paying more in tax than smaller farmers.''
 The newly released figures still leave many questions unanswered, including what company practices led to the payments. 
 ''The problem is that we don't know why this money was paid,'' said Jack Thurston, a co-founder of farmsubsidy.org. ''The E.U.'s Common Agricultural Policy is made up of dozens of different schemes from export subsidies to citric acid processing grants to money for organic farming and income support.''
 The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it was important to consider the context for some payments. For example, said Kristian Schmidt, deputy head of cabinet for Siim Kallas, vice president of the commission, large subsidies for many sugar producers included one-time payments to help reduce the size of the industry.

 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090507 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090507
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'HERNAN BAS: WORKS FROM THE RUBELL FAMILY COLLECTION,' through May 24. With a loose, deft touch, this young Miamian paints and draws storytelling images of winsome young men in homoerotically charged situations. He also creates video installations, the best of which involve old films of women in mermaid costumes performing underwater. This disproportionately big and splashy 10-year retrospective was organized by, and first appeared at (in 2007), the Rubell Family Collection, a private museum in Miami where the art collectors Don and Mera Rubell exhibit their holdings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090507
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20090507
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600,'through June 21. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So it's no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CAST IN BRONZE: FRENCH SCULPTURE FROM RENAISSANCE TO REVOLUTION,'through May 25. Most of the works in this impeccably scholarly exhibition display a cold impersonality, cramped imagination and slavish obeisance to the official culture of their times. But there are compelling exceptions, including small, action-packed sculptures representing episodes in the life of Hercules by Francois Lespingola, and Jean-Antoine Houdon's ''Winter or La Frileuse,'' a heartbreakingly lovely statue of a young woman nude, except for a shawl wrapped around her bowed head and shoulders.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,'through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,'through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WALKER EVANS AND THE PICTURE POSTCARD,'through May 25. This compact exhibition, the first drawn from the museum's extensive Walker Evans archives, unforgettably illuminates Evans's lean, influential documentary style: it features the picture postcards he collected from age 12 onward, an ultimate collection of 9,000 examples organized by subject. The show includes some 700 arranged in expanses that bring to mind Conceptual Art. Most visually rewarding is a smattering of his photographs, seen beside the postcards he made from them, for an unrealized project with the Museum of Modern Art. He was fearless about cropping, and often made outstanding images even better.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,'through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- still looks good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one of them, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090507
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,'through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and de-posited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090507
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER,' through May 24. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)20090507
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,'through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090507
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'INTO THE SUNSET: PHOTOGRAPHY'S IMAGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST,'through June 8. Almost every one of this resonant exhibition's approximately 150 pictures dating from 1850 to 2008 evokes tension between the myth and the reality of the great American West. Its overall perspective is predictably bleak, but it is loaded with arresting images, from the 19th-century group portrait of the outlaw gang the Wild Bunch in suits and bowler hats, to Irving Penn's glamorizing studio shot of five Hells Angels and their two girlfriends.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090507
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 1: TEHCHING HSIEH,'through May 18. This small, gripping exhibition -- the first in a series dedicated to performance art -- centers on the documentation of ''Cage Piece'' (1978-79), the first of five ''One Year Performances'' by the deprivation-prone Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. The piece entailed spending one year doing absolutely nothing in nearly solitary confinement in a cell-like cage, built in the artist's studio. The show includes the cell, as well as daily photographs of the artist that measure the year in the growth of his hair. Few performance pieces communicate the demands of this particular genre in such a basic, resonant way, or its ability to expand our understanding of time and space with such simple force.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090507
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TANGLED ALPHABETS: LEON FERRARI AND MIRA SCHENDEL,'through June 15. This overly full show mixes together partial accounts of the work of two important South American artists instead of focusing on one. Leon Ferrari (Argentine, born 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, born in Switzerland, 1919-1988) shared an interest in abstraction contaminated by language, line and modest materials, especially paper and wire. But Ferrari is, at heart, a sardonic, sometimes grandiose Conceptualist whose best works elaborate a maniacal, nonsense calligraphy. Schendel was a purist with a Zen slant, adept at transferring random marks and letters to rice paper, from which she also made ephemeral sculptures. While the show opens a window on a complex history that ran parallel to, not behind, postwar art in the United States, the double survey suggests a failure to commit. Our loss.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090507
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090507
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; and Guthrie Lonergan. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090507
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090507
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s, and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090507
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes target the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist. Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090507
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'JENNY HOLZER: PROTECT PROTECT,'through May 31. After decades of pelting us with unsettling, increasingly relevant portents, Jenny Holzer can say, ''I told you so.'' This 15-year survey proves that her signature LED-sign conflations of poetry, politics, reading and seeing are ever more dazzling; her warnings about the military-commercial-entertainment complex ever more pertinent. In addition, as time has overtaken her, Ms. Holzer has turned from soothsaying to simply reporting the facts. Her latest light works and paintings take their language and motifs entirely from declassified and redacted government documents concerning the war in Iraq. This is a beautiful show, but not a pretty sight.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090507
 Galleries: Chelsea
 ANDRE ETHIER: 'HEADING SOUTH,' through May 16. Funny, faux-naive paintings by this Toronto artist resemble the works of a semitalented high school stoner steeped in heavy metal music, fantasy novels and French Symbolism. Mr. Ethier paints on easel-size panels in oleaginous glazes, creating an oozy, finger-painting-like luminosity. He makes cartoonish portraits of gnomes, cyclopes, old hippies and other characters who seem to belong to some ramshackle place like a derelict neighborhood in ''The Hobbit.'' Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. (Johnson)20090507
 GLENN GOLDBERG: 'WELCOME,' through May 23. Glenn Goldberg's paintings of birds and flowers are bright accumulations of colorful pointillist dots that bring to mind both samplers and mandalas. This show includes pieces large (for him) and small, and adds fluid-filled, blown-glass sculptures that look like a cross between ritual instruments and toys. The effect is disciplined and pixilated, like a spring picnic with a shaman. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, third floor, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com. (Cotter)20090507
 RON NAGLE: 'BOOKENDS, WEEORAMAS AND FLAREWARE,' through May 30. This California artist has been creating small ceramic wonders since the 1960s. The eight delightful and diminutive sculptures in this show revolve around the form of bookends: twin, L-shape structures between which you could sandwich a couple of slim volumes of poetry. The cracker-thin ends have matte, granular surfaces lovingly glazed in hues ranging from earthy grays to Sunday funnies primaries. They also have sexually and scatologically suggestive elements nicely offsetting the hallucinogenic beauty. George Adams Gallery, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com. (Johnson)20090507
 'PICASSO: MOSQUETEROS,' through June 6. The takeaway from this staggering exhibition of around 100 late paintings and prints: in the main, Picasso only got better. Canvases depicting musketeers, entangled lovers and thick-limbed nudes abound. All look fabulous in the naturally lighted, unencumbered spaces -- free of lobbies, text panels and admission charges -- which contribute to the once-in-a-lifetime intensity. The combined effect contradicts generations of received opinion, proving that in his last decade in particular (1962-72) Picasso often achieved an emotional rawness, physical immediacy and joyful pictorial wickedness that was new to his art. His involvement with ceramics and the shorthand speed of glaze paintings undoubtedly contributed, as suggested by two paintings on tiles in the show. Like the 1908 masterpiece ''Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' these works turn painting inside out. If they have not similarly changed the course of art history, give them time. First they deserve their due. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20090507
 PETER SAUL: 'NEW PAINTINGS,' through May 23. The irrepressible Mr. Saul continues his cheerfully acerbic ways. With their pneumatic forms neatly rendered with a spongy, semi-pointillist touch in glowing colors, his cartoon paintings are like enlarged stills from a twisted animated film. In ''Viva la Difference,'' a grinning bon vivant with a martini in one hand wraps his arm around an amorphous blob that sprouts multiple breasts and is perforated by numerous vaginal orifices. Talk about your male gaze! David Nolan Gallery, 527 West 29th Street, (212) 925-6190, davidnolangallery.com. (Johnson)20090507
 Galleries: SoHo
 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING,' through July 23. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)20090507
 Galleries: Other
 'NOBLE TOMBS AT MAWANGDUI: ART AND LIFE IN THE CHANGSHA KINGDOM, THIRD CENTURY B.C.E. TO FIRST CENTURY C.E.,' through June 7. In the early 1970s three tombs were discovered in southeastern China. Because they had never been plundered and because of the unusually well-preserved state of their contents, the discovery caused a worldwide sensation in archaeological circles. This show presents about 70 of more than 3,000 objects that were excavated, including fabric samples, lacquer ware, lamps, grooming tools and wooden figurines. China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Johnson)20090507
 WARD SHELLEY: 'WHO INVENTED THE AVANT GARDE (AND OTHER HALF-TRUTHS),' through May 17. Drawing with ink and paint on sheets of Mylar in a cartoonish style, Mr. Shelley creates intriguingly eccentric flow charts that analyze particular historic developments, mostly having to do with modern art. In the gallery's back room he has installed hundreds of cardboard boxes, each with an amusing label describing its supposed contents: ''Pandora's Socks'' and ''Submerging Artists,'' for example. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, (718) 599-2144, pierogi2000.com. (Johnson)20090507
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY,' through June 21. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090507
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama Hope poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090507
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090507
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic, subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090507
 Last Chance
 ADEL ABDESSEMED: 'RIO'; closes on Saturday. The wheels of the international-art-stardom machine are turning, but they don't get much traction. Videos, photographs, installations and sculptures convey a lexicon of current biennial modes: identity politics, conceptual photography, performance strategies executed in real life, found and altered objects (including three small airplanes) and the sensational exploitation of living things. The show's strength may be the way the works' arrangement leads you through the gallery's large spaces, but it quickly becomes obvious that you need to do little more than tag along in ''I get it'' mode. David Zwirner, 519, 525 and 533 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)20090507
 FRANK CALLOWAY: 'PAGEANTS FROM THE OLD SOUTH'; closes on Saturday. The mural-size scrolls of this talented Alabama outsider artist, who is thought to be 112, present a world of houses, farm animals, factories, sundry vehicles and machines, as well as the workmen who keep them all going. The images seem to start out as line drawings, and are then enhanced by wonderfully textured expanses of radiant colors, mostly in crayon, that seem anything but filled in. An impeccable sense of proportion governs the forms, and the butcher paper used provides an all-important whiteness visible that adds glimmers to the structures at opportune times. A buoyant optimism pervades. Edlin Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Smith)20090507
 DREXEL UNIVERSITY: 'INK NOT INK'; closes on Saturday. Organized by the Shenzhen Art Museum in China, and making a one-stop appearance in the United States, this ambitious exhibition of 40 artists, most living in China, many working on a large scale, is intended to give a sense of the many uses to which the ink medium and its associated techniques, time-honored in China, are being put today. Landscape makes an expected appearance, but much of the work is figurative or abstract. Forms range from conventional brush-and-ink on paper, to sculpture and collage. An immense hanging piece by the well-known artist Wenda Gu is made of human hair. As Abbie Dean and Joseph Gregory, who coordinated the show, point out, after the suppressions of the Cultural Revolution and the innovations of globalism, the future direction of ink painting in China remains an open question, and a fascinating one. Sponsored by the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Art and Design, the show is in three Drexel locations: the Bossone Research Center and the Paul Peck Alumni Center, which are next door to each other, and the Leonard Pearlstein Gallery in Nesbitt Hall, a short walk away. Drexel University: Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, 33rd and Market Streets, Philadelphia, drexel.edu/inknotink. (Cotter)20090507
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE NORTON SIMON MUSEUM'; closes on Sunday. In a rare exchange that inaugurates a reciprocal loan agreement, five paintings from the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif., have been temporarily installed in the Frick's Oval Room. The Simon paintings, which date from the 16th and 17th centuries, bring a whiff of fresh air into the Frick. None of the artists -- two Spaniards, two Italians and one Flemish master -- are currently represented in its collection. Of special note are Francisco de Zurbaran's ''Still Life With Lemons, Oranges and a Rose'' (1633), which has been freshly cleaned for the occasion, and Guercino's commanding portrait of an Italian count's pet mastiff, ''Aldrovandi Dog'' (1625). 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)20090507
 SHEELA GOWDA AND YAMINI NAYAR; closes on Saturday. The better-known figure in this two-woman exhibition is the Indian artist Sheela Gowda, whose 1999 installation ''Private Gallery'' offers a subtle and unlikely blend of architecture and watercolor painting and a show-within-the-show. She is paired with the young American artist Yamini Nayar, who also works with installation, but translated into photographs: fantastic interiors that look both ruined and ethereal, as if winds, floods and fires had blown through them. Thomas Erben Gallery is taking important steps to introduce contemporary South Asian artists to the city. You can check out pieces by Sreshta Rit Premnath and Chitra Ganesh in a side room. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com. (Cotter)20090507
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: THE PROBLEM PERSPECTIVE';closes on Monday. The career of the German artist Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997 at 44, was a brief, bold, foot-to-the-floor episode of driving under the influence. What was he high on? Alcohol, ambition, disobedience, motion, compulsive sociability, history and art in its many forms. But art in its many forms was exactly what he made -- specifically paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, prints, posters, books -- all in madly prolific quantities. In every sense, he took up a lot of space, and he continues to in this first American retrospective, which spills out of top-floor galleries and down into the atrium. Not everything has equal punch. If messy and bad aren't your thing, and pristine objects are, he's not the artist for you. Yet in each work, the model he set for what an artist can be and do shines through.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20090507
 WILLIAM WILLIS: 'SIMPLICITY, PATIENCE, COMPASSION '; closes on Saturday. This show of modest, well-constructed paintings lives up to Lao-Tze's three principles and throws in some originality to boot. Mr. Willis, who has exhibited in New York since 1981, works in a style of borderline abstraction in which eccentric geometric shapes, both plain and patterned, are propped against one another, intimating temporary still lifes or stage sets. Evocations of wood grain, along with stripes and dots and a proscenium space, bring to mind the portraits, landscapes and painted furniture of classic American folk art, as well as early Modernists like Stuart Davis and Juan Gris. An intelligent, appealing show. HS Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (646) 486-7004, howardscottgallery.com. (Smith)20090507

HEADLINE: An Inquiry Into Firms That Offer To Cut Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Calling debt settlement ''a rogue industry'' that gives strapped consumers false hopes while socking them with high fees, New York State's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, has announced an investigation involving numerous companies in the field.
 Settlement companies, which are flourishing as the recession deepens, negotiate with credit card companies to reduce balances on behalf of consumers. The consumers usually pay an initial fee, often 15 percent of the total debt. 
 During the settlement process, the interest and fees from the card companies continue to mount. Personal finance experts say that settlement companies often break their promise to help, and many of the consumers end up more in debt than ever.
 ''These companies prey on people who are doing the right thing by seeking to manage their debt and get control of their finances,'' Mr. Cuomo said on Thursday through an aide. ''With all of the problems we face in this time of economic distress, it is outrageous that these firms are targeting those who are the most financially vulnerable.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo sent subpoenas to 14 settlement companies and one law firm to discover their fee structures, number of clients and whether they are indeed providing the advertised relief.
 Robby H. Birnbaum, a lawyer who represents settlement companies and is on the board of an industry trade group, said Mr. Cuomo was engaging in ''a P.R. stunt.'' 
 ''The press release was issued before any of these companies even received subpoenas, so we have nothing to respond to,'' Mr. Birnbaum said. 
 The subpoenas represent a broadening of an inquiry by the attorney general into two settlement firms, Nationwide Asset Services Inc., based in Phoenix, and Credit Solutions of America Inc., based in Richardson, Tex.
 A suit against Nationwide Asset on consumer fraud charges is in preparation, a person close to the investigation said. Nationwide did not return calls for comment. The chief executive of Credit Solutions, Doug Van Arsdale, said via e-mail that the company ''subscribes to the highest ethical standards'' and was cooperating with the investigation.
 In March, the Texas attorney general sued Credit Solutions, which says it is the largest debt settlement firm in the country, accusing it of engaging in ''false, deceptive and misleading acts and practices.'' The company said then that it did not comment on pending litigation.
 As many as 2,000 settlement companies operate in the United States, up from a handful at the beginning of the decade. Unlike debt collectors, they are only loosely regulated. 
 Mr. Cuomo said he issued subpoenas to the following firms: American Debt Foundation Inc., American Financial Service, Consumer Debt Solutions, Credit Answers L.L.C., Debt Remedy Solutions L.L.C., Debt Settlement America, Debt Settlement USA, Debtmerica Relief, DMB Financial L.L.C., Freedom Debt Relief, New Era Debt Solutions, New Horizons Debt Relief Inc., Preferred Financial Services Inc., U.S. Financial Management Inc. (operating as My Debt Negotiation) and Allegro Law.
 Several of the companies said they would welcome an investigation of the industry as well as tougher regulations.
 ''The only companies that will suffer are those that don't offer genuine value,'' said Jeff Takle, a spokesman for DMB Financial in Beverly, Mass. Robert Linderman, general counsel for Freedom Debt Relief in San Mateo, Calif., echoed those remarks. ''We're delighted the attorney general is seeking information from the industry,'' he said.
 Jeff Tenenbaum, a lawyer representing New Horizons Debt Relief in Aliso Viejo, Calif., said the firm ''puts tremendous emphasis on legal compliance, educating clients, and not making deceptive or misleading claims about its services.''
 A spokeswoman for American Debt Foundation in Fort Lauderdale declined to comment. A spokeswoman for American Financial Service in Bakersfield, Calif., said, ''I would appreciate it if you didn't call back'' and hung up. 
 Consumer Debt Solutions in Coral Gables, Fla.; Debt Remedy Solutions in Boca Raton, Fla.; Debtmerica in Santa Ana, Calif.; and New Era Debt Solutions in Camarillo, Calif., did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Other firms could not be reached.

HEADLINE: What Happens to the American Dream in a Recession?

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Given the battered economy, increasing joblessness and collapse of the housing market, what is the state of the American dream?
 Pollsters for The New York Times and CBS News set out last month to try to answer that question. And the results seemed somewhat contradictory.
 Although the nation has plunged into its deepest recession since the Great Depression, 72 percent of Americans in this nationwide survey said they believed it is possible to start out poor in the United States, work hard and become rich -- a classic definition of the American dream. 
 And yet only 44 percent said they had actually achieved the American dream, although 31 percent said they expect to attain it within their lifetime. Only 20 percent have given up on ever reaching it. Those 44 percent might not sound like much, but it is an increase over the 32 percent who said they had achieved the American dream four years ago, when the economy was in much better shape.
 Compared with four years ago, fewer people now say they are better off than their parents were at their age or that their children will be better off than they are.
 So even though their economic outlook is worse, more people are saying they have either achieved the dream or expect to do so.
 What gives?
 We asked Barry Glassner, who is a professor of sociology at the University of Southern California and studies contemporary culture and beliefs.
 ''You want to hold on to your dream even more when times are hard,'' he said. ''And if you want to hold on to it, then you better define it differently.''
 In other words, people are shifting their definition of the American dream. And the poll -- conducted on April 1 to 5 with 998 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points-- indicated just that.
 The Times and CBS News asked this same open-ended question four years ago and again last month: ''What does the phrase 'The American dream' mean to you?''
 Four years ago, 19 percent of those surveyed supplied answers that related to financial security and a steady job, and 20 percent gave answers that related to freedom and opportunity.
 Now, fewer people are pegging their dream to material success and more are pegging it to abstract values. Those citing financial security dropped to 11 percent, and those citing freedom and opportunity expanded to 27 percent. 
 Here's some respondents' answers that were put in the category of freedom and opportunity:
 ''Freedom to live our own life.''
 ''Created equal.''
 ''Someone could start from nothing.''
 ''That everybody has a fair chance to succeed.''
 ''To become whatever I want to be.''
 ''To be healthy and have nice family and friends.''
 ''More like Huck Finn; escape to the unknown; follow your dreams.''
 Those who responded in material terms were hardly lavish. Here's a sampling:
 ''Basically, have a roof over your head and put food on the table.''
 ''Working at a secure job, being able to have a home and live as happily as you can not spending too much money.''
 ''Just financial stability.''
 ''Owning own home, having civil liberties.''
 Mr. Glassner said, ''For the vast majority of Americans at every point in history, the prospect of achieving the American dream has been slim but the promise has been huge.''
 ''At its core, this notion that anyone can be president or anyone can be a billionaire is absurd,'' he said. ''A lot of Americans work hard, but they don't become president and they don't become billionaires.''
 Still, he said, Americans have always believed in possibilities. And they have consistently said over time that they can start poor in this country and become rich, regardless of the economy or their circumstances. The 72 percent who feel that way today is down from the 81 percent who felt that way in 2007, but 72 percent is still a very high percentage, especially given the downward economy. 
 ''It would be hard to find another country where it's as high,'' Mr. Glassner said.
 The percentage of people who say the American dream does not exist or is only an illusion has remained low -- 3 percent today and 2 percent four years ago. As one such person put it to our pollsters last month: ''A bunch of hooey.''
 By the way, the phrase ''the American dream'' is generally agreed to have been coined first in 1931, in the midst of the Depression. In his book, ''The Epic of America,'' the historian James Truslow Adams wrote, ''It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain the fullest stature of which they are innately capable.''

HEADLINE: A Cape Cod 'Vessel' For the Whole Crew

BYLINE: By LISA A. PHILLIPS

 BODY:
DAVID E. A. CARSON knows how transformative innovative architecture can be. In the mid-1980s, as chief executive of People's Bank in Bridgeport, Conn., he commissioned Richard Meier to design a new headquarters for the company. The result was Mr. Meier's first high-rise, a 16-story tower with a curving facade that has been credited with spearheading a renaissance of the city's downtrodden downtown.
 Mr. Carson, now 74 and retired from the bank, kept that in mind when building a home in Wellfleet, Mass., where he has taken his family every summer since 1961. He had always rented his Cape Cod getaways, but in 1997, his three children suggested that perhaps it was time for him to build a place of his own. And, they asked, could the house include a room for each of them and their growing families to visit? 
 He was glad to oblige. He turned to a local architect, Alan P. Dodge, who invited suggestions not only from Mr. Carson and his wife, Sara, but also from their children. 
 ''I didn't want the house to be just mine,'' Mr. Carson said. ''I wanted it to be a concept we all bought into.'' 
 The result, completed in 2001 for $2.3 million, is a multilevel four-bedroom contemporary home with a great room at its core for family gatherings. The house, set on a steep, wooded one-acre lot, has several sublevels, with rooms and balconies separated from the main floors by a few steps. 
 Even when the house is full of guests, the layout offers privacy. ''Within the large shape, the architect was able to create these places where you can be apart,'' Mr. Carson said. 
 The house is 5,000 square feet, but because it is tucked into a hillside, it appears far more modest. 
 ''We tried to build the house into the surroundings rather than compete with them,'' Mr. Carson said. ''We wanted to be part of the community.''
 The exterior has a strong Asian influence, with brick-red geometric roof sections reminiscent of a pagoda. The siding is classic Cape Cod cedar shingles, now sufficiently weathered to blend in with the more traditional bungalows and cottages in Wellfleet. 
 Inside, the open floor plan is shaped like the front of a ship, with the great room coming to a point at what Mr. Carson's family affectionately calls the prow, a sitting area overlooking a pine- and oak-covered hillside. ''I discover people who visit like to sit there, reading or just being quiet,'' he said. 
 He calls the house the Kolumns, for the pairs of dark-red steel K-shaped ceiling supports. Viewed from the mezzanine, the four sets of columns emphasize the shape of the house, which Mr. Carson said was originally intended to suggest an oak leaf. ''But when I first saw the house put together, I said, 'This looks like a ship,' '' he said. 
 The effect may not have been intentional, but the home's nautical feeling ties in neatly with Mr. Carson's story. The son of a merchant seaman and grandson of a sea captain in Birkenhead, a port in England, Mr. Carson and his family sailed to America in 1938. He lived on the shore in Bridgeport. 
 ''I love the sea and the sand,'' Mr. Carson said. ''It's part of my DNA, I guess. The water and things that border on the water -- beaches, sea life, harbors -- are fascinating and a great stimulus, and keep the mind active.'' 
 But the Kolumns would not make a very seaworthy vessel, owing to the sheer weight of the materials. The floors are poured concrete, as are the kitchen countertops and the piers flanking the steps leading down to the great room. One wall in the hall leading to the guest wing is also concrete, with a raised pattern of octagons and Xs from a mold designed by Mr. Dodge. 
 Tawny yellow and terra-cotta dyes in the floor and counters offset the starkness of the concrete. Radiant heating warms the house from the floor up, with large south-facing windows inviting passive solar heat. ''People don't think of the house as a cold, concrete and steel thing,'' Mr. Carson said. 
 Play spaces abound for the Carsons' six grandchildren, who are 8 to 14. An art room full of crafts, paints and Magic Markers is down the hall from the kitchen. The balconies are popular launching sites for paper airplanes. 
 A downstairs recreation room is filled with toys, puzzles, games and an assortment of videos. Costumes -- including a firefighter's uniform, a Superman cape and princess dresses -- hang on a pair of miniature hall trees. 
 ''The first thing the young ones do when they come here is decide what they're going to be,'' Mr. Carson said, ''and they become someone else for a while.'' 
 When Mr. Carson was the chief executive of People's Bank, he had his own trademark costume: natty business suits topped with one of his collection of 140 bow ties. The ties were part of his maverick image. He danced cameo roles with the Connecticut Ballet and let two children from Simsbury, Conn., persuade him to restore free lollipops that had fallen victim to bank budget cuts.
 His leadership tactics, which included expanding the bank's training department and credit card business as other banks were cutting back in these areas, helped People's survive the banking crisis of the early 1990s, Mr. Carson said. 
 Now called People's United Bank, it is the largest bank chartered in Connecticut, according to state records.
 Watching the current economic crisis from Wellfleet and the high-rise apartment in downtown Hartford where he lives full-time, Mr. Carson has no magic solutions. He calmly points out that there are plenty of banks that are not in trouble. ''They stayed true to their principles,'' he said, ''lending money to the people who would pay it back.'' 
 Mr. Carson has yet to fully retire his business acumen or his bow ties -- he dons them once or twice a month. He serves on corporate and nonprofit boards in Hartford and Wellfleet. He is a financial consultant to and an investor in a number of Cape Cod projects, including Mac's Seafood, a group of restaurants and retail stores, and Cape Tracks, which produces audio tours. 
 Mr. Carson also helps raise money for Wellfleet Preservation Hall, a former Roman Catholic Church that is being renovated into a community center. He recently ventured into film, becoming a producer of ''The Golden Boys,'' shot in nearby Chatham and starring Rip Torn and Mariel Hemingway. It was released nationally last month. 
 There is still plenty of time to savor the seaside pleasures that brought him to Wellfleet in the first place. His mornings start with a mile-long walk into town for a newspaper. In the summer, he bodysurfs, kayaks and plays innkeeper, hosting a stream of guests. 
 In the off-season, he goes out to the Kolumns a few times a month, often alone. Mr. Carson calls Wellfleet ''a spiritual place.'' 
 ''It is incredibly beautiful, one of the first places settled by the Europeans who came to this country,'' he said. ''You wake up in the morning and find wild turkeys in the yard, then the next day it's coyote. You're part of the Northeast Corridor, but it's still the primitive land the Pilgrims arrived at.''

HEADLINE: Weekly Rise in New Jobless Claims Slows Down

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New applications for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in 14 weeks, but the number of unemployed workers getting benefits climbed to a record.
 The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of newly laid off workers applying for benefits dropped to 601,000 last week. That was far better than the rise to 635,000 claims that economists expected. 
 But the total number of people receiving jobless benefits climbed to 6.35 million, a 14th straight record week.
 The four-week moving average of initial jobless claims, which smoothes out volatility, totaled 623,500 last week, a decrease of more than 30,000 from the high in early April. 
 In a separate report, the government said that productivity, a significant ingredient to rising living standards, grew at a 0.8 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, slightly better than the 0.6 percent increase that economists had expected. Wage pressures, as measured by unit labor costs, increased at a 3.3 percent rate, down from a 5.7 percent spike in the fourth quarter.
 While wage pressures' outpacing productivity normally would raise alarms about inflation, the threat of any price spikes is seen as remote. Regulators and economists are not worried about inflation since workers are more concerned about keeping their jobs than seeking higher wages.
 Despite the big drop in new applications for jobless benefits last week, the claims remained at elevated levels. By comparison, weekly jobless claims totaled 372,00 a year ago.
 But since peaking at 674,000 in March, claims have been trending lower, raising hopes that the wave of layoffs that has rocked the country could be easing a bit.
 Among the states, Michigan had the largest increase in claims, with 9,998 more for the week ending April 25, which it attributed to more layoffs in the automobile industry, according to the Labor Department. The next largest increases were in Massachusetts, Kentucky, North Carolina and New York.
 California had the largest drop in claims with 10,833, a result of fewer layoffs in the construction and service industries. The next biggest declines were in Georgia, South Carolina, Wisconsin and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: PBS to Shorten Time Commitments For Sponsorships

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
COMPANIES will soon be able to sponsor some PBS programs for as little as one week at a time, rather than a full year. 
 Feeling the pinch of marketing budgets, public television stations are being forced to be more creative when they approach corporate underwriters. This week the Sponsorship Group for Public Television, a sales organization for the Boston station WGBH and other producers, said it would encourage companies to underwrite children's shows like ''Arthur'' and ''Clifford'' for as little as a single week or as many as 10 weeks this summer. 
 Until now, the Sponsorship Group offered only full-year sponsorships. ''We're trying to be more flexible,'' said Suzanne Zellner, the vice president for corporate sponsorships for WGBH. 
 While PBS officials spurn the word advertising, critics say shorter sponsorship stints are another example of the creeping commercialization of public television. 
 PBS executives say the summer-long sales period for PBS Kids is the most extensive experiment to date with shorter sponsorship periods. Chalk it up to the changing needs of corporations, especially in a tumultuous economy. 
 ''Marketing decisions are being made closer to air time,'' Ms. Zellner said. ''Budgets are being determined one to two quarters beforehand. We want to be responsive to the marketplace.'' 
 Last month, for instance, the Walt Disney Company completed a one-month sponsorship of ''Frontline,'' ''Nature'' and ''Nova'' that promoted the release of the film ''Earth.'' 
 PBS has historically signed sponsors for annual partnerships; some of them have continued for decades. Short messages identifying the sponsors appear before and after programs. Distinguishing the segments from ads on commercial channels, the sponsors are forbidden from including what PBS labels a ''call to action.'' But fewer and fewer companies are interested in making long-term commitments to programmers. PBS's financing from corporations has eroded over the years; ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' the broadcaster's evening news program, has two of its four national sponsor spots available. PBS reported about $101 million in revenue from corporate underwriting last year, compared with $123 million five years ago. Andrew Russell, senior vice president of PBS Ventures, said the broadcaster was trying to ''mesh better to the time frames and the decision-making processes that corporations have now.'' 
 Last year the broadcaster upgraded its computer systems so that it could swap out sponsor messages more frequently, shortening the wait for new spots. 
 ''No longer do we have to hold a sale and wait until September comes around,'' Ms. Zellner said. 
 In the fall PBS will start providing more timely ratings to corporate sponsors, addressing another familiar complaint from potential marketers, that they didn't have enough information about the audience they were reaching with their messages. 
 PBS's efforts to put its shows on the Internet with advertising have also come under scrutiny. Last year the broadcaster upset some staff members when it placed episodes of ''Nova,'' ''Wired Science'' and other shows on Hulu, a popular video Web site. The site includes a commercial before the episodes, just as it does for shows on other networks that are not publicly supported, and splits the revenue with PBS. But PBS officials said the site prohibited commercial breaks with their shows. 
 Last month the broadcaster unveiled a new video portal on PBS.org that is more closely tied to the local stations. Web episodes of ''American Experience'' are sponsored by Liberty Mutual, just as they are on TV. 
 Mr. Russell said the next iteration of the video site would include pre-episode ads and banner ads, but that the guidelines for it had not been completed. 
 Susan Linn, the director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, an advocacy group, said that PBS had been moving toward a more commercial approach ''for a long time,'' and said that changes to the sponsorship model were ''undermining parents and harming children.'' 
 She expressed concern that PBS would now be able to show seasonal ads for toys or PG-13 movies on the children's shows and drew parallels to commercial channels like Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network. 
 Ms. Zellner and Mr. Russell said that PBS's strict guidelines about sponsorship messages remained in place. ''The only difference here is the amount of time that you need to be a funder for,'' Ms. Zellner said. 
 The shorter sessions will also be available for children's shows like ''Dragon Tales'' and ''Martha Speaks.'' The Sponsorship Group will offer packages of shows that can be sponsored together. 
 Ms. Zellner said she hoped the short-term sponsorships would encourage companies to make longer commitments. Already, she said, three new corporations are talking to her sales staff about full-year terms. 
 ''It gives them a chance to test it out,'' she said.

HEADLINE: BANKS TOLD THEY NEED $75 BILLION IN EXTRA CAPITAL

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After subjecting the nation's biggest banks to the most public scrutiny in decades, federal regulators ordered 10 of them on Thursday to raise a total of $75 billion in extra capital and gave the rest a clean bill of health. 
 The long-awaited results of the ''stress tests'' set off an immediate scramble by major institutions for more capital. By June 8, they must give regulators their plans for raising the money, and raise it by November. 
 The verdict was far more upbeat than many in the industry had feared when the tests were first announced in February. And the banks that came up short will have to raise much less than some analysts had expected as recently as a few days ago.
 The stress tests were aimed at estimating how much each bank would lose if the economic downturn proved even deeper than currently expected. But regulators gave the banks a break by letting them bolster their capital with unusually strong first-quarter profits and also by letting them predict modest profits even if the economy again turns sour.
 Despite an almost tangible sense of relief among the banks and investors, the report card is unlikely to silence an intense debate over whether the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve let the banks off too easily and glossed over their problems. 
 Under the worst-case assumptions -- an unemployment rate of 10.3 percent next year, an economic contraction of 3.3 percent this year and a 22 percent further decline in housing prices -- the losses by the 19 banks could total $600 billion this year and next, or 9.1 percent of the banks' total loans, regulators concluded. That rate of loss would be higher than any other since 1921.
 But while the adverse situation was supposed to be unlikely, it is not that much worse than what has happened so far. Unemployment hit 8.5 percent in April and could top 9 percent as early as Friday, when the Labor Department releases its employment report for May. 
 Bank of America was told it would have to come up with $34.9 billion. Wells Fargowill have to find $13.7 billion. And Citigroupwill have to produce another $5.5 billion, on top of the $52.5 billion that it had planned to acquire by letting the Treasury become its biggest single shareholder as part of a broader deal. 
 Industry executives reacted with jubilation, as if they had proved their critics wrong and passed the tests with flying colors.
 ''The results off the stress tests should put to rest the harmful speculation we have seen over the past few months,'' declared Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, hours before the results were even made public.
 Investors had already bid up share prices of the big banks in reaction to leaks about the results earlier this week.
 Regulators and bank executives alike predicted that most of the institutions would be able to build up the necessary capital from private sources -- either by selling off assets or by converting shares of preferred stock into ordinary stock. 
 ''With the clarity that today's announcement will bring, we hope banks are going to get back to the business of banking,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday. 
 Wells Fargo immediately announced that it would raise $6 billion through a new stock offering. Morgan Stanley, which was told to raise $1.8 billion, announced plans for a $2 billion stock offering.
 GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors, will need to find $11.5 billion in capital. Last week the government gave GMAC more federal funds after it agreed to be the lender for purchasers of Chrysler vehicles while Chrysler is under bankruptcy protection. Earlier this year, the Treasury Department supplied the company with $5 billion through its Troubled Asset Relief Program.
 Regulators did not push for the ouster of any chief executives, or demand any specific board shake-ups. They also said they would not subject the rest of the nation's banks to similar stress tests or require them to have additional capital buffers. 
 But Treasury and Fed officials said they would press banks to improve their governance and would reserve the right to demand changes in management.
 Indeed, Bank of America is expected to announce that it will start recruiting fresh board members in a bid to strengthen oversight.
 Despite the reassuring picture outlined by Mr. Geithner and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, the stress test results hardly silenced critics.
 ''It's window-dressing,'' said Bert Ely, a longtime bank analyst based in Alexandria, Va. Mr. Ely was particularly skeptical about letting companies bolster their balance sheets by converting preferred shares to common. 
 ''That won't add one extra dollar to a bank's capital buffer against losses,'' Mr. Ely complained. ''It's just moving capital from one place to another.''
 From the start, Treasury and Fed officials have steered between what Mr. Bernanke recently described as ''Scylla and Charybdis'' -- being perceived as too easy and too coddling of banks on the one hand, or so tough and antagonistic that investors and consumers alike become even more anxious.
 But the big question, which remains unanswered, is whether Mr. Geithner and Mr. Bernanke will in fact confront banks over their risk management practices in a way that regulators have been afraid to do for years.
 Officials also disclosed detailed estimates of potential losses at individual banks, concluding that losses could skyrocket at institutions with particularly risky loan portfolios. At Wells Fargo, which was a major subprime mortgage lender during the housing boom, regulators estimated that losses on first mortgages would hit almost 12 percent of its loan portfolio if the adverse situation proved correct. At Morgan Stanley, regulators estimated, loss rates from commercial real estate loans could potentially exceed 40 percent.
 But analysts increasingly agree that the economic outlook has brightened considerably in the last month or so.
 Mr. Geithner and top White House officials worked carefully to manage public expectations and avoid the kind of scathing reaction that greeted the Treasury's first big announcement in February of plans to rescue the banking system.
 Unlike in February, when both Mr. Geithner and President Obama raised expectations in advance, then unveiled only vague concepts, Mr. Geithner took much of the surprise out of the results by emphasizing early on that all the big banks were solvent. The only question, he said over and over, was whether they had enough capital to withstand a downturn that was even worse than the one already under way.
 In addition, Treasury and Fed officials remained tranquil as most of the results dribbled out through leaks. As a result, the results seemed almost anticlimactic when they finally became public.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about results of the stress tests by federal regulators on 19 large banks misstated the amount of capital the regulators said Bank of America must raise. It is $33.9 billion, not $34.9 billion. The error was repeated in a picture caption with the continuation of the article.

HEADLINE: The Harlem Miracle

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The fight against poverty produces great programs but disappointing results. You go visit an inner-city school, job-training program or community youth center and you meet incredible people doing wonderful things. Then you look at the results from the serious evaluations and you find that these inspiring places are only producing incremental gains.
 That's why I was startled when I received an e-mail message from Roland Fryer, a meticulous Harvard economist. It included this sentence: ''The attached study has changed my life as a scientist.'' 
 Fryer and his colleague Will Dobbie have just finished a rigorous assessment of the charter schools operated by the Harlem Children's Zone. They compared students in these schools to students in New York City as a whole and to comparable students who entered the lottery to get into the Harlem Children's Zone schools, but weren't selected.
 They found that the Harlem Children's Zone schools produced ''enormous'' gains. The typical student entered the charter middle school, Promise Academy, in sixth grade and scored in the 39th percentile among New York City students in math. By the eighth grade, the typical student in the school was in the 74th percentile. The typical student entered the school scoring in the 39th percentile in English Language Arts (verbal ability). By eighth grade, the typical student was in the 53rd percentile.
 Forgive some academic jargon, but the most common education reform ideas -- reducing class size, raising teacher pay, enrolling kids in Head Start -- produce gains of about 0.1 or 0.2 or 0.3 standard deviations. If you study policy, those are the sorts of improvements you live with every day. Promise Academy produced gains of 1.3 and 1.4 standard deviations. That's off the charts. In math, Promise Academy eliminated the achievement gap between its black students and the city average for white students.
 Let me repeat that. It eliminated the black-white achievement gap. ''The results changed my life as a researcher because I am no longer interested in marginal changes,'' Fryer wrote in a subsequent e-mail. What Geoffrey Canada, Harlem Children's Zone's founder and president, has done is ''the equivalent of curing cancer for these kids. It's amazing. It should be celebrated. But it almost doesn't matter if we stop there. We don't have a way to replicate his cure, and we need one since so many of our kids are dying -- literally and figuratively.''
 These results are powerful evidence in a long-running debate. Some experts, mostly surrounding the education establishment, argue that schools alone can't produce big changes. The problems are in society, and you have to work on broader issues like economic inequality. Reformers, on the other hand, have argued that school-based approaches can produce big results. The Harlem Children's Zone results suggest the reformers are right. The Promise Academy does provide health and psychological services, but it helps kids who aren't even involved in the other programs the organization offers.
 To my mind, the results also vindicate an emerging model for low-income students. Over the past decade, dozens of charter and independent schools, like Promise Academy, have become no excuses schools. The basic theory is that middle-class kids enter adolescence with certain working models in their heads: what I can achieve; how to control impulses; how to work hard. Many kids from poorer, disorganized homes don't have these internalized models. The schools create a disciplined, orderly and demanding counterculture to inculcate middle-class values.
 To understand the culture in these schools, I'd recommend ''Whatever It Takes,'' a gripping account of Harlem Children's Zone by my Times colleague Paul Tough, and ''Sweating the Small Stuff,'' a superb survey of these sorts of schools by David Whitman.
 Basically, the no excuses schools pay meticulous attention to behavior and attitudes. They teach students how to look at the person who is talking, how to shake hands. These schools are academically rigorous and college-focused. Promise Academy students who are performing below grade level spent twice as much time in school as other students in New York City. Students who are performing at grade level spend 50 percent more time in school.
 They also smash the normal bureaucratic strictures that bind leaders in regular schools. Promise Academy went through a tumultuous period as Canada searched for the right teachers. Nearly half of the teachers did not return for the 2005-2006 school year. A third didn't return for the 2006-2007 year. Assessments are rigorous. Standardized tests are woven into the fabric of school life.
 The approach works. Ever since welfare reform, we have had success with intrusive government programs that combine paternalistic leadership, sufficient funding and a ferocious commitment to traditional, middle-class values. We may have found a remedy for the achievement gap. Which city is going to take up the challenge? Omaha? Chicago? Yours?

HEADLINE: Bids to Push States' Rights Falter in Face Of Stimulus

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho 

 BODY:
Standing up for states' rights has not been easy this spring, even as many state lawmakers wince at the extended reach of the federal government. With the recession sparing few corners of the country, the $787 billion federal stimulus package has weakened the resolve of states' rights activists in legislatures across the country.
 ''They lay the bait out, and we come take it,'' said Monty Pearce, a Republican state senator who sponsored a sovereignty resolution that passed the Idaho Legislature. ''Then we whine that we've taken it.''
 Sure enough. When legislatures convened this year, lawmakers in more than 30 states set out to send Washington a blunt message: back off. Frustrated by federal policies like the bank bailout and rules allowing wolves to prowl the West, they drafted so-called sovereignty resolutions, aggressive interpretations of states' rights outlined in the Tenth Amendment. 
 Acting independently (though sometimes cribbing a whereas or two from the Web), the lawmakers shared the same broad goal: to symbolically push back against Congress and the White House in a power struggle as old as the Republic. 
 ''Cease and desist, effective immediately, mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers,'' reads the resolution passed here in Idaho, referring to powers described in the Tenth Amendment.
 Now, despite a few loud exceptions, including the recent protests of Gov. Rick Perry, Republican of Texas, and the Florida Legislature's rejection of $444 million in stimulus money that would have required changing state rules for unemployment aid, the objections have proved muted as financially struggling states embrace federal help. 
 As many legislatures come to the end of their annual sessions, only four states have passed sovereignty measures through their full legislatures. The states that have -- Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota and South Dakota -- were successful in large part because of the strength of determined conservatives, who have long railed against an activist federal government. 
 ''The stimulus money created a problem for us with the sovereignty thing,'' said JoAn Wood, a Republican who is chairwoman of the House Transportation and Defense Committee in Idaho, which has overseen some legislative action on the stimulus money. ''We'd like to stand on principle.'' 
 Oklahoma had passed a sovereignty resolution that was later vetoed by Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat. Mr. Henry said in a written statement that he had objected to the resolution's suggestion that Oklahoma should return federal tax dollars and ''that past and present U.S. leaders had violated the U.S. Constitution and committed crimes against the states.'' The Legislature is expected to pass a new, less-strident measure that would not require the governor's signature.
 Despite the poor results, supporters insist that the paper protests signal that a movement is under way.
 ''Even though the bill didn't pass, the message got out there,'' said Matt Shea, a first-term Republican state representative from outside Spokane, Wash., who drafted a sovereignty resolution that never got a hearing in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
 Mr. Shea's resolution was among the first filed in any state this year. After the measure was promoted on conservative Web sites, he said, ''several hundred people,'' including some from outside the state, contacted lawmakers to urge its passage. Parts of his resolution, cut and pasted, provided the framework for one that passed in Idaho, lawmakers here said. 
 Mr. Shea said legislative leaders in his state had rejected the resolution in part because ''they did need the stimulus money'' and approving the measure could have appeared contradictory. 
 ''It doesn't mean that the people aren't behind it,'' he added.
 The sovereignty push has been fueled by Republican lawmakers and governors who say the Democratically controlled Congress and President Obama have attached too many strings to the stimulus package. Yet many supporters of sovereignty measures insist that party politics and the current economic climate are irrelevant. Some cite the No Child Left Behind education policy and the U.S.A. Patriot Act under President George W. Bush as flagrant acts of federal overreaching.
 ''This is about Washington, D.C., politicians in general,'' said Randy Brogdon, a Republican state senator from outside Tulsa, Okla., who sponsored a sovereignty resolution this spring and is running for governor in 2010. Mr. Brogdon said he was motivated by longstanding issues like income tax rates and federal plans to require new restrictions on state driver's licenses, though he said he was particularly vexed by the ''feeding frenzy'' he said the stimulus had created. 
 Michael Boldin, who runs a Web site called the Tenth Amendment Center, which tracks the resolutions, said the idea of state sovereignty, in its purist form, transcends partisanship. To some, he said, California's aggressive environmental policies or its laws allowing medical marijuana might make it seem ''the original sovereignty state.''
 No sovereignty resolution has been proposed this year in California, and none has passed in any state dominated by Democrats. In some conservative states where the resolutions have had more support, some Republicans have been accused of exploiting the sovereignty issue to position themselves against moderates in the party.
 In Texas, Mr. Perry, speaking at an anti-tax rally, seemed to endorse seceding from the union, though he later clarified that he had no such interest. Mr. Perry, who faces a re-election challenge from Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a more moderate Republican, has expressed support for a sovereignty resolution in Texas.
 Here in Idaho, State Senator Elliot Werk, the assistant minority leader, said Republicans control the Legislature so overwhelmingly that their biggest political concern is primary challengers, not Democrats. Mr. Werk noted gun-rights bills that had passed, and a resolution that took a conservative stance on immigration. The stimulus package, he said, is another opportunity to express frustration, even as plenty of Republicans have voted to take the money. 
 Contradictions have been common here of late. Even Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican known for vocal opposition to government expansion and strong support for states' rights, has agreed to accept the stimulus money. (Mr. Otter has also angered many conservative Republicans by pressing to raise the gas tax.) 
 Aides to the governor say he believed he had no choice but to take the money, because money marked for Idaho would simply be steered toward other states.
 Jon Hanian, a spokesman for the governor, said the concern was made vivid to Mr. Otter at a governors' meeting in Washington this year. ''Schwarzenegger told him, 'Any money you don't want, California will take,' '' Mr. Hanian said, referring to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a California Republican.
 Regardless of the complications of the moment, the sovereignty movement will continue, said Dick Harwood, an Idaho Republican who sponsored the resolution in the House.
 ''We're going to have to come back next year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One of Baseball's Biggest Stars Is Now Its Latest Drug Culprit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
When Major League Baseball officials examined the results of urine tests from the slugger Manny Ramirez earlier this season, they became suspicious. Although the tests did not show clear evidence of a performance-enhancing drug, there were traces of banned substances, enough to initiate an investigation that has left one of baseball's greatest hitters with a 50-game suspension. 
 Nearly 30 major leaguers have been suspended for using performance-enhancers since players began penalty testing in 2004, and Ramirez is now the biggest of those names. And unlike many or all of the others who were suspended, Ramirez was ultimately tripped up by medical files that were handed over to baseball officials as the case proceeded. 
 It was in those files, said people in baseball with knowledge of them, that the officials discovered that Ramirez had been prescribed human chorionic gonadotropin, or H.C.G., a fertility drug for women that men can use to generate production of testosterone after they have stopped using steroids.
 Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Ramirez on Thursday for the documentary evidence tying him to H.C.G. rather than for a positive drug test. But the impact is the same. A player seemingly bound for the Hall of Fame now finds himself tarnished, and baseball is left to cope with another damaging drug revelation.
 Ramirez, known for his dreadlocks, baggy pants and often oblivious demeanor, had signed a two-year $45 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in March and will lose about a third of his salary this season. And the Dodgers, who had put together the best record in baseball this season (21-8 entering Thursday), will be without their best hitter until early July.
 The suspension is also a significant setback for the Dodgers' efforts to increase their Hispanic fan support by marketing Ramirez. After he was traded to Los Angeles from the Boston Red Sox last July, Ramirez became the hottest hitter in baseball and carried the Dodgers to the postseason. The team's attendance and television ratings rose significantly.
 This season, the Dodgers designated a section of seats in left field as Mannywood. In those seats, fans could hope to catch one of Ramirez's home runs or yell out to him as he patrolled left field.
 All that has been put aside for now. Instead, Ramirez becomes part of an ever-growing group of elite players from the past decade -- including Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Roger Clemens, Rafael Palmeiro and Jason Giambi -- who have been linked in one way or another to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Of those players, only Palmeiro was actually suspended for a positive test. His suspension came in 2005, only months after he adamantly denied using drugs in a nationally televised Congressional hearing. 
 In a statement on Thursday, Ramirez, 36, stated that a doctor gave him a medication that was not a steroid for a personal health issue and that he believed he could use it without violating the drug-testing program.
 ''Unfortunately, the medication was banned under our drug policy,'' Ramirez said in the statement, which was released by the players union. ''Under the policy that mistake is now my responsibility. I have been advised not to say anything more for now. I do want to say one other thing: I've taken and passed about 15 drug tests over the past 5 seasons.''
 H.C.G., which has been banned since 2008, is similar to the drug Clomid, which has a history of being used in conjunction with steroids. According to medical experts, doctors prescribe H.C.G. to men who are having fertility problems or who have low levels of testosterone, both of which can be side effects of steroid use.
 The Dominican-born Ramirez went to high school in upper Manhattan and was a first-round draft pick of the Cleveland Indians in 1991. With first the Indians, and then the Red Sox and the Dodgers, the right-handed Ramirez dominated as one of baseball's most ferocious hitters, hitting 533 home runs over parts of 17 seasons, compiling a career batting average of .315 and helping Boston win two World Series.
 But on the basepaths and in the field, and even in between innings, he came to be seen as a player who sometimes seemed to be in his own world, leading to the ''Manny being Manny'' phrase that came to be attached, more or less affectionately, to some of his actions. 
 In one memorable moment, in 2005, he took a bathroom break at Fenway Park while teammates were conferring on the mound and almost did not get back to left field in time for the next pitch.
 But last summer, the charm wore off as the perception grew that Ramirez was deliberately not playing hard to force the Red Sox to trade him and thus allow him to become a free agent at the end of the 2008 season.
 Exasperated by his behavior, and convinced that Ramirez was trying to force their hand so he could cash in and make more money, the Red Sox bade him goodbye.
 After the 2008 postseason, Ramirez did enter the free-agent market, with his agent, Scott Boras, letting it be known that Ramirez was looking for a new deal worth perhaps $100 million over four years.
 But because of Ramirez's age, the economic downtown and the concern that Ramirez might act up again if not happy, Boras did not find the offers he was seeking. In the end, two weeks into spring training, Ramirez re-signed with the Dodgers for less than half of what Boras had envisioned.
 Initially, representatives for Ramirez had told baseball officials that they would fight any suspension. On Wednesday, Rob Manfred, baseball's top drug-testing official, traveled to Los Angeles to prepare for an appeal hearing. But Ramirez relented Wednesday, and it was announced Thursday afternoon that he had been suspended.
 As damaging to baseball as the Ramirez suspension may be, it can be seen as evidence that the drug-testing program is working and that Selig is not afraid to go after the game's top players.
 For the moment, Ramirez's suspension may also take away some of the focus on Rodriguez, who has admitted using a performance-enhancing substance from 2001 to 2003 and who is returning to action with the Yankees on Friday after recovering from hip surgery.
 But the issue of Rodriguez's drug use may not go away. Selig has directed baseball's full-time investigators to determine whether Rodriguez lied to baseball officials in March when he denied using drugs after 2003.

HEADLINE: A Low-Cost Show Reinflates a Big Bag

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
The Whitney, like many of us in the current economy, is finding new ways to use the things it already owns. It's recycling parts of previous exhibitions, but it's also sprucing up works that haven't been seen in decades with a good cleaning and the necessary repairs.
 The strategy works well enough in a pair of shows devoted to Claes Oldenburg and his wife and collaborator, Coosje Van Bruggen, who died in January. The exhibitions lean heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/Van Bruggen drawings, smaller sculptures and ephemera, many of which were given to the museum in 2002 by its chairman at the time, Leonard Lauder (and exhibited that year). But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators.
 Some lowered expectations are in order. The presentation doesn't have the arc of a fully formed retrospective. But with a bit of creative staging by the curators -- Carter Foster, Chrissie Iles and Dana Miller -- a potpourri of a survey is made to reflect Mr. Oldenburg's multifaceted career. 
 The Happenings films get their own gallery, as do the ''Ice Bag'' and the legendary event-installation ''The Store.'' Then there's the show within a show ''The Music Room,'' a group of sculptures of musical instruments made by Mr. Oldenburg with Ms. Van Bruggen.
 The scattershot format isn't much of a problem for Mr. Oldenburg, who wears several hats. Born in Sweden in 1929, he is known as one of the great American Pop artists, a creator of wickedly visionary public sculptures and monuments and a pioneer of the enduring, complicated category of the Happening.
 A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop. Works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), made of stuffed vinyl and served up on low, platterlike pedestals, look good enough to eat.
 Other sculptures, like ''Soft Toilet'' (1966) and the oversized ashtray ''Giant Fagends'' (1967), remind you that Mr. Oldenburg's fascination with food was part of a larger curiosity about the way that substances are processed in the body and in art.
 Unlike Warhol and other Pop artists, the Oldenburg of the early 1960s liked to serve his art raw. He was attracted to messy piles of diner food rather than soup cans, the handmade rather than the mass-produced and the generic rather than the branded. His sense of humor was different too; you can see it in the many post-Freudian phallic symbols -- lipsticks, cigarette butts, fireplugs -- that stand in aggressively heterosexual contrast to Warholian camp.
 A selection of drawings, nearly all from the Lauder gift, include Mr. Oldenburg's fanciful yet pointed proposals for civic monuments. Many, like ''Proposal for a Skyscraper in the Form of a Chicago Fireplug,'' date from 1968 and are keyed to the social and political tumult of that year. Others are timelessly provocative; the stacked tubes of ''Museum Design Based on a Cigarette Package'' might have been dreamed up by a starchitect. 
 The radicalism of Mr. Oldenburg's sculpture, real and imagined, has a lot to do with context and scale. Both of these factors are lost at the Whitney, with one exception: the massive ''Ice Bag -- Scale C,'' measuring 12 feet in diameter.
 The Ice Bag, a parachutelike swell of nylon cloth capped by polyester resin, is an oversized, mechanized version of the classic headache remedy. Powered by an internal system of motorized fans, it was conceived as part of the Art and Technology program for the United States Pavilion at the 1970 World's Fair, but hasn't been shown in some time.
 Fortuitously, this show occasioned an update of the bag's antiquated technology. At the Whitney it inflates and deflates with a hypnotic twisting motion and a mechanical sigh, soothing the art world's collective hangover.
 Past the ''Ice Bag'' is a small room devoted to art and ephemera from ''The Store,'' Mr. Oldenburg's best-known project. Opened in 1961, the combination studio, marketplace and performance space collapsed artistic production and consumption onto a single Lower East Side site. 
 The Whitney's display looks sparse and sanitized -- more boutique than bodega -- but it does include rarely seen objects from Mr. Oldenburg's own collection. There are plaster-and-chicken-wire versions of clothing and food items, along with drawings, posters, business cards and slapdash inventory lists. One reads ''eggs/shoe shine box/(table)/meat-chicken/fruitboxes.''
 A better idea of the kinds of activities that went on at ''The Store'' can be gleaned from the newly restored films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings -- 17 in all, efficiently installed on seven screens by Ms. Iles. The films don't quite mitigate the had-to-be-there mystique of the Happenings, but they're a window onto a more relaxed, chaotic art world.
 Mr. Oldenburg appears in most of the films, which were shot by Stan VanDerBeek, Al Kouzel and other artists. In ''Fotodeath'' he is a Buster Keaton-like figure in a porkpie hat; in ''Injun'' he stumbles around in a cape covered with sawdust. The supporting characters are just as interesting: Henry Geldzahler, Lucas Samaras and Carolee Schneemann, among others. The action can be hard to see and even harder to make sense of; everyone grapples with one another and with inanimate objects and generally makes a big mess.
 Sculptures made by Mr. Oldenburg in collaboration with Ms. van Bruggen, some four decades later, are on view in the adjacent exhibition ''The Music Room.'' (The Whitney took a similar approach in 2002, when it held simultaneous shows of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/van Bruggen drawings.)
 Ms. van Bruggen, an art historian and writer born in the Netherlands, seems to have been a classicizing influence. In the early 1990s the couple purchased a house in France; inspired by musicians on Paris subways and the private salons of homes in the Loire Valley, they made a series of sculptures of musical instruments.
 ''Soft Viola,'' in latex-coated canvas, exhibits a wonderfully slouchy sensuality. Other instruments -- an unwound French horn, a sliced Stradivarius -- look more sinister, as if they had been plucked from paintings by Hieronymus Bosch.
 The connection between music, love and morality becomes more explicit in the couple's peepbox installation ''Resonance, After J. V.'' (2000). Commissioned by the National Gallery in London, it reinterprets Vermeer's paintings of young women playing the virginal (an early harpsichord). In the Oldenburg/van Bruggen version, the rigid lines and exacting perspective of the Vermeers are slackened and skewed. Yet the jewel-box quality of the paintings, not to mention the diminutive scale, is preserved. 
 It's hard to square the conservative sculptors of ''The Music Room'' with the Pop provocateur of giant ashtrays and ice bags, or the free-spirited impresario of the Happenings. But Mr. Oldenburg wasn't really a one-size-fits-all artist, and this thrifty survey suits him well.
 ''Claes Oldenburg: Early Sculpture, Drawings, and Happenings Films'' and ''Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen: The Music Room'' continue through Sept. 6 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street; (212) 570-3600, whitney.org.

HEADLINE: Lehman Unit Helps Lift Barclays' Profit

BYLINE: By CYRUS SANATI

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers may have rattled the global economy after its collapse last fall, but it was a major source of profit at the British bank Barclays in its first quarter. 
 The acquisition of Lehman resulted in a ''transformational change'' in Barclays Capital, its investment banking unit, Barclays said in a statement Thursday announcing the first-quarter results. The unit's profit before taxes and write-downs more than quadrupled to 907 million pounds, or $1.36 billion.
 That is roughly two-thirds of the entire company's total pretax profit of 1.37 billion pounds ($2 billion). 
 It is hard to break out how much of that profit came directly from Lehman, but the American unit seemed to have generated a large portion of cash. The part of the Barclays' investment bank that predated Lehman had to contend with billions of dollars in write-downs on the troubled assets it had acquired during boom years.
 Barclays had first walked away from talks to acquire Lehman in September, after the United States government declined to save it. That set the stage for Lehman's enormous bankruptcy filing, which exacerbated the credit crisis.
 After Lehman failed, Barclays acquired Lehman's North American investment banking unit for a pittance and without all the risky baggage.
 For the company as a whole, first-quarter net profit was 826 million pounds ($1.24 billion) , up from 736 million pounds ($1.1 billion) a year earlier. The company's revenue net of insurance claims rose 42 percent to 8.15 billion pounds ($12.2 billion), from 5.72 billion pounds ($8.6 billion).
 Barclays told investors Thursday to expect further losses and write-downs because of the sour economy and previous investment decisions that turned bad.
 One area that might cause the bank some trouble is its large exposure to the commercial real estate market. It has roughly 11 billion pounds ($16.6 billion) in commercial real estate loans and 734 million pounds ($1.1 billion) in commercial mortgage-backed securities. 
 The company said that 57 percent of its commercial exposure was in the United States, with two large transactions making up 44 percent of the portfolio.

CALF FINDS GRASS 
 Greener on Farm
 Molly the calf seems to have escaped the slaughterhouse permanently.
 On Thursday, the heifer -- who evidently escaped from a Queens slaughterhouse on Wednesday before being corralled by police officers -- was loaded on a trailer at a Brooklyn animal shelter and taken to her new home: a 60-acre organic farm -- called the Farrm -- in Calverton, in Suffolk County, about 15 miles west of the Hamptons. There, she can munch on organic hay with a steer named Wexler. 
 Rex Farr, who owns the Farrm with his wife, Connie, said that Molly was fed and watered when she arrived on Thursday afternoon. He added that he planned to leave her and Wexler alone to get acquainted in their pasture. 
 ''She can eat and sleep for the rest of her life,'' Mr. Farr said. ''The bottom line is she will have a very good home.''
 In addition to organic vegetable farming, the Farrm takes in rescued animals, like six crates of young chickens that fell from a truck on the Tappan Zee Bridge last year; a pony from a 4-H club that lost financing; and Wexler, who is about 5 years old, has no horns and was given to the farm after a private school closed its animal education program. There are goats, burros and other animals.
 Molly escaped on Wednesday afternoon when she was being unloaded at the Musa Halal slaughterhouse on Beaver Road in Jamaica, Queens. She broke through a fence that formed a passage between the truck and the cow pens.
 Richard P. Gentles, a spokesman for the city's Animal Care and Control agency, which cared for Molly on Wednesday night, said she had been seen by a veterinarian who estimated her to be less than a year old and 300 to 400 pounds. 
 She was signed over to the agency by the owner, he said. ''Maybe he is being altruistic,'' Mr. Gentles said.

 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week, Nancy E. Dunphy, the deputy commissioner for employment security at the state's Department of Labor, is answering questions about unemployment insurance benefits in New York City. Here's an excerpt:
 Q. Can you still collect benefits if unemployed and considering going back to school for a new degree (related to current profession and a two-year program)? If so, would this be eligible for 26 weeks or an extended period?RD
 A. There is a provision in the Unemployment Insurance Law that makes it possible for unemployment recipients to receive benefits while attending a training course/program. 
 Recipients are then excused from the requirement to look for work, and may be eligible for additional weeks of benefits when funding is available. 
 The training, however, must be approved by the Department of Labor. 
 Some of the requirements are that the training must consist of a minimum of 12 hours per week; be completed within 24 months; and enhance one's ability to obtain more long-term employment in the state or local labor market.
 There are other determining factors. Seek guidance at your nearest One-Stop Center and ask about the 599 Training Program.

HEADLINE: Tests May Spur Bank Mergers

 BODY:
For America's regional banks, it's merger time. With the results of the stress tests now public, it's clear that none of the country's largest financial institutions will fail. Those that need capital will find it, even if it takes de facto nationalization. But that doesn't mean the banking system is robust. 
 A handful of regional institutions received the equivalent of barely passing grades -- including SunTrust, Regions Financial, KeyCorp and Fifth Third. These banks have more than $500 billion of assets among them. Even if they can raise the extra capital that regulators say they need, they may not be in a position to act as engines of credit creation -- a requirement for their local economies to pull out of the recession. 
 Moreover, if they can't raise private money over the next six months, they may need to have the government take significant, or even majority, stakes in them.
 One risk is that they will stagger along, zombielike, for years. There's an alternative: Let the strong eat the weak. 
 A core group of relatively robust regional banks has also emerged from the Treasury's examinations, including U.S. Bancorp and BB&T, as well as PNC Financial, which has to raise a relatively modest $600 million.
 An alternative to propping up troubled banks with new capital is to actively encourage a wave of consolidation. 
 This approach would make life simpler for the government should the banks fail to raise private capital. Rather than taking controlling positions in many midsize banks, the government could take smaller stakes (or none at all) in fewer, larger banks that in turn use the capital to buy troubled rivals. 
 By encouraging, for instance, the acquisition of SunTrust by BB&T, the takeover of KeyCorp by U.S. Bancorp and the purchase of Regions by PNC, the government would foster the creation of three new heavyweights better equipped to compete with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. These three went from big to megabanks by acquiring troubled rivals like Washington Mutual, Wachovia and Countrywide early in the banking crisis, in deals blessed by regulators. 
 In theory, this approach would also streamline and improve regulation. Instead of scattering oversight among six institutions, the government could focus on three. 
 By favoring more of the banks that fared best in the crisis and not just the very biggest, it rewards those executives whose teams proved better at risk management, like Richard Davis, chief of U.S. Bancorp. 
 Finally, the enormous savings that would come from cutting overlapping operations, extra branches and redundant workers would accrue to shareholders and add to the capital cushions. Last year Fifth Third, SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions had combined noninterest expenses of $18.5 billion. As a general rule of thumb, knowledgeable bank acquirers aim to save about one-third of these costs. Gentlemen, start your M.& A. spreadsheets.
 Boon for Underwriters
 Banks must raise $75 billion of equity over the next six months. That sounds bad, but on Wall Street it may be cause for some celebration. That's because the underwriters who sell all of that stock can charge fees of as much as $3 billion for doing so. 
 In the grand scheme of a $75 billion capital shortfall, it's a pittance. But on the equity capital markets desks of the big investment banks, it would be a bonanza. Dealogic estimates it could add up to 12 times the amount they've earned so far this year.
 Underemployed bankers at Merrill Lynch may finally have a reason to applaud their new bosses' missteps. Merrill's new owner, Bank of America, needs the biggest capital infusion of all -- $34 billion. 
 Of course, the lead manager on a bank's stock offering is often the bank itself, which is motivated not to ratchet up fees. And many of the banks that the government has ordered to raise more capital may do so by swapping existing preferred shares for common stock. But with most bank stocks trading at decent premiums to the prices at which they would have to convert the government's preferred stock, it's a fair bet the next six months will be happier for the underwriters of Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Art in Review

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
WILLIAM POWHIDA
 'The Writing Is on the Wall'
 Schroeder-Romero 
 637 West 27th Street 
 Through May 16 
 William Powhida, art world vigilante, virtuoso draftsman, compulsive calligrapher, fantasist autobiographer and recently self-announced gallery owner and art dealer, has a semi-solo show at Schroeder-Romero well worth catching. 
 As in the past, Mr. Powhida, who lives and works in Brooklyn, provides an updated rogues' gallery of New York art world celebrities in a salon-style display of dozens of deft graphite portraits based on Internet photos of openings, parties, galas, etc. Wall of fame? Wall of shame? He refrains from comment. But art speaks for itself, or so we've been told, and you can make of these tawdry-looking types what you will.
 The rest of the main gallery is given over to a first-person, handwritten account by a William Powhida who may or may not be the artist (the gallery's news release addresses the confusion), about a stint in a Thai jail where the writer undergoes chemical detoxification, among other indignities. The report makes for sorry reading, though the technical skill and stamina that must have gone into producing it are awesome. 
 This leaves the artist's role as co-director of a start-up gallery to reckon with. (His partner in the enterprise is Jennifer Dalton, an artist who has an excellent solo show next door at Winkleman Gallery, through Saturday.) The new space, currently housed at Schroeder-Romero, is called SchroRoWinkleFeuerBooneWildenRosenGosian Gallery, and exists a few years in the future, after the Chelsea art world as we know it has been wiped from the planet by bad economics, low morale, shifts in fashion and public indifference to the latest tweak of a tweak called ''new work.'' 
 Looking exceedingly D.I.Y., the gallery insists that it will have its debut with a group show called ''Art-Pocalypto 2012'' featuring only crummy digital prints of ''real art'' in unlimited editions, available for preposterous prices. 
 Ambitiously, Mr. Powhida and Ms. Dalton will also be exhibiting their stable of artists -- basically anyone who walks in the door -- at ArtBaselMiamiDocumentaSiteSantaFeWhitneyBiennialeVeneziaNadaPulseScope the same year. It all sounds a bit iffy, I know, but it's a plan. So if you're still hanging tight with art three years hence, be there. HOLLAND COTTER

HEADLINE: Technology Shares Pull Down Market, and a Treasury Auction Disappoints

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
While waiting for the government to announce the results of its stress tests of major banks, Wall Street already seemed to be looking ahead to another potential source of market turmoil: technology stocks. 
 Declines in technology companies helped drag the broader stock market down on Thursday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which is up nearly 9 percent this year, posted the biggest loss of the three major stock indexes, falling 2.4 percent for the day, or 42.86 points, to 1,716.24. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 102.43 points, or 1.2 percent, to 8,409.85, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.14 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 907.39. 
 In credit markets, interest rates on government debt rose after bidders at an auction of 30-year Treasury bonds demanded higher returns on their money. Yields on the 30-year bond rose as high as 4.30 percent, their highest point since mid-November, a sign of slackening demand for government debt. ''It's a little disheartening, to say the least, to see how things played out today,'' said Chris Ahrens, head of United States rate strategy at UBS Securities. 
 The Federal Reserve, seeking to keep interest rates low, announced in March that it would buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. Interest rates on Treasury notes dropped in response to that action, but they have surged back as investors worry that the huge new supplies will drive down prices of government debt.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note followed that pattern on Thursday. The price of the note fell 1 10/32, to 98 6/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.34 percent, from 3.16 percent late Wednesday. 
 Shares of computer makers, software companies and search engines were lower. The networking giant Cisco Systems fell 3.4 percent, to $18.95, after it reported lower quarterly earnings late Wednesday and said its revenue in the next quarter could remain weak. 
 Some bank stocks came under pressure as the government prepared to announce the results of its stress tests to gauge the health of 19 major financial companies. After markets closed, the government said that 10 of those banks would need to raise additional capital totaling $75 billion. 
 Bank of America, which needs to raise $34 billion, gained 6.5 percent to close at $13.51 a share, while most other banks, whether they need more money or not, closed lower.
 Stocks surged higher on Wednesday as some results of the stress tests began to leak out, showing that even banks that might need billions of dollars of additional capital were not on the brink of insolvency. 
 Shares of retailers were mostly lower after they reported that sales rose a bit in April but still remained shaky. Excluding Wal-Mart Stores, which reported a 5 percent increase in stores open at least a year, retail sales at a host of clothing stores and department stores fell 2.7 percent in April from a year earlier.
 Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, rose 0.8 percent to $49.89.
 Still, analysts said retailers were beginning to see signs that consumer spending had stabilized and said they were no longer desperately cutting prices to move a glut of inventory.
 A weekly report on new unemployment claims also fed hopes that the government's report on Friday on unemployment would be a shade less grim than past months'. The Labor Department reported Thursday that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell 34,000 last week, to 601,000.
 Economists estimate that 600,000 jobs were lost in April, and they expect the unemployment rate to rise to 8.9 percent, from 8.5 percent.

HEADLINE: The New School's Kerrey Is to Step Down in 2011

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Bob Kerrey, whose eight years as president of the New School have been marked by rising enrollment and faculty expansion but also by criticism and recent student protests, announced on Thursday that he would step down when his contract expires on July 1, 2011. Mr. Kerrey, 65, revealed his decision Wednesday evening to the university's board of trustees at their final meeting of the academic year. The board unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming its support for Mr. Kerrey and committing itself to a smooth transition.
 Mr. Kerrey, the president of the New School since January 2001, said he had always intended to leave at the end of his second five-year contract. He said he had announced his departure to allow the university ample time to search for a new president. 
 ''Orderly transition is very important to me, and it's not easy in any organization -- for-profit and nonprofit,'' Mr. Kerrey, a former governor and senator from Nebraska, said in an interview on Thursday. ''I want to make sure my successor is at least as good as I am.''
 During Mr. Kerrey's eight years in office, the university has enlarged interdisciplinary academic offerings; doubled the size of the full-time faculty; expanded enrollment, admissions and fund-raising; and improved its Greenwich Village campus.
 But Mr. Kerrey's critics have said that he placed budgetary concerns over scholarly priorities, centralized power in his office and shut out faculty members' involvement. He has also been criticized for lacking a Ph.D.
 Mr. Kerrey has defended his tenure, saying his top struggle had been to unify a disparate set of eight schools into a cohesive university with a common identity and purpose.
 Founded in 1919, the New School developed as a haphazard patchwork. Mr. Kerrey repeatedly tried to knit its parts together into a unified institution. He faced steep resistance from full-time faculty members, who issued a vote of no-confidence in December, and from students. Student protesters held sit-ins at a university building in December and in April; the latter occupation resulted in 22 arrests when the police retook the building, at 65 Fifth Avenue.
 Mr. Kerrey has in recent months tried to repair frayed relationships, holding many meetings with faculty members, but he has continued to be criticized for a management style that some called autocratic, impulsive and even erratic. On Tuesday, the trustees and faculty members of the New School ordered an inquiry into the events surrounding the student occupation in April. Critics were angered by the president's decision to call in the police.
 Mr. Kerrey, in the interview, said the faculty members and student opposition did not play a role in his decision to step down. He said faculty autonomy had been enhanced during his tenure through a series of administrative changes, including the creation of a Faculty Senate, though that body came about largely because of frustration with Mr. Kerrey's communication style.
 Another criticism leveled at Mr. Kerrey concerned turnover. In his first seven years as president, he went through four provosts; it was the ouster of the most recent one, Joseph W. Westphal, that prompted the no-confidence vote in December. An interim provost, Tim Marshall, was appointed in March to serve through July 2010.
 ''The provost's office was quite weak when I arrived,'' Mr. Kerrey said. ''We've been strengthening it over time.''
 Mr. Kerrey is the seventh president of the New School, which has more than 6,000 undergraduate and 3,300 graduate students, and about 330 full-time and 1,700 part-time faculty members.
 David R. Howell, an economist and one of two chairmen of the Faculty Senate, said Mr. Kerrey had left a mixed record. 
 ''We recognized his efforts over the last term and a half to build a more unified university, his successes in expanding the full-time faculty, and his agreeing to establish a Faculty Senate,'' he said. ''The problems the faculty had were not with his efforts to centralize, but his failure to seek counsel and advice prior to making some major academic decisions, whether they were the hiring and firing of provosts or the centralization of fundamental services like admissions and advising.''
 He added, ''There was an unprecedented turnover of deans and provosts in the first seven years, which made it difficult for faculty and deans and other staff members to do their work. That turnover was very costly.'' 
 Mr. Kerrey, who was joined at the interview by Mr. Marshall, said the New School ''was essentially a holding company eight years ago, and it's a real university now.'' 
 ''One of the tension points,'' he added, ''is that, as you increase authority to operate like a university, you take away local control.'' 
 It is important, he said, that ''where possible, we rebalance authority, so it feels like you've got local control.''
 Mr. Kerrey sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. He received the Medal of Honor for his service as a Navy Seal during the Vietnam War; he acknowledged in 2001 that as a young lieutenant in 1969, he led a combat mission that caused the deaths of 13 to 20 unarmed civilians
 After leaving the Senate to lead the New School, he served on the 9/11 Commission and flirted with a run for mayor of New York City in 2005. In 2007, he briefly considered mounting another run for the Senate.
 A few years ago, the university went through a ''re-branding'' effort to raise the university's sense of cohesion. That effort resulted in convoluted new names for several of the component schools.
 The new names, like Parsons the New School for Design, were criticized for their awkward grammar and punctuation, and few university officials -- much less faculty members and students -- use them except in official correspondence.

HEADLINE: Premier Vows To Eliminate The Taliban In Pakistan

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani vowed Thursday to ''eliminate'' the Taliban militants who have taken over large parts of the country, publicly declaring a get-tough strategy that American officials have been urging on him since he took office last year. 
 ''To restore the honor and dignity of our homeland and to protect our people, the armed forces have been called in to eliminate the militants and terrorists,'' Mr. Gilani said in a nationally televised address. ''We will not bow before extremists and terrorists.''
 Mr. Gilani delivered the speech as Pakistani soldiers battled Islamic militants who had taken control of three districts northwest of the capital, Islamabad. In one of those areas, Swat, Mr. Gilani said, the militants had reneged on a peace deal signed in February and had no one to blame but themselves.
 ''The militants have waged war against all segments of society,'' Mr. Gilani said. ''I regret to say that our bona fide intention to prefer reconciliation with them was perceived as a weakness on our part.''
 The speech appeared to reflect a break with the Taliban, who have been supported by elements of the Pakistan military and intelligence services since the mid-1990s. That support, which has been provided covertly, has enraged a succession of American leaders, who have helped give Pakistan's military more than $1 billion a year since 2001.
 Pakistan's military has fought a desultory series of campaigns against the Taliban since 2004, and the militants have only grown stronger. It has never been clear the degree to which the failures of those military campaigns has been caused by incompetence, and how much by complicity. Pakistan's army is in many respects stronger than the civilian government, and military leaders have ruled the country more often than not since its birth in 1947.
 Mr. Gilani alluded to the growing impatience with the double game. ''Our reputation among the international community has deteriorated, and we are labeled as terrorists,'' he said.
 The timing of Mr. Gilani's address was hardly an accident. He made it a day after Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, met with President Obama in Washington. American officials have expressed alarm that the Taliban militants are threatening the integrity of the Pakistani state. Mr. Zardari has asked Mr. Obama for more military and economic aid, and Mr. Obama has indicated that he intends to oblige him.
 A collapse of the Pakistani state would be catastrophic for American and Western interests. The Taliban already use sanctuaries in Pakistan to attack American forces in Afghanistan. And there are fears that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic militants.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Director Resigns After Fare Deal to Give Governor a Free Hand

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On the same day that Gov. David A. Paterson signed a rescue bill for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, its executive director resigned on Thursday to allow the governor to take the agency in ''a different direction.''
 The departure of the chief executive, Elliot G. Sander, gives Mr. Paterson the chance to get a fresh start at the transportation authority. Its critics in Albany sought to cast it as plagued by mismanagement and waste during the rancorous political debate over its rescue. 
 ''He indicated he wants to go in a different direction, and he accepted my resignation,'' Mr. Sander said of the governor in a conference room at the authority's Midtown offices.
 Mr. Sander said he would stay on the job for two more weeks. 
 Speaking before Mr. Sander announced his resignation, Mr. Paterson said, ''We're going to have a widespread cleanup and cleanout of the M.T.A. and start getting this place working in an effective way.''
 Mr. Paterson spoke Thursday morning at the subway station at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas. He later issued a statement praising Mr. Sander.
 The rescue package includes a series of reforms meant to make the authority more accountable, among them a change that combines the positions of chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Sander and the chairman, H. Dale Hemmerdinger, were appointed by Mr. Paterson's predecessor, Eliot Spitzer.
 Mr. Sander and Mr. Paterson have never appeared to have a close relationship. While Mr. Sander spoke directly with Mr. Spitzer, he generally dealt with Mr. Paterson's staff.
 Mr. Paterson has spoken enthusiastically about Mr. Hemmerdinger, a real estate developer with no background in transportation. 
 The new law states that Mr. Hemmerdinger's term, which, according to the authority's Web site, would have lasted until 2011, expires in 30 days. 
 The governor may then appoint a new chairman -- or reappoint Mr. Hemmerdinger. The new chairman will also be chief executive, with responsibility for day-to-day operations. 
 Mr. Sander said that he told the governor's aides several weeks ago that he would offer to resign if the new law passed.. Mr. Sander appeared subdued as he talked about his accomplishments in the job he has held since January 2007. He cited improvements in relations with the authority's unions and its customers. 
 The authority moves 8.5 million people a day on buses, subways and commuter trains.
 Mr. Sander had worked as a bus manager at the authority in the 1980s and was the city transportation commissioner from 1994 to 1996. 
 When he was asked by a reporter if running the authority was, ''in a lot of ways your dream job,'' Mr. Sander quickly replied: ''Not in a lot of ways. It was my dream job.''
 He said he respected the governor's decision but added, ''There is a feeling of disappointment.'' 
 Mr. Sander's employment agreement calls for him to receive a year's pay after his resignation takes effect, he said. Mr. Sander's compensation package is worth about $350,000 a year.
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Hemmerdinger, who is not paid, said that he did not plan to resign, since the new law ends his term in 30 days. 
 He said he had not discussed his future with the governor. 
 ''He really has to decide what he wants to do and how he wants to play it,'' Mr. Hemmerdinger said. 
 The jobs of chairman and chief executive were separated in a reform push by the Legislature in 2006. But critics felt the move weakened the authority's leadership and made it more vulnerable to influence from the governor's office. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, who has led reform efforts, said the latest changes, including a mention of the fiduciary duty of board members, were meant to emphasize the independence of authority board members from those who appoint them.
 Mr. Brodsky said that Mr. Paterson should take his time in choosing new leadership for the authority. 
 ''I think there are people in the governor's office who want David to appoint someone they can control,'' he said. ''I think that would be a terrible mistake.'' 
 The authority has been grappling with yawning deficits caused by a heavy debt load and the slumping economy, which has choked off tax revenue that finances the transit system. 
 The rescue plan establishes or increases taxes and fees, steps meant to bring the authority about $1.8 billion a year. It will prevent deep service cuts and fare and toll increases of 20 to 30 percent. Instead, fares will go up about 10 percent, with the base subway fare rising to $2.25, from $2.
 Mr. Sander was praised on Thursday by Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which has often had a hostile relationship with the authority. 
 ''He took the first real major steps to turn the agency around, to restore the customer-service orientation there, to restore employee confidence and to make the agency more transparent and accountable,'' Mr. Toussaint said.
 ''My greatest concern here is that the progress made could be lost if the governor makes a wrong choice.''

HEADLINE: The Climate Debate Heats Up

 BODY:
Earlier this week, and not a moment too soon, President Obama put the weight of his office behind a bill that aims to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, tackle the rise in greenhouse gases and create millions of clean-energy jobs. 
 The bill has been stuck in a House committee: uniformly opposed by Republicans; feared by rust-belt Democrats who think it will hurt manufacturers; regarded with suspicion by some environmentalists who think it offers too many escape hatches.
 Mr. Obama told Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to work out a consensus, which they must do. Though flawed, the bill is an honorable start on a problem too long neglected. Fix it, but get on with it, in the certain knowledge that failure to act would almost certainly doom comprehensive climate change legislation for this year and, probably, for this Congress. 
 The heart of the bill is a provision to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by midcentury -- cuts scientists say are necessary to avert the worst consequences of global warming. The mechanism for achieving them is a cap-and-trade system that would place a steadily declining ceiling on emissions while allowing emitters to trade permits, or allowances, to give them more flexibility in meeting their targets. This would put a price on carbon, ideally raising the cost of older, dirtier fuels while steering investment to cleaner ones. 
 Since previous bills focusing exclusively on capping emissions have gone nowhere, the two seasoned politicians behind this one -- Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts -- are offering other provisions aimed at increasing energy efficiency, encouraging cleaner energy sources and providing subsidies for industries that produce them. Their theory is that if they can win over the diverse and cantankerous energy committee they can win the House itself. 
 The bill deliberately left big questions open for discussion, and as negotiations proceed, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey must resist crippling concessions. One debate is whether companies should get the allowances the government will assign to polluters for free or whether they should pay for them at an auction.
 Legislators from coal-dependent states want free allowances to mitigate costs of compliance and give emitters time to switch to cleaner fuels. Others fear that free allowances would delay hard choices while reducing revenues the government could use to make clean-energy investments and help the poor with higher energy costs. 
 Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey should make only modest adjustments, if any, in their original targets; better no bill than one that would cut the 2020 reduction goal from 20 percent to 6 percent, as some Democrats have suggested. That's a joke, not a compromise.
 The Republicans are no help at all, insisting without exception that the bill would bankrupt the economy. The truth is that no one knows how much this bill will cost. A lot depends on how it is structured, how the auction revenues are applied, how quickly new, job-producing technologies come online and how much the country can save through efficiencies. 
 We do know that the emissions cap will not begin to bite until 2012 and that past programs to clean the air have always cost less than predicted. And, if the scientists are right, we know that the costs of doing nothing will dwarf the costs of acting now.

HEADLINE: Obama Plans to Drop a Fighter Jet Engine From Military Budget

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
President Obama has anointed a new symbol of Pentagon waste. It is an 18-foot alternative engine for the Air Force's new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. 
 But some military experts and lawmakers questioned Thursday whether canceling the engine was as sensible as he had portrayed it. The president has drawn similar questions about a new presidential helicopter, which he earlier held up as an example of defense contracting ''gone amok.'' 
 In announcing his budget for 2010 on Thursday, the president cited the plan to kill the extra engine as showing how ''we're going to save money by eliminating unnecessary defense programs that do nothing to keep us safe.'' 
 But while canceling the extra engine could save $1 billion in the short run, military experts said it would add to the risk of much costlier problems with the Joint Strike Fighter, which is expected to become the Pentagon's largest and most expensive weapons program. 
 And some lawmakers predicted that Congress would save the extra engine as insurance against further delays in the fighter program, just as it did when President George W. Bush tried three times to kill it.
 ''The Pentagon has failed to inform the president of the complete picture,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat from Hawaii who is chairman of a House armed services subcommittee on air and land forces. ''We will correct that.'' 
 The engine was one of more than a dozen programs identified for cancellation or cuts in the administration's $640 billion military budget, which has generally been praised for shifting money from futuristic weapons to simpler arms that can be used in today's wars.
 All of the other cuts Mr. Obama outlined -- in F-22 fighter jets, missile defense systems and the Army's $159 billion modernization plan -- were announced before.
 The administration's efforts to rein in waste received another boost Thursday when the Senate approved a bill to strengthen the Pentagon's contracting controls. And Pentagon officials projected that after the Bush administration's buildup, the growth in Pentagon spending would slow from 4 percent each year in inflation-adjusted terms to no more than 2 percent annually.
 But much of the talk in defense circles on Thursday was on the alternate F-35 engine. It was ordered by Congress in the 1990s to avoid a repeat of costly problems with earlier fighters that initially had only one engine supplier.
 Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, is already building an F-35 engine in Connecticut. General Electric and Rolls-Royce have spent $2.5 billion developing the alternate engine in Ohio, and it is 70 percent complete. Congress's idea was to have the companies compete for contracts. 
 The Pentagon said that while such competition might produce modest savings as it builds more than 2,400 of the planes, the main engine program is ''progressing well, making a second engine program unnecessary.'' 
 House aides said two turbine blade failures during Pratt & Whitney's testing had contributed to cost increases on the F-35 program. Even though the problems have been fixed, they said, lawmakers were wary about relying on one supplier for such a critical program. 
 The Pentagon also plans to cancel the program to develop the new presidential helicopter, which had doubled in cost. Some defense experts have also questioned that decision, saying it would leave the government with little to show for the $3.2 billion that it has already spent. 
 In the budget documents, the Pentagon said it would review the requirements and would conduct new bidding by fiscal 2011.
 Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from upstate New York, where the project provides 800 jobs, said Thursday that he had asked the Pentagon not to stop the program until Congress could review the decision.
 Mr. Hinchey, a member of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, said he and Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the panel, would try to use the Pentagon budget bill to salvage a simpler version of the helicopter already being tested.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Friday with an article about President Obama's plan to cancel an alternative engine for the F-35 fighter jet misspelled the surname of the president of the team from General Electric and Rolls-Royce that is developing the engine. She is Jean Lydon-Rodgers, not Lyndon-Rogers.

HEADLINE: In Diplomacy, a Pakistan Disconnect

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There was a lot of talk at the White House on Wednesday about all of the ways that the United States is trying to help Afghanistan and Pakistan work together to improve the lot of ordinary people. 
 President Obama spoke of how members of his cabinet, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, would hold meetings with their Afghan and Pakistani counterparts to help them build democratic institutions for governance. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about a trade pact between the two countries to increase commerce over the borders. The national security adviser, James L. Jones, talked about judicial reform and the need to stamp out corruption in Afghanistan.
 But as Taliban and other insurgents have battled government troops closer and closer to Islamabad, the one thing that no one seemed to be talking about publicly is the one thing that, privately, Obama officials acknowledge is the most important: how to get the Pakistani government and army to move the country's troops from the east, where they are preoccupied with a war with India that most American officials do not think they will have to fight, to the west, where the Islamist insurgents are taking over one town after another. 
 Mr. Obama gave only passing reference to the problem, which American officials have been privately pressing their Pakistani counterparts to address all week. Standing next to the visiting heads of state of Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Hamid Karzai and Asif Ali Zardari -- Mr. Obama said simply that ''we meet today as three sovereign nations joined by a common goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda and its extremist allies in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their ability to operate in either country in the future.''
 Then he went on to talk about the drug trade in Afghanistan and the $5.5 billion raised for the region at a donors' conference in Tokyo. 
 Part of the reason for the gap between the public and private diplomacy is that administration officials do not want to go on the record explicitly with what they are seeking from the two governments, lest they be held to account when neither government comes through with promises made behind closed doors. 
 The other reason why no one wants to talk too much publicly about what the United States wants Pakistan to do is that there is a real difference in the way that the two countries view the insurgency in the western part of Pakistan. While Americans see this as an existential threat to the Pakistani government, Pakistanis look at things differently.
 ''This situation has been going on for decades,'' one Pakistani official explained on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''These people have always tried to impose Shariah law in the tribal areas.'' 
 Pakistan is more concerned, he said, with getting the American government to stop the unmanned Predator strikes in the western part of the country, which he characterized as far more damaging to the survivability of the Pakistani government than Islamist insurgents in the Swat valley.
 His comments came just after a senior Obama administration official said that the administration believes the Pakistani government is finally starting to come around to the American way of thinking about the nature of the Islamist threat to the Pakistani government, further underscoring the disconnect between the two governments.
 When such a disconnect exists, those involved in diplomacy just stick to public pronouncements on judicial reform and economic development.

HEADLINE: Talked to Death

BYLINE: By HASSINA SHERJAN. 
Hassina Sherjan is the president of Boumi, a manufacturer of decorative products for the home, and the director of Aid Afghanistan for Education, a nonprofit group.

DATELINE: Kabul, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
 FOR several years, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has been trying to negotiate and reconcile with supposedly moderate elements of the Taliban to end the insurgency. This approach has failed every time. Thus it is puzzling to many Afghans that President Obama has also been talking about negotiating with ''moderates.'' Let's hope that when the two men met in Washington this week, along with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, the idea of reaching out to the Islamic extremists was shelved once and for all. 
 After all, President Karzai's efforts have simply revealed the weakness of the Afghan government and its international allies. Taliban spokesman have repeatedly demanded unacceptable conditions for talks, including the departure of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and the establishment of Shariah law. 
 Indeed, shortly after Mr. Obama raised the subject of reconciliation, the Taliban rejected his proposal, stating there were no extremists or moderate groups within their ranks. On this point at least, the Taliban are right. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, put it very clearly: ''The Taliban were united under the leadership of Mullah Muhammad Omar. All the fighters follow and obey orders of one central command. The existence of moderates and extremist elements within the rank and file of Taliban is wishful thinking of the West and the Afghan government.''
 What can be the purpose of talks with the Taliban? These men deprive women of their rights, throw acid in the faces of schoolgirls, reject religious freedom and oppose constitutional democracy. They also threaten to kill any Afghans who have worked with Western militaries and nongovernmental groups or had other contact with foreigners. 
 Is it possible, as some have said, that the Taliban have mellowed since being toppled in 2001? Muhammad Ibrahim Hanafi, a top Taliban commander, answered that question in an interview in March with CNN: ''Our law is still the same old law which was in place during our rule in Afghanistan.'' 
 The more President Karzai and his Western allies talk about reconciliation, the farther their public support will plummet. I returned to Afghanistan in 2001 after more than two decades in America and founded a manufacturing company with the intention of using part of its profits to help young women get an education. In the early days, the discussions at our organization's meetings were dominated by talk of building schools and other big plans. Lately, however, the main topic has been the future of us women in Afghanistan under another Taliban regime. We know that there is not, and will never be, any ''moderate Taliban.'' Extremists and ideologues do not compromise. 
 The atmosphere has been made worse by the president's signing of a family law affecting Shiite Muslims that places restrictions on when a woman can leave her house and states the circumstances in which she is obliged to have sex with her husband. I was part of a group of civil-society representatives who recently met with President Karzai to express our concerns about the law; he replied that he hadn't known the full details when he signed it and promised to ''fight for us'' to have it amended. We'll see. But his later statement that ''there are no reconciliation processes'' going on with the Taliban, which seems at odds with the facts, did not inspire much hope. 
 The family law and other governmental efforts to appease religious extremists are having one effect that reminds me of the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of 1979: Afghanistan is being drained of the people who would be most effective at putting it back together. It seems as if every group of Afghans that attends training programs in the West now returns just a bit smaller. Last year, the accountant and the top administrator of my factory left for the Netherlands with their families. My new accountant recently went to Islamabad, Pakistan, to meet with German Embassy officials about a possible visa. 
 This is a far cry from the 1960s and '70s, when many Afghans, including my father and five of my uncles, studied abroad on scholarships but returned to work in the government or to start businesses and create jobs. That sense of nationalism has disappeared; unless we rediscover it, Afghanistan will become a failed state. 
 The only ''reconciliation'' strategy that is going to work is one between the Kabul government and the Afghan people. The key is making changes at the community level. Many local mullahs and citizens who have tolerated the Taliban in the past are open to working with a government that can protect them and help them find livelihoods. The government and its allies can best weaken the insurgency by better protecting the population, organizing local citizens' groups to cooperate on economic development, and hiring more people from every part of the country into the growing Afghan Army and police force.
 This is the only way that the reconcilables will be separated from the irreconcilables. We need to understand where Afghanistan's true moderates are to be found, and not look for them in leadership positions of one of the most repressive organizations on earth.

HEADLINE: In Strategy Shift, G.E. Plans Lower-Cost Health Products

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
General Electric is shifting the strategy in its $17 billion-a-year health equipment and technology business, seeking to broaden its reach with more lower-cost products. 
 The move is part of a wide-ranging marketing and business initiative announced on Thursday, called ''healthymagination.'' General Electric's health business, known for its medical imaging and diagnostic machines, is struggling in a weak economy. 
 The hospitals and clinics that buy such sophisticated and costly equipment are reducing capital spending in the downturn. In the first quarter, revenue for G.E.'s health care business fell 9 percent, to $3.55 billion, and its operating profit fell 22 percent, to $411 million.
 ''The high end in health care is never going to go away,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday. ''But this will make us broader in terms of price points and offerings.''
 As part of the new health strategy, G.E. said it would invest $3 billion to develop at least 100 product and services innovations by 2015. The criteria for the new products, G.E. said, will be that they lower cost, increase access and improve quality by 15 percent. The threshold measurements will be done by Oxford Analytica, a consulting and analysis firm.
 At a news conference in Washington, G.E. showed off some of the new products that it planned to bring to market, including a hand-held ultrasound machine, decision-support software for physicians developed with the Mayo Clinic and Intermountain Healthcare, and a bassinet with an overhead heater for keeping newborns warm, a product only for poorer nations.
 From $200 million to $300 million a year of the health research and development spending would be additional money, Mr. Immelt said, while the rest would be from the health unit's existing research budget.
 Broadly, the innovations are intended to address four needs: accelerating the adoption of health information technology like computerized patient records, delivering high technology medical equipment at lower prices, improving the access to health care by underserved communities and supporting consumer-driven preventive care.
 ''This is going to force G.E. to wrestle with big issues -- technical ones and beyond,'' said Noel M. Tichy, a professor of management and organizations at the University of Michigan business school. ''It's a real broadening, and very different from selling MRI machines to big hospitals.'' 
 The G.E. initiative will involve businesses beyond its health care division. In June, the company's MSNBC cable television network plans to introduce a daily health program, anchored by the NBC News chief medical editor, Dr. Nancy L. Snyderman. 
 G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., also intends to improve the health of the 600,000 workers and retirees it insures, using education, incentives and preventive health programs. One goal is to keep the increase in G.E. health costs below the general inflation rate. 
 The health campaign is broadly modeled on the company's ''ecomagination'' initiative, begun in 2005. It is focused on making G.E. and its products more environmentally friendly. Since 2005, the company has invested $1.5 billion on research and development for ''green'' products, tripled sales of such products to $18 billion and reduced the company's carbon footprint by 8 percent, saving $100 million a year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops Research Into Fuel Cells for Cars

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells, once hailed by President George W. Bush as a pollution-free solution for reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil, will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy secretary said Thursday, and the government will cut off funds for the vehicles' development. 
 Developing those cells and coming up with a way to transport the hydrogen is a big challenge, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in releasing energy-related details of the administration's budget for the year beginning Oct. 1. Dr. Chu said the government preferred to focus on projects that would bear fruit more quickly.
 The retreat from cars powered by fuel cells counters Mr. Bush's prediction in 2003 that ''the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.'' The Energy Department will continue to pay for research into stationary fuel cells, which Dr. Chu said could be used like batteries on the power grid and do not require compact storage of hydrogen. 
 The Obama administration will also establish eight ''energy innovation hubs,'' small centers for basic research that Dr. Chu referred to as ''Bell Lablettes.'' These will be financed for five years at a time to lure more scientists into the energy area. 
 ''We're very devoted to delivering solutions -- not just science papers, but solutions -- but it will require some basic science,'' Dr. Chu, who won a Nobel Prize for his work in physics, said at a news conference.
 He said he would probably reverse another Bush administration decision and restore funds for FutureGen, a program to build a power plant prototype. The plant would turn coal into gas, separate out the carbon dioxide -- a major contributor to the greenhouse gases that cause global warming -- and pump it underground. Then it would burn the hydrogen, which is nearly pollution-free. 
 An international partnership had selected a site in Mattoon, Ill., for construction of the plant, but the Bush administration decided that the costs were too high and that the money should be spread among more projects.
 The Obama administration will also drop spending for research on the exploration of oil and gas deposits because the industry itself has ample resources for that, Dr. Chu said. 
 While the budget request for the Energy Department is $26.4 billion, an increase of less than 1 percent, actual spending will actually be far higher because some projects will be financed by the economic stimulus package, said Steve Isakowitz, the department's chief financial officer.
 While Dr. Chu emphasized the allocations for research, a former Energy Department official, Robert Alvarez, pointed out that the budget still includes $6.4 billion for nuclear weapons and $4.4 billion for naval reactors, nuclear nonproliferation activity and safe storage of surplus plutonium. ''Weapons still make up the largest single expenditure,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Central Banks in Europe Ease Credit Policies Again

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and JULIA WERDIGIER; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank lowered its benchmark lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, to a new low of 1 percent, and announced plans to spend about 60 billion euros, or $80.5 billion, in an effort to ease credit flows.
 At the same time, the Bank of England held its key interest rate steady at 0.5 percent and said it would expand its program of buying corporate debt and British government bonds to pump more cash into the economy. 
 The European Central Bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, acknowledged that the pace of economic contraction in the euro zone was easing. But he said that the extraordinary downturn the region now faced -- one in which a distressed financial system was amplifying the recession -- called for new, unorthodox measures to stimulate the economy.
 Although the European Central Bank has been cutting rates rapidly since October, Mr. Trichet said there might be more to come. ''We have not decided today that they are at their lowest level,'' he said.
 In its most daring move yet, the central bank announced plans to buy about 60 billion euros in covered bonds -- which are bonds secured by mortgage pools or public debt -- as a further measure to promote lending. The market for covered bonds was about 600 billion euros last year, so the central bank's move was significant, economists said.
 Mr. Trichet added that the European Central Bank was not pursuing a policy of ''quantitative easing,'' as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve in the United States were. In its strictest sense, this policy involves purchases of government debt to expand the amount of money in circulation, but is often referred to as ''printing money.'' That is a label the European Central Bank is keen to avoid.
 The Bank of England said Thursday that it would expand its program of quantitative easing by $:50 billion, to a total of $:125 billion ($188 billion). It is fighting a serious recession in Britain, where the flagship financial services industry is shrinking and unemployment is skyrocketing.
 The European Central Bank has sometimes appeared reluctant to follow the more aggressive steps of its peers in London and Washington, economists said, so the bank's decision to buy covered bonds was considered an important turning point.
 ''It is a good push by the E.C.B.,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist in London for Goldman Sachs. ''And the door is not closed for anything else.''
 In keeping with a policy the central bank has pursued since the early stages of the financial crisis, Mr. Trichet also announced it would further extend the maturity of its basic refinancing operations -- in normal times a weekly event -- to 12 months. This is the underlying mechanism by which the European Central Bank infuses credit into the economies of the nations that use the euro economy by lending money to banks against collateral.
 The strategy has helped reduce strains in financial markets, but it has the European Central Bank assuming the role normally played by private banks, which typically lend far more to each other than they are now.
 ''The longer a central bank keeps the collateral, pledged by banks against cash, on its balance sheet, the closer the operations resemble a proper asset purchase,'' Jacques Cailloux, chief euro zone economist in London for the Royal Bank of Scotland, wrote in a research note.
 The Bank of England's move to expand its asset purchase program surprised some analysts because there had been some tentative signs that the British economy might be on course for a recovery from its worst recession since the Great Depression.
 ''They really must avoid the U.K. getting into a deflationary spiral, and that's why they are continuing with the program,'' said Charles Davis, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London. ''Even if we've seen some economic indicators improving, there's still the fickleness of some data and unemployment rising.''
 British stocks rallied in April, property prices slowed their steep descent as mortgage approvals increased, and consumer confidence gained. The weakness of the pound against other leading currencies started to help exporters. The signs prompted some economists to predict that Britain could emerge from the recession in the fourth quarter.
 Still, unemployment has continued to rise, and concern among consumers about the stability of their employment is weighing on their willingness to make major purchases. Britain's economy contracted 1.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 1979. The government said earlier it expected gross domestic product to shrink 3.5 percent this year. 
 ''The world economy remains in deep recession. Output has continued to contract, and international trade has fallen precipitously,'' the Bank of England said in a statement. ''The global banking and financial system remains fragile despite further significant intervention by the authorities.''
 The bank, however, also took note of the positive signals. ''In the United Kingdom, G.D.P. fell sharply in the first quarter of 2009,'' the bank said. ''But surveys at home and abroad show promising signs that the pace of decline has begun to moderate.''

Suggested Time Allowance: 3-5 class periods.
Activities / Procedures:
Click here for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now:
Open class by playing Bob Dylan's "Blowin' In The Wind" for students. As the song is playing, project the lyrics for students to read. (If the necessary equipment is unavailable, copy the lyrics for students in advance of class.) Both a recording and the lyrics of the song can be found online at BobDylan.com.
Ask students: Do you know when this song was written? (They may or may not know this song as a popular protest song from the 1960s - 1963, to be exact.) Once you've established the time period, ask: What was going on in the country when the song was written? After students share, invite them to look closely at the lyrics. Ask: Knowing the historical context of the song, what do you notice about the lyrics? What is the song about? How does Bob Dylan use rhetorical questions to engage listeners? What does he mean when he says "the answer is blowin' in the wind"?
Last year, Neil Young said, "I know that the time when music could change the world is past." Ask students: Do you agree? Why or why not? Was there a time when music had more impact? What makes a song significant as opposed to just popular? Does music in general have the potential to change the world?
Ask whether there are any Green Day fans in the room. Tell students that Green Day is set to release a new album, "21st Century Breakdown," on May 15, and that many of the songs contain social commentary. If possible and desired, play them the video or audio of one of the songs from this album, "Know Your Enemy." After watching the video, project or hand out copies of the song lyrics to the class. Before looking closely at the lyrics, ask students: What is tone of the song we just heard? What do you think the song's about? If you have watched the music video, ask, What images do you see repeated in the video? What might they represent?
Then, ask a student to read the lyrics aloud. Ask: What is this song calling for? What is the political and social context for these lyrics? How is it like "Blowin' in the Wind"? How is it different? What other artists do you know of today who address social and political issues in their music? Does their music have the potential to change the world? In general, is music a good way to deliver political messages? Why or why not?
2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS:
As a class, read and discuss the article "The Morning After 'American Idiot'", focusing on the following questions:
a. How did the success of "American Idiot" affect Green Day?
b. What is significant about their album "21st Century Breakdown"?
c. How is the "cultural moment" at which this new album is arriving different from that during which "American Idiot" emerged?
d. In what way is it worse, according to Billie Joe Armstrong?
d. What do song titles like "American Eulogy" and "Last Night on Earth" suggest?
e. What themes emerge on the new album?
f. How is the new album structured?
g. Which characters people the album? Why do you think the lyricist creates these different personae?
h. Why does the author begin the article with a tour through a tour of their longtime studio and trace the band's evolution as part of the article?
j. Why does Armstrong hold off on completing the vocals?
k. What do you think Armstrong means when he talks about what he would like to write saying, "It's something where you write the soundtrack to the chaos. And you write the soundtrack to some kind of revolt"?
3. ACTIVITY:
Tell students that for today's activity, they will be choosing a seminal album from any point in the 20th century to research and creating liner notes that explain how exactly it captured the zeitgeist and both reflected and affected its time period. If necessary, help students differentiate between music that is popular and that which is seminal and defines the times.
Ask students if they are familiar with liner notes. (In the age of iPods and downloadable music, they may not be.) Introduce/elucidate the concept of liner notes by handing out "Liner Notes -- A Primer". If you have access to liner notes at home, you may wish to bring in physical models. Alternatively, you may wish to share some examples from an online library of liner notes. Explain that although many of these albums were produced with an original set of liner notes, theirs will have the advantage of the historical perspective -- they can look back on these albums and seek to understand them in their social and political context in a way that is not possible when an album is released.
Once students understand what they will be doing, list album titles considered seminal from which students can choose, or have students brainstorm and/or do research for additional titles. Several examples are listed below, just to get you and/or your students started:
1950s:
Pete Seeger
Woody Guthrie
1960s:
"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" - Bob Dylan
"The White Album" - The Beatles
"Blue" - Joni Mitchell
1970s:
"4-Way Street" - Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young
"London Calling" - The Clash
1980s:
"Born in the USA" - Bruce Springsteen
"The Wall" - Pink Floyd
1990s:
"Nevermind" - Nirvana
"Jagged Little Pill" - Alanis Morrisette
"Fear of a Black Planet" - Public Enemy
2000s:
"Home" - Dixie Chicks
"Pearl Jam" - Pearl Jam
"American Idiot" - Green Day
Resources to use to find additional candidates for a list of seminal albums include the following:
The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time
Time Magazine's The All-TIME 100 Albums
Rateyourmusic.com: 100 greatest albums of all time
Teachers should note that the content of some of the albums included on these lists are explicit; you may wish to curate the list so that it is appropriate for your students or to subject students' choices to final approval.
Once each student has selected an album for which to write liner notes, instruct them to begin to research the historical, political and social context of the album, as well as any contemporary and later impact it seems to have had. Suggest that students use the Times Topics pages for various artists and/or bands as starting points for their research. As a starting point, they should read contemporary reviews and obtain all of the lyrics to the songs on the albums in order to answer the questions outlined on the handout; they should also listen to the album, if at all possible. There are several song lyric databases on the Internet including www.songlyrics.com and www.lyrics.com. In addition, many bands and artists have their own official Web sites that offer lyrics, recordings and press.
When research is complete, students write their liner notes according to the guidelines on the handout. Offer them the following examples to help them get started:
-A student writing about the Dixie Chicks album "Home" might note that the Dixie Chicks made waves in 2003 when they spoke out against the war in Iraq and President Bush during a concert in London, England, resulting in a great deal of attention to and criticism of their album.
-A student writing about Bob Dylan's "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" might choose "Blowin' in the Wind" as one of the songs to write about and discuss its role as a protest song during the Vietnam war, a civil rights anthem, as well as how it has recently resurfaced in protests of the Iraq War.
As a culminating experience, ask each student to prepare to share one representative song from their assigned album with the class and discuss its significance: why it captured the zeitgeist, how it said something important or how it reflected and/or affected its time. Ask that students bring copies of the lyrics to the song they wish to discuss for each person in their group/class. (Or, if technology permits, have them project the lyrics on the board or a large screen.)
Conclude this activity by sharing this excerpt from the Times editorial "Still Singing" about the 90th birthday concert held for Pete Seeger at Madison Square Garden on May 2, 2009:

Ask students: In what way do some of the artists and albums you've researched act like 'stealth dagger[s] through the heart of our country's illusions about itself'? How do these seminal albums act as soundtracks to their times? Do you think that new generations will continue 'to write and sing songs to fight power with truth'? Why or why not?
4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES:
Invite students to become part of this new generation: individually, they develop a "pitch" to a record executive for a concept album that fights power with truth. Hand out "Creating a Concept Album" and ask students to use it to think through their ideas. Invite students to pitch their ideas to small groups of their peers during a future class.

Create a podcast to share the songs you choose, introducing your own with a brief commentary on its significance.
3. Create a class timeline or wiki where each student can post their album and a blurb about what was happening in the word at the time of its release. If possible, create your display in a school common area like the library or a much-trafficked hallway and invite students, faculty members and staff members to contribute album titles seminal in their own lives with a blurb explaining why.
4. As a class, research the cultural and historical references in Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire". Then create a hypertext version of the song, with links to resources.
5. Using PBS's Independent Lens: Strange Fruit as a starting place, research the history and role of protest songs in African-American slave communities.
6. Brainstorm a list of "one-hit wonders" that were popular, but didn't necessarily have staying power. What makes some songs popular but not lasting? Share examples of popular songs that lacked the substance and/or other qualities necessary for a song to have lasting significance, with explanations of why.
7. Interview your parents about the role music has played in their lives. Using the Favorite Poem Project as a model, have a listening party in your classroom during which parents and students share the music seminal to them and explain its personal and/or cultural/historical significance.
8. Read several of the short essays inspired by Nick Hornby's book 'Songbook' at McSweeney's Web site. Make a timeline of seminal albums or songs in your own life. Then, choose one of these and write a personal essay, modeled after those on the McSweeney's site, in which you explain how that particular song reflected and affected your life at a particular moment.Interdisciplinary Connections:
Economics - Investigate the commercial success of the seminal albums researched by the class. How many of these albums were commercially successful during their initial few weeks of release? Just because an album is critically acclaimed or culturally significant, does it make money? Create a graph showing how much money each of these albums has made since its release. What is the relationship between significance and popularity?
Global History - Research collaborations by musical artists to raise money for and awareness of issues in other countries, like U.S.A. for Africa's "We Are the World" and BandAid's "Do They Know Its Christmas?". What was happening in Africa at the time these singles were released? What prompted artists to join together and make a difference? Did the proceeds from these albums and concerts actually make a difference?Academic Content Standards:

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Says It Needs $19 Billion More in Aid

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Fannie Mae issued a grave warning about its future on Friday, saying it needed $19 billion in additional government aid as job losses grew and risky loans made in the housing boom went bad at an unnerving pace. 
 Fannie Mae, a mortgage finance company, received a $15 billion bailout from the federal government in March. In addition to calling for more money, it said it would not be profitable soon. 
 In a regulatory filing, the company said ''there is significant uncertainty as to our long-term financial sustainability.'' Even more government aid, it added, ''may not be sufficient to keep us in a solvent condition.''
 Fannie Mae posted a quarterly loss of $23.2 billion, or $4.09 a share. That compares with a loss of $2.5 billion, or $2.57 a share, in the year-ago period.
 The federal government, which seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last September, has already spent about $60 billion to prop up the two struggling companies. 
 Freddie Mac is expected to release its first quarter results next week.
 The Obama administration has estimated the bill to taxpayers for the two companies will reach $147 billion out of a potential $400 billion government lifeline by the end of September 2010.
 James B. Lockhart, the head regulator for the companies, said, ''Anything that we can do to stabilize the mortgage market will be to the long-term economic good of the two companies.''
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a vital role in the mortgage market by purchasing loans from banks and selling them to investors. Together, the companies own or guarantee almost 31 million home loans worth about $5.5 trillion. That is about half of all American home mortgages.
 The two companies lowered their standards for borrowers in the real estate boom and are reeling from the bust. Fannie Mae now has $145 billion in delinquent loans on its books, more than 10 times the amount last year.
 In addition, the company said, it was able to recoup less money through foreclosure sales -- it owns 62,000 foreclosed properties -- because of the sharp drop in home prices. And Fannie Mae expects home prices to decline an additional 4 to 17 percent.

HEADLINE: Losing Job May Be Hazardous To Health

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Even as the Labor Department released figures showing that the economy lost more than half a million jobs in April, researchers on Friday made public a large study with an unsettling finding: losing your job may make you sick. 
 A researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed detailed employment and health data from 8,125 individuals surveyed in 1999, 2001 and 2003 by the Panel Study of Income Dynamics at the University of Michigan. 
 Workers who lost a job through no fault of their own, she found, were twice as likely to report developing a new ailment like high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease over the next year and a half, compared with people who were continuously employed.
 Interestingly, the risk was just as high for those who found new jobs quickly as it was for those who remained unemployed. 
 Though it has long been known that poor health and unemployment often go together, questions have lingered about whether unemployment leads to illness, or whether people in ill health are more likely to leave a job, be fired or be laid off. 
 In an effort to sort out this chicken-or-egg problem, the new study looked specifically at people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- for example, because of a plant or business closing.
 The author, Kate W. Strully, said she looked at situations in which people lost jobs for reasons that ''shouldn't have had anything to do with their health.'' 
 What happens to their health afterward, then, ''isn't reflecting a prior condition,'' said Dr. Strully, an assistant professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Albany, who did the research as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation scholar at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
 Only 6 percent of people with steady jobs developed a new health condition during each survey period of about a year and a half, compared with 10 percent of those who had lost a job during the same period. It did not matter whether the laid-off workers had found new employment; they still had a 1 in 10 chance of developing a new health condition, Dr. Strully found.
 David R. Williams, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who was not involved in the research, said the study was a reminder that job loss and other life stressors have a tremendous impact on mental and physical health and contribute to the development of chronic conditions. 
 ''We know that stress affects health,'' said Dr. Williams, who is director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier America. ''It causes changes in physiological function in multiple ways, and it can lead to alterations in health behavior. People no longer exercise; they eat more; they drink more. People who smoke, smoke more on high-stress days.''

HEADLINE: Hospitals Pay for Cutting Costly Readmissions

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It is one of the biggest avoidable costs on the nation's medical bill. 
 Millions of patients each year leave the hospital only to return within weeks or months for lack of proper follow-up care. One in five Medicare patients, for example, returns to the hospital within 30 days. Over all, readmissions cost the federal government an estimated $17 billion a year. 
 But even when hospitals find ways to greatly reduce the return trips, saving money for Medicare and other insurers, their efforts go unrewarded. In fact, because insurers typically pay hospitals to treat patients -- not to keep them away by keeping them healthy -- hospitals can actually lose money by providing better care. Empty beds mean lost revenue. 
 As Congress debates health care, some policy experts say no meaningful improvement can be made without changing the payment system so medical centers have more financial incentive to help people stay out of the hospital. 
 ''The hospitals who say they are penalized for doing the right thing are absolutely right,'' said Dr. Robert Berenson, a policy specialist at the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy research center in Washington. ''If we can't do this, we can't do much of anything in health reform.''
 Attuned to the issue, two Senate leaders of the effort to overhaul health care, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and the Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, recently announced their support for changing the way hospitals are paid, to reward them -- instead of punishing them -- for reducing the number of patients requiring readmission. 
 Medical providers all too familiar with the financial double bind include Park Nicollet Health Services, a hospital and clinic system based in St. Louis Park, Minn. Park Nicollet started tackling the readmission problem four years ago, spending as much as $750,000 annually on more nurses and on sophisticated software to track heart failure patients after they left the hospital. It reduced readmissions for such patients to only 1 in 25, down from nearly 1 in 6. 
 But the reduction has been a losing proposition. Although the effort saved Medicare roughly $5 million a year, Park Nicollet is not paid to provide the follow-up care. Meanwhile, fewer returning hospital patients mean lower revenue for Park Nicollet. 
 ''We've kept it up out of a sense of moral obligation to these patients, but we're getting killed,'' said David K. Wessner, chief executive of Park Nicollet. ''We will totally run out of gas.''
 Another hospital system, Catholic Healthcare Partners in Cincinnati, has dropped a similarly successful follow-up program. The hospital said it did so because it could not afford the additional expense of keeping heart failure patients out of the hospital. Medicare officials argue that hospitals and doctors should already be doing what is best for patients. And they say some simple steps could be adopted at little expense, such as making sure patients get a list of the medications they should take after leaving the hospital. But Medicare, the Obama administration and some members of Congress now at work on health care legislation have acknowledged the need to change the payment system. 
 ''Ultimately, we have a reimbursement system for health care that is not aligned all the time with providing high-quality care,'' said Dr. Barry M. Straube, the chief medical officer for Medicare. ''Unequivocally, there has to be payment reform.''
 At Park Nicollet, the key to reducing readmissions is an early-warning system that signals when heart failure patients' symptoms are starting to worsen. 
 All the heart patients in the program weigh themselves daily at home and answer a few simple questions, like whether they are short of breath. They punch this information into their telephone keypads. If the data indicate a possible decline in a patient's condition, the software system alerts a nurse, who follows up with the patient. 
 Patients include Adeline Patyk, 85, and her husband, Chester, 83. If they begin to retain fluid, causing their weight to spike, or if they report that their ankles are beginning to swell, they can get help before their symptoms reach the point that they must go to the hospital. The nurse might suggest an adjustment to their medications, for example, or send them to a doctor. 
 ''We don't have to go to the hospital so often,'' Mrs. Patyk said. ''That means a lot.''
 Judy Ryan, a nurse who helps oversee the program, says that it works. ''We can really abort that terrible experience of the emergency room, ultimately the I.C.U.,'' Ms. Ryan said. 
 As part of a Medicare experiment to reduce readmissions, Park Nicollet earned a bonus of $247,000 in 2008 -- but that payment equaled only about a third of the cost of running the program that year. Park Nicollet, which a few years ago had 640 patients enrolled in the program, has reduced enrollment to 380 -- the patients at highest risk of being readmitted.
 Other hospitals have had similar success. With the help of a federal grant, from 2002 to 2006, Catholic Healthcare Partners hired six nurses to oversee the care of its high-risk heart failure patients. Return visits dropped sharply. But when that grant ended, officials at the hospital said, they could not persuade insurers to pay for the program, so they eventually ended it. 
 Pressed by the growing need to care for patients who cannot pay their bills, Michael D. Connelly, chief executive of Catholic Healthcare, said his organization had little choice. He says insurers need to develop new ways of paying hospitals, like bundling payments so a patient's hospital stay includes follow-up care. ''One of my frustrations is it's taking so long to do this,'' he said. 
 The problem with the current insurance system, some experts say, is that there is no payoff for hospitals and doctors who invest in new ways of providing care. 
 ''The payer reaps the entire benefit,'' said Harold D. Miller, the executive director for the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a nonprofit group in Pittsburgh.
 Mr. Miller says there are payment models in which hospitals could share in the savings from better care, or could be paid more by providing some sort of warranty on their care -- as the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania has tried to do with heart operations. 
 The Obama administration has already discussed reducing Medicare payments to hospitals with the highest readmission rates, and the Senate is discussing bundling payments. 
 Something has to change, said Mr. Wessner at Park Nicollet. He says he understands that health systems like his may eventually have to learn to live with more empty beds. But he says hospitals also need to be rewarded for investing in programs that keep patients out of the hospital -- instead of pouring more money into new facilities meant to bring in more patients.
 ''There's got to be a business case and a return on investment in new patterns of care,'' Mr. Wessner said.

HEADLINE: Flu? What Flu?

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
If you are looking for a cheap travel destination, try Mexico.
 Short of war, Mexico has endured about the worst calamity that can befall a country's tourism industry over the last few weeks. A few people who had traveled here came down with what looked, initially, like a potentially highly contagious flu. Within days, pictures of civilians clad in surgical masks, like scenes from some science fiction disaster movie, were leading newspaper and television reports around the world.
 It will take a long time for would-be vacationers to forget those images, but the Mexican government is trying to help them, with a multimillion-dollar campaign to restore Mexico's brand, as hotels cut rates 50 to 70 percent. 
 Some are not even waiting for the World Health Organization pandemic warning to be lifted. AM Resorts, a hotel chain, announced a ''flu-free guarantee'' at 10 of its 11 Mexico hotels beginning Friday. The company will give three free vacations over the next three years to any customer unfortunate enough to pick up the H1N1 flu virus at one of its Mexico resorts. 
 The company is also offering discounts of 37 to 55 percent, as well as credits worth as much as $250 for food and other items.
 ''During the last few weeks, we have continuously encouraged travel to Mexico based on the real facts about the H1N1 virus,'' Alex Zozaya, AM Resorts president, said.
 When Mexican officials announced almost $2.1 billion in tax breaks and loans to help the Mexican economy recover from the residual effects of the flu, the tourism industry received special attention -- loans for hotels and airlines, cuts in airport and port fees, and tax write-offs for businesses -- worth, all told, $450 million. 
 The reason is clear. Foreign tourism earned Mexico $13.3 billion last year. Tourism employs more than two million people and accounts for about 8 percent of the economy. 
 The number of foreign visitors had already plunged since the beginning of the year because of the sinking global economy. And graphic press reports from Mexico describing gruesome drug violence were no help. Then, came H1N1. 
 Though it is impossible to know how much damage the flu will inflict in the end, Mexican officials have said that in the worst case, the revenue from foreign tourists could fall $5 billion this year. The finance minister, Agustin Carstens, has estimated that the outbreak will eventually shave 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent from the gross domestic product. 
 There are a number of worrying signs that pessimism is hurting the tourist trade, at least right now. Although the normal pace of life is returning here, the State Department still advises Americans against all but essential travel to Mexico. 
 Continental Airlines cut capacity on its Mexico routes in half beginning on Monday, noting that demand was already soft before the flu outbreak and dropped sharply on the news. Hotels in Cancun and south along the Mayan Riviera reported that guests did not bother to cancel; they simply did not show up. Cruise ships have canceled all ports of call in Mexico.
 ''It is not necessarily the risk'' to the passengers, Cynthia Martinez, a spokesperson for Royal Caribbean Cruises, said. ''It's more about whether our guests feel comfortable visiting Mexico.'' 
 Hotel occupancy in Cancun dropped from 77 percent the day the alert began on April 24 to 42 percent by the end of the month. By the end of last week, it was down to about 23 percent, said Marisa Setien, the executive director of the Cancun Hotel Association. 
 ''We did not think it would be that bad, but it was a chain reaction,'' she said.
 Health authorities have confirmed about 1,360 cases of the new influenza virus and 45 deaths in Mexico. The vast majority of the cases have been concentrated in Mexico City and the surrounding suburbs, far from tourist resorts on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. 
 Hotel occupancy in Mexico City fell to about 10 percent as the city shut down. The city's tourism secretary, Alejandro Rojas-Diaz, estimates that the city is losing $10 million a day.
 But he argues that the tough line the city took against the illness, closing restaurants for a week and most other entertainment, including bars and soccer stadiums, for even longer, will ultimately pay off in credibility. 
 ''We have told the truth and when we tell the truth that the city is safe again, the world will believe us,'' Mr. Rojas-Diaz said. ''It will be squeaky clean.''
 That may be true, but travel agents in the United States say bargains will help. 
 Hotels, hoping to restore their occupancy rates, have dropped their prices sharply and that is reducing the prices of packages to Mexico, said Tim Mullen, senior president of Apple Vacations, a large agency near Philadelphia. 
 Compared with four weeks ago, packages are 70 percent cheaper for May and 50 percent cheaper for June, he said. There will be ''a bonanza of good deals this summer.''
 Mr. Mullen said the first rush of concern among vacationers had slowed. 
 ''This week, all of a sudden it became less ominous than what was reported,'' he said. ''Hopefully, it's a short-term blip on trips to Mexico.''
 The Cancun Hotel Association plans to work first with travel agents in Mexico to bring back Mexican tourists. When the global flu warnings are lifted, the association will begin working with tour operators in the United States and elsewhere.
 Oscar Fitch, the executive director of the Mexico Tourism Board, said that once the United States and other countries lift travel advisories to Mexico, Mexico will start a broad campaign to bring visitors back. ''The country is closed right now, not by us, but by everybody else,'' he said. 
 ''In a couple of weeks people are going to want to go back to Mexico,'' said Mike Trujillo, a travel agent in Santa Rosa, Calif. ''There were some great deals before this and there will be better deals now.''

HEADLINE: Twins In Finance And Folly

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 I can't tell you how many times I heard the words ''Glass-Steagall'' here this week. 
 ''Should we have a new Glass-Steagall?'' asked Liam Halligan, the chief economist with Prosperity Capital Management, a London-based asset manager, who also writes a weekly column for The Telegraph. He felt very strongly that the answer was yes.
 ''We'll see a Glass-Steagall-like environment,'' predicted Michael Spencer, the billionaire founder of ICAP, a large interdealer broker whose headquarters is in the City of London.
 ''We need to bring back Glass-Steagall,'' said Terry Smith, the chief executive of Tullett Prebon, another big interdealer broker. 
 Every time I heard the phrase, it caught me up short. Glass-Steagall, of course, was an American law passed during the Depression to separate investment banking and commercial banking. It was dismantled 66 years later, in 1999, because it was viewed by the American political establishment, starting with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, as an outmoded relic of an earlier age. Glass-Steagall never existed in Britain.
 And it wasn't just Glass-Steagall that kept coming up in conversations here. Londoners were conversant with the ins and outs of the stress tests and President Obama's recovery plan. They knew that Representative Barney Frank was busy reining in bonuses. They had opinions on how Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, was doing. No matter how much I pressed people to talk about how London was dealing with the financial crisis, they kept turning the conversation back to America. What kind of regulations were likely to emerge? Was the American banking system going to shrink? And so on.
 All of which served as a useful reminder that, for all the talk in recent years about whether the City of London was ''overtaking'' Wall Street as the world's financial capital, they have really become one and the same. All the big financial institutions operate in both places -- with surprisingly little distinction between what the London office does and what the United States office does. The financial products unit of the American International Group traded credit-default swaps in both Wilton, Conn., and London, for instance. 
 Hedge funds are as large a part of the financial world in the City of London as they are on Wall Street. Banks in London chased the same deals, hired the same traders and followed the same business practices as their American competitors. ''The right way of thinking about New York and London is that they are Siamese twins,'' said Martin Wolf, the economics columnist for The Financial Times. ''They were the same institutions doing the same things with the same set of regulations.'' 
 Which is why it is only natural that Londoners would be closely tracking America's response to the crisis -- and thinking about whether old laws like Glass-Steagall should be revived. Because it turns out that, having hitched its wagon to Wall Street more than a decade ago, the City of London cannot afford to untether itself. It simply has too much at stake.
 I had heard, before coming here, that the mood in London was darker than it is in New York, but I didn't really find that to be the case. Like us, Londoners are starting to wonder, ever so cautiously, whether the worst is over. People talked about consuming less conspicuously and saving more. Although plenty of financial executives have lost their jobs, I also met a man named Michael Tory, who went down with the ship at Lehman Brothers in London and has now co-founded a new advisory business, Ondra Partners. 
 ''There has been a profound inversion,'' he said. ''People have lost faith in the large firms, and now any start-up is viewed as lower risk.'' Well, maybe. Certainly, he was as optimistic as anyone I've met in finance this year. And there was still a lot of deal-making in the air.
 Whereas American anger is mostly reserved for the banking industry, the British are primarily angry at their politicians. People are dumbfounded at the risks their banks took, and stunned that some of them have needed huge government bailouts -- unlike with us, bank failure is almost completely foreign to their experience. 
 But they also feel the path to ruin was paved by the country's regulators. These days, the reputation of the former chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who presided over the bubble when Tony Blair was prime minister, is as tattered as that of Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman. The difference is that Mr. Greenspan is retired -- while Mr. Brown is the current prime minister.
 ''Since 1997, the City has been a metaphor for New Labor,'' said Philip Augar, author of ''Chasing Alpha,'' a book that chronicles the events that led to the financial crisis in London. (Labor took power in 1997.) At the time, he said, the asset management business was struggling, mired in a series of scandals, and there was fear in the City that Mr. Blair's Labor Party would make things worse. But that didn't happen.
 ''Gordon Brown instituted a lot of pro-City policies,'' Mr. Augar said. ''He cut the capital gains tax. He combined about nine different regulators into the F.S.A.'' -- the Financial Services Authority -- ''which adopted something it called 'proportional regulation.' '' Mr. Brown himself had a more apt phrase: ''light touch regulation,'' he called it. In other words, he consciously aligned regulation in Britain with the free-market, deregulatory approach being promoted by Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin.
 Mr. Augar says he believes that the regulatory environment helped bring about the ''Americanization'' of the City of London, and that it was ultimately ruinous. All the big American investment banks raced to London -- which they saw as a place to do business not just in Britain but all over the Continent. After the abolition of Glass-Steagall, the commercial banks came roaring in as well. 
 British banking had for hundreds of years been a safe, even stodgy business -- even during the Depression, banks remained relatively healthy. But in their desire to compete with the American invaders, banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland transformed themselves into turbo-charged, high-growth institutions, just like our own. They traded mortgage-backed securities, made unwise loans, did deals for the deal's sake and not necessarily for the sake of the client, and used credit-default swaps to lower regulatory capital requirements to absurd levels. Finance became the dog instead of the tail.
 Needless to say, not everyone agrees with Mr. Augar's thesis. A number of people pointed, in particular, to the Royal Bank of Scotland, which, in addition to its poor lending, did itself in by buying the Dutch bank giant ABN Amro at the very peak of the market. ''Was Royal Bank of Scotland buying ABN an example of the American disease?'' asked Alan Gemes, the global head of financial services for the consulting firm Booz & Company. ''No. American banks and U.K. banks fell prey to the same problem.''
 But I would argue that, even if there weren't any Americans on the premises, the Royal Bank of Scotland did indeed get caught up in the Americans' game. The ABN Amro deal sounds to me just like the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch deal. Had the ethos of the City of London not changed so drastically, it would never have made so foolish a deal.
 Now, of course, Britain is paying the price. The Royal Bank of Scotland has been partly nationalized, and the government has spent billions of pounds propping up the banking system. The country is drowning in debt. Mr. Brown's Labor government is running large deficits in an effort to stimulate the economy.
 If that, too, sounds like the response of the Obama administration to the financial crisis, it is indeed quite similar. Here's the big difference. New York is a big city in a big country, and our national banks, as big as they are, are much smaller as a percentage of gross domestic product. London is a big city in a small country, and during the bubble, its banks became truly immense, outsize really, given the size of the country they operated in. 
 Royal Bank of Scotland grew from a regional Scottish bank to the largest bank in the world by assets -- some $3.8 trillion. Citigroup's assets, by comparison, were a ''mere'' $2.2 trillion -- and for that matter, the gross domestic product of all of Britain itself is only $2.1 trillion. The big banks combined probably had five times the asset base of the country's G.D.P. 
 So everything the government does in response to the crisis has larger potential consequences -- a greater likelihood of inflation down the line, and a far higher level of debt as a percentage of G.D.P. Because the City of London was such an outsize source of tax revenue, the subsequent hit to the tax rolls has been worse. British taxpayers are much more likely to be paying for generations to atone for the sins of light-touch regulation. No wonder Mr. Brown is in so much political trouble.
 Which brings me back to Glass-Steagall. In any banking crisis, said Mr. Gemes, the Booz & Company consultant, banks revert to being national institutions rather than international ones. In the United States, the political focus, for instance, is on persuading banks to start lending to American companies. In London, the big British banks have all tempered their once grandiose ambitions, at least for now.
 But Glass-Steagall? It is highly unlikely that Britain would ever take such a drastic step. Just a few days ago, Barclays reported profits that were almost entirely attributable to its new investment banking division -- the one it bought from the ashes of Lehman Brothers. Besides, although no one will say this out loud, Britain can't regulate unilaterally anymore -- it is simply too dependent on American institutions. Its regulatory response will be to mimic whatever the Obama administration decides to do.
 ''If regulation is transformed in London it is because of what the U.S. does,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''The U.S. will say, 'You are to follow us.' We now have no regulatory autonomy.''
 It's tough being a Siamese twin.

Oh, how he loves that Lady.
 Give Don Oral 30 seconds and he'll wax poetic about the grace and meaning of the Statue of Liberty for a city of immigrants. As a teenager in 1966, Mr. Oral hiked the 168 steps to her crown on a summer camp field trip. His recollection is enthusiastic, even if his details are suggestive of the Bataan Death March.
 ''It's like 114 degrees in there, O.K., and someone's behind is in your face,'' said Mr. Oral, 56, who now lives in Bayside, Queens, and works for the city. ''Up a step, stop. Up a step, stop. I loved it, really.'' 
 O.K., Mr. Oral, so you would do it again? 
 He paused, then asked, ''You're saying with or without a doctor's note?''
 Pull your schlepping shoes out of the closet. With great fanfare, the Obama administration announced on Friday that the Statue of Liberty's crown, closed to the public since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, would reopen this summer. Unveiled in 1886 after being shipped across the Atlantic from France in 214 vast crates, the copper-clad Lady Liberty has drawn tens of millions of visitors over the decades, although for the last eight years none have climbed the staircase to the crown. 
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar was buoyant Friday about the reopening of this aerie. ''On July 4, we are giving New York a special gift,'' he said on the ''Today'' show, which broadcast from inside the crown. ''The economic times we're going through really call for hope and optimism.''
 So, in just eight short weeks, thousands of peripatetic children and perspiring parents and elderly aunts from Omaha who drew the short straw on their trip to New York will once again be able to work their way up the low-railed and vertiginous, not-so-slightly claustrophobic, 12-story-high stairway to her crown.
 Where they can peer through small windows at New York Harbor for a few minutes before beginning a steep descent.
 That the lady of the harbor is an iconic beauty is beyond quarrel. The faraway sight of her torch can bring even a jaded native to a halt. And there was something diminishing, even galling, about the Bush administration's decision to close off the innards of this international symbol of freedom's possibility. (Officials then argued that there was no safe way to reopen the stairway, given the lack of a second exit route in case of emergency.) 
 It is also an indisputable victory for Representative Anthony Weiner, the perpetually insistent Queens Democrat, who turned public access to the crown into a crusade.
 And yet, as iconic hikes go, this one might draw a shudder from even a field-trip-hardened third-grade teacher. The potential for accidents is reasonably high; the potential for tantrums is more or less off the charts. (This correspondent recalls the precise moment his mother ended a July ascent: She gazed at a young son and two daughters expertly torturing one another and at a line that stretched endlessly up; that way, she knew, lay madness).
 Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, recalled his childhood ramble to the crown as a city kid's rite of passage.
 ''That's back when I could fit up that narrow staircase,'' said Mr. Moss, now 60-something and perhaps no longer so svelte. ''The Statue of Liberty, like a lot of old icons, is pretty hot and really not made for modern tourism, which is very antiseptic.''
 Ten people will be allowed to occupy the crown at a time; 30 visitors an hour will be expected to walk through. Park officials estimate that 50,000 people will be able to visit in the first year, and 100,000 would be allowed to troop through the following year as security protocols are adjusted. 
 Their predecessors had long put a dour cast on any suggested reopening. To climb the spiral staircase, Daniel Wenk, deputy director of the National Park Service, told Congress in 2007, is dangerous and a ''difficult feat even for people in excellent health and under ideal conditions.'' (This might surprise the millions of underexercised, wide-beamed Americans who nonetheless managed to plant two sneakered feet on the crown's landing in hazy humidity). 
 Mr. Wenk then invoked a host of apocalyptic fires, from the Triangle shirtwaist factory in Washington Square in 1911 to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Boston in 1942. Three years earlier, Larry Parkinson, an assistant secretary at Interior, went a step or three further, suggesting that memories of the tortuous hike up the statue, perhaps not least his own, were imaginary.
 ''Most of us think we went to the crown; a lot of us didn't,'' he told The New York Times in 2004. ''I thought I went to the crown, and I hadn't.''
 Mr. Oral works in billing for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, and his days are long and he is not young, but he is quite positive that his boyhood trek was real. And despite the sweat and more or less constant views of derrieres, he is ready for another shot at the sea-washed Mother of Exiles. 
 ''You know, my memory may play tricks, but I remember that view,'' he said. ''And to take my grandkids or whatever up there? I like it high and like it beautiful, and that's that statue.''

HEADLINE: At 8.9%, Unemployment Still Rises, but Pace Slows

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The American job market remains dreadful and is still worsening, but at a slower pace than before -- good news given the stomach-churning events of recent months. The government's monthly employment report buoyed hopes that the longest, most punishing recession since the Great Depression may be relenting.
 Another 539,000 jobs disappeared from the economy in April, and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.9 percent, its highest level in a quarter century, the Labor Department reported Friday. Yet the deterioration was milder than expected, prompting encouraging talk.
 ''The most intense spate of weakness is probably behind us,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at the research and trading firm MKM Partners. ''Less bad is always a prelude to good. It's going to take some time for this economy to get back on its feet, but we might be closer to the recession ending.'' 
 Investors bought into that message, sending stock prices soaring. 
 A day after the Treasury pronounced American banks healthier than many analysts had anticipated, the jobs report presented the clearest evidence yet that the nation's economic free fall appears to have been arrested. The acute shock that began last fall with the collapse of the prominent investment bank Lehman Brothers has largely passed. Panic is no longer the dominant motif of American commercial life.
 ''It's a confirmation that we're in the early stages of a turn,'' said Ethan Harris, one of the chiefs of United States economic research at Barclays Capital. ''We're getting further and further removed from the confidence shock of last fall.''
 But others emphasized that the easing of dire worries, while positive, says nothing about the economy regaining vigor. Crisis may have merely given way to something more ordinary, yet still miserable for tens of millions of people: a continued slog through recession, with demand for goods and services weak and jobs hard to find.
 ''This is really horrible in any normal context,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''This isn't recovery. It's a slowing recession. In any other time other than the recession we're in, we'd be appalled by these numbers.''
 The numbers for April looked good only by comparison with recent months, with February's net job loss revised up to 681,000, from 651,000, and March's net losses revised up to 699,000, from 663,000. The rise in the unemployment rate, from 8.5 percent in March, was mostly because more people began seeking jobs who had not previously been looking for work. 
 The report for April reflected a moderate slowdown in the pace of layoffs, but not an inclination among businesses to hire. The April tally was helped by a surge of government hiring ahead of the Census, while private-sector payrolls dipped by 611,000. 
 Businesses are expected to cut an additional two million jobs before the economy begins growing again and the unemployment rate ebbs, probably sometime in 2010. 
 ''We're still in the midst of a recession that was years in the making and will be months or even years in the unmaking,'' President Obama said Friday morning, as he announced the expansion of programs to retrain laid-off workers for new careers. ''We should expect further job losses in the months to come.''
 Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said her department was moving to release $750 million to retrain workers in faster-growing areas of the economy like health care, technology and renewable energy.
 ''There's a lot of people who lost jobs where those jobs are not coming back,'' said Ms. Solis, pointing to the auto industry and other areas of manufacturing.
 The labor market is a lagging indicator, economists note, meaning it tends to improve after other parts of the economy. But it is of greatest import to ordinary people -- particularly now.
 After years of borrowing against soaring home values and tapping credit cards to spend in excess of incomes, millions of Americans are being forced to live on their paychecks. Yet, since the recession began in December 2007, 5.7 million jobs have disappeared. Wage growth has flattened in recent months. This limits the spending needed to generate demand for goods and services, along with more employees at factories, shopping malls and offices.
 ''We're seeing fewer people employed, and those who are employed aren't seeing their earnings power increase,'' said Mr. Baker. ''It's tough to see where a recovery can come from.''
 Those holding more optimistic outlooks focus on the government-led initiatives to stimulate the economy. A $787 billion spending and tax cut package is beginning to wash through the economy. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury have been pouring money into mortgage markets and other areas, bringing down the costs of borrowing.
 ''You have monetary and fiscal stimulus the likes of which the world has never seen,'' said Mr. Darda.
 The question is whether new job losses will overwhelm the benefits of the stimulus spending. Lost wages combined with continued declines in real estate prices could put millions more Americans behind on their mortgages, leaving banks counting fresh losses and prompting them to tighten credit again. That might blunt recovery and exacerbate joblessness. The next few months should clarify whether the Obama administration's initiatives are enough to avert that.
 The latest jobs report serves as a catalogue of household grief. Manufacturing jobs declined by 149,000, employment in professional and business services dropped by 122,000 and construction shed 110,000 jobs. Finance and insurance shrank by 25,000 jobs. Health care added 17,000 jobs, and government payrolls expanded by 72,000.
 The unemployment rate reached 15 percent among African-Americans, 21.5 percent for teenagers, and 9.4 percent for adult men.
 Those figures do not count the 8.9 million people now working part time because their hours have been cut or they have failed to land full-time jobs. When they are counted along with those who have given up looking for jobs, the so-called underemployment rate reaches 15.8 percent -- up from 9.2 percent a year ago.
 Among the jobless, 27.2 percent were unemployed for more than six months, the highest figure since the government began tracking such data in 1948.
 Catherine Morse of East Mesa, Ariz., is among those suffering. She has been seeking work since she lost her job as a building company administrator six months ago. She has been living on her savings, now dwindling.
 ''I've been looking every day,'' she said. ''I haven't been getting anything.''
 Businesses will almost surely take a timid approach to hiring, say economists. .
 ''We're headed for an unemployment rate above 10 percent,'' said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, adding that the rate ''will stay high for quite a while.''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Drop Again

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers fell in March for the seventh consecutive month after a record drop in February, as distributors focused on eliminating excess supply from their shelves. 
 Stockpiles fell 1.6 percent, the Commerce Department said Friday in Washington. A revised 1.7 percent decrease in February was bigger than previously estimated. Still, sales plunged 2.4 percent to the lowest level since 2005.
 Companies are cutting back production and spending to winnow stockpiles built up as a result of reduced demand both in the United States and abroad. The economy shrank 6.1 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a record slump in inventories that may set the stage for a return to growth later this year.
 At the current sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for distributors to deplete the amount of goods on hand, compared with 1.31 months in February.
 Inventories at wholesalers were forecast to drop 1 percent after an initially reported 1.5 percent decrease in February, according to the median estimate of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Projections ranged from a decline of 1.8 percent to an increase of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Money Shortage Forces Cut In Cases to Be Prosecuted

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Malia Wollan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
When the district attorney in suburban Contra Costa County, Robert J. Kochly, announced last month that he would stop prosecuting certain misdemeanors for lack of money, the resulting outcry was enough to make him cut his own salary to avoid putting the plan in place. 
 But Mr. Kochly -- who agreed to a 10 percent pay cut -- is not the only local prosecutor who has floated extreme solutions in a time of dwindling budgets and increased caseloads. 
 District attorneys in many parts of the country say they are considering prosecutorial rollbacks, including opting not to try some minor crimes, eliminating crime prevention and monitoring programs, and seeking to divert more defendants to so-called community court systems. 
 The reason: not enough money to pay lawyers to try all those crimes. 
 ''Understaffing is always a problem, and when you talk about cutbacks on top of that it just compounds the problem,'' said Christopher D. Chiles, the prosecuting attorney in Cabell County, W.Va., and the president-elect of the National District Attorneys Association.
 In Sacramento County, District Attorney Jan Scully drafted a ''doomsday scenario'' last month to deal with a looming $20 million budget shortfall. Her memorandum, first published by The Sacramento Bee, suggests a variety of misdemeanors could go unprosecuted, including crimes like petty theft, public drunkenness and minor drug possession. Misdemeanor vehicle theft, child abuse, domestic violence, and resisting arrest, meanwhile, would be subject to ''a case-by-case analysis.'' 
 ''When you're talking about $20 million you have to have a reality-check,'' Ms. Scully said. ''And this is the reality.'' 
 In Oregon, which faces a bulging budget deficit over the next two years, several prosecutors have said that something must give. For instance, the district attorney in Marion County, south of Portland, has cut back on prosecutions of crimes inside correctional facilities.
 ''It's about prioritization,'' said the district attorney, Walter M. Beglau, who runs an office of 34 lawyers filing nearly 15,000 criminal counts a year. ''It's like a MASH unit: you take the most serious cases.'' 
 As jarring as the proposals can seem, no prosecutor has suggested that felonies go untried, and many of the offenses that are being downgraded in importance have long been low priorities for prosecutors. 
 ''The notion that we prosecute all crimes for which we have probable cause is absurd,'' said Robert Weisberg, professor of law and the director of Stanford Criminal Justice Center.
 Still, the specificity and seriousness with which some prosecutors are spelling out the kind of cases that would go unpunished has unsettled local officials. 
 In Contra Costa County, for example, Mr. Kochly startled the county Board of Supervisors when he issued a memorandum outlining a number of drug offenses -- including possession of up to a gram of cocaine or methamphetamine -- that would not be pursued. Trespass, loitering, simple assault or battery, and nonalcohol-related traffic offenses were also on the chopping block, according to Mr. Kochly, who was facing the prospect of layoffs of several prosecutors. 
 ''We have a very anxious public, a very concerned public,'' Gayle B. Uilkema, a county supervisor, said at a meeting last week. ''A bordering-on-frightened public.'' 
 Some of which, Professor Weisberg said, may have been the point. He said some prosecutors were no doubt using the threat of untried crimes as a way to squeeze more money out of legislators, though prosecutors say that is not the case. 
 ''That's just not how I do business,'' said Ms. Scully of Sacramento County. 
 In some cities, the budget cuts are coming at a particularly unfortunate time, as the recession appears to have contributed to a spike in crime and federal stimulus money is putting more police officers on the street. In Dallas, Criminal District Attorney Craig Watkins has been fighting a proposed 10 percent cut in his budget, even as he says crime has increased in some areas and more police officers are expected to make more arrests. 
 ''My question to the commissioners is when they hire all those new officers and make all those new cases, what difference does it make if we can't prosecute them?'' Mr. Watkins said. 
 Many prosecutors also fear that allowing minor or quality-of-life crimes to slide might encourage more serious offenses in the future. 
 ''That's why this is so difficult,'' Mr. Kochly said. ''There weren't really any good choices.''

HEADLINE: Eat Quickly, for the Economy's Sake

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
IF you eat rapidly, will your economy grow the same way?
 Unlikely as it may seem, data released this week seems to indicate that the answer is yes. The relationship is not perfect, but it is persistent. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes leading developed countries, released a study about the living conditions of its members. The data included survey results in 17 of the countries regarding the amount of time each day people spent eating and drinking.
 To no one's surprise, France followed the most leisurely schedule of dining; those surveyed reported they spent an average of 135 minutes each day. The fastest eaters were in North America; the United States, Canada and Mexico were the only three nations to report fewer than 75 minutes a day devoted to eating and drinking.
 As the accompanying chart shows, the 10 countries where people spend less than 100 minutes eating and drinking each day have, as a group, consistently shown higher economic growth than those that took more than 100 minutes to savor their daily repasts.
 Last year, as recession spread around the world, real gross domestic product in countries that ate rapidly fell by an average of 1.2 percent. Those that ate more slowly suffered an average decline of 2 percent. Moreover, the fast countries did better in every year from 2001 to 2008.
 The relationship persists within regions. All four of the Western European countries whose people eat relatively rapidly -- Britain, Finland, Norway and Sweden -- showed average economic growth of 2 percent or better over the eight years. Of the five Western European nations whose people ate more slowly, only Spain grew that rapidly. The others -- Germany, France, Italy and Belgium -- showed compound growth rates of 1.5 percent or less.
 Similarly, New Zealand, with slow eaters, grew at an average rate of 2.8 percent a year, while the faster eaters in Australia produced a 3.1 percent growth rate. South Korea, with faster eaters, grew at an average rate of 3.8 percent. Japan, which favors a more leisurely approach to dining, grew just 0.8 percent a year.
 Correlation does not prove causation, of course. There are cultural factors at work, and the picture could change if there were data from more countries. Certainly eating habits alone do not determine economic growth.
 Even if there is a relationship, it is not obvious which is cause and which effect. Do people spend more time eating because they have less to do in economies that are not growing? Or do economies stumble because people are savoring a glass of wine when they should be working?
 The O.E.C.D. also provided data on obesity. The correlations there were not as strong, but there is some evidence that expanding waistlines come with expanding economies. 
 On average, the five countries in the survey with the least obesity -- South Korea, Japan, Norway, Italy and France -- grew at a slower average rate in each of the eight years than did the five countries with the most obesity -- the United States, Mexico, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
 Such correlations may be nothing but coincidence, of course. But if the relations indicated by the data are genuine, a contribution to world growth is rendered by any institution that enables people to eat rapidly and gain weight. Take a bow, McDonald's.

HEADLINE: Toward Fair Lending

 BODY:
The predatory lending bill that passed the House on Thursday is less than what is needed, but it does fix at least some of the abuses and risky lending practices that got the economy and the country into the current mess. 
 The Senate needs to improve on the legislation and ensure that stronger reforms quickly become law. To do that, senators will finally have to stand up to the mortgage industry and its all-too-well-paid lobbyists. 
 In the years before the crash, brokers, appraisers and lenders conspired to herd borrowers into risky, high-cost mortgages that many could never hope to repay. The lenders took their profits off the top -- with ruinous fees -- then repackaged the suspect loans and sold them to Wall Street. The rest is history.
 The House bill takes several steps aimed at restoring sound lending practices. First off, it requires lenders to take into account the borrower's ability to repay the debt. It prohibits prepayment penalties for adjustable-rate mortgages. It wisely builds in better protections for renters, who are often thrown into the streets when buildings are foreclosed -- even when the rent has been paid faithfully for years.
 And it bans one of the most common forms of kickbacks that brokers often get for steering borrowers into higher priced loans. 
 When the Senate comes up with its own version -- and it should do so quickly -- it should correct that and other weaknesses in the one passed by the House. 
 The House bill, for example, provides only a slap on the wrist to lenders that violate the law. It also coddles Wall Street companies -- which encourage unscrupulous lending by buying up risky loans -- by limiting the conditions under which they can be sued by borrowers.
 The way to discourage irresponsible lending is to hold liable both the mortgage originators and the companies to which they sell their sometimes illegal loans. The risk of being hauled into court would make secondary investors more careful and build accountability into the securitization system.
 The House bill also fails to address the problem of federal regulations that pre-empt state laws that may impose stronger penalties and remedies. Federal regulations should be a floor, not a ceiling, in lending. Millions of Americans have lost their homes, neighborhoods have been destroyed and the country's financial system has been brought to the very brink of disaster. Does Congress really need to know more before it finally fixes these rules?

HEADLINE: Unemployment May Be Hazardous to Your Health

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Even as the U.S. Labor Department released figures showing that the economy lost more than half a million jobs in April, researchers on Friday made public a large study with an unsettling finding: Losing your job may make you sick. 
 A researcher at the Harvard School of Public analyzed detailed employment and health data from 8,125 individuals surveyed in 1999, 2001 and 2003 by the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
Workers who lost a job through no fault of their own, she found, were twice as likely to report developing a new ailment like high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease over the next year and a half, compared to people who were continuously employed.
 Interestingly, the risk was just as high for those who found new jobs quickly as it was for those who remained unemployed. 
 Though it's long been known that poor health and unemployment often go together, questions have lingered about whether unemployment triggers illness, or whether people in ill health are more likely to leave a job, be fired or laid off. 
 In an attempt to sort out this chicken-or-egg problem, the new study looked specifically at people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- for example, because of a plant or business closure.
 ''I was looking at situations in which people lost their job for reasons that...shouldn't have had anything to do with their health,'' said author Kate W. Strully, an assistant professor of sociology at State University of New York in Albany, who did the research as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation scholar at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''What happens isn't reflecting a prior condition.''
 Only 6 percent of people with steady jobs developed a new health condition during each survey period of about a year and a half, compared with 10 percent of those who had lost a job during the same period. It didn't matter whether the laid off workers had found new employment; they still had a one in 10 chance of developing a new health condition, Dr. Strully found.
 David Williams, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who was not involved in the research, said the study is a reminder that job loss and other life stressors have a tremendous impact on both mental and physical health and contribute to the development of chronic conditions. 
 ''We know that stress affects health,'' said Dr. Williams, formerly director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier America. ''It causes changes in physiological function in multiple ways, and it can lead to alterations in health behavior. People no longer exercise, they eat more, they drink more. People who smoke, smoke more on high stress days.'' 
 ''There is a lot of focus on the economic downturn, but there is not much attention being paid to the health consequences of the downturn,'' he added. ''This study shows that it does not take a long sustained period of unemployment to see health effects.''

HEADLINE: 2 Banks Cited In Stress Tests Find Investors

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Eric Dash, Catherine Rampell and Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Finally, it was a moment for the banks to de-stress.
 A day after the bank stress tests were released, two major institutions, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, handily raised billions of dollars in the capital markets on Friday to satisfy new federal demands for more capital. A third, Bank of America, hastily laid out plans to sell billions of dollars in new stock.
 The speed and ease with which the banks swung into action, combined with a surge in financial shares, was hailed as a sign that confidence was returning to the financial industry. The sales seemed to put to rest questions about whether big banks would be able to lure private investors, rather than have to turn to the government again. 
 Before the results were made public, many of the larger banks successfully pushed the government to minimize the capital they needed to raise.
 While the results of the tests on 19 major banks, released by the administration on Thursday, were far more positive than many had expected, they nevertheless created an immediate urgency for 10 banks to raise new capital. Federal regulators ordered them to raise a combined $75 billion to buffer their potential losses. 
 With some off to such a rapid start -- Goldman Sachs raised $5 billion before the stress test results were announced -- the race is now on among the most robust to repay the government money they received last fall and so escape from government control. 
 But while the mood was generally buoyant among these leaders, others still have to spell out how they will raise money -- or accept further federal aid. 
 GMAC, the onetime finance arm of General Motors, was deemed by the regulators to need an extra $11.5 billion in capital. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner indicated that this was likely to have to come from the government and that the administration would stand behind GMAC.
 The stress tests estimated how much each bank would lose if the economic downturn proved even deeper than currently expected: under the worst-case assumptions, with a jobless rate of 10.3 percent, the losses by the 19 banks could total $600 billion.
 On Friday, economic data showed the American economy lost a further 539,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate leapt to 8.9 percent -- a sign that the United States might already be heading toward the worst case, although the job losses were less than Wall Street expected. 
 Despite the sobering outlook, the mood on Wall Street was generally upbeat after the rosier-than-expected assessment of the biggest banks. The stock market climbed, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 2.4 percent on Friday. 
 ''If there were holes in this, the market would have seen it,'' said Stuart Plesser, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Citigroup, Bank of America, PNC Financial, Wells Fargo and several other big lenders spent more than a week disputing the regulators' early findings, arguing that they were stronger than regulators believed, according to people briefed on the exams. The more capital the banks needed, the greater the chance they would end up diluting their existing shareholders. 
 Of particular concern were several assumptions that regulators made in administering the tests, like the timing and severity of losses on mortgages, credit card, and commercial real estate loans. Regulators also initially took a dim view on earnings, basing their projections on depressed 2008 year results. The banks, citing their strong first-quarter results, thought their prospects were much brighter. 
 To help bridge the gap, regulators decided to allow banks to offset capital shortfall with any locked-in gains from asset sales as well as profits that were better than the government projected for the first quarter, people briefed on the talks said. 
 The banks will also be able to get credit for extraordinary second- and third-quarter profits. 
 In the capital-raising exercises, Wells Fargo sold $7.5 billion of common stock; regulators ruled it needed to fill a capital hole of $13.7 billion. 
 Morgan Stanley raised $8 billion by selling $4 billion in common stock and $4 billion in bonds. It increased the total amount it raised compared with its initial plans by $3 billion because of strong investor demand, it said. Regulators had declared that the investment bank needed to raise money to fill a $1.8 billion hole. 
 In an important signal of its future intentions, Morgan Stanley raised its debt without the guarantee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- a show of strength that is one of the government's requirements for paying back money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which are also eager to repay TARP funds, have gone through similar exercises.
 Bank of America, judged one of the weaker institutions, registered its intention to sell 1.25 billion common shares over the coming weeks. At Friday's closing stock price, that amount of stock would be valued at nearly $18 billion, which means the bank might not have to turn to another possible means of raising money like converting preferred shares into common equity.
 Citigroup was told by regulators that it must raise $5.5 billion, in addition to its recent efforts to raise capital by selling businesses and converting to common stock just over half of the $45 billion of its preferred stock held by the government.
 On Friday, Vikram S. Pandit, Citi's chief executive, held a town hall meeting at Citigroup's investment banking offices in New York, where he told staff members the test results had validated his strategy of righting the company.
 But Meredith A. Whitney, a prominent banking analyst, said the results underscored the difficulties banks faced. 
 ''The revenue environment is very different,'' Ms. Whitney said. Given the recession, banks are not going to make much money from credit cards or originating mortgages, she said. And even if all the banks secured more capital, they still might not lend, holding back the economy. 
 Some analysts are now saying that some of the assumptions even in the worst-case situation may turn out to be too optimistic. 
 Given this, attention is now turning to the thousands of smaller banks elsewhere in the country and whether they will be able to survive any deterioration in economic conditions. Mr. Plesser said that these banks would face extra capital needs and that consolidations might occur.
 ''It's not the same urgency as the big 19, but I think we are going to see needs for additional capital, and one way to get that is to be swallowed up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: More States Using GPS to Track Abusers and Stalkers

BYLINE: By ARIANA GREEN

DATELINE: NEWBURYPORT, Mass. 

 BODY:
When Theresa, a 51-year-old mother of two living near this coastal town, filed for a restraining order against her husband, she thought it would help put an end to the beatings, death threats and stalking that had tormented her family for years.
 She won the order, but her husband, Joel, a West Point graduate with a master's degree who police reports say hid 17 guns in their home, did not seem to care. He violated the restraining order three times, she said. 
 ''He'd come to our child's school and beat both of us up in front of everyone,'' Theresa said. 
 In Massachusetts, where about one-quarter of restraining orders are violated each year, according to the state's probation office, a recent law has expanded the use of global positioning devices to include domestic abusers and stalkers who have violated orders of protection. A judge ordered Joel to wear a Global Positioning System monitor, alerting law enforcement officials if he went near his wife's house, her work or their children's school.
 ''It was the first time I could turn my house alarm off and feel O.K.,'' said Theresa, who has since been divorced and who insisted that only her first name be used, to protect her children's privacy. 
 Twelve other states have passed similar legislation -- most recently, Indiana this week -- and about 5,000 domestic abusers are being tracked nationwide, said George Drake, who oversees Colorado's Electronic Monitoring Resource Center, which gathers data from equipment vendors. 
 But the path to the system's widespread use has been bumpy. It is still hard to protect families who live in rural areas or where there are not enough police officers to respond quickly. With the economic downturn, states have cut money for training the police and judges in GPS use, and some places with legislation in place say they cannot afford it. 
 It is up to a judge, in cases of extreme violence, to decide whether to order its use before trial, as a condition of bail or as a sentence. That has led to complaints by the American Civil Liberties Union and others of too much leeway for judges. 
 ''Until they know how GPS can be used and how successful it can be, judges are reluctant to order it because it's unfamiliar,'' said Judge Peter Doyle of Newburyport District Court. ''Without seminars and convincing presentations, I wouldn't have been comfortable ordering it.'' 
 The scope of stalking was revealed in a study released by the Justice Department in January, which found that 3.4 million people had been subjected to stalking over a one-year period. As this week's fatal shooting of a Wesleyan University student showed -- the victim, Johanna Justin-Jinich, 21, told the authorities two years ago that the suspect, Stephen P. Morgan, had repeatedly sent harassing e-mail messages -- stalking often includes sending threats online and lurking outside homes, offices and schools. Often the only way victims can prove that they are being stalked, experts say, is through new technologies like GPS. 
 Newburyport, a city of 17,000 about 35 miles north of Boston, has been a testing ground for some of the most effective training programs in preventing domestic abuse.
 Kelly Dunne, associate director of the Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center here, has helped seven other cities follow the model of the Greater Newburyport High Risk Response Team, which brings together police officers, district attorneys, probation officers and others to decide which domestic violence cases should be recommended for GPS monitoring. Last year, her group trained over 1,000 advocates, prosecutors and officials from other states, alerting them to the danger signs in offenders' behavior.
 Experts say the program can help save lives. Domestic-violence-related homicides increased 300 percent in Massachusetts from 2005 to 2007, according to Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, while in Newburyport, where a High Risk Team was in place, there were no such homicides in that period. 
 ''Using GPS monitoring to enforce an order of protection makes the order more than just a piece of paper,'' said Diane Rosenfeld, a lecturer at Harvard Law School and a longtime advocate of using GPS in domestic abuse cases. ''It's a way of making the criminal justice system treat domestic violence as potentially serious. By detecting any escalation in the behavior of a batterer, GPS can prevent these unnecessary tragedies.'' 
 Ms. Rosenfeld's research found that about one quarter of women who were killed by their domestic abusers already had restraining orders.
 Alexis A. Moore, 34, founder of Survivors in Action, a nonprofit organization for crime victims, said that her former partner had violated a restraining order more than 30 times over four years, but that she had no way of proving it. She said he had slashed her tires, lurked outside her home and harassed her online. She said California lawmakers had told her there was no money to pay for GPS monitoring where she lives, although legislation allowed for it.
 ''My stalker continues to make a game of getting away with restraining order violations -- because he can,'' Ms. Moore said.
 In Massachusetts, about 100 people accused of domestic abuse are monitored by GPS. They are charged $8 a day for a cellphone-like device that clips to a belt, an ankle bracelet and a home charger. Their movements are monitored by three control centers, and if they break an ''exclusion zone'' around the victim or her children, the police are notified. 
 Tracey Mutz, 43, who works in sales in Louisiana, said she was raped at gunpoint by her former boyfriend, a sheriff's deputy who is currently on GPS monitoring while awaiting trial. ''I don't think GPS is enough to keep us safe,'' Ms. Mutz said. ''Five women have come out in public about his abuse.'' 
 Violent abusers can always remove their GPS monitors, as Theresa's former husband did in Massachusetts.
 After being a fugitive for eight months, Joel was caught and began a yearlong prison sentence in March. Theresa, who now has a permanent restraining order, said she wanted GPS monitoring ordered for him when he is released. 
 ''I'm hoping next time that he will be too scared of being caught to take it off,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Con Edison Seeks 3-Year Rate Increase

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Con Edison submitted plans to state regulators on Friday that would increase monthly electricity bills in 2010 by as much as $8 for typical residential customers. 
 The utility submitted the proposal just over two weeks after the regulators approved a one-year increase in rates of about $6 for typical residential customers in New York, part of a plan to raise revenue by about $523.4 million. 
 Critics of the first increase said it was too excessive during a recession, while Con Edison said $523.4 million would not be enough -- the reason the utility is now asking for increases in each of the next three years.
 In its latest plan, the utility offered two scenarios. The first called for a three-year delivery rate that would raise an additional $695 million annually. The utility said that a typical residential customer paying $83.60 a month would experience a $6.48 increase, or roughly 7.8 percent, in each of the three years. A business paying about $15,744 a month would face an increase of about $751, or just under 5 percent, the utility said. 
 Under the second scenario, the rate increase would change every year. Con Edison would seek to raise revenue by $854 million in the first year, $462 million in the second and $391 million in the third. As a result, the agency said, a typical residential customer paying $83.60 a month would see an increase of about $8, or 9.6 percent, in the first year, while a business paying $15,744 a month would pay an extra $942, or roughly 6 percent. 
 The proposal is likely to be debated and draw scrutiny from consumer groups, local municipalities and state regulators in a review process that could last close to a year.

HEADLINE: Slump Revives Town-Gown Divide Across U.S.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The rats are out in spades this spring in North Allston, a gritty neighborhood wedged between the Charles River and the Massachusetts Turnpike, and residents are blaming Harvard.
 Harvard had big plans to expand its campus into Allston with a science complex. But last winter, the university announced that the recession would force it to slow -- perhaps even halt -- the $1 billion project. Now Allston residents are living with a gaping hole and a bunch of vacant buildings instead of the prospect of a revitalized neighborhood. 
 They are not alone in feeling burned by a university. As endowments everywhere sink with the economy, town-gown relationships, often carefully nurtured during the boom years as colleges and universities sought to expand, are fraying.
 ''We feel like we've been betrayed and taken advantage of,'' said Harry Mattison, a resident who serves on the Harvard Allston Task Force, an advisory group. ''Instead of Harvard bringing in jobs and excitement and vibrancy, we are sliding backwards.'' 
 Some cities and towns -- including Ann Arbor, Mich., Durham, N.C., and Princeton, N.J. -- have renewed calls for local colleges and universities to make voluntary payments to the communities because they have tax-exempt status.
 Others have proposed levying taxes on dorm rooms or even on students, whom they say use municipal services at the expense of property taxpayers.
 Response from the institutions has been frosty. 
 ''The recession will certainly keep private colleges in the crosshairs of policy makers looking to expand the tax base,'' said David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. ''However, it will be challenging to argue that an institution that has lost 20 to 30 percent of endowment value in the past six months, and is cutting millions from its budget, is overflowing with excess revenue.'' 
 In Boston, which already gets about $9 million a year in voluntary payments from 13 colleges and universities, Mayor Thomas M. Menino has asked a task force to study how to wring more revenue out of the institutions. 
 In Providence, R.I., Mayor David N. Cicilline has proposed charging students at the city's four private colleges and universities, including Brown, a ''municipal impact fee'' of $150 per semester. 
 And in Worcester, Mass., one elected official has gone so far as to propose a tax on dorm rooms, an idea that is gathering support as layoffs take place. 
 ''Police, fire, all the city services that colleges use are being cut,'' said City Councilor Michael J. Germain, who proposed the dorm tax. ''So now is the perfect time to go to the colleges and say, 'Hey, we need a little bit more.' This is a way to force their hand as far as I'm concerned.''
 Resentment runs especially deep in Allston, which had finally been warming to Harvard's expansion plan after years of opposition. In addition to the construction pit -- a five-acre foundation for the complex -- a string of vacant buildings that Harvard bought over the last 20 years but has failed to lease have also left residents fuming. 
 Harvard will finish building the foundation of the science complex in the coming months and then decide whether it can afford to continue, said Christine Heenan, the university's vice president for government, community and public affairs. 
 A halt in construction would require covering the 40-foot-deep foundation and addressing any other ''aesthetic or safety concerns.'' 
 Harvard's expansion plan has been in the works for years, but the science complex construction, begun early last year, has been the most concrete step. 
 Harvard even forced some tenants, like a Volkswagen dealership, out of buildings for which plans are now unclear. The university has always described the expansion as a 50-year project, but residents want it to take more proactive, short-term steps.
 ''The fair and just thing would be to have a 50-year plan but also a five-year plan,'' Mr. Mattison said. ''Let us have a thriving neighborhood now.'' 
 Harvard has continued smaller projects in Allston, like planting trees and starting a weekly farmer's market. But the scientists who were supposed to move into the new complex in 2011 will work elsewhere indefinitely.
 Meanwhile, finding the kind of tenants that residents want for the properties along Western Avenue -- like shops and cafes -- remains difficult, Ms. Heenan said.
 ''Even if you could have convinced someone to take a chance on a coffee or a sub shop 12 months ago,'' she said, ''they may now be looking at economic conditions that make that all the more challenging.'' 
 As for the neighborhood's rat problem, Ms. Heenan said the construction was not responsible. 
 In Providence, where city officials are predicting close to a $50 million budget deficit next year, Mr. Cicilline has been quietly meeting with local college and university students and presenting his proposal of charging them $150 per semester. The city must close a $17 million deficit before the fiscal year ends in June. 
 ''Look, this is a post-Obama generation,'' Mr. Cicilline said. ''At a time when our president is asking everyone to look in a collective way at our communities, there's value in asking young people to make a contribution to the collective well-being of the city they are a part of.''
 The private institutions already agreed in 2003 to pay a total $48 million to the city over 20 years. And students say they cannot afford the extra expense.
 ''We find it regressive and unfair and a little bit shortsighted,'' said Heather Lee, president of the Graduate Student Council at Brown. ''We provide a huge amount to the local economy throughout the year and to neglect that is not right.'' 
 Tensions have mounted in small towns, too. North Bennington, Vt., home to about 1,300 people, has asked Bennington College to donate $300,000 to the village over the next three years. 
 The college has offered $20,000 a year over five years, saying it is under too much strain to do more.
 Judith Rodin, the former president of the University of Pennsylvania who led an ambitious effort to remake the troubled neighborhood of West Philadelphia in the 1990s, said town-gown relationships should not have to slide backward now after all the recent investment. 
 ''The obligation is never more important than in difficult times,'' Ms. Rodin said. ''But so much of it relies on frequent, continuous, difficult communication -- the type that doesn't often occur during even the best of times.''
 ''There are ways of developing meaningful partnerships,'' she added, ''without putting up a building.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Saturday with an article about relations between colleges and their neighbors misstated the status of a new science complex for Harvard. The foundation of the building will be finished, then Harvard will decide whether it can afford to continue. The construction will not be ''suspended, leaving a gaping hole and empty buildings'' in the Allston neighborhood, the site of the project.

HEADLINE: Toyota Posts Annual Loss and Warns Another Is Ahead

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Company booked its first annual net loss in six decades Friday and warned that it would plunge even deeper into the red this year, a stunning reversal for an automaker whose breakneck expansion and record profits seemed unstoppable just 12 months ago.
 The automaker said it lost 765.8 billion yen, or $7.7 billion, in the first three months of the year -- even more than the $5.9 billion lost by its American rival, General Motors, in the same period. 
 The devastating numbers from the final quarter of the fiscal year contributed to a worse-than-expected net loss of 436.9 billion yen, or $4.4 billion, for the year that ended in March. It was Toyota's first annual net loss since 1950.
 The automaker warned it would lose another 550 billion yen, or $5.5 billion, this fiscal year. It cut its annual dividend by nearly 30 percent, its first cut to the dividend in at least 15 years.
 Toyota attributed its woes to the slump in global demand and a strong yen, which makes exports from Japan more expensive.
 ''It will take more time before the financial markets in the U.S. and Europe normalize and the global economy recovers,'' Toyota's president, Katsuaki Watanabe, said Friday. ''We were lacking in scope and speed in dealing with various problems and for that I am sorry.''
 The deep loss is a stark turnabout from the record profit of 1.72 trillion yen that Toyota booked the previous year. Annual sales slumped 22 percent, to 20.529 trillion yen.
 The loss also caps a roller-coaster year for Toyota, which in 2008 dethroned G.M. in terms of vehicles sold worldwide, a post the Detroit-based automaker had held for 77 years.
 Analysts say Toyota has strong cash reserves, and is far from the bankruptcy that has befallen the American carmaker Chrysler and that threatens General Motors.
 Still, Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, lowered its long-term credit rating on Toyota a notch to AA, the third-highest rating, on Friday and gave a negative outlook for the company.
 Toyota's latest forecast paints a grim picture for the year ahead. Toyota has been hit hard in its biggest market, the United States, where sales have plunged and show few signs of recovery.
 In April, Toyota sold 126,540 cars in the United States -- a 42 percent drop from a year earlier -- slipping behind Ford, which sold almost 130,000 cars.
 Toyota has also suffered double-digit percentage drops in Japan as well as in China, where it is losing out to rivals with a wider lineup of smaller cars that have surged in popularity.
 The company has said it expected its global unit sales to fall about 14 percent, to 6.5 million vehicles, in the year ending in March 2010.
 To cope with the slump, Toyota has made sharp production cuts across its 74 global assembly lines, laid off about 6,000 temporary workers in Japan and sharply cut pay for its managers.
 The company has so far held off from laying off permanent workers, who enjoy lifetime employment guarantees.
 Toyota is counting on its third-generation Prius hybrid, which will be unveiled this month in Japan, to buoy sales. But the automaker faces stiff competition from its Japanese rival, Honda Motor, whose low-cost Insight hybrid is expected to eat into Toyota's market share.
 The automaker is also rallying around its founding family, tapping Akio Toyoda, the company founder's grandson, to replace Mr. Watanabe next month.
 Mr. Toyoda has said he will focus on ''green'' technology like hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles.
 The automaker could benefit from Japanese stimulus efforts. Last month, officials introduced a so-called cash-for-clunkers program under which car owners who upgrade to cleaner, fuel-efficient vehicles from cars that are at least 13 years old will receive government subsidies.
 Toyota's numbers stand in contrast to its smaller rival, Honda, which lost $1.9 billion in the first three months of 2009 but eked out a net profit for the year that ended in March.

HEADLINE: City Begins Charging Rent to Working Homeless in Public Shelters

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN and ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has quietly begun charging rent to homeless families who live in publicly run shelters but have income from jobs.
 The new policy is based on a 1997 state law that was not enforced until last week, when shelter operators across the city began requiring residents to pay a certain portion of their income. The amount varies based on factors that include family size and what shelter is being used, but should not exceed 50 percent of a family's income, a state official said. 
 Vanessa Dacosta, who earns $8.40 an hour as a cashier at Sbarro, received a notice under her door several weeks ago informing her that she had to give $336 of her approximately $800 per month in wages to the Clinton Family Inn, a shelter in Hell's Kitchen where she has lived since March. 
 ''It's not right,'' said Ms. Dacosta, a single mother of a 2-year-old who said she spends nearly $100 a week on child care. ''I pay my baby sitter, I buy diapers, and I'm trying to save money so I can get out of here. I don't want to be in the shelter forever.'' 
 City officials said the new rent requirement had been in the works since a 2007 state audit that forced them to pay back $2.4 million in state housing aid that should have been covered by homeless families with income. They argued that homeless people with income should be expected to pay for a portion of their shelter costs, a model that echoes the federal Section 8 housing voucher program. 
 ''I think it's hard to argue that families that can contribute to their shelter cost shouldn't,'' Robert V. Hess, the city's commissioner of homeless services, said in a telephone interview Friday. ''I don't see this playing out in an adverse way. Our objective is not for families to remain in shelter. Our objective is to move families back into their own homes and into the community.''
 It is unclear why the state law has not been enforced until now. New York's situation is unusual, with far more working homeless families than elsewhere in the state, and higher housing costs than virtually anywhere in the country.
 Anthony Farmer, a spokesman for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said the new policy will eventually affect about 2,000 of the more than 9,000 families in New York City shelters. More than 500 families have been informed that they were expected to begin paying rent on May 1. 
 City officials said they started with families who are new to shelters, and would phase in the new approach over the next several months, including for people who are on welfare and are also working. They could not yet estimate how much it would raise.
 A flier posted in one shelter last week warned residents in bold, underlined type, ''Failure to make the required contributions could result in the loss of your family's temporary housing.'' 
 But advocates for the homeless said the new policy was punitive and counterproductive, and some shelter residents, in protest, have already refused to sign the documents acknowledging receipt of the rent notifications. 
 ''Families have been told to pay up or get out,'' said Steven Banks, the attorney in chief for the Legal Aid Society. ''The policy is poorly conceived, but even more alarmingly, it's being poorly executed. What is happening is that we have seen cases of families being unilaterally told, without any notice of how the rent was calculated, that they must pay certain amounts of rent or leave the shelter. We've already had a case of a survivor of domestic violence who was actually locked out of her room.''
 Mr. Hess acknowledged that if a family does not pay the required rent, it could be told to leave the shelter, but he noted that residents can contest the rent required through a state hearing. 
 Ms. Dacosta, for one, said she had spoken with her caseworker and demanded a hearing. Martha Gonzalez, who is 49 and lives with her 19-year-old son in a rundown shelter in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said she was informed last week that she owes $1,099 in monthly rent on a $1,700 monthly income as a security guard in Midtown. She said she planned to contest the rent demand in court.
 City officials did not immediately respond to Ms. Gonzalez's assertion that her rent would exceed half of her income.
 Patrick Markee, the senior policy analyst of the Coalition for the Homeless, called the policy ''impractical,'' arguing that most working people who live in homeless shelters earn low wages and would be better off saving for a place of their own. ''It's going to make families stay in shelter longer because they'll have fewer financial resources,'' he said. 
 ''They are taking money from them that could otherwise be used to help themselves get out of the shelter system,'' agreed Arnold S. Cohen, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for the Homeless. ''We're dealing with the poorest people, the people who are the most in need, and we're asking them to pay for a shelter of last resort. As a city and a state that has a history of social and economic justice, I think we can do better than that.''

HEADLINE: In China, No Problem Selling Cars

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Vehicle sales in China jumped 25 percent in April from the year before to a record monthly high of 1.15 million units, according to industry figures. Passenger car sales surged 37 percent over a year earlier, to 831,000, outpacing sales in the United States, where 820,000 units were sold in April. After slowing late last year as the impact from the global financial crisis deepened, China's auto sales have risen for five consecutive months.

HEADLINE: Recession Fails to Halt Spring Charity Benefits

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Despite hard times, many nonprofit groups are proceeding with the charity benefits that are an annual rite of spring. But they are looking for new ways to save money, like scheduling events in donors' homes and joining forces to cut costs.
 ''We never thought of not doing the annual benefit,'' said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, director of special events at Vogue magazine and a board member of the Food Allergy Initiative. ''The money raised by it is critical and vital to everything the Food Allergy Initiative does.'' 
 The organization was trying to figure out how to cut the costs of its annual luncheon when Ms. Winston Wolkoff sent an e-mail message to a friend, Heather Mnuchin, to invite her to sit at her table for the event. Ms. Mnuchin responded with a reciprocal invitation to sit at her table for City Harvest's annual benefit later the same day in the same venue, Cipriani in Manhattan.
 ''It didn't click right away, but when I did realize that they were both the same day and in the same place, I went straight to Heather, and together we came up with plans that have cut more than half of the costs of the events for both of our organizations,'' Ms. Wolkoff Winston said.
 Those attending the Food Allergy Initiative's lunch sat at tables crowned by topiaries. A few hours later, City Harvest's guests gathered around tables with some of the same topiaries.
 Both events used the same cherry blossom flower arrangements, votives and candles, and sound and lighting equipment; and Raul Avila, whose company, Raul Avila Inc., plans and designs events, provided the decor at cost. 
 ''You have to think outside the box,'' Ms. Winston Wolkoff said. ''You can't just think in the old way based on the budgets we had in the past.''
 David Stark, whose eponymous company designs, plans and produces events for charities and corporations, redeployed the wine bottles emptied during the Metropolitan Opera's 125th anniversary gala as vases for New Yorkers for Children which provides services to children in foster care in New York City. 
 ''I washed them out and took them back to the studio and painted them,'' Mr. Stark said. ''One organization ended up helping another without even really knowing it.''
 He said he had been exploring ways to cut the waste generated by events, driven in part by environmental awareness and in part by the need to ''be more inventive in the budgeting process.''
 For the opera's event, he scavenged in its archives and ended up anchoring the design for the party with historic marquee posters.
 ''We were looking for the appropriate thing for what was going to be a momentous occasion, the 125th anniversary, when the times are such that certain statements that were acceptable two or three years ago would be considered gauche,'' Mr. Stark said.
 Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising consultant, said there were risks to hosting what he called ''glitter balls'' at all. ''Organizations that throw a big party right now will have to answer questions about why they are spending money frivolously,'' Mr. Sharpe said.
 He said two large organizations, which he would not name, that threw lavish events last fall lost gifts that had been pledged previously because the donors were upset by the extravagance.
 Many organizations anticipated the economic downturn and made plans to tailor their events. Only Make Believe, a small nonprofit that brings interactive theater performances to children in the hospital, decided in April 2008 that it would cancel its annual benefit last fall.
 ''Bear Stearns had started having issues at the time, and we anticipated things weren't going to be great,'' Katie Hall, the executive director of Only Make Believe, said, referring to the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns. 
 So last fall, Only Make Believe held a ''Make Believe'' gala, inviting donors and supporters to make a donation and stay at home. The benefit grossed $95,000 for the organization, which had grossed around $250,000 through its past benefits. ''It was about 95 percent less expensive, and much more of the gift fell to the bottom line,'' Ms. Hall said. ''On top of that, it saved us the time of our limited staff.''
 For its 10th anniversary event this fall, the organization is thinking of scrapping dinner in favor of cocktails. ''Nothing is set in stone yet, but we're thinking hard,'' Ms. Hall said.
 Similarly, Guide Dogs for the Blind decided late last summer to forgo large, elaborate events with dinners and auctions in favor of smaller, more intimate gatherings in donors' homes. 
 ''With the economy hammering philanthropy, that decision proved to be wise,'' said Andy Eber, director of development at Guide Dogs. ''Nonprofits like us are searching for ways to cultivate the emotional connection of our donors to our mission, and these donor-hosted events are the perfect setting for that.''
 Guide Dogs estimates that its revenue from benefits and other events will drop 17 percent in the fiscal year that begins July 1. ''We are seeing a dramatic decrease in the ability of many underwriters to support these events,'' Mr. Eber said, ''and event attendance is only one-half to two-thirds of normal.''

HEADLINE: Far From Over

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It's a measure of just how terrible the economy has become that a loss of more than a half-million jobs in just one month can be widely seen as a good sign. The house is still burning down, but not quite as fast.
 I can understand why people are relieved that we no longer seem to be hurtling toward a depression, but beyond that I see very little to be happy about. 
 The economy is in shambles. Nearly 540,000 jobs were lost in April, a horrifying number. The unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent. Even the most optimistic observers expect the job losses to continue, although, hopefully, at a slower pace. The unemployment rate is expected to keep on climbing, like some monster from the movies, toward double digits.
 We are stuck in what is -- or will soon be -- the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. Newspapers and the U.S. auto industry are on life support. The employment picture for even the most well-educated Americans -- men and women with four-year college degrees or higher -- is the worst on record.
 If there is something about this economy to be cheerful about -- something real -- I wish someone would let me know.
 Poverty and homelessness are increasing and, as Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, said during an interview this week, ''There are a whole lot of people who are going to be economically desperate for many years.''
 Joblessness is like a cancer in the society. The last thing in the world that you want is for it to metastasize. And that's what's happening now. Don't tell me about the stock market. Don't tell me about the banks and their perpetual flimflammery. Tell me whether poor and middle-income families can find work. If they can't, the country's in trouble.
 One reason the employment losses slowed somewhat in April was that the government added 72,000 jobs, most of them temporary hires as part of the preparation for the 2010 Census. The private sector dumped 611,000 jobs. Moreover, the Labor Department revised the job losses for March upward, from 663,000 to 699,000, and for February, from 651,000 to 681,000. Some 5.7 million jobs have been lost since the start of the recession in December 2007.
 Mr. Mishel has been trying to call attention to the human toll caused by job losses on this vast scale. The institute estimates that the poverty rate for children is in danger of increasing from 18 percent, which is where it was in 2007, the last year for which complete statistics are available, to a scary 27.3 percent in 2010. 
 For black children, you don't want to know. But I'll tell you anyway. The poverty rate for black kids was 34.5 percent in 2007. If the national unemployment rate rises, as expected, to the vicinity of 10 percent next year, the poverty rate for black children would rise to 50 percent or higher, analysts at the institute believe.
 That would be a profound tragedy.
 We already know that children are being harmed in families hammered by job losses, home foreclosures and the myriad stresses that grip families trying to cope with economic reversals. Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund and a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, has referred to these youngsters as the ''recession generation,'' and has described what is happening to them as ''a quiet disaster.''
 Much of the impact of the Obama administration's economic stimulus efforts is still to come, but those efforts were never narrowly focused on the need for job creation and are not nearly large enough to cope with the mammoth job losses that are occurring. The official unemployment rate for men is already at 9.4 percent, and for black workers 15 percent.
 To get a sense of the task ahead, consider that 7.8 million jobs would have to be created just to bring us back to where we were when the recession began. That's because the working-age population has continued to grow since then. The economy has to create about 127,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. That comes to more than 2 million jobs since the start of the recession, which you then add to the 5.7 million that have been lost.
 There is no light yet at the end of this tunnel.
 It may not be popular, and it certainly won't sit well with the so-called deficit hawks in Congress, but there is a real need for additional government spending to further stimulate the economy and create jobs. (Think infrastructure, among other things.) The kind of employment distress we're confronting is not sustainable. Help will be needed for people whose unemployment benefits run out, who are ill but not covered by medical insurance, who are homeless or otherwise in desperate economic straits.
 This crisis is far from over.

HEADLINE: Assembly Speaker Urges End of Impasse on New Skyscrapers at Ground Zero

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, called on Friday for a meeting on rebuilding ground zero to resolve the impasse between the developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority over the construction of office towers on the 16-acre site in Lower Manhattan.
 Mr. Silver called for the construction of at least three massive office towers at the World Trade Center site by 2014, despite rising vacancies and falling rents in the city's financial district. 
 But he also insisted that Mr. Silverstein must invest his own money in the project if he is to reap the profits, while the Port Authority, the city and the state should assist in some way.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg immediately embraced the notion. He invited Mr. Silver, as well as the governors of New York and New Jersey, Mr. Silverstein and Port Authority officials, to Gracie Mansion next week ''to find a way to align the incentives and keep progress moving at ground zero.'' 
 Mr. Silver, at a breakfast forum sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown New York, said, ''Seven years and eight months after the attacks, I am fed up with the stalling and exasperated with the current state of the World Trade Center project.''
 He said that the city, the state and the federal government had a ''moral obligation to rebuild this American community.''
 Janno Lieber, who oversees the World Trade Center project for Mr. Silverstein, said he welcomed Mr. Silver's call, although he made no mention of whether the developer would put money into the project. Work is progressing at ground zero on both a $3.2 billion transit center and a 9/11 memorial.
 But Mr. Silverstein, who holds the lease for the trade center site, has been unable to obtain financing for the three towers that he is required to build and has asked the Port Authority to back the project financially, a move that could cost $3 billion.
 The Port Authority, which is already building the first tower, a 2.6 million-square-foot skyscraper at Vesey and West Streets, countered with an offer to provide him with about $800 million in financing for what is known as Tower 4, a 64-story building on Church Street between Cortlandt and Liberty Streets that is one of the first two that Mr. Silverstein would build.
 Under the Port Authority's proposal, Mr. Silverstein's second and third towers would be built over the next two decades as demand grows.
 Mr. Silverstein, who would be free to build the towers sooner if he obtained tenants and private financing, rejected the offer. Officials worry that the dispute could delay efforts to open the memorial in 2011.
 Mr. Silver and Mr. Bloomberg have now set the stage for potentially acrimonious negotiations in the midst of a recession that has blown multibillion dollar holes in the budgets of New York, New Jersey and the Port Authority. At the same time, lenders are unwilling to finance new office projects because of falling real estate values, growing vacancy rates and widespread layoffs.
 Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority, and Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey have told officials that they are opposed to financing speculative office buildings, especially when the chances of securing tenants are bleak. And the authority's bridge and tunnel revenues are down sharply, putting a severe strain on its capital budget.
 ''There are other things Governor Corzine wants from the Port Authority,'' Mr. Silver said in a reference to plans for a new train tunnel into Pennsylvania Station. ''We're either going to accommodate each other or stalemate each other.''
 Gov. David A. Paterson of New York also appeared reluctant to provide government financing for the towers. 
 ''Moving forward,'' Mr. Paterson said, ''we must acknowledge that the public should not be the ones taking on all of the risk for private development and that we should not repeat the mistakes of the past where unrealistic expectations got in the way of a practical path.'' 
 Landlords, real estate brokers and some urban planners expect the vacancy rate for downtown office buildings to rise to 16 percent or higher next year, from about 12 percent today. 
 Every Friday evening, moving trucks carry desks, computers and other equipment for Merrill Lynch employees who are being transferred from the World Financial Center downtown to the new Bank of America building on West 42nd Street.
 Real estate executives expect Merrill to vacate about 2 million square feet, and Goldman Sachs and A.I.G. to move out of another 3 million square feet downtown.
 The average lease for downtown offices is for just over 24,000 square feet, which means that it would take more than 200 companies moving to Lower Manhattan to fill the space left behind by those three companies alone. Expensive new towers will not help the situation, brokers said. 
 ''You don't want all that inventory built on a speculative basis right now,'' said Robert L. Freedman, executive chairman of FirstService Williams Real Estate, a broker.
 Mr. Silver predicted that the economy should recover by 2015, when the towers are completed.
 ''In this tough economic climate,'' said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the authority, ''the Port Authority must be realistic about putting its limited public resources toward the most public benefit, which means keeping the memorial and the public transportation projects moving forward, and building the office and retail development to meet the market.''
 Mr. Silver and city officials said that they appreciated the Port Authority's concerns, which is why they insist on Mr. Silverstein investing his own money and accepting some risk.
 Mr. Silverstein leased the trade center in 2001, only six weeks before it was destroyed in the terrorist attack. Ultimately, he received $4.5 billion in insurance proceeds. Mr. Silverstein used some of that money in 2003 to repay a $563 million loan he had on the project.
 That allowed him and his investors to receive most of the money they invested in the deal. An additional $870 million was set aside for the first new tower, being built by the Port Authority.
 Since the attack, Mr. Silverstein has paid the Port Authority about $800 million in rent, to retain his right to the property, and has taken $150 million in development fees. Today, there is only $964 million of the insurance settlement left to pay for the three office towers he is required to build under a 2006 agreement.
 ''We have to see progress on the site continue,'' said Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber. ''We'd like to see a better economic model in which all sides participate in both the upside or downside.''

HEADLINE: In Capital, Efforts to Hit The Right Note Of Optimism

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The formula for restoring national confidence -- part good policy, part good politics, part good luck -- can be hard to find. It eluded Herbert Hoover after the Crash of '29, Lyndon B. Johnson after the Tet offensive, Jimmy Carter after the energy shock and George W. Bush after Iraq turned from quick victory to bloody insurgency. 
 But President Obama has to try to do just that in a time of crisis. As the government announced this week that the nation's largest banks had steered away from the precipice and that job losses were beginning to slow, Mr. Obama has carefully begun trying to mine any national leader's most precious commodity in a crisis: optimism. 
 His past references to ''glimmers of hope'' were modestly upgraded at the White House on Friday, with his declaration -- which he stumbled over, taking some of the assertiveness out of the line -- that ''the gears of our economic engine do appear to be slowly turning once again.'' 
 His aides have been reaching tentatively for similar metaphors, then adding, as Mr. Obama quickly did, that real recovery is months, if not years, ahead.
 Fear and aversion to risk have been part of the economy's problems since the downturn began, and Mr. Obama's aides have been highly attuned to the risks of a downward spiral of pessimism. In recent weeks, his economic team has begun flagging signs that the worst could be over, even as it carefully released the results of its bank examinations in a way that suggested a desire to reassure the financial markets and consumers. They got a bit of backing this week from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who forecast that the economy was likely to begin growing again by the end of the year.
 ''Remember this central paradox of financial crisis,'' Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser in the White House, said in mid-March, when every arrow was pointing down, ''that while the problem was caused by excessive complacency and excessive optimism,what we need today is more optimism and more confidence.''
 Mr. Obama's own words on Friday signaled that he was worried about the perils of getting out ahead of the numbers. He spent more time talking about the letters he received from the desperate and out-of-work than he did dwelling on the decline in the pace at which Americans are losing their jobs. After all, 539,000 job losses in a single month is not exactly cause for celebration, even if it represents an improvement over the previous month.
 ''There's a kind of artistry to this, isn't there?'' said Robert Dallek, the presidential historian best known for chronicling how Lyndon Johnson, the consummate politician, never led the public out of its view that everything was falling apart. ''You don't want to come out and say the recession is over. You want to do a version of Churchill's line about how this isn't the end, or the beginning of the end, but rather the end of the beginning.''
 In Mr. Obama's case, polls showed that a significant chunk of the public was predisposed to look for the bright side. The proportion of Americans who said the country was moving in the right direction rose to 41 percent in a New York Times/CBS News poll last month, from 15 percent in January just before his inauguration, even though by nearly every measure the economy was getting worse during that period. But there are plenty of skeptics out there, from economic historians who know that history is littered with false recoveries, to those who argue that Mr. Obama has engineered a turnaround at the cost of phenomenal deficits and a huge new role for the government in the private sector. 
 Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton's secretary of labor and one of Mr. Obama's critics on the left, was on television Friday arguing that to create this sense of optimism Mr. Obama's team essentially put its finger on the scale when weighing the ability of the banks to survive a deeper downturn.
 Given the depth of the concerns about the stability of the financial system and the debates about whether Mr. Obama was being tough enough on the banks, administration officials recognized that they could not afford the kind of mistake they made in early February, when Timothy F. Geithner, new to his job as Treasury secretary, provided vague assurances that the banks would be saved but said he was not prepared to give details. He was hammered in the markets and derided as inexperienced. 
 So when it came to releasing the results of the bank stress tests, much was done differently. When the tests were first announced in late February, administration officials said that bank-by-bank results would not be announced. It quickly became clear that would court disaster: Banks that were given a clean bill of health would scream that news to the markets, leaving the rest of the 19 appearing to be in far direr straits.
 Inside the administration, according to two officials, Mr. Geithner argued that the results had to be announced in considerable detail. And this week Mr. Geithner defended the soundness of the administration's approach. 
 ''A huge part of the dynamic of a crisis is confidence,'' Mr. Geithner said in a telephone interview on Friday. He was influenced in part by his days as a young Treasury official in the American Embassy in Japan, where he saw what happened when the Japanese government talked up the economy but failed to act.
 He said Mr. Obama was opting for ''directness and candor and openness about the scope of the problem,'' but steering clear of ''talking up the numbers'' in ways that predict what the future will bring.
 But administration officials said they recognized that the numbers that resound most with Americans were the unemployment statistics, and those were usually the last to recover. They are also subject to surprise downturns, which explains Mr. Obama's hesitance to describe the job-loss figures on Friday as the beginning of an improving trend. 
 ''The hardest part of this is balancing optimism with credibility,'' said Mr. Dallek. ''Hoover's 'Happy days are here again' wasn't credible. Bush's 'Mission accomplished' became a running joke. No one wants to make that mistake again.''

HEADLINE: Chavez Seizes Assets of Oil Contractors

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez asserted greater control over the country's energy industry on Friday by seizing the assets of some foreign and domestic oil contractors while his government grapples with a sharp decline in oil revenue and mounting debts.
 The move points to a greater concentration of power by Mr. Chavez, who is busily exerting sway over important industries and political institutions during the economic crisis. In recent weeks, his government has also hounded top rivals, stripping the mayor of Caracas of financing for the city budget while forcing the mayor of Maracaibo to seek asylum in Peru after he was confronted with corruption charges. 
 The move by Mr. Chavez on Friday also raises concern about Venezuela's ability to increase its declining oil production at a time of low oil prices. The national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, hired the contractors to help it produce oil by operating drilling rigs, using technology to extract oil from aging wells or moving personnel or equipment on boats.
 Venezuela, which relies on oil for about 93 percent of its export earnings, has not paid some of the oil contactors since late last year, according to filings by companies like Williams Companies, based in Tulsa, Okla., which said last month that it did not expect to receive $241 million it was owed here. Petroleos de Venezuela had been seeking a reduction of about 40 percent in its overall debt to the companies, which is estimated by industry analysts to be about $10 billion.
 Our ''people will never again be anyone's slave,'' Mr. Chavez said Friday.
 Industry representatives in the oil-producing state of Zulia said uniformed soldiers had begun occupying oil installations on Thursday, shortly before the National Assembly approved a measure allowing the takeovers. The move deepens Mr. Chavez's control of the oil industry, following the imposition of higher royalties on foreign oil companies, raids on their offices by tax authorities and the nationalization of large oil-producing projects in recent years.
 In other countries, national oil companies have been trying to negotiate better terms with contractors since prices plunged with the onset of the global financial crisis. But Mr. Chavez's move marks an aggressive turn in such negotiations, highlighting the risks that many energy companies face in doing business in Venezuela.
 Some foreign companies began shutting down their drilling rigs earlier this year when it became apparent they would not get paid by Petroleos de Venezuela. Helmerich & Payne, a drilling company based in Tulsa, has told investors that it stands to lose $116 million because of unpaid bills by Petroleos de Venezuela.
 Particularly for large oil-services companies, like Schlumberger or Halliburton, opportunities still exist in Venezuela, where they have carved out a presence that has spanned decades. It was not immediately clear whether they could remain as minority partners with Petroleos de Venezuela or continue talks over debts they hoped to collect.
 For the time being, Mr. Chavez's government said it would expropriate at least 13 drilling rigs, 39 oil terminals and about 300 boats used in waters and land around Lake Maracaibo in western Venezuela. Still, industry leaders said the scope of the expropriations could easily be widened. Cathy Mann, a spokeswoman for Halliburton declined to comment on whether the company would be affected.
 Despite the abrupt shifts in energy policy here, large oil companies like Chevron and Total of France have tried to maintain their business activities in the country, attracted by its sizable oil reserves. Unlike some other major oil countries, like Saudi Arabia or Mexico, Venezuela still allows foreign companies to be minority partners in nationalized oil fields.
 In an attempt to increase production, Venezuela has recently been soliciting bids from private oil companies in the West, as well as from state-controlled Chinese and Russian companies, for new oil projects capable of producing up to 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. The bidding has been delayed this year, but it is scheduled to begin here in late July.
 ''For those thinking about bidding, the action against the contractors is another reminder of how unsettling the environment in Venezuela can be,'' said RoseAnne Franco, lead analyst for Latin America at PFC Energy, a company in Washington.
 While the new projects up for bid would be assembled in the Orinoco Belt, an area with an enormous hydrocarbon reserve in southern Venezuela, the seizure of the contractors' assets on Friday took place largely in Zulia, in western Venezuela, where some of the country's oldest oil wells are located.
 Zulia is also a bastion of opposition to Mr. Chavez. Resentment has been festering against the president there since corruption charges were brought against Manuel Rosales, a leading opposition figure who ran against Mr. Chavez for president in 2006 and was elected mayor of Maracaibo last year. Mr. Rosales fled to Peru last month rather than submit to an order for his arrest to face corruption charges.
 Mr. Chavez will expand his power in Zulia with the takeover of the contractors by his loyalists, but it is a move that could heighten tension in one of the most strategically important states.
 ''They want to come for all of Zulia,'' said Nestor Borjas, a leader in Fedecamaras, a regional business association in western Venezuela.
 ''They come with their soldiers from the National Guard, and they take what they want,'' he said, ''and you, as the owner of your company, can do absolutely nothing.''

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway Posts Its First Loss Since 2001

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway, the company led by Warren E. Buffett, announced late Friday that it had recorded its first quarterly loss since 2001, hurt by a large investment in ConocoPhillips shares and losses from derivatives. 
 The company, based in Omaha, reported a net loss of $1.53 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to a profit of $940 million in the year-earlier quarter. The net loss per class A share was $990 in the quarter, in contrast to earnings of $607 a share in the year-earlier quarter.
 Mr. Buffett has acknowledged a major mistake in purchasing ConocoPhillips shares when oil and gas prices were near record levels last year. 
 In the first quarter, the company sold 13.7 million of its 79.9 million shares of ConocoPhillips, using the loss to offset past taxes on capital gains. In a letter to shareholders in February, Mr. Buffett said the investment in ConocoPhillips had cost Berkshire several billion dollars.
 Last year, Berkshire Hathaway became the biggest shareholder in ConocoPhillips. But since last June, its share price has dropped by half, resulting in Berkshire taking a $1.9 billion charge on the oil company's stock. 
 In the earnings report, Mr. Buffett said he expected the price of ConocoPhillips shares to ultimately exceed the purchase price.
 The company also took $1.3 billion in write-downs in derivatives tied to corporate-debt indexes.
 At the company's annual meeting last Saturday in Omaha, Mr. Buffett said, ''I didn't cover myself in glory'' in 2008.
 Berkshire Hathaway, which owns assets as diverse as insurance operations, Benjamin Moore Paint and See's Candies, reported that revenue for the quarter fell 9.5 percent, to $22.8 billion, from $25.2 billion a year earlier. It had operating earnings of $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 12 percent from $1.93 billion in the first quarter of last year.
 Mr. Buffett has urged focusing on operating earnings, saying they were a fairer measure of performance because they exclude the stock price swings of its investments. 
 The company reported increased operating earnings in its insurance underwriting and insurance investment income. But operating earnings in its noninsurance businesses were hit hard by the recession and fell to $539 million in the first quarter, from $950 million in the year-earlier period. 
 At the annual meeting, Mr. Buffett said earnings from insurance underwriting should increase because the recession hardly affects them. Although Mr. Buffett has criticized derivatives, Berkshire's derivative commitments have pushed down its results over the last year. Its derivatives losses included $675 million of payments related to junk-bond defaults as a result of several corporate bankruptcies.
 Mr. Buffett has said ''the odds are good'' that the directive contracts tied to stock markets would be profitable long term, but he was more pessimistic about derivatives linked to corporate debt.
 Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service downgraded Berkshire's triple-A ratings in 2009. Berkshire owns 20.4 percent of Moody's parent, Moody's Corporation.
 Berkshire's class A stock closed on Friday at $95,295, up $905 for the day. The earnings were released after the markets closed.

HEADLINE: Hearing Michigan's Pleas, and Pledging U.S. Help

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich. 

 BODY:
The official appointed by President Obama to help communities scarred by auto plant closures and layoffs promised some help during a tour of Michigan. 
 He announced better access to training for unemployed workers, more loans for small businesses and $10.3 million to redevelop closed factory sites.
 But the official, Edward B. Montgomery, also explained that the federal government had limited abilities to quickly rejuvenate the cities he visited. 
 ''Clearly the problems that we face and the challenges we face today didn't occur overnight and they're not going to be solved overnight,'' Mr. Montgomery, the director of recovery for auto communities and workers, said Friday. ''We need to get the economy growing. We need to get people buying automobiles. As that process goes on, I'm confident we can bring back jobs and growth in Michigan and around the country.''
 Over two days, Mr. Montgomery traveled through what he called ''the very heartbeat of the auto communities in America.'' He explored an engine plant in Flint, a city where General Motors has cut about 80,000 jobs over several decades, a G.M. design studio in suburban Detroit and a parts supplier in western Michigan.
 Everywhere he went, Mr. Montgomery heard pleas from state and local leaders who say the struggles of their constituents have long been ignored in Washington.
 ''If we're going to keep the middle class in this country, we have to focus on Flint and Michigan and get people back to work,'' Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said. ''We have been through too much for too long.''
 For years, Michigan's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, has described residents of her state as victims of an ''economic hurricane.'' Ms. Granholm, a Democrat, accompanied Mr. Montgomery throughout his visit.
 ''The levee has broken in our region,'' Michael J. Brennan, the president of the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, told Mr. Montgomery. ''You just can't drive up to it and point to it because it's all throughout our communities.''
 Yet Mr. Montgomery saw little of the fallout from the industry's restructuring. His visit did not include conversations with unemployed auto workers, a drive through the sections of Flint and other cities hit hardest, or stops at other ailing businesses.
 Mr. Montgomery said he was planning to return to Michigan soon and to visit other states, including Ohio and Indiana.
 ''The president made a commitment that we will stand behind our communities and the workers, and part of the first step in that process is to come out and listen to people on the ground,'' he said. ''This is not going to be directed from Washington. This is a bottom-up effort.''
 Michigan's troubles are likely to be worse by the time Mr. Montgomery returns. Thousands more job cuts are looming at Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, and at G.M., which could end up in bankruptcy at the end of May.
 Michigan's unemployment rate was already 12.6 percent in March, four points higher than the national average. Flint, northwest of Detroit, had a jobless rate of about 15 percent.
 ''We're not to the bottom yet,'' Representative Candice Miller, Republican of Michigan, told Mr. Montgomery. ''This time we don't see the comeback that we have always experienced in this area.''
 Many officials urged Mr. Montgomery not to simply focus on job training programs and more unemployment benefits.
 ''Our safety net in this community is in tatters and we need help,'' said Deborah Cherry, who represents Flint in the State Senate. ''It's wonderful to have job training dollars, but we have to have jobs to train people for. It's important to have unemployment insurance and we thank the administration for the extensions, but what we really need is work.''
 Ms. Cherry and others told Mr. Montgomery there were already many programs to provide help. The problem, they said, is that they require communities to put in funds they do not have or that they simply take too long to produce results. 
 ''We don't have months or years,'' Ms. Stabenow said. ''We need help right now.''

HEADLINE: The Dropout Crisis

 BODY:
The soaring dropout rate is causing the United States to lose ground educationally to rivals abroad and is trapping millions of young Americans at the very margins of the economy. The Obama administration acknowledges the problem in its new budget, which includes a $50 million dropout prevention program, but solving this predicament will require a lot more money and a comprehensive national strategy. 
 The alarming scope of the dropout crisis is laid out by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston and the Alternative Schools Network of Chicago, a nonprofit known for its work in educating dropouts. Their study, which examines data from the 12 largest states, finds that 16 percent of people between the ages of 16 and 24 have dropped out. 
 The problem is especially pronounced among men, who make up more than 60 percent of those who leave school nationally. The dropout problem hits minorities really hard. According to the study, for example, nearly 1 in 5 African-Americans and nearly 3 in 10 Hispanics ages 16 to 24 were dropouts in 2007.
 The numbers are disconcerting given that dropouts tend to have anemic earnings and unstable lives, which places them at high risk of becoming a burden to society. 
 Many of this country's large urban high schools are rightly called ''dropout factories'' because more students leave school than graduate. But according to the study, state dropout rates are highest in the South, where Georgia (22.1 percent), Florida (20.1 percent), Texas (18.5 percent) and North Carolina (17.6 percent) lead the way. 
 The dropout crisis presents a clear danger to national prosperity. But at the moment, states and localities are struggling to contain it with little help or guidance from the federal government. Congress, which is just waking up to this issue, can advance the solution by putting its money and muscle behind proven programs that have been shown to re-engage the young people who have dropped out and that keep at-risk children on track to complete their educations.

HEADLINE: Gov. Paterson's Performance

 BODY:
New Yorkers were deeply relieved last year when the governor, Eliot Spitzer, relinquished his office to David Paterson and retreated in disgrace. A year later, polls show that a majority of the state's residents would rather have Mr. Spitzer back than continue under the amiable but irresolute Governor Paterson. 
 Even more humiliating for the governor and his fellow Democrats, the Republicans now see Mr. Paterson's weakness as their strength. Joe Scarborough, a former United States representative and a leader in the Republican attack squad, noted gleefully that New York could very well go Republican ''thanks to David Paterson.''
 That question will not be answered until next November's elections, and we're not sure such a switch would be an improvement. What's obvious, though, is that Mr. Paterson needs to show New Yorkers that he can master this powerful job. Instead, he has ceded too much power to his former colleagues in the Legislature. He should be leading that crew, not trying to blend in with it.
 There have been moments when the governor seemed ready to take a forceful stand on hard issues then too quickly crumbled. Our hopes were raised, for example, when he endorsed same-sex marriage and urged state senators to stop haggling behind the scenes and take a public vote that would have revealed who stood where on an important civil right issue. But within days, Mr. Paterson had retreated and said that, no, he did not mean to advise the senators on how to conduct their back-room business.
 This tendency to advance, then retreat, surfaced again during the debate over how best to shore up New York City's public transportation system and help its eight million riders. Having first supported a balanced, four-star plan involving new tolls, taxes and fare increases, Mr. Paterson shifted to a weaker-though-still-acceptable proposal, then to a deficient Senate plan whose main virtue was that it had enough votes to pass. 
 Finally, after a public outcry, Mr. Paterson, Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver agreed this week on a compromise that would keep the Metropolitan Transportation Authority going for two more years. In the end, the governor did not appear to play a leading role. 
 After his job approval dropped to historic lows, Mr. Paterson hired a new set of advisers and embarked on a good-will tour, handing out federal stimulus dollars like candy -- especially upstate. He has endorsed property-tax relief and said he would seek a spending cap tied to the rate of inflation. Each would require a legislative miracle. 
 Progress is missing on other fronts. The Democrats have stalled campaign finance reform, and Mr. Paterson has yet to propose an independent commission to redraw Congressional and legislative districts. The governor would be wise not to leave this to the Republicans. 
 Mr. Paterson has other tasks: helping Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City to keep control of city schools and accelerating projects like the former World Trade Center site and the Moynihan Station. But at the top of the to-do list is Mr. Paterson's need to assert himself as a leader to be needed or feared -- preferably both.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Calling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
ANDREW BAISLEY described himself as a ''cheerleader for Brooklyn'' -- at least until a month ago, when the proud Bushwickian decided to take a peek at the Manhattan rental market. Now he has a one-bedroom in Chelsea with outdoor space and a 10-minute commute, all for an ''unbelievable'' $2,100 a month.
''When you go to Manhattan, there's an air of selling out,'' he says. ''I've accepted that.''
Great Recession prices are drawing even the most loyal outer-borough dwellers back to Manhattan. The migrants hail from Hoboken, Astoria and the brownstone blocks off Prospect Park, as New Yorkers who found themselves priced out of the gilded isle in the boom years are bidding farewell to long commutes and skinny-jean chic. 
Among the lures: $1,600 one-bedrooms on the Lower East Side. Lenient landlords who no longer require security deposits. And an overriding sense that an obscenely overpriced borough is now, well, slightly more reasonably overpriced.
''There's a part of me that feels like I'm cheating on Brooklyn,'' said Keith O'Brien, a 30-year-old in marketing and public relations who recently jumped from a spacious two-bedroom in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to a Lower East Side walk-up. ''But this was a unique moment in real estate history where renters have the upper hand, which seemed unbelievable a couple of years ago. I realized that it would have been foolish not to start looking at places.''
For an extra $100 a month, Mr. O'Brien -- a seven-year Brooklyn stalwart -- is now enjoying a trendy location and a six-minute commute, in exchange for losing half of his living space. ''There's no sink in the bathroom,'' he said, ''but concessions must be made.''
Newly minted Manhattanites range from 30-somethings seeking a professional edge through a shorter commute, to out-of-work recent graduates who think they can get a better deal on the Upper East Side than in the usual post-college enclaves of Williamsburg and Fort Greene.
Numbers on the New York rental market are notoriously unreliable, but recent reports suggest that rents are falling faster in Manhattan than in neighboring boroughs.
In the first three months of the year, one-bedroom rents in Manhattan fell 6.7 percent compared with the previous year, while Brooklyn one-bedrooms dropped just 3.2 percent, according to data from Citi Habitats and Ideal Properties Group, both brokerage firms. Other reports show some Manhattan rents down by 10 percent from a year ago.
''I just got lucky with the whole financial meltdown,'' said Kristi Giamichael, 26, who earlier this year gleefully tracked falling rental prices on Craigslist from the Hoboken duplex that she shared with two friends. She liked her neighborhood bar scene and the $1,172 rent, but realized Manhattan was no longer prohibitively expensive.
On May 1, Ms. Giamichael and a roommate moved into an 800-square-foot one-bedroom in Ruxton Towers, a landmark prewar building on 72nd Street off Central Park West. The two will split the $2,600 rent, and the landlord paid the fee to their broker, Caroline Bass of Citi Habitats.
Like many young adults, Ms. Giamichael moved to New York at a time of brutally high rents in Manhattan. Those seeking perks like in-house gyms and roof decks flocked to Hoboken and Long Island City, where amenities could be had for the price of a Yorkville walk-up.
Now, prices at upscale rental buildings like 45 Wall Street have come down significantly, discounted by 15 to 20 percent in recent weeks. At 20 Exchange Place, a tricked-out conversion around the corner from the Stock Exchange, the management company will waive the security deposit if the prospective tenant's credit checks out. Stuyvesant Town offers the same perk on some apartments, along with waiving the broker's fee.
''We do see that certain neighborhoods in Manhattan may be a better deal than certain neighborhoods in the boroughs,'' said Stephen Love, a broker at Ardor Realty.
So some New Yorkers who came to appreciate the outer boroughs -- spacious apartments, neighborhood charm -- are finding reasons to return.
Matthew Creamer spent nearly a decade in Brooklyn (with a brief stopover in Hoboken), rotating through Smith Street, Cobble Hill and finally Sunset Park, where he spent four happy years in a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom for $1,400 a month.
''I told a lot of friends that I would never move back from Brooklyn, had no desire to move back to Manhattan,'' he recalled. ''I said that on a lot of occasions.''
But in March, Mr. Creamer, 32, began to feel anxious about his 45-minute commute to Midtown, where he works as an editor at Advertising Age. ''So much has changed in the past six months,'' he said. ''In the past, people wanted a separation from work on the weekend. I liked the fact that the neighborhood I lived in couldn't be any more different from the place that I worked.''
Now, Mr. Creamer said, ''people are so worried about their jobs and the general economic situation, that people don't mind being near work. It may even make them feel a little bit safer.''
The possibility of subway cutbacks made him worry about making morning meetings on time. ''At a 45-minute commute, it's not the worst thing in the world,'' he said. ''But if something goes wrong, it gets ugly really quickly.''
Mr. Creamer began searching for a place near Grand Central Terminal, aware that he would have to sacrifice space (and price) for peace of mind. Last month, he moved into a studio in a building with a doorman at 33rd Street and Park Avenue with views of the Empire State Building. Although he pays more in rent than he did, he calculates that he nearly breaks even, now that he's free of his monthly MetroCard and hefty late-night cab fares. And he received one month free on a 13-month lease.
The place is a third the size of his last apartment, and he does not have the basement storage he enjoyed in Sunset Park. At times, he misses the neighborhood feel of his old haunt.
''Nothing has changed as far as the way I feel about Brooklyn as far as it being one of the best places on earth to live,'' he said. ''I doubt I'll come out of my experience in Midtown thinking that. I'll probably like it, but I can't imagine having the same feeling for it.''
Brooklyn on the whole is still more affordable than Manhattan: one-bedrooms east of the river cost an average of $1,901 in the first quarter, compared with $2,432 in Manhattan, according to market reports.
But the flow of Manhattanites into Kings County has apparently slowed. In the first three months of 2008, nearly a quarter of renters moving to Brooklyn hailed from Manhattan. A year later, only 9 percent of renters came from across the river, according to data from Ideal.
And some of Brooklyn's trademark tenants -- underemployed recent graduates -- are also changing their minds.
For two years, Mark Schenkel, 25, has lived with roommates in a ground-floor apartment in a Windsor Terrace brownstone. Mr. Schenkel is paying $1,175 a month for a building with no laundry. His commute to work in the West Village was a half-hour haul on the F train.
''I always assumed that Manhattan was way too expensive for me and out of my reach,'' said Mr. Schenkel, who moved to the city in 2006. But when his landlord threatened a $100 rent increase, he decided to shop around.
''Just for fun, I started looking at the Upper West, Upper East,'' he said. ''Everybody talks about how nice and ritzy it is. I was shocked to see some of the prices.''
In Yorkville, for instance, he found rents that were several hundred dollars cheaper than what he and his roommates are paying in Brooklyn.
''They're a little bit smaller, but they have some of the amenities that I don't have now,'' he said, citing perks like a laundry and an elevator. Most of the apartments he has toured are renting for under $1,000 a person.
''A lot of these places are just desperate to find people,'' Mr. Schenkel said. ''People are responding to my e-mails within minutes to look at the apartment. People are saying, 'Come whenever you want.' ''
Craigslist directed him to a three-bedroom in a small building off First Avenue on 88th Street; the monthly rent came out to $730 a person, with no broker's fee.
Alas, that particular apartment was ''big, but had no kitchen or place to sit,'' Mr. Schenkel later wrote on Twitter. ''It's like the builders forgot to include that.''
The recession has not been kind to Mr. Schenkel, who recently lost his job with a record label. But unemployment has only underscored his interest in moving across the river. The Upper East Side is home to big retail franchises like Barnes & Noble and Best Buy that may still be hiring.
In Brooklyn, he said, ''all the local stores have two or three people working for them at a time. Mom-and-pop shops don't need people in this economy.
''I never thought losing my job would be one of the reasons I end up moving to Manhattan,'' Mr. Schenkel said, sounding a tad dazed. ''It seems backward to me, what's going on.''
Renters aren't the only ones looking to move. When Paul Kolbusz, a broker at the Corcoran Group, decided to buy in 2007, he opted for a new development in Long Island City. He was willing to give up Manhattan conveniences for the extra living space.
That was before the bubble burst. Earlier this year, with construction still incomplete, the developer was obligated to offer Mr. Kolbusz the right to rescind his contract. He jumped.
''They were trying to negotiate with me in order to keep me,'' Mr. Kolbusz said. ''I decided against it because Manhattan opened up in ways that it hadn't before, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity.''
Now he is shopping in prewar buildings in Murray Hill, and mulling over a $500,000 one-bedroom with beamed ceilings on East 28th Street. The unit is just $30,000 more than the Long Island City condo he left behind, but has two-thirds of the living space.
Even as rental prices fall, a little bit of luck can't hurt in finding that dream apartment. Perry Balin, 28, spent a year in a $900 studio in Boerum Hill. Children ran screaming in the hallways and the heat cut out in the middle of winter.
''I'd always wanted to live in the city my entire life,'' she said, ''and Brooklyn was my second choice. I took it because it was what I could have at the time.''
Encouraged by chatter about cheap apartments, she set off with her broker, Jeff Brenner of Citi Habitats, to a fourth-floor walk-up studio on West 95th Street just off Central Park.
''It faces the back of the building, all of the really rich people's yards on 94th Street,'' Ms. Balin said. ''I look out the window and feel like a millionaire.''
Her terrier, Tess, is more social and enjoys walks in the park.
The rent: $1,225 a month. Ms. Balin, an aspiring singer, hummed when she disclosed the figure. ''Now, don't be jealous,'' she said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: For Recession Victims, Patchwork State Aid

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As millions of people seek government aid, many for the first time, they are finding it dispensed American style: through a jumble of disconnected programs that reach some and reject others, often for reasons of geography or chance rather than differences in need.
Health care, housing, food stamps and cash -- each forms a separate bureaucratic world, and their dictates often collide. State differences make the patchwork more pronounced, and random foibles can intervene, like a computer debacle in Colorado that made it harder to get food stamps and Medicaid.
The result is a hit-or-miss system of relief, never designed to grapple with the pain of a recession so sudden and deep. Aid seekers often find the rules opaque and arbitrary. And officials often struggle to make policy through a system so complex and Balkanized.
Across the country, hard luck is colliding with fine print. 
Workers who banked $2,000 in severance pay can get food stamps in South Carolina; their counterparts in North Carolina cannot. Oklahomans who earned $10,000 in six months can collect unemployment if they started work on the 15th of February, May, August or November -- but not if they started two weeks later.
When Beverly Johnson of Kosciusko, Miss., lost her job at a Bible college, she took solace in the prospect of jobless benefits. Then Ms. Johnson discovered that as an employee of a religious school she was ineligible for aid. ''That was a shock,'' she said.
When the recession cost Erika Nieves of Bridgeport, Conn., her job with a wrestling promoter, she did get unemployment benefits. But that caused her to lose a welfare-to-work grant and her child care subsidy. Now Ms. Nieves is months behind on her rent and is job hunting with a 2-year-old. ''They took away my aid when I need it the most,'' she said.
As a measure of the safety net, The New York Times examined state-by-state enrollment in six federal programs and found large variations in the share of needy helped.
Just 50 percent of people eligible for food stamps receive them in California, compared with 98 percent in Missouri. Nineteen percent of the unemployed get jobless benefits in South Dakota, compared with 67 percent in Idaho.
Fifteen states rank among the top 10 in providing one form of aid and the bottom 10 in another. California ranks second in distributing cash welfare but last in food stamps. South Dakota, last in jobless benefits, is first in subsidized housing.
Aid in states most hit by recession is also scattershot. Michigan's programs reach a comparatively high share of the needy, while South Carolina's rank in the middle and Nevada's reach relatively few. All have double-digit unemployment rates.
''The system for helping Americans in need is very fragmented, and it confuses everyone,'' said Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard. ''Some people are covered and some people are not, even though they look like they're in very similar circumstances.''
This complexity is a challenge for President Obama as he reacts to the economic crisis. The February stimulus act contains more than $100 billion in safety net provisions, but much of the aid consists of financial incentives the states are free to reject. Several governors quickly spurned grants to expand unemployment insurance, for example, saying the move would raise business taxes and kill jobs.
Aid programs spend hundreds of billions of dollars and reach tens of millions of people; the food stamp program alone covers more than one in 10 Americans. Yet the safety net leaves few camps satisfied. Liberals say programs are weak compared with other rich countries and are overly deferential to states. Conservatives fault costs and complexity and warn that aid can do harm.
With generous programs ''you could be discouraging people from seeking better jobs,'' said Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation.
Both sides, those who want more spending and those who want less, would unite under Mr. Butler's description of the status quo. ''You've got this kind of jigsaw puzzle that doesn't really fit together, '' he said.
Compared with its peers, the United States has always made social policy in ad hoc ways, with voters quicker to call themselves self-reliant and central government more structurally constrained. Even the New Deal was a hodgepodge affair, with Social Security initially omitting about 40 percent of the work force.
Now decades after the Great Society brought a new burst of policymaking, aid programs flow through multiple -- and sometimes rivalrous -- departmental chains of command. Welfare and Medicaid reside at the Department of Health and Human Services; food stamps at Agriculture; rent subsidies at Housing and Urban Development; unemployment insurance at Labor; and tax credits at Treasury.
Families receive aid, or do not, in contrasting ways. Sheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute examined use of food stamps, health insurance and child care among a representative group of low-income families. About a third got no help, a third enrolled in one program, and just 5 percent enrolled in all three.
''We have people at both ends of the spectrum,'' Ms. Zedlewski said in an interview. ''But we have far more people who get nothing than who get the whole package. A significant group remains outside the safety net.''
Nationwide, about two-thirds of people eligible for food stamps receive them. But just 21 percent of poor children get cash welfare; 30 percent of eligible households get subsidized housing; and 44 percent of the unemployed get jobless benefits.
While calls for government transparency are common, within the safety net, confusion often reigns. Ms. Nieves, of Bridgeport, received five food stamp notices in five weeks, telling her how much to expect: $241, $256, $429, $492 and $460.
Sometimes rules that make sense in one program collide with another. That is what happened to Ms. Nieves when she lost her job shipping wrestling souvenirs for $8 an hour. She was on welfare when she found the work, and to ease the transition the state continued her welfare payments and paid for child care. Then sales slumped, and Ms. Nieves was laid off.
Unemployment benefits replaced just half her earnings, but the state withdrew her welfare grant and child care subsidy.
''Basically, when I lost my job, I just lost everything,'' she said.
Sometimes rules in a single program collide with themselves. Such was the case with Jewell French-Allen, who got tangled in an obscure provision of Massachusetts unemployment law. With a high-risk pregnancy at age 35, Ms. French-Allen left a $40,000 a year job and applied for jobless benefits. But the state denied the request, ruling that she had quit by choice. She then took a sales job at much lower pay, and was laid off.
Had she never held the first job, Ms. French-Allen could have gotten unemployment benefits. But because her earlier request had been denied, the state added a test -- and disqualified her because the weekly pay from the second job was less than the benefits she would have gotten from the first.
Two days after she was rejected again, she went into labor and delivered a boy who weighed less than two pounds.
''I am bitter -- if I had gotten unemployment, he wouldn't have been born prematurely,'' she said. ''When you can't support yourself financially, it puts incredible stress on your body.''
Unemployment coverage tends to be high where jobs pay well and unions are strong. (Leaders include New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.) Subsidized housing is more plentiful in places that had comparatively large populations decades ago, when money to underwrite new apartments peaked. (It is sparse in Arizona and Florida.)
Since states bear the costs of welfare expansions, most poor states trim the rolls. (Louisiana covers about one of every 20 poor families with children.) But the federal government pays for food stamps, and poor states often grab the aid. (Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana have higher enrollment rates than New York.)
Many states defy easy depiction. While Nevada keeps most programs small, unemployment insurance is an exception, perhaps reflecting union influence in Las Vegas. Despite its modest safety net, Mississippi ranks second in subsidized housing, partly a legacy of the Jim Crow age when Southern states used it to preserve segregation.
Along with differences in program enrollment, the size of benefits differs greatly, too -- adding another level of variation. Mississippi pays a weekly average of $190 in unemployment benefits, while Hawaii pays $416.
While some programs are limited on purpose, some take shape by accident. Colorado invested $200 million in a computer system and got a case study in high-tech failure. Within months of the system's start in 2004, the backlog of food stamp and Medicaid cases tripled to 18,000. The state spent three years under court order to reduce delays, but significant backlogs remain.
A bureaucratic bungle compounded the woes of Ms. Johnson, who lost her job as a librarian at Magnolia Bible College in Kosciusko, Miss. Religious schools are exempt from unemployment taxes, so Ms. Johnson, 60, faced the recession without jobless benefits.
She applied for food stamps and was denied because she had more than $3,000 in an Individual Retirement Account, though officials said she would qualify if the savings were in a 401(k).
Finding the distinction illogical, Ms. Johnson searched the Internet and learned that Congress had just changed the law. As of October 2008, savings in either kind of retirement account are no barrier to food stamps.
But state and county officials held firm, and a federal official sent an e-mail message supporting their outdated view. With the help of an advocacy group, the Public Policy Center of Mississippi, she finally traced the problem to an errant Web page at the Department of Agriculture.
''To get maybe $320 of food stamps took an entire month of work,'' she said.
Occasionally, people have the opposite fortune: getting benefits they should be denied. That is what happened to Tracey Walker, 43, who was laid off last fall after seven years on the night shift at a Baltimore cosmetics factory and lost her health insurance.
With high blood pressure and headaches, Ms. Walker tried to get Medicaid, but was told her jobless benefits were too high. ''I just sat there and cried,'' she said.
She was ineligible for food stamps, too, but the caseworker prayed, bent the rules and authorized $180 a month -- freeing up just enough cash for blood pressure pills. ''It made me cry even more,'' Ms. Walker said.
There are few growth industries in Baltimore, but Ms. Walker found one: a nonprofit group that helps the needy apply for Medicaid. She started work there last month as an enrollment specialist. Among the benefits she prizes is coverage under the group's health insurance plan.
Safety Net Tested: With hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and major industries on the ropes, America's array of government aid subsidies, including unemployment, insurance, food stamps and housing, is being tested as never before. This is the first in a series of articles examining how the safety net is holding up under the worst economic crisis in decades.

HEADLINE: Hotels Hit Pause On Pricey Renovations

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
AT the Hotel Vertigo in San Francisco, guests on the fourth floor can expect new bathrooms, soundproof windows, flat-screen televisions and furniture ready for a travel magazine close-up.
Guests on the third floor cannot.
A $6 million renovation of the hotel was supposed to be completed earlier this year. But Personality Hotels, which owns the Vertigo, formerly known as the York, and six other hotels in San Francisco, decided to save money by leaving part of the building untouched.
Yvonne Lembi-Detert, the president of Personality Hotels, said that she had already bought everything needed, from tiles to TVs, to complete the transformation of the hotel's 97 rooms. But the one thing she doesn't have right now is enough money. 
All over the country, hotels are halting or postponing renovations in numbers not seen since 2001, when the terrorist attacks led to a retrenchment in the travel industry, according to Chad Crandell, the president of Capital Hotel Management. This time, the cause is a decline in revenue -- both occupancy and room rates are down in most cities -- coupled with the difficulty of obtaining credit.
For hotel owners, ''the name of the game is capital preservation,'' said David Loeb, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
Most large hotel companies, Mr. Loeb said, ''have ratcheted down their capital plans, to focus only on life safety kinds of concerns.'' Companies want to have cash reserves, ''in case things get worse for the industry,'' he said.
''If they started something, they're going to finish it,'' he added. ''But we're seeing very little optional spending.''
No hotel owner wants to halt a renovation that has already begun. But that's what happened at the Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage (formerly the Lodge at Rancho Mirage), near Palm Springs, Calif., where a top-to-bottom makeover began in 2006. Construction was about 80 percent complete when the lender, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy protection last September. Now the developer, a division of the Gencom Group, is seeking new financing that would allow it to complete the renovation.
Other hotel projects, though, are proceeding apace. The Mark Hotel in New York is preparing for a summer opening after a gut renovation. At the W in Washington, the general manager, Ed Baten, said that he had already booked a wedding for this summer, indicating that the hotels' transformation is in the final stages. That hotel is owned by Nakheel, a development company sponsored by the Dubai government.
At least one major project has benefited from the recession. At the Four Seasons Hualalai, on the big island of Hawaii, a decline in occupancy helped simplify a $40 million renovation, according to the general manager, Robert Whitfield. Mr. Whitfield said that this spring, with occupancy down 20 to 25 percent over last year, turned out to be ''an opportune moment'' to add 20 suites and redo spa and restaurant facilities.
''It would have been harder to do with our typical demand patterns,'' he said.
But for many other hotels, now is anything but an opportune time to renovate. Hotels that fly brand ''flags'' are in a particularly tough sport, said Mr. Crandell of Capital Hotel Management, which manages a portfolio of 22 hotels, including the Sheraton Waikiki in Hawaii, the Courtyard Detroit Downtown, and the W Atlanta Downtown Hotel and Residences.
Mr. Crandell said that in order to remain part of the chains, branded hotels are generally required to perform ''soft goods renovations'' -- replacing bedding, carpets and the like -- every six to seven years, and more comprehensive renovations every 10 to 12 years. The hotel owners need permission from the brands to delay scheduled improvements.
Luckily, said Mr. Loeb, the Robert W. Baird analyst: ''The brands are being very constructive in their conversations with the owners. They're trying to be as flexible as they can without sacrificing the guest experience. They want the owners to survive.''
Mr. Crandell said that 90 percent of his hotels were ''working with our brands, trying to pull back on capital renovations.'' He declined to name specific projects, citing the confidentiality of discussions with hotel chains about brand standards. The company has not postponed projects that relate to safety, he added.
In San Francisco, Ms. Lembi-Detert has been a one-person arbiter of brand standards since she created her first hotel some 30 years ago. Even in flush times, Ms. Lembi-Detert said, she has kept close tabs on renovation costs. Her method, she said, is to hire good designers, but then eliminate extravagances from their plans.
For the Vertigo, the designer was Thomas Schoos of Los Angeles. ''He wanted the bathroom floors to be made of tile with the texture of pigskin,'' Ms. Lembi-Detert said. Instead, she said, ''I just got a brown nonskid tile.'' She added: ''The owner calls the shots.''
As a result of her frugality, she said, the money allocated for the Vertigo renovation would have lasted if she hadn't encountered ''plumbing and electric surprises'' in the building's walls.
''Whenever you renovate an old building, you don't know what you're going to find,'' Ms. Lembi-Detert said.
So, she said, she has to come up with several hundred thousand dollars more than she initially budgeted for the renovation of the Vertigo and its sister property, the Hotel Frank. ''And no one will lend it to me right now,'' she said.
PAYING from current accounts isn't an option, because a rate war has driven San Francisco hotel prices down. In fact, Ms. Lembi-Detert said ruefully, ''The rates are the same as when I got into the business 30 years ago.''
Recently, renovated rooms with king-size beds were going for $137 a night, about $30 more than similar unrenovated rooms.
Ms. Lembi-Detert says she is working closely with her contractors to devise a plan for finishing the renovation project. ''If you don't work together during these times,'' she said, ''it's all going to fail.''

HEADLINE: Finding Suriname's Past in Its Present

BYLINE: By DAVID SHAFTEL

 BODY:
TO the uninitiated, Paramaribo is full of surprises. Surveying the buildings surrounding Independence Square, for example, one could be forgiven for mistaking the scene for a quad at a Northeast college, especially while taking in the red-brick Finance Ministry of Suriname, complete with its Doric columns, hipped roof, dormers and clock tower.
Or take the Neve Shalom Synagogue, which, completed in 1839, looks more like a cross between an antebellum plantation house and a small town bank than a place of worship. Surinamers are fond of boasting of its harmonious proximity to the Central Mosque, whose minarets climb in stark contrast to the earthly synagogue.
These buildings might appear to be out of place in this drowsy tropical South American capital, with its cultural ties to the West Indies. The key to the puzzle, may lie in the country's colonial experience, which only ended some 35 years ago. 
Suriname seems to be largely unknown among Americans these days. When I told some friends that I was going there earlier this year, a few said they wouldn't be able to find it on a map. That was somewhat surprising given that the territory, with its lucrative sugar and coffee plantations, was ceded to the Dutch by England in 1667 in exchange for a piece of North America that included what would become New York City.
For the last decade Paramaribo has been a popular destination for Dutch students and eco-tourists headed for the interior, lured by colonial ties and a common language. Many quickly skip over the city itself. But Paramaribo has appeal of its own for fans, like myself, of colonial architecture and New World history -- to say nothing of travelers unenthusiastic about the price tag on a jungle adventure or the robust entomological scene found therein.
I arrived in Paramaribo on a Wednesday evening in February, planning to spend most of a long weekend exploring the city proper, which is small and safe enough to be pleasantly walkable.
Parts of the city became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2002, and with around 250 listed monuments, there are plenty of highlights. These include Fort Zeelandia, a 17th- and 18th-century cluster of buildings on the Suriname River that was the disembarkation point for arriving colonials, and the white, veranda-surrounded Presidential Palace, which has a stately dignity that is snuffed out at sundown when it becomes irradiated by green floodlights, giving it an air of ethereal pretense.
Paramaribo is a town where the streets become nearly deserted after sunset. This, I found, was a good time for a walk through the historic district, which is untainted by high-rises and unchecked development.
This tranquillity and an enthusiasm for historic preservation encouraged by the Netherlands, from which Suriname gained its independence in 1975, make it easy to imagine Paramaribo as it was when populated by absentee plantation owners tired of life in the bush. Many of Paramaribo's old houses were built after an all-consuming fire in 1821 and thus have a mellow continuity: most are painted white, with balustrade balconies and green doors and windows.
Just up the river from the historic district is a cluster of hotels, bars and restaurants that challenge the city's post-sunset repose. The establishments surrounding the bar 't Vat, a beer garden-like restaurant, resemble any tourist center found on the backpacker trail, where early '90s hip-hop mingles with the smell of stale pilsner.
I opted instead for a riverside sundowner at De Waag, a restaurant in the former weighing house where sugar and coffee were inventoried before being shipped to Europe. The building's antique scales have been preserved, and the restaurant is now one of the more elegant establishments in town.
After two days of exploring Paramaribo, I hired a guide to take me to Frederiksdorp, a faithfully restored plantation on the Commewijne River, which joins the Suriname River near the sea. Once outside the city, I was again struck by Suriname's unlikely diversity, in particular the similarities between coastal Suriname and Southeast Asia. The connection wasn't just topographical, with its muddy river and lowland farming, but also cultural. After the emancipation of African slaves in 1863, Javanese, East Indian and some Chinese laborers were brought in to fill the labor shortage. Indeed, I made the 10-minute river crossing to Frederiksdorp in an outboard-powered sampan like those I've seen in East Asia.
Back in town that night I had dinner with Sirano Zalman, an artist and tour operator, and his wife, Tessa Leuwsha, a novelist and author of a Dutch-language Suriname travel guide. We ate at the Log House, a recently opened riverside African restaurant, which offered Kenyan and Swahili dishes served by dashiki-clad waiters.
Ms. Leuwsha told me that before a 1980 coup and an ensuing decade of political instability, Suriname was rife with Americans, who started arriving in World War II to extract bauxite. Since the war never really touched Paramaribo, it became a playground for Americans, who continued to visit until the coup.
''Until recently a lot of the buildings here were like ruins,'' said Ms. Leuwsha, 41. ''It's only two years since we've had good roads in the city, but everything is coming up again.''
Mr. Zalman, 47, was born in Suriname but lived in the Netherlands for 11 years before returning to Paramaribo in 1993. ''It was safe by then,'' Mr. Zalman said, ''but very different from now. People didn't go out, and there was a lot of whispering. For the last eight or nine years, we've had a stable economy and things have been going really well. Now it's exciting because we've been through the tough times, and we have seen the beginning and the middle.''
Without saying so directly, he seemed to be in eager anticipation of a happy ending.
HISTORY AND TRANQUILITY IN A FORMER DUTCH PORT
GETTING THERE
Caribbean Airlines offers daily flights to Paramaribo via Trinidad, though flights arrive after midnight and depart in the early morning. Round-trip fares for travel next month start at around $540 and $700 from Miami and New York City.
WHERE TO STAY
The somewhat washed-out Torarica Hotel & Casino (Mr. L. J. Rietbergplein 1; 597-47-15-00; www.torarica.com) could be the leftover set from a James Bond film, albeit an early 1980s Roger Moore Bond film, when things started to get a bit campy. Rooms start at $140. (Hotels generally accept payment in U.S. dollars, though other transactions may require Suriname dollars.)
Near the Torarica is the Torarica Eco Hotel (Cornelis Jongbawstraat 16; 597-42-55-22), where ''eco,'' in this case, means ''economical.'' There, somewhat fresher rooms start at $88, and guests may use facilities at the main Torarica.
The Best Western Elegance (Frederick Derbystraat 99-100; 597-42-00-07; www.bestwesternsuriname.com) is just over a year old, and it's away from the bustle of the tourist district. Rooms start at $124.
WHERE TO EAT
De Waag (Waterkant 5; 597-47-45-14) has fine Italian food in a charming setting for about 80 Suriname dollars (about $28 at 2.84 Suriname dollars to the U.S. dollar) for a two-course meal.
Chi Min (Cornelis Jongbawstraat 83; 597-41-21-55) is an emporium-style Chinese restaurant popular among locals and tourists. Dishes are about 15 Suriname dollars.
There are several Roopram Roti shops around Paramaribo. They offer addictive West Indian fast food for about 10 Suriname dollars.
Cafe d'Optimist (Verlengde Gemenelandsweg 200; 597-49-50-09), a hangout among locals, is not centrally situated but has upscale European fare and a friendly staff. Dinner and a cocktail are about 80 Suriname dollars.
The Log House (Anton Dragtenweg 134; 597-8-40-34-08) serves traditional African fare -- the fish dishes stand out -- and fruity cocktails, starting at 100 Suriname dollars.

HEADLINE: LINCOLN CENTER: MIXED REVIEWS

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
ON May 14, 1959, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke ground at Columbus Avenue and 64th Street for what would become Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, he joked that maybe the whole project was unnecessary. In a makeshift tent Leonard Bernstein had just conducted the New York Philharmonic in Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' and other works. ''If they can do this under a tent,'' the president said, ''why the square?''
 Turning serious, he forecast that this ambitious endeavor, which wound up costing $185 million, would become a ''mighty influence for peace and understanding throughout the world.''
 Fostering international peace is a rather lofty standard by which to measure the success of Lincoln Center as it begins its 50th-anniversary celebrations on Monday morning at the newly renovated Alice Tully Hall. What really matters is that night after night, as the founders envisioned, the plaza is abuzz with crowds heading into Avery Fisher Hall, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Vivian Beaumont Theater and the other performance spaces of the center's 12 constituents. 
 Yet if a sprawling performing-arts complex like Lincoln Center were proposed today, it would never be built. Some of the impediments would be practical: the daunting costs, the lack of political consensus, the shift in attitudes toward large-scale urban development projects that displace entire neighborhoods. But the larger question is whether such a complex should be built in the first place. The idealistic assumption that sparked the creation of Lincoln Center -- that orchestras, opera companies, ballet troupes and theaters would have much to gain by becoming partners in a centralized complex -- would be vigorously challenged today. 
 Nothing can be more energizing to the cultural life of a city than dynamic performing arts institutions. But the danger in grouping them together is that the creative identities of individual institutions -- a bold modern dance company, a great symphony orchestra -- can blur behind the walls of an officious encampment. The promise of arts organizations working in sync can become a daily grind of competing boards and directors stifled by bureaucracy.
 These are the fair complaints that have been leveled at Lincoln Center and at cultural complexes that followed in other cities. Still, there is potential for synergy between performing arts institutions that share a common campus and a board of overseers. Lincoln Center was conceived with that vision. And today that spirit can best be felt each summer with the Lincoln Center Festival, when member institutions devise innovative, collaborative projects and presentations.
 So, for good and bad, New York is stuck with the mixed-bag that Lincoln Center has become. To its great credit the center is now in the midst of an ambitious $900 million renovation project that promises to galvanize, demystify and literally open up the plaza to new ventures and audiences.
 Lincoln Center dates from a time when cities were widely regarded as crowded, chaotic and forbidding. For arts enthusiasts, the new complex, which required clearing away more than 16 acres of a badly run-down neighborhood, promised to be safe, modern and convenient, a cultural citadel with concert halls, opera houses, a duplex theater and more, built with travertine columns and gleaming windows. There would be amenities galore and ample underground parking. Luring suburbanites to Lincoln Center was essential to its success. Once Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall) opened in 1962, it was possible for a music lover to drive in from the suburbs, park, have a little meal, attend a performance and return home without setting foot on a New York sidewalk. 
 It's worth remembering, as Eisenhower emphasized at the groundbreaking, that in addition to symbolizing America's increasing interest in ''cultural matters,'' Lincoln Center offered a ''stimulating approach to one of the nation's pressing problems: urban blight.'' Yet the families living in the tenements that the center supplanted would surely have stronger defenders today. 
 At the start almost everyone involved with Lincoln Center said the right things about access to the arts for all citizens. As Eisenhower put it, Americans would now have ''new and expanded opportunities for acquiring a real community of interest through common contacts with the performing arts.'' But however principled the intent, it was not matched by the imposing architecture, which suggested a ''little white palace on a hill,'' as Jane S. Moss, Lincoln Center's adventurous vice president for programming put it in a recent interview. 
 Back then, though it took much cajoling, the constituent institutions were willing to throw in their lots together. But today, when everyone seems to love cities again, most arts institutions in big metropolitan areas want their own turf so they can interact with neighborhoods and establish distinctive identities. Think of the Public Theater in the East Village, which opened in 1967 with an acclaimed production of ''Hair.'' Placing a theater way, way off Broadway in a run-down section of town was a leap of faith. Now the Public is the centerpiece of a thriving neighborhood, as Joseph Papp, the theater's visionary founder, was certain it would be some day. 
 For a time after Lincoln Center was built other cities raced to imitate it, even if many projects were ill-conceived, like the sprawling, ugly Barbican in London. The ideal of the cultural complex still holds sway in Dallas, where this fall the $338 million Dallas Center for the Performing Arts, dominated by a new house for the Dallas Opera, will begin its inaugural season. But that is an exception to a long trend away from collaborative centers.
 Some institutions -- like the Metropolitan Opera, a colossus with a devoted audience -- are so big that it hardly matters where they are located. That the Met is part of Lincoln Center minimally affects the way it functions. 
 But the struggling New York City Opera has been an unhappy fit at Lincoln Center since it moved to the New York State Theater (now renovated and renamed the David H. Koch Theater) in 1966. Its previous home, New York City Center, was far from a proper opera house, but the company had a feisty character there. At Lincoln Center, City Opera has long been the junior partner in a skewed arrangement with New York City Ballet. Being literally in the shadow of the Met has made it harder for City Opera to show the public that it is not a lesser Met but an alternative company with a different mission and inventive ethos. 
 In his 11 years as general and artistic director, Paul Kellogg tried mightily to extricate City Opera from Lincoln Center and move it to its own home. By the time he stepped down in 2007 he had given up. Now the company, which recently seemed close to collapse, has announced an intriguing, though much-reduced, season for 2009-10. In any case City Opera's current financial crisis is mostly the result of a bungled search for a new director and other bad decisions; the company's board has itself to blame for much of the trouble, not Lincoln Center. 
 Then there is the New York Philharmonic. In the mid-1950s, with John D. Rockefeller leading the way, the Philharmonic was the prime mover in getting Lincoln Center off the ground. Yet the orchestra suffered in the process of moving from the acoustically glorious Carnegie Hall. Today the Philharmonic must make do with a hall it finds acoustically disappointing, despite several extensive renovations over the years. Administrative and rehearsal facilities at the orchestra's Avery Fisher home are barely adequate.
 The Met also agitated for the creation of Lincoln Center. In June 1956 the Met and the Philharmonic signed a joint line of credit for $200,000 to start planning the big move. The Met's old house at Broadway and 39th Street was a grand, endearing and storied place with fine acoustics. But its exterior suggested ''police headquarters or the United States Customs,'' as the critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1960. And the backstage facilities were impossible. Large pieces of sets covered with canvas were sometimes lined up on the sidewalk outside. A new Met was badly needed, and the well-equipped house that opened in 1966 was deemed a success from the start.
 The Philharmonic was not nearly as fortunate. What is often forgotten in recounting the genesis of Lincoln Center is that starting in 1954, when talks of replacing Carnegie Hall with a hotel or office tower began in earnest, the Philharmonic had the option of buying the building. After several years of dithering, the Philharmonic passed.
 Why didn't the orchestra grab it? Hindsight is easy. At the time Carnegie Hall was run-down with a limited backstage area and essentially no lobby. Reports put the cost of renovation, including ''air-cooling,'' at $1.5 million, added to a purchase price that topped $4 million, a hefty sum for what would still have been an inadequate space for the orchestra. Yet had the Philharmonic taken the plunge, Lincoln Center might never have been built, or else it might have been scaled back to become essentially a new home for the Met. 
 On Sept. 23, 1962, Leonard Bernstein conducted the Philharmonic in the inaugural concert of Philharmonic Hall, with Jacqueline Kennedy among the honored guests. In The New York Times the next day Mr. Schonberg reported that the sound of the orchestra from one section of the hall was ''a little dry, with not much reverberation and a decided lack of bass.'' Other critics were much more negative.
 The inadequacy of Avery Fisher Hall's current acoustics is greatly exaggerated. On a good night, when the Philharmonic is inspired, the sound has richness, clarity and presence. Did anyone in the audience think about acoustics in January when Gustavo Dudamel conducted the orchestra in an electrifying performance of Mahler's Fifth Symphony?
 A bigger problem, reflecting the downside of being one of many Lincoln Center constituents, is the way the Philharmonic's tenant status is affecting the renovation of Avery Fisher. Plans are stuck in place because the orchestra and the center have been unable to agree on the nature and extent of the project. The auditorium seats 2,738. Ideally the capacity would be brought down to less than 2,400, the maximum, most acousticians agree, if an orchestral hall is to have vibrant sound. But Lincoln Center makes money from renters of Avery Fisher, including schools and colleges that need every available seat for graduation ceremonies. 
 Not surprisingly, Ms. Moss, the vice president, prefers to cite the benefits of having a single arts complex where different institutions share facilities and function as neighbors. Lincoln Center, she said, has an ''iconic meaning'' for the public.
 ''Having these arts organizations together, with this uber identity, has absolutely brought in new audiences,'' she added, calling it an ''extraordinarily democratic approach to the arts.''
 But it could also be argued that the complex's citadel-like feeling has deterred potential audiences. With its institutional appearance, Lincoln Center does not look at first glance like a place for innovative or experimental work. 
 And yet, thanks in part to Ms. Moss, the center has been a hotbed of unusual programming and creative educational projects for the last 15 years. It is significant, though, that some of the most daring recent presentations have occurred off campus, like last summer's multimedia production of Bernd Alois Zimmermann's visionary, complex modernist opera ''Die Soldaten,'' which the Lincoln Center Festival presented in the Park Avenue Armory. 
 To get a deeper sense of how Lincoln Center could live up to its dream of being a magnet for the city's artistic life, one has only to watch a video relay of a live Met performance in the plaza with crowds of grateful opera buffs, or witness Midsummer Night Swing, when the plaza is transformed into an outdoor dance hall. 
 In this regard the reopening of Alice Tully Hall in February -- the first completed project in the overall renovation -- is the most encouraging development at Lincoln Center in years. 
 The results are exhilarating. The old entrance made the hall look like a bunker protected from above by a useless pedestrian overpass. The inner lobby felt cramped and isolated. But now, with its expansive see-through lobby, an inviting new restaurant and fanciful outdoor courtyard, the hall practically shouts at people to come on in. 
 As the redevelopment continues, the willingness of the constituents to cooperate will be tested. The renovation of Avery Fisher Hall could force the Philharmonic into a nomadic existence for two full seasons. Will the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the very possessive resident ensemble at Alice Tully Hall, make multiple dates available for Philharmonic concerts? Will Jazz at Lincoln Center do the same? 
 Whatever one's take on the Lincoln Center at its 50-year milestone, the institution is certainly doing its part to stimulate the sagging economy. At a time of severe recession, when arts organizations everywhere are cutting back and even going under, Lincoln Center remains committed to its nearly $1 billion renovation project. Arts lovers in New York should be gratified to see the scaffolding and walled-off excavation sites in the plaza. Having long ago chosen the all-together-now approach to creating an performing arts complex, Lincoln Center is determined to make the best of it.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It will cost Americans 2 more cents to mail a letter starting Monday.
 The price of a first-class stamp will climb to 44 cents. It is the third year in a row that rates have gone up in May under a new system that allows annual increases as long as they do not exceed the rate of inflation for the year before. 
 While the increase will bring in added income, the Postal Service continues to struggle financially as more and more lucrative first-class mail is supplanted by the Internet and the recession discourages businesses from sending their usual volume of advertising.
 The Postal Service lost $2.8 billion last year and is $2.3 billion in the red so far this year.

HEADLINE: The Price of Staying Connected

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WIRELESS Internet access is no longer a rarefied luxury. It's free in cafes, parks, fast-food chains, campgrounds and gas stations -- yes, gas stations.
 Yet in some places travelers still must pay for Wi-Fi access, and perhaps nowhere is that more disturbing than in an upscale hotel room. 
 While many budget and midscale hotel chains have largely given up on charging guests for Wi-Fi, fees persist at more luxurious sister hotels -- typically about $9.95 to $19.95 a day. 
 Wi-Fi is free, for example, for travelers staying at Starwood's Aloft. At Starwood's W Hotels, the service costs roughly $12.95 to $16.95 for 24 hours. This disparity has long perplexed travelers. But in this economy, with expense accounts drying up and vacationers increasingly looking for deals, having to pay to use the Internet at your hotel seems increasingly absurd. 
 ''As far as I am concerned it is one of the most annoying of hotel charges,'' said Randall Stempler, a lawyer in Manhattan who travels often on business. The fee is ''exorbitant,'' he added, considering the time he usually spends logged in to check e-mail or go online. ''It should just be built into the rate, like electricity.''
 Many guests agree. Free in-room Internet access ranked as the most desired guest-room amenity in a national survey of 800 affluent travelers conducted in August by Ypartnership, a travel marketing firm in Orlando, Fla. That was above premium bedding and flat-screen TVs. A January survey of 6,300 people across 10 countries by the research firm Synovate found that 47 percent of respondents said a hotel must cater to their technology needs before they book it, with wireless access a top priority. 
 ''We are finding that it is now no longer an added feature to have wireless Internet in hotels, but rather it is expected,'' Sheri Lambert, a Synovate senior vice president for travel and leisure research, said in a statement. ''Travelers, whether for business or leisure, need to be connected.'' 
 Budget hotels, which have been offering free Wi-Fi for some time, are increasingly calling attention to the service as a way to stand out from more expensive hotels as travelers look for bargains in the recession.
 Starwood's new extended-stay brand, Element, has been highlighting its free Wi-Fi in local advertising campaigns for recently opened hotels in Las Vegas and Lexington, Mass. Homewood Suites by Hilton is running an advertisement that lists ''all the little extras that would otherwise eat into your expenses'' starting with high-speed Internet access. 
 Recognizing the resentment, a few upscale hotels have begun to drop Internet charges -- at least for some of their guests.
 Hyatt announced last month that it would waive the charge for in-room Internet access for members of its loyalty program at platinum and diamond levels. In March the luxury Liberty Hotel in Boston did away with the $10.99 fee it had been charging for Internet access and began offering free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.
 Some hotels, however, have taken the opposite direction. Thompson Hotels, a small group of boutique hotels that used to boast about free Wi-Fi, started charging $10 per 24-hour period earlier this year. ''As rates of all of the hotels have decreased,'' said Jennifer Walters, a publicist for the hotel group, ''certain services that don't affect all guests had to be altered -- one such item being Wi-Fi. Not all guests use it, so to include it complimentary in the rate no longer makes sense with the consumer wanting the most attractive rates.'' 
 Yet on the whole, more hotels do seem to be moving away from the fees. Over all, 15 percent of hotels charge for Internet service in a guest room, down from 22 percent in 2004, according to a 2008 survey by the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Those that still require payment for the service are overwhelmingly at the high end: 49 percent of luxury or upscale hotels charge for in-room Internet service compared with just 16 percent of economy or budget properties. Only 5 percent of midprice hotels require payment.
 Some major chains that charge for Internet service in guest rooms have been offering free Wi-Fi in lobbies, but travelers say it's not the same. 
 ''Everyone has to line up in the computer room, and the hotel lobby becomes an Internet cafe, which is rather unappealing,'' Kevin Leibel, president of a brand strategy company in Chapel Hill, N.C., wrote in an e-mail message from the business center at the Westin Palace in Madrid while on vacation. For in-room Internet, that hotel charges 18 euros for 24 hours (about $24 at $1.33 to the euro) or 12 euros an hour, but users are allowed 30 minutes at a time free in the business center. 
 So why do many upscale hotels continue to charge for Internet access while more affordable brands do not? The guest bending over a keyboard could be forgiven some impatience at hearing one explanation: the role of hotels' legal agreements on branding.
 ''In the management contract scenario, the brands would like to maximize revenue because all of that is subject to base management fees,'' said Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. When the ownership is through a franchise, as is typical with less expensive hotels, the hotel brands ''let the owners pay for installation and providing the service.'' 
 Hotels say Internet charges are driven by what the market will bear. Because travelers have been willing to pay extra at high-end properties, those hotels continue to charge. But that doesn't much change the experience for travelers who have paid for in-room Internet service at a Hilton, for example, but received it for free at a Hilton Garden Inn. 
 ''That's the big disconnect'' said Juliana Shallcross, senior editor at HotelChatter.com, where hotel Wi-Fi has become a frequent topic. HotelChatter issues an annual Wi-Fi report detailing hotel policies across various brands. This year, the report focused not just on which hotels were charging and which weren't, but also on reliability.
 ''What brings out the most ire,'' Ms. Shallcross said, is finding that not only is there a fee for the Internet connection, but also that ''it's not working.'' She recently paid $14.99 for in-room Internet at the Mirage in Las Vegas. First, she tried using the wireless option, but the connection was ''so terrible,'' she said in a post on HotelChatter, that she tried using the ethernet cable she found in a drawer. Still no luck. 
 ''After trying for about an hour to send an e-mail,'' she wrote, ''we got on the horn with the technician who said the modem looked zapped and that a technician would arrive to fix it. We waited for 45 minutes, and no one came. At 11:30 at night, we decided we could not afford to wait for someone to come as we needed to be up and working by 5:30 a.m. We called the front desk and asked for a different room.''
 At checkout, the Mirage removed the Internet charge from her bill.

HEADLINE: More Than a Numbers Game

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN. 
Walter Kirn is a frequent contributor. His most recent novel is ''The Unbinding.''

 BODY:
My boss delivered the news over the phone, while I was parked outside a Dairy Queen eating hot-fudge sundaes with my kids. It was bad news made to sound like good news, couched in the sort of chipper corporate double talk that tends to sharpen blows by trying to soften them. My position as a writer for a weekly national magazine (a job that had supported me for years; one I felt that I did well) was being ''redefined.'' Or was it ''modified?'' I don't quite recall the euphemism, only its bitter residue. I also distinctly remember thinking, as the dispiriting conversation ended and I looked up to see my children's faces smeared with chocolate sauce in the rearview mirror, that fatherly duty obliged me to wear a smile until I was alone, when I could weep. 
 The unemployment rate is an abstraction, an aggregation of bodiless data, but losing a job is a lived experience, written on the nerves. The numbers and the traumas are as different as thermometers and sunburns, but at times they influence each other. Five years ago, when the magazine dismissed me, fewer Americans were unemployed than are now, and I felt like a solitary reject in a nation of comfortable successes. Statistics weren't on my side. The company that misery is said to love was in comparatively short supply, while the shame that accompanies joblessness was abundant. If I were to get the same news now, in an era of mass layoffs and major bankruptcies, I wonder if I would suffer as I did then, lying in bed for three days straight eating cheese popcorn and watching pro wrestling. Maybe I would just shrug instead and head outside for a relaxing bike ride.
 But maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I would sleep for four days. The pain of being idled, acute in good times, may be just as keen or worse in hard times. The long-established correlation between unemployment and psychiatric distress -- depression, chronic insomnia, panic disorders -- doesn't suggest that there's any safety in numbers when it comes to the pain of losing a paycheck. And lately, the news has seemed to reaffirm this research, sometimes in lurid, bloody ways. Last month's mass shooting in Binghamton, N.Y., occurred several months after the killer's workplace, a vacuum factory, was shut down. Meanwhile, in Kansas City, Mo., the head of a shelter for victims of domestic violence said a recent surge in cases could be attributed to men who had been fired and were taking out their frustrations on their families. Even in the broadest, steepest downturns, not all Americans blame Wall Street or globalization for their plights. Some blame themselves and some blame everybody. Still others, not knowing whom to blame, explode.
 The Horatio Alger myth, so inspirational during periods of growth, may work against people during contractions. Its message of can-do individualism urges us to beat the odds, but it cuts us no slack when the odds grow terribly long. The impotent struggle to prevail against conditions that won't yield can prove the unmaking of self-made men, and perhaps turn them into madmen now and then. For true believers in the gospel of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, the notion that bootstraps sometimes snap -- and occasionally in great numbers, simultaneously -- is destabilizing and bewildering. To accept that this notion is true may suggest that you have been lied to about how the system works, provoking resentment. To deny this truth may convince you that the defect lies in yourself, provoking despair
 In his 2005 book, ''Born Losers: A History of Failure in America,'' the historian Scott Sandage offers a poignant cultural account of 19th-century economic hardships and the pitiable archetype they gave birth to: the dismal ''plodder,'' the man who was a ''failure.'' He was the fellow who couldn't get ahead, who couldn't break through and probably never would. The fatal flaw that supposedly distinguished these born nonentities was their lack, it was thought, of a certain crucial vitality. In an age that equated vigor with virtue, this weakness was tantamount to immorality. To make the loser feel even worse about himself, his glorious antithesis -- the striver, the up-and-comer -- was being defined at the same time. Writers promoting the secrets of success in the rough game of industrial capitalism rendered a verdict on economic failure that still endures: it's never an accident. The success people have is determined by who they are -- or rather, by who they aren't -- and not by circumstances.
 This brutish superstition persists, despite our increasingly scientific perspective on economic and financial developments. When experts wielding charts and graphs refer to ''bottoms'' and spells of ''negative growth,'' the jobless take scant consolation, I have a hunch. A nation that thinks of material well-being as the prize in a competition or a race instills in its citizens a moral horror of ever giving up, even if the contest can have few winners and the course is all uphill.
 When I heard I lost my job, my kids and I had just attended a baseball game. It was the first professional one they had ever seen, and I let them know that the home team, the Minnesota Twins, was the underdog. The Twins were behind in every inning, but in the ninth they got some lucky hits. I made my kids stand and holler with the other fans, explaining that the best, most memorable ballgames are won at the very end, against the odds. They nodded, taking this in, and when the Twins pulled out a victory, they danced. Then we went out for ice cream and my phone rang. I let my boss ramble long after I caught his drift, and long after I wanted to hang up on him. My kids didn't know what was happening, but I did: I was losing in the same way the Twins had won: abruptly and dramatically. But not inevitably, and not because it was rigged against me, I wanted to believe, which is why I masked my agony until I broke down later in my bedroom.
 Unless the children think the game is winnable, even when it's not, they might not play.

As if raising and nurturing future generations wasn't enough, mothers are also a force in propping up the economy. There are more than 80 million mothers in the United States, and as we honor them this weekend, businesses like restaurants, florists, jewelers, card shops, bookstores and phone companies are reaping the benefits. 
 Mother's Day is the No. 1 day of the year for dining out, according to the National Restaurant Association, followed by Valentine's Day. (Total mimosa and omelet consumption is surely far above normal.) 
 Mother's Day surpasses Valentine's Day in sales of flowers and plants combined, although Valentine's Day comes out ahead in sales of flowers alone, according to the Society of American Florists. The average amount spent on flowers and floral gifts last Mother's Day was about $45, according to the society.
 Phone calls also surge. Verizon says landline calls are typically about 18 percent higher on Mother's Day than on a typical Sunday. 
 Lawmakers and President Obama, then, have reason to be thankful for the economic stimulus package known as Mother's Day, approved by Congress and signed by Woodrow Wilson in 1914.

HEADLINE: Still Feeling Stressed Out

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE beginning of the end of the banking crisis or merely the end of the beginning? 
 That is what inquiring Americans want to know after last week's pronouncement that 10 of the nation's biggest banks must raise $75 billion by November if regulators are going to give them a clean bill of health. 
 Bank of America, Wells Fargo, GMAC and Citigroup are the neediest institutions, said government stress testers. Nine others, including Bank of New York Mellon, American Express and U.S. Bancorp, were deemed healthy. 
 ''The results released today should provide considerable comfort to investors and the public,'' Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a statement last Thursday when his office released the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. He added that nearly all of the tested banks had enough capital to absorb higher losses the Fed expected under its ''hypothetical adverse scenario.'' 
 With almost 40 pages of charts, graphs and scenarios, the program was a ''deliberately stringent test,'' its authors said. Clearly, the message they want to send is that the banking mess we have endured for the last two years is finally becoming manageable. 
 All is under control. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.
 Much as it would be a relief to move on, anyone in search of reality cannot yet conclude that the big banks are out of the woods. The government tests were, in truth, not exceedingly tough. And some of the program's ''adverse'' scenarios look more like a day at the beach. 
 ''Let's not call it a stress test,'' said Janet Tavakoli, founder of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm in Chicago. ''This was a test to try to get a measure of capital adequacy, using broad-brush percentages. I think what they are hoping is that the banks are going to be able to earn their way out of this.''
 Some might be able to do that, given the immense taxpayer subsidies they are receiving. Cheap money from government programs translates to delightfully low expenses and the potential for profits where there might otherwise be only losses. 
 But not all banks will be able to earn enough to see them through. And while no one knows how long our economy will remain under pressure, Ms. Tavakoli said she was certain that the stress tests' assumptions on worst-case losses at banks were too rosy.
 Under the government's so-called adverse scenario, for instance, banks may experience losses of 8.8 percent over the next two years on first mortgages they hold. A more likely figure, Ms. Tavakoli says, is 10 percent. 
 ''Given what has happened with the economy and unemployment, they are in massive denial,'' she said. Losses recently seen in Fannie Mae's portfolio support this view. In the first quarter, its subprime loans had average losses of around 68 percent; the Fed expects two-year losses in subprime to be, at worst, 28 percent.
 For investors interested in a stress test that is free of government spin, Institutional Risk Analytics, a bank analysis and risk management firm, published its own assessment of financial institution soundness last week. Using first-quarter 2009 reports on 7,600 institutions from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the analysis showed that banks were under increasing pressure. 
 Christopher Whalen, the editor of Institutional Risk Analyst, said that the data told him that bank losses would not peak until the end of the year; before he combed through the figures, he had thought losses would hit their highs in the second quarter. 
 Mr. Whalen said he pushed back his estimate for peak losses because banks continued to provision more for loan losses -- the reserves bankers set aside for future damage -- than they are actually writing off. ''We don't see charge-offs yet,'' he said. ''When you see banks charging things off, the reserve bill will have ended. Then, you'll know you are done.'' 
 In the meantime, taxpayer subsidies to banks will help offset some of the losses, he said. But keeping interest rates in the cellar to revive banks has significant costs, Mr. Whalen said. For example, institutions that have agreed to pay out interest on investments that are higher than prevailing rates -- think insurance companies and pension plans -- are getting killed. ''The Fed can't do this for much longer,'' he said.
 What's more, banks' costs for working out bad loans -- whether mortgages or credit card debt -- are rising, Mr. Whalen said. In previous downturns, for example, investors would step up and buy bad credit card debt from banks. Yes, the prices they paid were discounted, but at least the banks could write off the loans and move on. 
 Now, though, buyers for these hobbled portfolios are so rare, and the prices they will pay so low, that banks are hiring their own workout specialists to recover what they can from troubled borrowers. That costs. 
 It is good that the stress test circus is over. But two lessons remain. First, the effects of a debt binge like the one we have just experienced cannot be worked off either quickly or painlessly. Second, there is the matter of the government's credibility deficit. Maybe $75 billion will be enough to pull the big banks through this woeful period. But weren't some of the folks providing these estimates also those who assured us subprime would not be a problem? That, in fact, it would be ''contained''?
 Yes, indeedy.

HEADLINE: Cross County Center Is Revamping

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
 WHEN Cross County Shopping Center, one of the nation's first open-air shopping centers, opened to much fanfare here in 1954, well-known stars of the day like Martha Raye, Morey Amsterdam and Carl Reiner joined thousands of shoppers for the celebration. The ribbon-cutting was such a social event that 55 years later, Sandra Atlas Bass, the daughter of Sol G. Atlas, the developer, still remembers it, along with the festive hat her mother, Edythe, bought for the occasion. 
 ''It was the place to shop in those days,'' Mrs. Bass said. 
 Over the years, Cross County has fallen into disrepair and many shoppers have migrated to two upscale enclosed malls nearby in White Plains: the Galleria, which opened in 1980, and the Westchester, which opened in 1995. Yet Cross County remained among the largest shopping centers in the country.
 Now, the owners say they will move forward with a $250 million plan to renovate Cross County even as shopping centers and malls face the most challenging retail environment in decades and longtime retailers like Fortunoff and Circuit City are shutting their doors.
 The location of the shopping center, just 12 miles north of Times Square, is a major reason the owners are going ahead with the plan, said Alfred B. DelBello, a White Plains lawyer representing Brooks Shopping Centers of Manhattan, Cross County's owners. 
 Despite the lure of malls like the Westchester, Cross County's location at the crossroads of two major highways has contributed to its continued profitability, said Anthony J. Lembeck, chief operating officer of NAI Friedland Realty, a commercial real estate firm in Yonkers.
 The 71-acre shopping center, which has more than 5,000 parking spaces, is at the intersection of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and the Cross County Parkway. Its owners estimate that more than 222,000 vehicles pass by it each weekday and that it draws from a trade area that extends north into Westchester and south into the Bronx and parts of Manhattan. 
 Also, a growing number of older shopping centers around the country with outdoor parking and retail shops laid out along promenades began undergoing renovations in recent years and are finding success with shoppers. 
 ''We're seeing a lot of the older centers reinvent themselves as lifestyle centers,'' said Erin Hershkowitz, a spokeswoman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade organization. These reincarnations of the open-air mall resemble walkable downtowns, offering an array of shopping and dining options, along with spaces for socializing and people-watching. 
 No enclosed malls have been built in the United States since 2006, Ms. Hershkowitz said.
 Cross County's problems have included sections of its parking that buckled because they were built over a peat bog. Over time, storefronts also grew shabby. But because it continued to turn a profit, Cross County's owners were not under pressure to renovate it until recently, Mr. DelBello said. ''Now it's tired, very tired, and rundown,'' he said. 
 Despite its deterioration, the shopping center has long enjoyed a loyal base of customers, like Denise and Carlos Albarees of New Rochelle, who said they travel to Cross County regularly to buy clothing for themselves and their two children.
 Jasmine Bygrave, 13, of Mount Vernon, who was shopping with a friend recently, said she was 4 when she first went to Cross County with her mother. ''It's not so nice anymore,'' she said, ''but I still like the stores here.''
 Cross County caters to a middle-income market and will continue to do so, said John M. Genovese, the executive vice president for development at Macerich, a real estate investment trust based in Santa Monica, Calif., that has been hired to redevelop and manage the mall.
 ''The goal is to broaden the mix of tenants, to add new retailers, but not to make it into a high-end mall,'' Mr. Genovese said. ''Right now we don't have the right mix of merchandisers, and we want to draw back the customer who may not have shopped here for years.''
 Cross County's retailers in the early days included a John Wanamaker department store, Gimbels, F. W. Woolworth, Fanny Farmer Candies, Thom McAn Shoes and a Horn & Hardart Automat. That lineup is vastly different now.
 The renovation plans include an 11,000-square-foot expansion of Sears and a 75,000-square-foot expansion of Macy's, the mall's two major anchors. (Cross County pioneered the concept of a dumbbell-shaped mall, with an anchor store on each end and shops in between.)
 Edward J. Goldberg, a spokesman for Macy's, said it was ''starting to see signs of new vibrancy'' in the market. 
 ''The store at its present size can only do so much business,'' he said of Macy's at Cross County. ''So we're making an investment in the future. Eventually, the recession will go away.''
 Other major tenants include a Super Stop & Shop, a National Amusement movie theater complex and Old Navy, as well as smaller retailers including Aeropostale, Wet Seal, Claire's and Charlotte Russe. They will remain open during the renovations.
 The new tenants -- including AX Armani Exchange, Bebe, American Eagle and Victoria's Secret Pink -- were chosen to appeal to what is known as ''aspirational shoppers,'' who buy mostly moderately priced goods but also want to acquire at least a few brand-name luxury items, said Liz Pollack, a marketing manager for Macerich. 
 For the economically needy City of Yonkers, the refurbished mall will be ''a major, major revenue generator and a big employer,'' said David Simpson, a spokesman for Mayor Philip A. Amicone. 
 The mall currently employs 2,540 workers and will add 380 by the time the renovations are completed next year, officials said. Also, under an agreement with the city, the mall owners will pay property taxes starting at $6.4 million this year, up from $4.5 million in 2008, and increasing over the next 14 years to $13.5 million annually. 
 The city, which has a $903 million annual municipal and school budget and is facing a large shortfall, sorely needs the added revenues, Mr. Simpson said.
 Meanwhile, as the beeps and chugs of construction equipment echoed through the mall recently, Antonia Riley, a 13-year-old from Mount Vernon who was decked out in black jeans, a gray hoodie and purple running shoes, seemed unfazed by the disruption.
 ''Yeah, it's kind of noisy and messy around here, but I don't care,'' she said, ''because all our favorite stores are moving in.''

HEADLINE: Ethanol Industry's 15% Solution Raises Concerns

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to make an important and far-reaching decision this year that will affect more than 500 million gasoline engines powering everything from large pickups to family cars to lawn mowers: whether to grant the ethanol industry's request to raise the maximum amount of ethanol that can be added to gasoline. 
 That request has engine manufacturers and consumer advocates worried about possible damage, service station owners in a tizzy over the financial and legal implications and a leading petroleum industry group saying the move is unwise and premature.
 Specifically, ethanol producers are asking that the maximum ethanol content in the most common blend of gasoline be increased from 10 percent -- a limit set about three decades ago -- to as much as 15 percent. The blend the industry hopes will become common is known as E15, but the E.P.A. could approve a blend between E10 and E15. 
 Last year, nearly three-quarters of the gasoline sold in the United States contained some ethanol, according to the American Petroleum Institute. E10, which is 10 percent ethanol, is by far the most common fuel, though the E.P.A. has approved the use of ethanol blends up to 85 percent -- but only for the limited number of new and late-model cars and trucks certified by manufacturers as ''flexible fuel vehicles.'' The ethanol industry wants E15 to replace E10 as the standard fuel found at most stations. 
 The issue came before the E.P.A. in early March when Growth Energy, an ethanol lobbying group, and 54 ethanol manufacturers asked the agency for a waiver of the Clean Air Act so that more ethanol could be added to gasoline.
 Although the request went largely unnoticed by the public, it got the attention of anyone who makes or sells gasoline engines, as well as some environmentalists and consumer advocates.
 Approving E15 would have a huge impact on consumers, said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, and could cause problems including the voiding of car warranties. ''There's a lot to worry about,'' he said. ''All a consumer has to do is look at the fuels section of the owner's manual, which says that the use of fuel above 10 percent ethanol may result in denial of warranty claims.''
 Nearly 250 million cars and light trucks are registered in the United States, according to Experian Automotive. But the impact would be even broader. Kris Kiser, executive vice president of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, a trade group, estimates that a change would affect 300 million engines in everything from chainsaws to weed trimmers. 
 The National Marine Manufacturers Association says 12 million boat engines would also be affected.
 Growth Energy, whose co-chairman is Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general and former Democratic presidential candidate, has told the E.P.A. that it has proof from several studies that E15 will not damage engines and will result in cleaner air while reducing the nation's reliance on oil. 
 The studies were done by groups including the federal Energy Department, the State of Minnesota, the Renewable Fuels Association, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Minnesota Center for Automotive Research and Stockholm University in Sweden. 
 Michael Harrigan, a former Ford Motor Company fuel-system engineer who is now a consultant to Growth Energy, said automakers had been doing enough testing that there should be no problems using E15. 
 And Tom Buis, the chief executive of Growth Energy, said, ''We are confident in the science we prepared.'' 
 But confident or not, Growth Energy has plenty of opposition from groups that say some of the studies it cites are inconclusive. The critics also say its assertions are unproved and in some cases misleading.
 While automakers generally favor wider use of biofuels, Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing 11 automakers, said Growth Energy had failed to prove that E15 would not damage vehicles engineered to run on a maximum of 10 percent ethanol. More testing is needed, he said.
 ''We are not asking for this to be delayed forever,'' Mr. Territo said. ''We are asking for this to be delayed until the testing is complete.'' 
 Mr. Kiser, of the outdoor power equipment group, said some initial tests already indicated that E15 could cause serious problems -- including safety issues -- with some small engines. 
 At Honda, which makes a wide range of engines for products from minivans to power generators, the concern is that the effects of a big increase in an additive like ethanol are unknown, said Edward B. Cohen, vice president for government and industry relations at American Honda. ''The impact can be on the emissions system, like the catalytic converter,'' he said. ''It can be on the various tubes or couplings that are part of the fuel system, and it could affect the performance of the vehicle, particularly cold starting.''
 Honda can design engines to run well on new gasoline blends, Mr. Cohen said. The issue is the legacy fleet, whose engines were designed over two decades for varying requirements. There is no single answer, Mr. Cohen said, to the question of how E15 would affect them.The American Petroleum Institute is also concerned, said Robert Greco, the group director of downstream and industry operations. He said more research was needed -- probably several years' worth -- before the institute would be convinced that E15 was safe for so many different kinds of engines.
 ''We think that the current waiver request is premature,'' Mr. Greco said. ''The science isn't in yet.'' 
 And Jeremy Martin, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., said there was simply not enough solid information on which to make a decision that would have such a broad impact.
 ''We shouldn't just look at a little data and extrapolate,'' he said. ''There are rules here, and there are procedures. And there is a proper engineering way to come to this determination. One can guess about the most likely outcomes, but that is not sufficient to put all the fleet at risk.''
 Wendy Clark, group manager and principal researcher in the fuels performance group at the Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said a lot of credible organizations were studying E15. But she said it was too early to know for sure how engines would be affected.One question is how many of the studies will be done before Dec. 1, the date by which the E.P.A. is required by law to make its decision.
 Mr. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety said: ''What the ethanol people are asking the consumer to do is bear the risk. If only 1 percent of the vehicles on the road today had E15-related problems, that would be about 2.5 million vehicles.'' 
 Among those concerned about the proposed change are service station owners, many of whom fear that their pumps and fiberglass storage tanks would need to be replaced. They also fear legal problems including lawsuits from customers claiming their vehicles were damaged by the fuel.
 ''It is a horrible thing for our members,'' said Carl Boyett, president of the Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America.In their March request to the E.P.A., proponents of the waiver said E15 would provide ''increased energy security, enhanced economic development, creation of American jobs, reduced transportation costs and environmental benefits.'' The ethanol manufacturers contend that the increase is necessary because of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. That act includes a renewable fuels standard that requires a steady increase in the use of biofuels in the United States -- to 36 billion gallons in 2022 from 11 billion gallons this year. To meet the goals, refiners must add biofuels to gasoline.
 The industry has been meeting the requirements. In 2007 , it was required to use 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol and it actually used 6.85 billion, according to the petroleum institute. Last year, when the requirement was 9 billion gallons, the industry used 9.6 billion.
 But Americans are now buying far less gasoline than was expected when the law passed. That decline has the industry worried that as early as 2011 or 2012 it will be impossible to meet the renewable fuels standard with a 10 percent limit, Mr. Greco said.
 Mr. Buis of Growth Energy said: ''We are up against a blend wall. That cap needs to be raised.''
 While adding more ethanol would help refiners meet the law, it would not improve fuel economy. An October 2008 study for the Energy Department tested 16 late-model cars and found, on average, that mileage dropped 5 percent with E15 compared with gasoline that contained no ethanol.
 In deciding whether to raise the cap, the E.P.A. says it must consider not just emissions, but also vehicles' durability and drivability ''over their useful lives.'' The agency has acknowledged that E15 is a complex issue, given that engines vary widely in their age and sophistication. Some might run fine on E15 while others might be susceptible to problems. 
 The E.P.A. says one possibility is that it could approve the use of E15 for some vehicles or engines but not for others. 
 Mr. Martin of the Union of Concerned Scientists says tests may show that vehicles produced starting with 2004 models could run safely on E15. That year, more sophisticated engine controls were required, making it more likely their systems could detect and compensate for fuel variations.About 79 million cars and light trucks have been produced since the 2004 model year, Experian Automotive says.
 Mr. Buis of Growth Energy said that the advantages and safety of E15 were clear and that allowing higher ethanol content would help to make the nation less dependent on petroleum. He said there was no reason to delay.
 ''You know, some people don't want to do anything -- they just want to test, test, test or study, study, study,'' Mr. Buis said. ''You know, this nation has been stalling for 30-some years from becoming energy independent.''

HEADLINE: In Leaner Times, Classic-Car Auctions Turn On the Charm

BYLINE: By DONALD OSBORNE

 BODY:
PRESENTING a product to customers in the most favorable setting is a basic tenet of marketing, but rarely is the effort to influence shoppers taken to this extreme. 
 Next Sunday in Maranello, Italy, an auction of vintage Ferraris will be held in the logistics center of the automaker's famed Formula One racing team. The sale follows four days of buildup during which bidders registered for the auction can visit the Ferrari museum; tour the production facilities and factory Classiche division, the department that authenticates racecars and vintage road cars, and the Ferrari factory; see a private car collection housed in a 15th century castle; and sample some of the cars to be auctioned on the company's test track. 
 The activities, organized by RM Auctions in association with Sotheby's, are part of an annual sale called Leggenda e Passione, Italian for legend and passion. The participants are a select group of bidders -- the events are not open to the public -- who have traveled to Italy for the sale. 
 According to RM, the drives of auction cars at the test track are possible for those bidders who have shown interest in a particular vehicle; in the relatively small world of collector auctions, qualified buyers are typically known to the auction house from previous transactions. 
 While the level of marketing creativity at this sale is impressive, the level of showmanship at car auctions was increasing even before the economy slowed, with sale prices for collector cars repeatedly setting records. And the elaborate presentations were not exclusive to the toniest sales, either. 
 Many factors led to classic car sales catapulting from a low-key trade into a major pop-culture attraction, of course, including a frenzy over American muscle cars (especially among graying baby boomers) and a surge of interest for the concept cars created by automakers to display on the show circuit. 
 But there was a lot of show business involved, too. Cable TV coverage of the major auctions, complete with hours of breathless commentary, pumped up spectator interest. Visitors to the sales events were greeted by elaborate spectacles. 
 The publicity machine behind the popular Barrett-Jackson auctions raised the bar a few years ago when a Lifestyle Pavilion was added for the company's big winter sale in Arizona, offering fine dining, jewelry shops, cigar-rolling lessons and even an on-site spa, complete with Botox treatments.
 The RM program in Italy provides an indication of the relationship-building that sellers of top-flight classic cars are doing in 2009. Motivating potential buyers at the very top of the market has become a much more sophisticated business, well beyond signing up bidders and handing them paddles. 
 But the work seems to have paid off. At last year's Ferrari sale a 1961 250 GT California Spyder once owned by the actor James Coburn was bought by Chris Evans, a British radio show host, for $10.9 million. The price -- the highest ever for a car at public auction -- broke a 21-year-old record set by a 1931 Bugatti Royale, one of six made, sold by Christie's in 1987 for $9.7 million. 
 The rising status of classic car auctions has a parallel in the once-sleepy world of art auctions, which in the late 1950s also went from a no-nonsense wholesale market to a glamorous place to see and be seen. With Greek shipping tycoons, Hollywood stars and American bluebloods appearing at auctions and spending record amounts for paintings, the moment of the auction had arrived. 
 The crowning achievement came in 1957 when Sotheby's hired the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency to promote its sale of Van Gogh paintings in London. The agency daringly sent a preview invitation to Queen Elizabeth II, who actually attended -- and the auction business was never the same again. 
 Catching the attention of the world's deep-pocket car collectors takes more than printing a catalog, sending out invitations to a preview and providing a folding chair in the auction room. Connecting with these people lies more than ever in having ''really important and unique and significant cars to sell, cars that people have to have,'' said Peter Wallman, an autos specialist at RM Auctions who is based in London.
 The marketing strategy may also involve making the sale a destination experience; bidders are coming to Italy from North America and Europe, predictably, but also from Russia, Japan and Australia. 
 ''Selling Ferraris at their historic home, with Ferrari factory certification of originality, combined with experiences you can't buy, make it completely engaging,'' Mr. Wallman said. 
 The experiences this year, which is RM's third Maranello sale, include an opportunity for driving instruction by Ferrari test drivers in 599 sports cars on the Fiorano test track. And putting the vintage cars on the track for potential buyers proves that they are not just expensive eye candy. 
 That credibility was not lost on Dino Maggio, a Windsor, Ontario, collector who owns 40 cars. Mr. Maggio, 57, attended his first Maranello auction in 2008, when his son had a fast ride around the Fiorano circuit in what later became the $10 million Ferrari. ''Not many get to have that kind of encounter,'' Mr. Maggio said.
 After a factory tour, Mr. Maggio ordered a Ferrari F430 Scuderia, which is scheduled to be delivered this fall. 
 That all the vintage cars in the sale have the imprimatur of the factory through the Ferrari Classiche certification program is also important to Mr. Maggio. ''I want the real deal and best I can buy, and this way I have confidence,'' he said.
 While aggressive promotion of auctions as lifestyle occasions works well for events like the Barrett-Jackson events, auction companies at the high end of the market are not necessarily looking to follow suit.
 David Gooding, founder of the Gooding & Company auction company, is among those who remain unconvinced that a lifestyle approach is the only way to further engage potential customers.
 ''It's vital to have a better understanding of the cars being sold and the possibilities of what to do with the cars,'' Mr. Gooding said. He regards it as an almost curatorial approach, working to create an emotional connection between potential buyers and the cars offered for sale.

HEADLINE: Joy and Anticipation For Soldiers' Return Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: TEANECK 

 BODY:
 IN the next few weeks, the largest overseas deployment of the New Jersey National Guard since World War II is scheduled to come home, 2,850 soldiers returning to their loved ones. As head of the family support program for the Teaneck Armory, Master Sgt. Minnie Hiller-Cousins has to make sure those loved ones are mentally prepared for those soldiers.
 ''Put on your helmets!'' Sergeant Hiller-Cousins ordered the 50 wives and mothers who had come to a recent monthly family meeting at the armory. ''And keep those helmets on! Everyone must wear a helmet.''
 Over the next half-hour, as the sergeant explained the services available to their returning soldiers -- job counseling, health care, therapy for post-traumatic stress -- the wives and mothers progressed from feeling very silly in the helmets to feeling very uncomfortable in them. 
 ''It's heavy,'' said Cathy Jefferson, whose husband, Tom, is finishing his second Iraq tour.
 ''Hot and sweaty,'' said Iris Walls, whose husband, Gregg, is completing his first.
 ''It makes your hair itchy,'' said Adriana Roldan, whose husband, John, is also coming to the end of a second tour.
 ''Yes, it is miserable,'' said Sergeant Hiller-Cousins, who knows firsthand, having herself done a tour of Iraq in 2004. ''You wear that helmet long enough, your neck will hurt. Your soldier's been wearing that helmet every day for the last year. That helmet was their life.''
 The sergeant's lesson in empathy was not over. She gave several of the women yellow roses, then told them those may be the only roses they receive for a while. ''Soldiers in a combat zone, they forget to be sensitive,'' the sergeant said. ''It doesn't mean they're crazy, it means they're stressed out. When they get back to normal, you'll get your roses. Until then, if you need roses, give yourself roses.''
 RETURNING soldiers will not be the only ones on edge. The last year has been long and exhausting for the families holding down the home front, often made tougher by the national economic collapse.
 Although, by law, Guard members are guaranteed their jobs back, that is little solace if their employer goes out of business. National Guard members come from all walks of life, from stockroom workers at the now defunct Circuit City to stock brokers at the now defunct Bear Stearns.
 The unemployment rate for combat veterans ages 18 to 25 in 2008 was 14.1 percent, compared with 11.6 for nonveterans that age, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Veronica Cobb's husband, Rahaman, is due home in a few weeks with no job to return to. ''We've got a mortgage, we've got four children, we're definitely concerned about him not having a job,'' said Mrs. Cobb, a bus driver. For 14 years, Mr. Cobb was a data operator for The Star-Ledger of Newark, but the paper downsized while he has been in Iraq. Mr. Cobb opted for a buyout, his wife said, because they feared he could lose his job in a subsequent layoff. He was going to leave the Guard, but if he cannot find work, he plans to re-enlist. ''I don't want that,'' Mrs. Cobb said. ''I need him home.''
 Mrs. Walls's real estate business has nearly ground to a halt, and because her husband, Gregg, an accountant, has been deployed, she cannot work the extra hours she would like, to make up some of that lost income. Thursday nights, he would watch their two young children so she could stay late at her Manhattan office. ''You might get a rental walk in off the street,'' she said. Sunday is the big day for open houses. ''I couldn't always get a sitter.'' 
 Their children, 4 and 7, are at the stage when they need a parent, she said. ''Even when I'm working, it's hard to focus, I'd always have to run back for them.''
 ''November to February was scary,'' Mrs. Walls said. ''I did almost no business.''
 During her husband's first tour, Mrs. Jefferson, an assistant school librarian and the mother of five, got all the bills paid. This time, she has e-mailed her husband letting him know she is behind on many. ''I didn't want him coming home and being surprised,'' she said.
 Jean Michele Moore's husband, Patrick, a construction company director, has spent the last 18 months away, first training at Fort Benning, Ga., then stationed in Iraq. Mrs. Moore has been balancing a demanding job as a sales trainer for a pharmaceutical company with caring for her stepson, Austin, 12, who has Asperger's syndrome.
 She had lived with Austin about a year when his father was mobilized. ''Suddenly, I was a single parent for a child not my own,'' she said.
 This is not an economy where people can afford to take their jobs lightly. ''I don't have the kind of job where it's O.K. to have a bad day,'' Mrs. Moore said. ''No matter how I feel, I have to be smiling.'' And smiling is not natural on those mornings when the baby sitter arrives at 6:30 to get Austin on the bus to his special needs school, so Mrs. Moore can race off to an early meeting.
 STILL, at a time when so many Americans have lost jobs, these families count themselves lucky. Their soldiers have served their country and provided a dependable income with generous government benefits in exchange for this year of living dangerously.
 While her husband has been in Iraq, Mrs. Roldan bought their first house, a three-bedroom, one-bath in Bergenfield for $240,000. They could afford it, she said, because the Department of Veterans Affairs gave them a 4.5 percent fixed-rate mortgage, with no closing costs and no down payment.
 Before being deployed, Mr. Roldan, a mechanic, worked a second job as a superintendent at a Cliffside Park building, which provided his family with a basement apartment, rent-free.
 After he left, Mrs. Roldan became the superintendent. ''I thought I'd just be taking out the trash and recycling,'' she said. If only. She has had to teach herself to snake out toilets and sinks. ''I wind up snaking something about once a month,'' she said. Twice, the 18-unit building lost heat last winter. She learned how to drain a boiler and change the valves. And while the second deployment has been harder -- in addition to Brandon, 6, the couple now have a second child, Samuel, 18 months -- Mrs. Roldan said: ''I'm stronger, I feel I can do anything that comes this way. I've changed.''
 Mrs. Moore recently bought a house that her husband has not yet seen. ''I've sent him pictures, that's it,'' she said. ''I knew what he wanted -- it's the right house at the right price. I'm not putting my life on hold because he's gone a year and a half. It's not fair to me, not fair to Austin.''
 Mrs. Moore and her stepson have grown closer in their time alone together. With her help, he earned his Tenderfoot badge in Boy Scout Troop 77 in Westfield. ''It took him a little longer than most kids, but he can't wait to tell his dad,'' she said. To help Austin understand when his dad will return, she made a paper chain with 52 links. Each week, they rip one off, Austin writes a short note and they mail it to Iraq. ''Austin's not a great communicator, if he says 'tomato paste,' it's a big deal,'' she said. ''This is a way for him to send something to his dad.'' She keeps that chain in the dining room and they're both focused on how short it is getting. ''We don't have to talk about it, Austin sees his dad will be home soon.''
 THE happiest man at the Teaneck Armory may be Staff Sgt. Steve Lawrence, a National Guard recruiter. In 2008, he was tops in the state, putting in 30 recruits. As the economy fell into recession last year, he had people come in he had never seen in his four and a half years recruiting. ''I had a couple of real estate brokers,'' he said. ''That was new -- surprised me.''
 Sergeant Lawrence says the biggest reason people give him for signing up is education benefits: The Guard pays full tuition for any New Jersey state college.
 A very bad economy is very good for military recruiting. The national strength of the Guard is currently 358,000, 10,000 ahead of its goal. New Jersey currently has 6,230 in the Guard, against a goal of 5,990.
 As a result, the military is cutting signing bonuses and making it tougher to enlist. In the last few months, the National Guard has lowered the maximum age of eligibility to 35 from 42; raised the qualifying test score on the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery to 50 out of 100, from 31; and stopped taking anyone convicted of a felony, as well as most with misdemeanors, according to Sergeant Lawrence. ''The Guard will have a better quality of soldier,'' he said.
 Retention is up, too. For the first six months of this fiscal year, the state goal was to get 354 Guard members to sign for another tour; 433 have.
 So retention bonuses have been slashed. Until recently, the Guard paid a $15,000 bonus if a soldier re-enlisted for six years and $7,500 for three years; now it is $5,000 for six years and no bonus for three.
 Recruiters' quotas have dropped, to one per month from 1.75.
 ''The last six months, people were realizing the military has a lot to offer,'' said Lt. Col. John Sheard, the state recruiting commander. ''The economy is absolutely a factor. One of the building blocks. Like I tell people, I get my check every month on the 15th and 30th.''
 ABOUT 30 percent of this deployment is on its second tour, and the consensus among family members, state officials and soldiers stateside is that, to date, this has been a less dangerous, less stressful deployment. It appears that as announced at the outset, most of the soldiers have spent their time running Camp Bucca, a prison in southern Iraq.
 Still, family members are holding tight as they come down the homestretch. ''You never know about a suicide bomber or some inmate causing bodily harm,'' Mrs. Jefferson said.
 Each night, when Mrs. Roldan puts her 6-year-old to bed, they pray for a safe return. ''We pray for John in Spanish, I say it and Brandon mumbles with me.''
 Those who are doing this a second time, like Mrs. Jefferson, have tried to learn from their mistakes. When her husband got off the plane after his first tour, he greeted the family, but then she was hurt when he drifted back to his military buddies. ''The soldiers congregated in little groups, ignoring us,'' she recalled.
 ''This time, I have different expectations,'' she said. ''I understand he's been with these people for a year, that's what he's used to. Change takes time.''
 A few weeks ago, Mrs. Roldan felt sure she had come to her bitter end. In the span of a month, her mother suffered what was apparently a stroke, her husband's father had heart surgery and she was trying to buy a home herself, dragging two little boys from open house to open house. ''It was late, and I sat at the computer and I wrote John a long e-mail,'' she said. ''I wrote and wrote. I wrote everything I was upset about. I couldn't take it any more. I said, 'I can't believe I'm going through this by myself, I can't believe you did this to me.' I was crying, I was angry.''
 Then she deleted it and went to bed.
 ''I am done, I am so done,'' Mrs. Walls said. ''I'm always feeling frazzled and angry and like I want to kill somebody.'' In July, after her husband has been home a month, Mrs. Walls has planned a vacation to Miami -- with her girlfriend. ''I need me time. All I want to do is breathe and not be juggling all the time. I want to run again, go to the gym. My eating habits have been bad. A lot of stress puts on the pounds. I feel ugly, horrible.''
 Mrs. Roldan has planned a weekend trip to Atlantic City for July with two girlfriends who also have husbands deployed. ''We're not taking cellphones,'' she said. ''We want them to see what it was like. If they have trouble with the kids, they can fix it.''
 Even so, they cannot wait for those soldiers. ''Looking forward to it?'' Mrs. Jefferson said. ''Yes, I truly am.''
 ''Miss him so much,'' Mrs. Walls said.
 ''We need him so bad,'' Mrs. Roldan said.
 Mrs. Moore can see it clearly: ''I just want to sit with him on the porch and have a glass of lemonade -- actually, maybe a glass of wine.''

HEADLINE: The Ironic Nature Walk

BYLINE: By CHRIS RUEN

 BODY:
AT the northernmost tip of Brooklyn, in the area east of McGuinness Boulevard, there is an industrial wilderness, a home for rumbling trucks and silent brick warehouses adorned with wooden signs and chipped paint. 
 But on the corner of Paidge Avenue and Provost Street, just a short distance from Newtown Creek, a boulder sits like a giant trail cairn. Down the block, shining silver gates mark the entrance to the Newtown Creek Nature Walk. 
 The nature walk occupies an unsavory wedge of land, stuck as it is between a sewage treatment facility and the infamous creek that separates Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens, where decades ago more than 17 million gallons of oil seeped in from underground tanks. Yet, this contradictory nature walk, with its bleak concrete paths, holds truth for our confounding times. 
 Walking southeast from the boulder, an expanse of wastewater pools extend to your right. You may receive your first whiff of sewage as you approach the nature walk's tall entrance gate, which guards metal stairs and a wheelchair access ramp of tangled, Gehry-like proportions.
 Heading up the steps, you follow a brutalist concrete pathway, on either side of which thick gray slabs bow out like a ship's hull, rising and falling. Holes cut through the slab on your right are meant to mimic portholes. You look through one. Excited for natural scenery, you instead see a stretch of wastewater lagoons.
 Disappointed and confused, you make a 90-degree turn to the left that reveals yet another landscape.
 Heading along a straight path to the water ahead, the ''nature'' to be seen is strictly of the concrete, metal and glass variety. A sparkling new office building is visible on the right. An asphalt factory is on the left, along with rusty bulldozers that sit next to a conveyor-belt system bearing the word ''Gencor'' in large sans-serif type. The path allows unobstructed views not of hillsides or grassy fields but of trash, weeds and huge concrete barriers holding variants of sand and gravel.
 Heading down to the creek, you finally see a tree. It is thin, fragile, lonely and encircled by granite stumps. Chiseled into the stumps are a variety of Native American words: ''O jik ha da ge ga,'' ''Muscota,'' ''Mahicanituk'' and ''Mesaethes,'' which, according to a little surfing on the Web, translate as ''ocean,'' ''place in the reeds,'' ''river that flows both ways'' and ''great brook with tide.''
 IT'S easy to imagine this untouched inlet teeming with fish, seabirds, herons and crabs, a vast wetland expanding into dense forests across Long Island City and Manhattan Island. 
 But why dredge up this appealing memory of the area's natural beauty? Across Newtown Creek, all that can be seen are the graceless byproducts of urban development. The turquoise glass of the Queens Citicorp Building looks awful; it is architecture as toxic as its namesake's credit-default swaps. 
 The Queens-Midtown Tunnel spits cars and trucks out to the Long Island Expressway. Along the highway, colonies of looming billboards patiently await some driver's bored gaze.
 Continuing east along the creek, you notice that grass is largely missing from this nature walk. That's by design; get used to concrete and gravel.
 Wide steps descend into the water, providing access for brave fisherman and chemically immune kayakers. Be careful to avoid the combination of seagull droppings covering the steps from end to end and the dark sludge, risen with the tide. 
 The water is murky. On sunny days, dark, swirling rainbows of oil glide across the creek's surface. Looking downstream, you see the inspirational beauty of the Manhattan skyline. But this nature walk is more about what's in front of you, that which sustains the city.
 There are birds, yes. A swarm of seagulls is in constant motion across the creek. They hover around a giant industrial claw that swings back and forth, filling a barge with scrap metal and impounded cars. This is where the building blocks of our civilization go to die, taken on a barge out to sea.
 Walking along the water, you hear an aerated sucking sound, its source unknown. Muffled echoes from loudspeakers mix with clanking machinery, the screeching of hungry gulls and falling piles of scrap metal crashing across the water. Around every corner you find another emergency telephone -- someone is very concerned about your safety here.
 When we think of nature, we imagine ourselves alone, surrounded by untouched beauty, connecting with our collective memories of the world as it was at the dawn of humanity. But ''nature'' is also defined as a characteristic or state of things, and this alternate meaning carries its own weight.
 The nature walk is itself a byproduct of industrial growth. When the city's Department of Environmental Protection approved a $3 billion expansion for the sewage treatment plant, a fraction of the budget was set aside for artwork. The city also agreed to provide public waterfront access as a concession to the community. Nine years and $3.2 million later, the nature walk was born. That the pre-apocalyptic landscape of Newtown Creek, so unready for the spotlight, would be put on close display in the process was incidental.
 Past the boulder cairn at Paidge and Provost is a symbol of who we are and what we have made here on earth, like it or not -- an unusually honest space in which to contemplate the nature of our city and our civilization. As much as we have created the grand cultural playgrounds of Manhattan, we have also created the wretchedness of Newtown Creek. The two worlds need each other and cannot be set apart, though much of our economic system takes great pains to encourage the illusion that this is not the case.
 As I left the nature path one day, I lingered at the granite steps.Suddenly, a creature popped out of the water in front of me, some kind of seabird, maybe a double-crested cormorant. 
 Long-necked, with a thin hooked bill, it dived into the creek. When the bird re-emerged, it had a small fish in its bill, struggling to break free. The cormorant flicked the fish into its mouth and swallowed it whole. I watched, entranced, as the bird moved slowly along the creek and toward the East River, diving again and again to explore the water's depths.
 Nature has a way of surprising you.

HEADLINE: The Two Sides of 'Star Trek'

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
It takes a certain mix of optimism and frustration to contemplate the possibility of space travel. To dream of navigating the cosmos is to assume that man has the resources and the know-how to propel himself into the heavens, but also some compelling reasons to exchange his home planet for the cold vast unknown. 
 It was these seemingly contradictory impulses that shaped ''Star Trek,'' the supremely influential science-fiction television series whose three-season run yielded 40 years of sequels and spinoffs including a new feature film about the origins of Kirk and Spock that opened on Friday. Yes, the series is at heart a geeky space epic, but it is also one with a political and historical context. 
 When it was created by Gene Roddenberry in 1966, ''Star Trek'' was meant to expand the notions of what a unified world could achieve -- a mission that was deeply complicated by the turmoil of the era. And the newest incarnation of ''Star Trek'' arrives at a moment when the country again finds itself teetering between limitless potential and peril, yearning to boldly go in all directions but potentially stuck in neutral. 
 The original ''Star Trek'' imagined the futuristic fulfillment of John F. Kennedy's inspirational oratory, in which his New Frontier became ''the final frontier.'' The budget surpluses and budding space program of the early 1960s gave rise, in the 23rd century, to the utopian United Federation of Planets. On the Starship Enterprise, men and women, blacks and whites, Americans, Russians and Asians -- with names like Uhura, Chekov and Sulu -- worked side by side, reflecting Mr. Roddenberry's belief that ''when human beings get over the silly little problems of racism and war, then we can tackle the big problems of exploring the universe,'' said David Gerrold, a writer for the original ''Star Trek'' series.
 But events during its brief original run -- the race riots of Newark and Detroit; the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and the nation's ever-deepening commitment to the Vietnam War -- inevitably affected the tone of the show. By the second season, episodes like ''A Private Little War'' (in which Captain Kirk attempts to balance an arms race between two extraterrestrial tribes) were commenting on America's intervention in Indochina.
 As Richard M. Nixon was entering the Oval Office on an anodyne platform of peace, ''Star Trek'' was blunter with its audience. In the episode ''Let That Be Your Last Battlefield'' that aired in January 1969, Kirk was giving dire warnings to aliens -- and by extension, to viewers -- that they would ''end up dead if you don't stop hating.''
 Forty years later, as ''Star Trek'' is returning to its past so is America: the country is again gripped by anxieties about entanglements abroad, compounded by the fear that the economy could collapse at warp speed. A cautious optimism has emerged in the afterglow of the election of President Obama (whose Vulcan-like composure has invited frequent comparisons to Mr. Spock), but a surge of foreign violence, a swine flu outbreak or any number of other events could easily dampen that mood. 
 Under President Obama, ''we're starting the era of the 1960s in 1967,'' said H. Bruce Franklin, a professor of English and American studies at Rutgers University who was the guest curator of the National Air and Space Museum's ''Star Trek and the Sixties'' exhibition in the early 1990s. ''Culturally we're reinventing the '60s, but economically we're reinventing the '30s.'' 
 In recent decades, Mr. Franklin said, ''Star Trek'' ceded its position as America's dominant science-fiction mythology to ''Star Wars'' -- both the Reagan-era missile defense program and the George Lucas movies (which in turn were influenced by Depression-era serials and World War II dogfights). 
 Roberto Orci, who wrote the new ''Star Trek'' movie with Alex Kurtzman, acknowledged that its retro vision of an Earth at peace was meant as a tonic for an era when people wonder if perpetual war is becoming the norm. ''We're smack-dab in the middle of that very debate,'' he said, pointing to the growing American military presence in Afghanistan and an increasingly worrisome situation in Pakistan. ''It couldn't be more stark now.''
 The new film has plenty of modern-day angst to address too: the efficacy of torture is touched upon (though only the film's villains employ it); an entire planet central to ''Star Trek'' lore is destroyed, intended by the writers as an amplified metaphor for the 9/11 attacks. 
 And a scene in which an aged version of Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy) converses with his younger self (played by Zachary Quinto) becomes a platform for the regret that the grown-up children of the 1960s feel for letting down the youth of today, just as they might have felt they were let down by their leaders. ''It's kind of a baby boomer apology for where we are,'' Mr. Orci said. ''Not that I'm asking for the baby boomers to apologize.'' 
 But at least one person closely identified with ''Star Trek'' argues that for all the ways in which the franchise has been affected by current events, its optimistic vision has persisted . 
 ''A lot of science-fiction is nihilistic and dark and dreadful about the future, and 'Star Trek' is the opposite,'' Mr. Nimoy said. ''We need that kind of hope, we need that kind of confidence in the future. I think that's what 'Star Trek' offers. I have to believe that -- I'm the glass-half-full kind of guy.''

HEADLINE: The Recession Made Them Do It

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Not long ago, the sheriff of Wayne County in Michigan warned that the wave of foreclosures sweeping across Detroit and the rest of his territory was a threat to law-abiding citizens.
 ''Public safety is imperiled,'' Sheriff Warren C. Evans wrote to the governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, ''by the number of foreclosed citizens living on the street or committing crimes with the actual intent of being jailed.''
 Stripped of their own house, the foreclosed were choosing the Big House. 
 This is the sort of misfortune that happens when times are bleak and so many are pushed to the brink. Crime and violence of all sorts ramp up. People burn their cars for the insurance money. They rob. They steal. They kill themselves. 
 Or so we assume. But if bad times have a special mythology, the reality is more elusive. In this extreme recession, reports of such incidents are easy to find -- despite the fact that actual statistical increases in such behavior are often inconclusive if not downright illusory. The American Association of Suicidology, for instance, felt compelled to issue a statement in January saying that historically there is no clear association between periods of economic distress and suicide. Maybe this recession will be different, but that will not be clear until all the numbers have been collected a few years from now.
 The voluntary prisoner in search of ''three hots and a cot'' is a persistent figure in American popular culture. He turns up in the folklore of the Depression and reappears in Bill Sands's ''My Shadow Ran Fast,'' a bestseller in the 1960s that humanized life behind bars. And of course there was Otis Campbell, the town drunk on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' who let himself in and out of his cell at whim. 
 A spokesman for Sheriff Evans, who was pursuing an ill-fated bid to become mayor of Detroit, referred me to Jeriel Heard, Wayne County's chief of jails and courts. ''Before, we would get a dozen voluntary incarcerations a year,'' Chief Heard said. ''Now we're looking at four or five a week.'' 
 The crimes committed were mostly of the public-disorder variety, he said, purposely done in front of the police to attract their attention: throwing an empty wine bottle or urinating in public, perhaps breaking into a foreclosed house. The offenders were seeking not only food and shelter but medical care. They had no previous criminal history. ''The criminal justice system,'' Chief Heard said, ''is becoming the safety net of last resort.''
 Chad Audi, the president of Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a program that operates a shelter and works with former prisoners, also said he was seeing a troubling increase in intentional commitments, although in his experience the people involved often had done time before.
 ''They love to go to jail, because this is their comfort zone,'' Dr. Audi said. ''One man told us he went and stole a bag of chips from a gas station just so he could go to jail and get help for his teeth. That is how petty this is.''
 With the jails filling up, Dr. Audi said he worried that the lawbreaking would not remain petty much longer. ''People will be forced to commit a violent crime to get into the system,'' he said. 
 As if in confirmation, a man named James A. Roberts in February robbed a bank in Lincoln, Neb., of $3,000, and then waited outside until the police came. Mr. Roberts, 52, told the police that he had been laid off and could not find a place to live. In his mug shot, he looked pleased. 
 Examples in Detroit, however, have been harder to come by. Chief Heard agreed to set up an interview with a prisoner driven to crime by the recession the next time one arrived. But no one did. Social service workers were generally dismissive of the idea. In the shelters, the homeless said they had heard stories of people intentionally getting themselves locked up but that was long ago.
 One of them, Kevin Allen, 54, said he couldn't imagine trying to put himself in jail. ''I did six months when I was 18, and that was enough for me,'' Mr. Allen said.
 The mythology of bad times also calls for a rise in insurance scams. Accounts of car torchings are indeed plentiful. A Tucson man who owed much more on his 2006 Dodge Charger than it was worth is accused of persuading his daughter's boyfriend to set it on fire. In exchange, the man agreed to let the boyfriend marry the girl. Both are now facing charges. There have been dozens of other stories only slightly less bizarre.
 Yet research by John R. Hall Jr. of the National Fire Protection Association has shown that intentional fires of all sorts have been declining since 1980, and that there were no notable spikes in recession years. One reason: Revenge or spite was a more common motive in arson than profit.
 If any crime were boosted by economic downturns, it would likely be burglary and other forms of theft. But in Los Angeles, where unemployment and foreclosures are rampant, crimes of all types are falling. Property crimes, for instance, are down 7 percent this year compared with 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department said last week. 
 As for Detroit's voluntary incarcerations, the chief of jails now says the people doing this are so unbalanced they literally might not know what they are doing.
 Brian Moore, a 49-year-old homeless Detroit man, says he thinks that is about the only way it could be happening.
 Some time ago, in the middle of a miserable winter, Mr. Moore was so empty of luck that he decided he had no choice but to go back to jail. He had only a single dollar left, he recalled, and it was ripped in half. So he decided to go to a neighborhood restaurant, where he would stuff himself and then reveal he had no money. The police would handle the rest.
 At the restaurant, Mr. Moore feasted on meatloaf and mashed potatoes and fried chicken while drinking three cups of coffee and a bottle of soda. The waitress was already eyeing him suspiciously. All he had to do was confess. But with his stomach full and his body warm, freedom regained its allure, he said. Mr. Moore waited until the waitress was distracted and then ran out the door.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
Colorado
 VAIL INTERNATIONAL DANCE FESTIVAL, July 27-Aug. 11. One suspects that grander platforms than Vail await Damian Woetzel, but the post-stage life of this former New York City Ballet star is off to a good start. As the director Mr. Woetzel lands big names -- Savion Glover, Edward Villella and his Miami City Ballet, Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company -- but aims for intimacy, inviting a few artists to talk as much as they perform. Tickets will no doubt go fast for an evening in which the powerful contemporary ballerina Wendy Whelan is joined by Morphoses in a performance that surveys her dazzling career; Mr. Woetzel and Christopher Wheeldon, the hosts, will serve as guides. (888) 920-2787, vaildance.org.
 Connecticut 
 INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ART AND IDEAS, New Haven, June 13-27. New Yorkers pining for Cathy Edwards, the visionary curator who left Dance Theater Workshop in 2006, might consider a Metro-North trip to see what she's up to here. It sure looks good on paper: a premiere by Wally Cardona and Phil Kline; Mark Morris's knockout dance-opera ''Dido & Aeneas,'' with Mr. Morris conducting; and a preview of ''The Good Dance -- dakar/brooklyn,'' a hugely exciting collaboration between the stellar American choreographer Reggie Wilson and the Congolese choreographer Andreya Ouamba, which will have its premiere this fall at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (888) 736-2663, artidea.org. 
 Illinois
 CHICAGO DANCING FESTIVAL, Aug. 18-22. As recession specials go, this one is first-rate: four free events featuring choreographers like Trey McIntyre, William Forsythe and Jerome Robbins, performed by members of the Joffrey Ballet, Oregon Ballet Theater and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. (312) 520-2210, chicagodancingfestival.com.
 RAVINIA FESTIVAL, Highland Park. June 5-Sept. 19. Ravinia concludes its Lincoln bicentennial celebration with a dance bang: a commission from Bill T. Jones, inspired by Lincoln's life and legacy. Mr. Jones has a history of taking on ridiculously big subjects, and Ravinia, hoping to avoid a dreary, stilted hagiography, chose him in part because the resulting dance-theater works have often had polarizing effects. Hold onto your hats. (847) 266-5100, ravinia.org.
 Maine
 BATES DANCE FESTIVAL, Lewiston, July 11-Aug. 8. This understated teaching festival has a loyal following and plenty of cheap or free dance-related offerings. Performance highlights include veterans like the Bebe Miller Company and the rising young choreographer Kyle Abraham. (207) 786-6381, batesdancefestival.org.
 Massachusetts
 JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL, Becket, June 20-Aug. 30. America's big dance festivals aren't exactly known for being adventurous, but there are a few surprises at the Pillow this year, including the premiere of ''Orbo Novo'' by the Belgian choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui; a European biggie, he is scarcely known here. Other offerings of note: Pacific Northwest Ballet's all-Ulysses Dove program, Merce Cunningham Dance Company and the fierce, sophisticated hoofer Jason Samuels Smith. (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org.
 SUMMER STAGES DANCE, Concord, July 9-25. How, you ask, does a punk ballerina age? Karole Armitage's 1985 heavy-breather, ''The Watteau Duets,'' will offer a glimpse during this year's festival, which showcases results from a residency partnership with the Baryshnikov Arts Center. David Parker and the Bang Group, meanwhile, celebrate their 10th annual Summer Stages season. (978) 402-2339, summerstagesdance.org. 
 TANGLEWOOD, Lenox, July 3-Aug. 23. Music festival, schmusic festival. The Mark Morris Dance Group will unveil two works, ''Visitation,'' set to Beethoven's cello sonata in C, and ''Empire Garden,'' to Ives's trio for violin, violincello and piano, at Tanglewood in August. Mr. Morris is also crashing Mostly Mozart with these dances, which feature quite the musical trio: Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax and Colin Jacobsen. (888) 266-1200, tanglewood.org. 
 Minnesota
 MOMENTUM, Minneapolis, July 16-25. The Twin Cities constitute an intriguing arts hub, and the dynamic, progressive Walker Art Center is a big reason: if its senior performing arts curator, Philip Bither, identifies a choreographer as noteworthy, we all should keep an eye out. A partnership with the Southern Theater, Momentum features four commissions by local talent, co-curated by the two institutions and community artists. (612) 375-7600, walkerart.org.
 New York City
 BOOGIE DOWN DANCE, the Bronx, through June 3. This marvelously inclusive community festival features top-notch talent, including the virtuosic house dancer James (Cricket) Colter, Desmond Richardson and the John Jasperse Company. (718) 842-5223, bronxacademyofartsanddance.org.
 CENTRAL PARK SUMMERSTAGE, June 12-Aug. 16. SummerStage offerings can often seem happily incidental to the crowd's revelry. Not this one: a commission from Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company and the witty singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright is among this year's free dance offerings. (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org. 
 EVENING STARS, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Aug. 1-2. The Dia:Beacon Events sell out. The Brooklyn Academy of Music 90th birthday celebrations sold out. One shudders to think what the crowds will be like when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company unveils a new, free Event. (212) 242-0800, joyce.org. 
 LA MAMA MOVES! La MaMa E.T.C., through May 31. Just four years old, this festival has fast become a local fixture, specializing in idiosyncratic variety. One program to look out for is Cunningham Generations. Featuring company alumni like Kimberly Bartosik, Foofwa d'Imobilite and the always worthwhile Douglas Dunn, it traces a few of the many roads leading back to the grand old master. (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. 
 LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS, Aug. 5-23. While the Lincoln Center Festival trots out predictable contenders (Shen Wei and Emanuel Gat), you'll find a more lively and diverse crowd at this series of free events, whose resemblance to the main festival ends with its name. There's authentic New York street art (Kwikstep and Rokafella's Full Circle company anchors Hip Hop Generation Next) and New York as melting pot, via troupes like the Urban Bush Women and Afro-Peruvian Caracumbe. (212) 875-5766, lcoutofdoors.org. 
 SITELINES, Lower Manhattan, May 31-Aug. 13. The good news about site-specific dance: the funky New York sites. The bad news: sometimes those sites are the only good news. This free series, part of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's River to River Festival, often has better intentions than results. But Nicholas Leichter and Monstah Black should have delicious, swaggering fun at the Seaport. (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines.
 TAP CITY, New York Library for the Performing Arts and Symphony Space, July 8-10. Sadly, it's always festival season for tap, a shamefully marginalized American art form that has retreated largely to a festival circuit. The main event of Tony Waag's Tap City reads like a who's who: Brenda Bufalino, Michelle Dorrance, Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Derick K. Grant, Jason Samuels Smith and more. (646) 230-9564, atdf.org.
 New York State
 BARD SUMMERSCAPE, Annandale-on-Hudson, July 9-Aug. 23. Wagner is this year's theme, so perhaps we're meant to expect Gesamtkunstwerk from the collaborative opener: ''Dance,'' Lucinda Childs signature 1979 work, which includes a Philip Glass score and Sol LeWitt film. (845) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu.
 MOUNT TREMPER ARTS FESTIVAL, July 11-Aug. 29. In true do-it-yourself New Yorker fashion, the choreographer Aynsley Vandenbroucke and the photographer Mathew Pokoik have started a multidisciplinary arts center in the Catskills, complete with residencies and this festival. Whodoesn't want to escape to the Catskills? Artists like robbinschilds and the Collective Opera Company are just the icing on the cake. (845) 688-9893, mttremperarts.wordpress.com. 
 NEW YORK CITY BALLET AT SARATOGA, Saratoga Springs, July 7-18. City Ballet's summer stint in the countryside has a poignancy this year: it will be the end of the road for the 11 corps dancers whose contracts were not renewed, adding them to the growing ranks of economic casualties in the performing arts. The season, though one week shorter, offers a full array of ballets, including a new Benjamin Millepied work, Christopher Wheeldon's ''Mercurial Manoeuvres'' and lots of Balanchine. Here's hoping the departing artists get many opportunities for glorious dancing. (518) 584-9330, spac.org.
 North Carolina
 AMERICAN DANCE FESTIVAL, Durham, June 11-July 25. Even this modern dance bastion isn't immune to the economy. The festival is a week shorter and somewhat thinner. But much remains the same in terms of programming: Shen Wei, Paul Taylor and Pilobolus are among the all-too-usual suspects. Bright spots include Twyla Tharp and William Forsythe works by the Aspen Santa Fe Ballet and, in a sign that the festival may finally be letting in exciting younger contemporary choreographers, a premiere by Faye Driscoll. (919) 684-6402, americandancefestival.org.
 Oregon
 TIME-BASED ART FESTIVAL, Portland, Sept. 3-13. One of the best summer festivals comes at the end, courtesy of the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art and the news guest artistic director, Cathy Edwards, who will get to program somewhat more adventurous material than her New Haven mandate typically allows. Increasingly, contemporary dance is part of a wider, non-genre-specific conversation about performance. Festival artists like Miguel Gutierrez, Sharon Hayes, Meg Stuart, Young Jean Lee and Danielle Goldman prove just how rich this conversation is. (503) 242-1419, pica.org.
 Pennsylvania
 PHILADELPHIA LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE, Sept. 4-19. These coinciding festivals offer the best of both worlds: the something-for-everyone Fringe smorgasbord and, in Live Arts, a thoughtfully constructed look at multidisciplinary performance work by the producing director Nick Stuccio, one of the field's bright lights. (215) 413-1318, livearts-fringe.org.
 South Carolina
 SPOLETO FESTIVAL USA, Charleston, May 22-June 7. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater continues its 50th anniversary tour with a program that includes -- wait for it -- ''Revelations.'' Spoleto sticks mainly to crowd pleasers with Noche Flamenca and Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, which, like Ailey, offer variations on the theme of virtuosity. But Basil Twist's sublime puppetry choreography, showcased in his ravishing ''Dogugaeshi,'' should prove the highlight. (843) 579-3100, spoletousa.org. 
 Virginia
 WOLF TRAP VIENNA, June 16-Aug. 19. It's debut city at Wolf Trap: Rasta Thomas's Bad Boys of Dance, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet and -- better late than never -- the Merce Cunningham Dance Company as it continues its extended 90th birthday victory lap. Wolf Trap has also commissioned the all-American choreographer Trey McIntyre to make a new ballet for its Face of America: Glacier National Park series. (877) 965-3872, wolftrap.org.

HEADLINE: With a Blank Slate, Dutton Creates His Own Willy Loman

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
THEY don't applaud when Charles S. Dutton makes his entrance in ''Death of a Salesman.'' At least they didn't on opening night, a week ago Thursday, at the Yale Repertory Theater.
 It's not that there isn't a sense of star-presence excitement. It's not that the audience doesn't recognize Mr. Dutton as the man they came to see. It would just seem disrespectful toward his Willy Loman, a clearly exhausted man coming home late at night and dropping his heavy valises on the kitchen floor with palpable despair.
 ''Willy opens the play with those bags, already a beaten man,'' Mr. Dutton said in a telephone interview the next morning. ''You think the character has nowhere to go. But that's the challenge of the acting of the role -- that you have nowhere to fall.'' 
 Loman, one of American theater's great tragic figures, is an old-fashioned traveling salesman in his 60s, who learns that loyalties fade as youth and vigor do and that possibly he was never really well liked after all. He is pressed for cash, disappointed in his two underachieving grown sons and convinced that everything he has done in life has been a mistake. This is not a role to be taken on lightly.
 ''When I read it as a young student, I thought it was easy,'' said Mr. Dutton, 58, speaking from his temporary New Haven apartment. ''It is to date the most difficult thing I've ever played.''
 Oddly, he admitted, he had never seen a single film or stage production of ''Death of a Salesman.'' That left him with a blank slate for creating the character.
 ''I was tempted a few times to rent the movie -- the Lee J. Cobb, the Dustin Hoffman,'' he said. ''At night on Chapel Street, I would stop at the video store. But I kept saying, 'No, no, no.' ''
 And he's pleased with the way things have gone. ''As exhausting as it is to play him, it is a great joy to play him,'' Mr. Dutton said of Willy. ''I haven't had this much fun in 19 years.''
 The year 1990 was the last time Mr. Dutton appeared in a new stage play, August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ''The Piano Lesson.'' (He starred as Levee in ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' in 2003, but that was a reprise of his 1984 role.)
 He did stay busy with screen work, however. Mr. Dutton, who will star in a remake of the film ''Fame,'' scheduled to open this fall, played the title role in the acclaimed 1991-94 television series ''Roc.'' His more than two dozen feature films after ''The Piano Lesson'' included the sports biography ''Rudy'' (1993), ''Aliens 3,'' ''Menace II Society'' and ''The Distinguished Gentleman'' (all 1992), Mira Nair's ''Mississippi Masala'' (1991) and Robert Altman's ''Cookie's Fortune'' (1999). 
 He was a little too busy with television and film, in the opinion of Lloyd Richards, the former artistic director of Yale Rep and dean of Yale School of Drama, who had cast Mr. Dutton in ''Ma Rainey's'' when the younger man was still a Yale drama student.
 A primary reason for Mr. Dutton's return to the stage was a conversation he had with Mr. Richards in 2006, at a lunch that took place two months before Mr. Richards died, at 87.
 ''We're at lunch talking, reminiscing, talking old times, and then he stated very bluntly to me, 'Do not waste any more of your theater years,' '' Mr. Dutton recalled. ''Lloyd said: 'You've wasted too many of them. You've got to play the great roles.' And I made him a promise.''
 Mr. Dutton had already begun discussions about ''Death of a Salesman,'' but Mr. Richards's advice made him more determined than ever. At that point, this production wasn't planned as an African-American version of the play, he said. In fact, it looked as if Meryl Streep might play Willy's fiercely devoted wife, Linda. But she and Mr. Dutton couldn't find dates when both were free. The role is being played by Kimberly Scott, known for her Tony Award-nominated performance in the original production of Mr. Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone.'' 
 No matter how it is cast, ''Death of a Salesman'' remains painfully universal. ''I thought the production would resonate with today's audience,'' Mr. Dutton said, ''because it is about economics -- not being able to pay insurance or the mortgage.''
 ''Death of a Salesman,'' by Arthur Miller, is at the Yale Repertory Theater, 1120 Chapel Street, New Haven, through May 23. Information: yalerep.org or (203) 432-1234.

HEADLINE: Out of Work In Finance, They Turn To Teaching

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
WITH an M.B.A. and 20 years' experience as a financial analyst, Kathy Marshall should be at the top of her professional game.
 But the game ended late last year, when the 44-year-old consultant from Chatham found her work had dried up. Her specialty was building financial models for business start-ups.
 ''I kept thinking everything would get better, but when September hit I decided it was time to re-evaluate what I wanted to do,'' Mrs. Marshall said. Her husband was employed but worried that his job could be at risk, she said. The couple has four children.
 ''I started thinking about teaching math,'' Mrs. Marshall said, ''and went out and got my substitute teacher certificate.'' 
 In March, the State Legislature approved a pilot program that seemed tailor made for her situation. Called Traders to Teachers, it is designed to turn unemployed finance professionals into math teachers in three months. Successful candidates, who are not required to have been math majors, will attend classes free at Montclair State University.
 The response to the program has been overwhelming. Within 48 hours of its unveiling, 200 people called or e-mailed; at least 100 are expected to apply for the first class of 25, according to university administrators. Besides Mrs. Marshall, those who responded include Pedro Ramirez, 48, of Cranford, a Goldman Sachs executive let go in February 2008; Robert Stanley, 50, of Basking Ridge, a 26-year Wall Street veteran out of work since October; and Tony Malanga, 46, of Verona, a mortgage banker who lost his job in March. 
 ''Things collapsed to such an extent in financial services, it's going to take years to get back to normalcy,'' said Mr. Malanga, a father of six. ''It's a good point for me to transition into a new career. Teaching was always something I wanted. In your late 40s, after coming through this, you care more about stability than building wealth.''
 Since December 2007, New Jersey's financial services sector has shed 16,000 jobs, said David J. Socolow, state commissioner of labor and workforce development. Thousands of other residents lost similar jobs in New York.
 Traders to Teachers, financed by a federal grant, will do more than retrain dislocated workers, Mr. Socolow said, it will also ease the state's shortage of math teachers. 
 Ada Beth Cutler, dean of the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State, said the idea came to her and Lucille E. Davy, New Jersey's education commissioner, last fall.
 ''She called me and said she was hearing about all the people being laid off from financial services,'' Dr. Cutler recalled. ''She said, 'Don't you think these people would make great math teachers?' I said, 'That's funny you should ask, because we've been getting calls from them about this.' ''
 Most of the callers had majored in finance or accounting. When they learned they needed 30 college credits in mathematics, she said, they were dismayed.
 Special legislation was introduced to ease that rule and fast-track certification.
 ''That does not mean we will compromise our standards,'' Dr. Cutler said. ''We will take very bright people and, through a very intensive program, teach them the mathematics they need to know and how to teach it.''
 The first 25 of the newly trained teachers are expected to be placed in teaching positions in January. Three more groups are expected to be trained within a year, Montclair State administrators said.
 On a recent afternoon, dozens of potential candidates filed into a lecture hall in Montclair for orientation. Most appeared to be at least 40. Many were dressed in business attire, and kept one eye on their BlackBerrys.
 Tina Lordamlis, 38, of Weehawken, a former financial analyst for Citigroup, drew smiles when she raised her hand to ask: ''All my life I've been on the analysis side. How do you teach getting up in front of people?''
 A question about math teachers' pay followed. In 2007, financial sector salaries averaged about $98,000, nearly twice as much as the average New Jersey wages, according to the state labor department.
 ''Salaries differ from district to district, and depending on your degree,'' Dr. Cutler said. ''Generally, for someone with a bachelor's, it's somewhere in the 40s. A few pay in the 50s. Some districts are willing to negotiate.''
 Candidates also learned that they would have to pass a qualifying exam.
 Afterward, Maureen Quinn, 46, a former financial analyst who has been substitute-teaching in Tenafly, her hometown, said she needed an algebra refresher. ''I think I need to study,'' she said. 
 Many of those present said they had enjoyed their careers before the economy soured.
 ''It was rewarding psychologically, and very rewarding financially,'' said Robert Stanley of Basking Ridge, a broker whose niche is electronic trading. ''The work was also essential to society. I have no shame for the fact I did it.''
 Still, at 50, he sees no future in it. 
 ''I believe my Wall Street career is done at age 50. I would go back to Wall Street, absolutely, if the right thing came, but I don't see any turnaround,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''Wall Street is a young man's game.''
 Pedro Ramirez, 48, said he had been happy, too, at Goldman Sachs, which paid for his M.B.A. and promoted him through the ranks in the syndication and loan trading department. ''I was learning, I was managing people and processes,'' he said.
 After a year of job hunting, though, he decided to switch gears. 
 ''Teaching was always something in the back of my mind,'' said Mr. Ramirez, who lives in Cranford. ''Obviously, I won't be able to make the money I was making. On the other hand, the quality of my life may change for the better, and my kids would be very happy to see me around.'' After losing his job he became an assistant scoutmaster. 
 Retraining financial services professionals as teachers ''makes a heck of a lot of sense,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''It may produce a cadre of highly skilled, talented teachers who ordinarily wouldn't have gone into the profession.''
 Whether they will remain in it is another issue, he said.
 ''A year or two down the road, when there is strong economic recovery, some people might drift back to opportunities in the financial world,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''But who knows? The future hasn't been written.''

HEADLINE: Taste of Spain and Italy, With Tapas Just the Start

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
I WORRY about a restaurant like La Taberna in this economy. I worry because, unlike a number of other Bridgeport restaurants I've reviewed, Taberna is outside the busy downtown area. I worry because we were the only table at lunch last week and because it would be unfortunate if such good food, and such gracious service, were to languish unrewarded.
 Taberna, which opened in October last year serving Spanish and Italian cuisine, is the second restaurant for Jamie and Daniel Lopez, brothers who also own La Paella Tapas and Wine Bar in Norwalk. Like its sister restaurant, La Taberna boasts a robust menu of tapas -- specials are chalked on the blackboard in the bar. 
 My lunch companions and I contentedly made a meal of six tapas, an entree pasta split between the three of us, and dessert. Five of the six tapas were flawless; the sixth would have been, had it not cooled between kitchen and dining room.
 Presentation and cuisine are graceful and restrained. Miniature, golden brown codfish balls are piled on a smear of pale orange, paprika-cumin aioli; pop one in your mouth and the fragile crust gives way to an almost liquid interior of salt cod, potato and nutmeg-scented bechamel. Three brilliant red, wood-roasted piquillo peppers make for another beautiful plate, each stuffed with a well-seasoned saffron-yellow mix of Spanish rice, diced chicken and shrimp and walnuts.
 A goodly portion of delicious white anchovies line up like soldiers on a rectangular plate, garnished simply with lemon and a fistful of baby lettuces. Diced red and green peppers are scattered like confetti over tender, grilled, two-bite baby squid, the plate decorated with dabs of green (basil-cilantro pesto), orange-red (piquillo pepper) and brown (aged balsamic) sauces. 
 Narrow, oval slices of dark red, grilled chorizo lean against a mashed potato volcano (the flavors were successful, but the potatoes were not quite hot). The individual Spanish omelet, usually a rather dry affair, is a delicious thing here: layers of moist, thin-sliced potatoes and onion bound with egg, and served quartered, with salad greens. 
 At a second meal, crisp rounds of fried calamari also passed muster, as did a dish of soft, mild-tasting polenta, paired with slices of grilled portobello mushrooms. A bay scallop ''risotto'' was more rice than risotto, but the scallops were tasty. And Taberna has one of the freshest tasting Caesar salads I've eaten in Connecticut, barely dressed with a mixture of olive oil, Parmesan, anchovies, white vinegar, lemon juice and cream.
 My favorite entree that night was a rustic special of fresh cod fillet, sauced with pesto thinned with fish stock, served with onion-sweetened roasted potatoes and a generous mound of spinach. Equally terrific was the veal Milanese, a crisp golden brown shingle topped with diced fresh tomato. 
 Housemade linguini, dressed with a bright green, fresh herb, garlic and white wine sauce, lacked pizzazz, and the shrimp that topped the pasta were slightly overcooked -- but a drizzle of Taberna's Spanish olive oil (served in lieu of butter) went a long way toward correcting those faults. 
 Taberna also serves an acceptable paella Valenciana, but I was disappointed in a Moroccan baby lamb stew in which the lamb was dry.
 Desserts are just great. The delicate mango flan is decorated with candied, julienned orange peel, spiked with cinnamon and star anise. Tiramisu is served as a wedge of layer cake, combining coffee-soaked, housemade white cake, with a mascarpone cheese filling flavored with Kahlua and espresso. A ramekin of rice pudding comes with a creme-brulee-like caramel topping, and chocolate mousse is coated in a thin, crisp layer of chocolate.
 Sometimes the food is not hot enough, and occasionally it's too salty (our pasta, for example, as well as the portobellos and the spinach). But reasonable prices, the understated elegance of the cuisine, and careful, caring service make La Taberna an experience not to be missed.

HEADLINE: Peace and Love, Yes. But Understanding?

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
MICHAEL Lang and Joel Rosenman were two of the producers of the original Woodstock festival 40 summers ago. Lately, they have been trying to pull together an anniversary concert this year, they really have, but you have to understand, man, it's complex.
 Part of the problem is that they have a few disagreements. 
 ''The first conversation we had about Woodstock for this year was probably nine years ago,'' Mr. Rosenman said last week.
 ''We started thinking about it about a year ago,'' Mr. Lang said in a separate interview. 
 While the partners' most promising idea -- a one-day mini-Woodstock in Prospect Park in Brooklyn this August -- fizzled when they could not find sponsors, that doesn't mean others haven't coaxed a few more marketing miles from the creaky Woodstock bus. 
 Dozens of projects are planned to commemorate the August 1969 concert, including an Ang Lee movie called ''Taking Woodstock,'' a Heroes of Woodstock concert tour (with Jefferson Starship and Melanie) and at least 13 books, including one for children co-authored by a second cousin of Max Yasgur, the farmer who lent his land in Bethel, N.Y., for the original event. Target is set to run a ''Summer of Love'' promotion featuring licensed Woodstock merchandise, like beach towels with the symbolic white dove perched on a guitar neck.
 But Mr. Lang, 64, and Mr. Rosenman, 66, who, with the family of another original partner, control Woodstock Ventures, which owns the trademarks, have so far failed to deliver a solid plan to commemorate their own historic achievement. Time, it would seem, has run out for pulling together the kind of anniversary blowouts the partners were behind in upstate New York in 1994 and 1999 -- the former a three-day, mud-slathered event that attracted 300,000 fans, the latter chiefly remembered for a riot. 
 Some obstacles are rooted in the personal and philosophical differences between Mr. Lang and Mr. Rosenman that date back four decades.
 ''Joel is a much more bottom-line-oriented person,'' said Mr. Lang, wearing a dark blue T-shirt, jeans and white tennis shoes in his offices in a loft in Chelsea. ''I'm more of an intuitive person, a loose thinker.''
 MR. ROSENMAN, who was a musician when he was young, disputes being characterized as the stiff suit and Mr. Lang as the dreamer, a dichotomy, he says, that began appearing in the news media four decades ago, when Mr. Lang was doing most of the interviews. ''Michael was by far the most businesslike of us when it came to calculating profits and the advantage of one deal over another,'' Mr. Rosenman said.
 Mr. Lang wants a Woodstock concert show this year because, he said, ''Woodstock is relevant on the anniversaries.'' 
 Mr. Rosenman is not in such a rush. ''If it's not the best lineup and the best setting and the right feeling about the community that develops,'' he said, ''we shouldn't have that event.'' 
 Their partnership started in 1969, and also included Artie Kornfeld, a record producer, and Mr. Rosenman's then-business partner, John Roberts, who died in 2001. Mr. Kornfeld and Mr. Lang sold their shares in Woodstock Ventures to the other two men for about $65,000 in the wake of disagreements and debts after the original Woodstock, but Mr. Lang returned as a minority owner before the 1999 festival.
 Although Mr. Roberts's children are consulted regularly about Woodstock-related decisions, they do not perform the role their father once did, as a buffer between Mr. Lang and Mr. Rosenman. 
 ''John,'' Mr. Lang said, ''was the bridge.'' He and Mr. Rosenman speak frequently, often during Mr. Lang's twice-weekly commutes to the city from the town of Woodstock, N.Y., where he lives with his second wife and twin 7-year-old boys. Mr. Rosenman lives on Central Park South. One measure of their differences was the challenge of getting them to pose together for a photograph. After much back-and-forth scheduling, Mr. Lang refused to enter Mr. Rosenman's building to meet him.
 They are dickering over many issues, both men say. Should the next official Woodstock be held live or as an online-only event? Should it be postponed until the economy improves? Should it include nostalgia acts or contemporary bands? In the city or country? Free or not?
 Mr. Rosenman said Mr. Lang did not show up for a recent meeting the two were supposed to have with Kevin Wall, a producer of the Live Earth concerts in 2007. 
 For his part, Mr. Lang, in his forthcoming book, ''The Road to Woodstock,'' dredges up old disagreements with his partner. He writes that Mr. Rosenman's opposition to investing in a recording studio in the town of Woodstock in 1969 was a mistake and that a studio that was built nearby a year later by Albert Grossman became ''the origin of albums by the Rolling Stones, Foreigner, Bonnie Raitt, R.E.M.'' and many others.
 The operators of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, on the grounds of the original Woodstock concert, gave up trying to work with Woodstock Ventures and announced on May 4 that they were going ahead with their own commemorative concert Aug. 15, called the Bethel Woods Music Festival, which will include acts from the Heroes of Woodstock tour. 
 Now, Mr. Lang and Mr. Rosenman sometimes seem like an old married couple who can usually talk about all the water that has passed under the bridge and, when it comes to their baby, Woodstock, manage to work together. Mr. Rosenman said that any personal differences had ''zero'' to do with no major event being scheduled but that they continued to debate whether it was better to forge ahead without commercial sponsors or to wait to line some up.
 ''My feeling is let's come back when that is the case,'' Mr. Rosenman said. ''And Michael's position is let's do what we can now with less resources.'' One thing Mr. Lang and Mr. Rosenman agree about is that they are not trying to mine Woodstock for money. The 1969 event left Woodstock Ventures more than $1 million in debt. The most successful spinoff, the three-hour concert movie directed by Michael Wadleigh, has grossed more than $60 million, but most of the profit has gone to Warner Brothers.
 At the moment, the two partners' most tangible project is Woodstock.com, a Web site scheduled to go up in June. 
 ''The word 'Woodstock' means something -- it's hard to pin down sometimes,'' Mr. Rosenman said. ''We're brainstorming about how to take something that was kind of a beacon to the world about counterculture and music and community in 1969 and transforming it into a 21st century phenomenon that has an Internet platform instead of a live one.''
 SUCH late-in-the-game confusion has some historical precedent. In May of 1969 -- 40 years ago right now -- there was no firm site set for Woodstock, and many of the bands were not yet booked. 
 Mr. Lang has not given up hope that he can pull off another last-minute event. He said they were speaking with a potential sponsor and city officials for a free concert in Prospect Park in the fall. ''We would have 150,000 ticketed and an overflow area for 150,000 more with video screens,'' he said, speaking more animatedly when the logistics of a show were being discussed than he was when the subject was finding sponsors and working out issues with Mr. Rosenman.
 ''It would be noon to 11 p.m., eight to 10 bands on the main stage,'' Mr. Lang continued. ''On-site solar and wind power; biodiesel for generators; organic and local produce; recycled paper goods. We'd like to give away one-day free passes on city transit with a ticket.''
 Maybe, just maybe, Mr. Rosenman said.
 ''It is a slim prospect as are nearly all of our prospects for the near term,'' he said. ''I'd be hesitant to talk about them except that in the past slim prospects have materialized for us.''

HEADLINE: 'Rodeo Drive' in Greenwich Shows Vacancies

BYLINE: By MOINA NOOR

DATELINE: Greenwich 

 BODY:
 AS the owner of Betteridge Jewelers, a fixture on Greenwich Avenue since 1897, Terry Betteridge has seen stores come and go on the avenue over the years.
 ''New stores come to town and think that rich people are going to throw money at them,'' he said recently. ''Those stores don't last. Customers are smarter than that, especially now.''
 Right now, ''the Avenue,'' as it is referred to by Greenwich residents, has more vacant storefronts than anyone can remember. As shoppers stroll along the broad sidewalks of this retail stretch so posh that it is often referred to as the Rodeo Drive of the East Coast., they pass Tiffany & Company and Saks Fifth Avenue and other high-end specialty stores where it is easy to drop $1,000 on a dress and a pair of shoes. 
 At every intersection along the half-mile avenue, a police officer directs traffic and pedestrians, a luxury few towns provide even in good economic times.
 But Greenwich, home to more than 100 hedge funds and one of the wealthiest towns in the country, is intimately tied to the ups and downs of Wall Street. And as retail sales decline all over the country, Greenwich Avenue stores and those in neighboring affluent towns like New Canaan and Westport are finding that they have to adjust to a new economic reality of diminished bonuses and slimmer wallets.
 Mr. Betteridge inherited the business from his father and comes from a long line of jewelers, and he said his sales are ''good enough'' now, although he has definitely noticed a change. 
 ''I've had to cross some of my banker customers off my client list and my staff and I have to hustle more,'' said Mr. Betteridge, 56. ''Clients are looking for quality pieces, not so much flashy stuff these days.'' 
 Because the stores that have closed down on the avenue are so prominent nationally -- some of them selling the top of the line in their product group -- any of them shutting down has sent ripples through the buying and selling public here.
 Coach closed its store on Greenwich Avenue in March. Banana Republic left last year. Others that have left since the beginning of the year include Ann Taylor, Borders and Shabby Chic (the company filed for bankruptcy protection in January). 
 ''The returns we were achieving were not up to Coach's standards,'' Andrea Shaw Resnick, senior vice president of investor relations for Coach, said in an e-mail message. 
 Thomas Torelli, a commercial real estate broker for Allied Property Group in Greenwich, said the vacancy rate is 7 percent now, compared with 3 percent annually over the last 15 years. That translates to about eight empty storefronts. The usual attrition rate is four to five stores every year, but this year there have already been six store closings in the first quarter alone, he said. 
 ''The demand for space has diminished in the last few months,'' Mr. Torelli said. ''We always had three to four stores that were actively looking to get on the avenue. Now we have one or two.'' 
 The average rent in 1999 was $60 a square foot; today, the same space is $125 a square foot, Mr. Torelli said. Rents went up to as much as $200 a square foot in 2008. Mr. Torelli estimated that they have decreased 15 to 20 percent since their peak this time last year. 
 ''The rents went up too fast during the boom time,'' he said. ''And now stores that don't generate margins like Tiffany's are deciding not to renew their leases.'' 
 Jill duPont, owner of Out of the Box Designs Inc., a women's apparel store on the avenue, said merchants have to adjust to the new reality.
 ''I think the days of indiscriminate, flashy buying are over,'' she said. ''We're going to go back to the ways of an old Greenwich customer.'' 
 Marshal Cohen, a chief industry analyst for the NPD Group, a market research firm, said that store closings along Greenwich Avenue are a sign of how deep the recession has reached. ''This is a rare recession because Luxury Main Street is feeling the effect of the downturn,'' he said. ''There was a false wealth in affluent towns -- people living off their refinanced homes -- that created a nouveau rich market. Now with fewer dollars, only the stores with the best quality and best service will survive.''
 Main streets in neighboring New Canaan and Westport are also feeling the effect of reduced consumer spending. 
 ''I have not seen this many vacancies in downtown New Canaan in all my 37 years in business,'' said Hugh Halsell, a broker for Brotherhood and Higley Real Estate and a commercial property owner in downtown New Canaan.
 Peter Prime, owner of the Adirondack Store, a home accessories and furniture business, closed his New Canaan shop after 13 years of business in late April for three reasons, he said. 
 ''A decline in spending, credit tightening and the cost of doing business in Fairfield County all make it difficult to stay open,'' Mr. Prime said on the day his store closed. Knoyzz, a teenage apparel shop based in downtown Westport with stores in New Canaan and Westchester County, closed all its shops in February. JD's Cosmetics and Waterworks on Westport's Main Street have closed in the last couple of weeks. 
 The Westport Planning and Zoning Commission has suspended the ban on stand-alone signs outside stores until Oct. 1 to help retailers promote business. David Waldman, president of David Adam Realty and commercial property owner on Main Street, said that rents in downtown Westport are down substantially and several tenants and landlords are renegotiating rents, while others are looking to sublease their spaces. New construction on the street has also stalled.
 ''Last year this time, I rented out a property for $165 a square foot,'' Mr. Waldman said. ''Now I can't even find a tenant to rent the same property out at $90.''

HEADLINE: Of Inlets, Channels and Dunes

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
SINCE 1933, the Doxsee Sea Clam Company has occupied a prime spot in Point Lookout, with a dock along Reynolds Channel -- shucking, chopping and freezing bushels of surf clams dredged up by its two fishing boats off Jones and Long Beaches. 
 A mixture of pricey cottages, expanded Capes and pseudocastles on tiny lots in the town of Hempstead, the 0.23-square-mile Point Lookout occupies the east end of the Nassau County barrier island that is also home to Lido, Long and Atlantic Beaches. Except for a few other fishing boats, the Doxsee factory is the only industry in the hamlet.
 But the lure of a real estate bonanza, even in a sour market, is changing that. A few months ago, Bob Doxsee Jr., 79, who has worked in his family's five-generation-old fishing and clamming business since he was 13, put his 18,000-square-foot property on the market. 
 ''The place is worth more than what I was using it for,'' Mr. Doxsee said. 
 With clam beds exhausted and government rules on catch size ever more stringent, Doxsee will never again process vast quantities of clams a year. During World War II, it employed more than 100, about half of them shuckers who would whip through 2,000 bushels daily and were known for singing while they worked, often old ballads like ''Sweet Adeline.''
 Now Doxsee is down to 10 employees. By the end of the summer, Mr. Doxsee said, he plans to raze the building and subdivide the property into three 6,000-square-foot building lots, selling the prime waterfront at $2 million per lot. ''If I clear the land,'' he said, ''it will be worth more individually.'' 
 What he envisions are three custom residences, not dissimilar to his own, two doors down: a two-year-old turreted house with sunrise and sunset views over Reynolds Channel. 
 His life and plans for the processing plant reflect the transformation that has turned Point Lookout from a community of mainly summer cottages to the mostly year-round neighborhood of about 850 homes that it is today. One of those year-rounders is Pat Andorfer, who moved here three years ago with her husband, Kenneth, paying about $730,000 for a five-bedroom three-bath contemporary with a big side yard.
 ''Now we are down here full time and it is the best thing I ever did,'' said Ms. Andorfer, a former Freeport resident, having previously rented a home in Point Lookout for two summers. ''You feel like you are on vacation all year round.''
 Though Ms. Andorfer, who works in sales in Uniondale, doesn't have an ocean view, she is a block away and can hear the waves from her back porch at night or from the bedroom when the windows are open. She enjoys walking on the beach and into town. ''It's a very relaxing lifestyle,'' she said. 
 As for Mr. Doxsee, he grew up in Freeport, but spent summers in Point Lookout in a cottage that his family moved by barge from Meadow Island. 
 The enclave has changed a lot, he said, remarking how many of the bungalows have expanded upward. ''Now,'' he said, ''we have 'skyscrapers' -- oversized homes.'' 
 According to Kevin Haff, vice president of the 77-year-old Point Lookout Civic Association, home size is an issue, and 90 to 95 percent of the lots ''fall under the allowable area to build on,'' requiring a variance from the Hempstead town zoning appeals board. ''If neighbors ask us to get involved,'' he said, ''we try to mediate.'' 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Joggers, children on bicycles, mothers pushing strollers and beachgoers pulling wagons commandeer the concrete roads in this 11-block-long, three-block-wide community of fewer than 1,500. The peninsula is surrounded by Reynolds Channel to the north, the Atlantic to the south and, to the east, Jones Inlet, which separates Point Lookout from Jones Beach Island. Lido Boulevard is the link to the hamlet of Lido Beach and the city of Long Beach.
 Thomas A. Hug, the owner of Thomas Hug Real Estate, drives his customers to check out homes in a GEM car, an open-sided vehicle, often seen on these local streets, which are mostly named for other Long Island towns -- Hewlett, for instance, and Garden City. The serene enclave claims to have the only 15 mile-per-hour speed limit in the state, and a single traffic light. Along the main drag are a drugstore, a gift shop, a gas station, a supermarket, a dry cleaner, and restaurants like Jo Jo Apples, a diner with seasonal outdoor seating and bins of toys to keep the kids busy. 
 The minuscule downtown is also home to a library and Ye Old Firehouse, whose occupant is the local historical society museum. There is no home delivery; residents go to the post office to collect their mail. The sidewalks were recently redone with pavers, new lighting was installed and a tourism kiosk put up, part of a $250,000 renewal project financed by the county, said Denise Ford, a legislator for the district. 
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 Despite the economy, prices are steep in this area sometimes known as Nassau's ''answer to the Hamptons.''
 As Mr. Hug put it, ''Point Lookout usually brings in higher prices than the rest of the barrier island,'' because of its small-town feel and proximity to Meadowbrook Parkway. Like Ms. Andorfer, renters often return as buyers. 
 According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, there are 22 homes for sale and 20 for rent -- some seasonal, some year round. In 2008, 16 homes sold; in 2007 the number was 17. Leonilde Simonetti, a broker with Coldwell Banker Beach West in Long Beach, acknowledged that there had recently been ''a little adjustment'' in prices, but maintained that ''if you price it right, it still sells.'' In March, an extended Cape-style home went to contract for just under its $799,000 asking price after two weeks on the market. It had previously sat on the market a year, with another broker, at $975,000, Ms. Simonetti said. 
 Prices begin around $575,000, for a two-bedroom one-bath cottage on a 35-by-60-foot lot. The middle of the market ranges from $800,000 to more than $1 million, for a three- to four-bedroom two-bath high ranch or expanded brick Cape. At the top of the market, over $2 million, homes are sitting longer. Mr. Hug mentioned an oceanfront house listed at $6 million but also for rent at $100,000 for the season. 
 Paul A. Gomez, owner of Point Realty, said that in season, rentals quintuple in price. The range for the high season, June through August, is about $5,500 to $35,000 a month. 
 THE COMMUTE
 There is plenty of free parking for commuters at the Long Beach station of the Long Island Rail Road. A bus to the station is also available, at no charge. The train to Manhattan takes 53 minutes to an hour; some trains stop in Jamaica. A monthly ticket is $211, or $206.78 online. Just off the Loop and Meadowbrook Parkways, Point Lookout is 37 miles from Manhattan -- about a 50-minute ride, depending on traffic. 
 WHAT TO DO
 At the residents-only ocean beach, homeowners can stash their umbrellas and beach chairs for the season in a house by the pillared entryway near Garden City Avenue. Town of Hempstead residents can use a separate beach for a daily fee of $6.50 per car. 
 Beyond the beach, the action in the summer is on Bayside Drive along Reynolds Channel at the Point Lookout Clam Bar, Fisherman's Catch, and the Buoy Bar. Bait, tackle and ice cream are available at Ted's Fishing Station. Boaters can gas up, and boat rentals are available. Picnic tables line the deck. 
 The 184 boat slips in the East Marina are reserved for residents of Hempstead. The West Marina, on Lido Boulevard, is open to the general public and has 152 slips, a boat-launchingramp and a fishing pier. Party fishing boats leave from the West Marina. 
 Concerts at Jones Beach are a 10-minute drive east, and the Roosevelt Field shopping mall is 15 minutes north. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 Point Lookout is in the Long Beach school district, which has 4,200 students. Prekindergarten meets at the Blackheath Prekindergarten Center in nearby Lido Beach. For kindergarten through Grade 5, parents choose among four schools: Lido, East, Lindell and West. Each has a different program and orientation, but all include a dual Spanish-English language program beginning in kindergarten and, because the community is on the water, mandatory swimming starting in second grade. Life saving is taught at the high school. 
 SAT averages last year were 500 in reading, 506 in math and 501 in writing, versus 502, 504 and 503 statewide. 
 THE HISTORY
 Erosion is a perennial problem. For more than a decade, said Gerry Ottavino, a co-chairman of the civic association's environmental committee, financing for a storm damage reduction project has been elusive. The money is needed to protect against hurricane season. Last year, when the state and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged Reynolds Channel for navigation and safety, 600,000 cubic yards of sand was poured onto Point Lookout beaches.

HEADLINE: Shift From Spending to Saving May Be Slump's Lasting Impact

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The economic downturn is forcing a return to a culture of thrift that many economists say could last well beyond the inevitable recovery.
 This is not because Americans have suddenly become more financially virtuous or have learned the error of their free-spending ways. Instead, these experts say, Americans may have no choice but to continue pinching pennies.
 This shift back to thrift may seem to be a healthy change for a consumer class known for spending more than it earns, but there is a downside: American businesses have become so dependent on consumer spending that any pullback sends ripples through the economy.
 Fearful of job losses and anxious over housing and stock declines, Americans are squirreling away more of their paychecks than they were before the recession. In the last year, the savings rate -- the percentage of after-tax income that people do not spend -- has risen to above 4 percent, from virtually zero. 
 This happens in nearly every recession, and the effect is usually fleeting. Once the economy recovers, Americans revert to more spending and less saving. Over the last 30 years, the savings rate has fluctuated from over 14 percent in the 1970s to negative 2.7 percent in 2005, meaning Americans were spending more than they made.
 This time is expected to be different, because the forces that enabled and even egged on consumers to save less and spend more -- easy credit and skyrocketing asset values -- could be permanently altered by the financial crisis that spun the economy into recession.
 ''I expect that the savings rate will end up at the end of this recession higher than it was going into it,'' said Jonathan A. Parker, a finance professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ''It's hard to see how it wouldn't.''
 Sustained increases in household saving would cause a difficult period of restructuring for the American economy, which has become increasingly driven by consumer spending. Such spending makes up about 70 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
 Add the decline in consumer spending to the planned expiration of government stimulus spending, and a painful readjustment in demand for goods and services could occur, economists say. The effect would be felt here and abroad, as many developing economies also depend on America's big-spending ways.
 ''If Americans cut back, as they almost have to do, what will replace that source of demand?'' asked William G. Gale, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-centrist policy research group. 
 ''The easy answer is the Chinese consumer,'' he said, but unlike their more prodigal American counterparts, the Chinese save about a quarter of what they earn. ''We may cut back faster than they expand into that space, so there might be a lull.''
 Why might the higher savings rate outlast the recession? 
 Social critics like David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, hope that introspection about America's ''culture of consumption'' will awaken Americans to the virtues of thrift, just as the Great Depression reset American financial values for a generation.
 But many economists believe consumers will change their habits for more pragmatic reasons. 
 Consumers have lost a huge chunk of their net worth, in the housing bust and the stock market, and to resuscitate their retirement accounts or children's college funds they will have to channel more of their paychecks toward saving -- unless those asset markets soar again. 
 Forms of easy credit that were once prevalent, like mortgages with no down payments, also may not return, either because the government regulates them out of existence or because banks dare not venture back into such risky lending. That means if Americans want to buy a house, they will have to save more and borrow less. 
 Whether for reasons moral or otherwise, consumers are already thinking a bit differently about their long-term budgets. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that many more Americans had begun regarding products like microwave ovens as luxuries rather than necessities.
 Such attitudes suggest that retailers will have to change their marketing strategies, said J. Walker Smith, executive vice chairman of the Futures Company, a marketing and research consultancy.
 ''People are realizing they can't accumulate everything they want anymore, and they'll have to prioritize more,'' he said. ''That may be hard for a lot of brands -- figuring out not only how to get considered by consumers, but put at the top of their list.''
 Consumers planning big purchases are also anticipating that their borrowing options will remain limited.
 Last year, Aryn Kennedy and her husband, Brian Ewing, who live in Los Angeles, spent ''every dollar'' they earned on debt repayment and living expenses. When local housing prices began to fall, Mr. Ewing toyed with the idea of a low-down-payment mortgage.
 ''By the time we really started looking at buying, I knew from reading blogs that most loans like that were not really available anymore, since lenders didn't want to take risks,'' said Ms. Kennedy, who said she was suspicious of such offers anyhow. 
 Since then, through ''windfalls'' like a salary increase for Mr. Ewing, and by cutting expenses for clothing, entertainment and other items, Ms. Kennedy says the couple has begun saving about 25 percent of their take-home pay in anticipation of making a traditional down payment of 20 percent on a house. 
 Even after they buy, Ms. Kennedy said, the couple plans to keep saving 25 percent of their pay. A recent Gallup poll found that most Americans who have recently increased their savings believe their budget adjustments represent a ''new, normal pattern for years ahead.''
 Despite the immediate jolt to the economy, more personal saving would be a positive step in the long run, analysts say. More saving leads to more investment, which promotes economic growth, which leads to better living standards. 
 At the family level, social critics, economists and even many consumers seem to agree that a forced financial conservatism may be for the better.
 Kenny Tran of Santa Ana, Calif., for example, said he had been nervous about saving enough to buy his first house -- he and his fiance have been setting aside about $800 a month for the last year and a half -- but he has no regrets about not buying a home when credit was looser and saving was less of a priority.
 ''A couple years ago it would have been easier for us to get a loan,'' despite the fact that the couple's combined income was lower, Mr. Tran said. ''But if we would have gotten a loan, and a house, a couple years ago, we'd probably have ended up in foreclosure now.''

HEADLINE: A Chocolate, With Amway Undertones, Networks Its Way Into New York

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
The little wrapped chocolates were passed around the Upper West Side living room on a silver tray, plucked one at a time by the manicured hands of the guests perched on sofas and kitchen chairs. 
 ''Probiotic,'' the hostess of the tasting, Patricia Watt, a theater producer, told a group seemingly culled from the front page, gossip sheets and back copies of Playbill. They chewed and nodded with approval, among them a prominent 9/11 widow, a bankruptcy lawyer, an Argentinean investor and avid polo player, a Pace University student, and a former sister-in-law of the last president. 
 Ms. Watt said a few words about the chocolate, pitched as being so rich in antioxidants that, if eaten three times a day, it provides some nutritional benefits on the order of a pound of spinach. Then she said a few more, about a new way to make some money in a shaky economy. 
 Exotic name and sleek day-spa packaging notwithstanding, Xocai (pronounced show-SIGH) is a cousin of the humble Amway products, among the newest in a seemingly endless series of network-marketing ventures. But where Tupperware parties and door-to-door sales are a time-honored tradition in suburban towns, Xocai has found a foothold among the ladies who lunch -- and the men who love them -- in New York City.
 ''When you think of Amway, you think about people in a ranch house somewhere,'' said Ronnie Glucksman, 47, a theater producer and Xocai distributor who said he found network marketing ''unseemly'' until Ms. Watt, a close friend, persuaded him to sign up. ''You've got people in penthouses who are involved in this.'' 
 Xocai is a product of MXI Corp., a Reno, Nev., company that heavily promotes the chocolate's oxygen radical absorbance capacity, or ORAC. Typical dark chocolate has ORAC levels around 15,000 per 100 grams; milk chocolate has more like 6,700. Xocai's levels are said to be more concentrated. A 12-gram ''nugget'' (recommended serving: three) has 3,120, while three fluid ounces of a Xocai drink has more than 15,000, according to Andrew N. Brooks, who founded the company with his mother in 2005. 
 Brunswick Laboratories, which assigns ORAC levels, has run independent tests confirming Xocai's levels, according to Jim Nichols, Brunswick's president, who cautioned that chocolate companies tend to overplay the importance of the number, when exactly how it translates into promoting health is unknown. 
 ''Marketeers in general overstate the importance of a high number,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''Because we don't know how high is high.''
 The business operates on a familiar model: New distributors buy in at various levels and receive cases of chocolate products -- bars, nuggets, cookies, drinks -- at home every month. These distributors recruit newer distributors, earning a percentage of their sales. The promotional materials promise larger and larger monthly checks for those who greatly expand the tree. 
 About a third of those who sign up follow this model; another third keep ordering the chocolate to eat it; and a third drop out, according to Mr. Brooks. 
 Ms. Watt was introduced to the chocolate in July by an old friend, Debra Scott, who lived in Las Vegas, and quickly became the Johnny Appleseed of Xocai in New York, urging friends and acquaintances from the theater world to sign up. She now sits atop a tree of about 300 distributors, and said she makes $1,500 a month.
 One early convert was Robin Cofer, an ordained swami and ballet dancer who lives on the 90th floor of Trump World Tower. She signed up in August and said she has about 20 executives -- high-volume sellers -- working beneath her. One of the friends she signed was Jill Zarin, one of the stars of the show ''Real Housewives of New York City.'' 
 ''Robin is a very holistic light person,'' said Ms. Zarin, a former Avon lady (at 14, on Long Island). ''She says, 'Jill, I have to tell you about this thing I found, this chocolate, it's unbelievable, and not only that, you can make money.' I said, 'You know what, Robin? Here's my credit card. You're my friend, I trust you, sign me up.' ''
 Ms. Zarin said that she wanted to try to promote the chocolate on the air -- ''I have a lot of fans'' -- but that a planned scene involving Xocai was cut. 
 ''Last month, I made $650,'' she said. ''And yes, that $600 last month bought me a pair of shoes.''
 The business model might seem a less-than-perfect fit for city dwellers. For instance, a taped message on the company's customer-service line reminds sellers to use the ''Xocai three-feet rule,'' wherein distributors offer chocolate and encouragement to recruit anyone within three feet -- a sure way to make yourself unwelcome, or worse, in New York. 
 Peter M. Birkeland, an adjunct professor at the University of Chicago and author of ''Franchising Dreams: The Lure of Entrepreneurship in America'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), said New Yorkers have been historically loath to try similar businesses in the past. 
 ''I think New York has always kind of looked down its nose at something that's lowbrow, that's crass,'' Professor Birkeland said. ''They can make their money in other ways.''
 Mr. Brooks, the founder, agreed that the New York sellers were ''forging unknown territory'' but said, ''They looked at that as an opportunity.''
 At a large tasting in the conference room of an apartment building in Chelsea in March, dozens of distributors and their guests -- prospective distributors -- wore name-tag stickers and sat in plastic chairs. ''Have a Xocai moment,'' an executive-level distributor from Winnipeg purred to the guests tasting for the first time.
 Grant Innes, a painter in SoHo, signed up at the executive level after a friend from Canada visiting New York gave him some Xocai and, he said, he lost seven pounds within a month of eating it. But Mr. Innes, who is 46, said the ''whole philosophy'' of network marketing ''kind of rubs me the wrong way.'' 
 ''I think it'll be more of a one-on-one thing to start out with, rather than a big party,'' he said. ''If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it's not the end of the world. I don't want a Mercedes. I don't have anywhere to park it.''
 Peter J. Laitmon, 68, a veteran marketing executive, peeled off his name tag and left unimpressed, finding the data on the chocolate's health benefits too scant and the process of selling it ill suited to city life. 
 ''This is not a Tupperware party in Jericho, Long Island,'' he said. ''These are people who don't need a lot of people in their home.'' 
 Back at Ms. Watt's apartment, she began her pitch, citing three friends who lowered their cholesterol eating Xocai: ''I have their records from their doctors.'' Then she sought to head off any stigma: ''There's a great difference between a pyramid and a Ponzi.'' 
 The 9/11 widow, Monica Iken, who is on the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board, begged off because, she said, she has no time to sell between ''doing my nonprofit work and raising two kids under 4.''
 The Pace student, Christina Nieto, 24, said she could not imagine pitching health-related products to her peers, noting, ''People my age don't think about that.'' 
 Sharon Bush, the ex-wife of Neil Bush, George W. Bush's brother, was a fixture in the tabloid headlines last year when her former fiance, Gerald Tsai, sued her to get an 11-carat engagement ring returned. She spent most of the tasting sitting apart in the corner and said she preferred not to be interviewed. 
 But, she said afterward, ''You can say that I think it's very tasty.''

 Re ''How Lehman Got Its Real Estate Fix'' (May 3), about the disastrous investments pioneered by Mark A. Walsh when he was head of the global real estate group at Lehman Brothers: 
 If Mr. Walsh had done his homework, he would have walked down Main Street just once pretending to be a homebuyer and spent one day having liars' loans thrust at him. He would have met the real estate agents selling overpriced merchandise to underinformed dreamers and heard the agents' pitch -- ''Investors like you, sir, are making a fortune.'' If he had done his homework, Mr. Walsh might not have played the part he did in devastating our economy. 
 This investor did walk Main Streets in California, New Jersey and Florida. This investor saw all the concrete being poured and toured unfinished projects that were 80 percent sold before the first wall went up. And this investor sold all his real estate holdings in early 2006 while telling anyone who would listen that the financial house of cards was just about to fall. Ian Jarvis

HEADLINE: My Dream Is for Sale; Buy It for Me

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 AS any gallery owner knows, art does not exactly sell itself. Even in a bullish economy the way a work is displayed and discussed can make all the difference between igniting a collector's abiding interest and letting the ember go cold.
 This is also true in the museum world, where curators must lobby for proposed acquisitions and exhibitions, both with museum directors who sign off on projects and trustees who sign the checks. And nowhere is the sales prowess of museum curators exhibited more theatrically than in the annual Collectors Committee weekend at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
 While most curatorial sales pitches tend to take place in boardrooms behind closed doors, this event makes a rather public sport of it; this year one curator was spotted literally falling on his hands and knees before a trustee at a gala dinner, playfully yet seriously begging for acquisition funds. 
 The concept is simple: after curators argue for their proposed acquisitions, collectors, who have ponied up money to participate in the event, vote on what to buy with the pooled funds. 
 Since it began in 1986 the event has raised a total of $16 million for the purchase of 157 works, now valued by the museum at $75 million. The tradition was started by Earl A. Powell III, then the director here. He modeled it on a program still in place for buying modern art at the National Gallery of Art, which he now leads. But otherwise few museums have anything quite like it. The director of the Los Angeles County Museum, Michael Govan, called it an important income source for a ''young museum that has almost no endowments yet for acquisitions.''
 Despite the sour economy Mr. Govan attempted to make this year's event even more fruitful for his institution -- and more memorable for collectors. He added a contribution level of $60,000 to existing tiers of $15,000 and $30,000, encouraged curators to think big in their proposals (raising the suggested price ceiling to $750,000 from $350,000) and tapped the museum trustee Ann Colgin of Colgin Cellars to organize the Friday night kickoff event in late April. 
 Instead of staging the usual cocktail party Ms. Colgin called in favors from her friends in the food business, enlisting bold-name chefs like Thomas Keller, Tom Colicchio and Nancy Silverton to cook for participants in the homes of museum trustees like Victoria Jackson and William Guthy, and Willow Bay and Robert Iger. 
 ''The idea is to make this event national or even international,'' Mr. Govan said, though he acknowledged that the economy was not on his side. This year, despite the enticements, 76 donors, overwhelmingly local, contributed just over $1 million, barely topping the kitty for the last few years. The competition was fiercer than ever when 10 curators took turns at the podium on Saturday morning to give pithy talks on the works (mainly on offer from galleries) they had their hearts set on acquiring.
 ''It's nerve-racking,'' said Wendy Kaplan, the museum's head of decorative arts and design, who had been preparing for the day since November. ''You tell yourself it's only an object, not your health. But you've researched it intensively, and you're crushed if you don't get it.'' 
 In her talk Ms. Kaplan focused on the pioneering originality of her object of desire: a chair with an undulating floral pattern on its back designed around 1883 by Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo. She called it ''the first among many firsts, universally considered the first manifestation of Art Nouveau'' and ''an equally seminal example of Arts and Crafts movement production.'' She concluded that only five examples of the chair are known, and the other four already belong to ''museums renowned for their Arts and Crafts collections.'' Price: $325,000.
 Sharon Takeda, head of costume and textiles, used a blend of cultural history and humor to bring an ''astonishing 117-piece collection'' of late-19th- and early-20th-century Kuba cloths to life. She described the role of these richly patterned fabrics in the culture and told an amusing anecdote about a Kuba king who in the 1920s received a motorcycle as a gift from missionaries. He was unimpressed by the machine but ''fascinated with the pattern made in the soil by the tires,'' she said, noting that it became a source for yet another Kuba cloth pattern. She also discussed the influence of the textiles on modern artists like Matisse, who hung them in his studio. Price: $450,000 for the entire set.
 The photography head, Charlotte Cotton, lobbied for ''Henry VIII and His Six Wives,'' seven 1999 images by Hiroshi Sugimoto, whom she praised as ''the leading contemporary art photographer of today.'' The photographs are pictures of wax figures, which themselves were based on Renaissance oil portraits. The result, which Ms. Cotton called ''photographic alchemy,'' is arresting; it looks as if the 16th-century king recently agreed to a photo shoot. She concluded that Henry VIII was ''the first truly modern'' monarch, ''just as photography was the first truly modern way of seeing.'' The price: $420,000. 
 The Latin American art curator, Ilona Katzew, presented the largest painting of the day: the 32-foot-wide antiwar work by the Chilean Surrealist Roberto Matta, ''Burn, Baby, Burn,'' 1965-66, offered to the museum by the artist's heirs. The heart of her pitch was that the painting, which alludes to the Watts riots as well as to the Vietnam War, belongs in California. '' 'Burn, Baby, Burn' can be to Los Angeles what 'Guernica' is to Spain,'' she said. She noted that half of the work's cost, $1.2 million, had already been raised by the museum. (Those funds were raised by the museum's recent de-accessioning of Latin American works.)
 The Japanese art department head, Robert Singer, whom Mr. Govan introduced as the ''Ty Cobb of Collectors Committee'' because 17 of his 18 previous pitches have met with success, pulled out all stops for a set of five Momoyama-period Japanese tea-ceremony food vessels by Furuta Oribe. Carving out an exception only for the Ogata Kenzan plates already in his collection, he called this group ''the most famous Japanese ceramics that have in 450 years been allowed to come to the West.'' To make the vessels even more tempting, he showed slides of them filled with Kaiseki delectables and an image of an export license that he had obtained to allow the work to leave Japan. Total cost: $280,000. 
 By the time of the gala dinner Saturday night, collectors were busy finalizing their picks. The actor Kyle MacLachlan, a committee newcomer invited by Ms. Colgin, said he was voting for the Sugimoto. He was initially drawn to the textiles for their rich history and the chair for ''its exquisite craftsmanship and the way that it, like all great art, led to something more.'' 
 But for him Sugimoto trumped the others: ''I was thinking about the museum context and what would get people to the museum. The story of Henry XVIII is sexy. It's something you could market. I don't go to a museum to see a chair.''
 The Internet entrepreneur and investor David Bohnett, a museum trustee and event regular, voted for the Japanese food vessels, even though his own collecting field is contemporary. ''Robert Singer has helped to open my eyes to the beauty and significance of Japanese ceramics,'' he said, adding that he liked the idea of building on existing collections' strengths. 
 But in the end, no matter how sound their reasoning, neither Mr. MacLachlan nor Mr. Bohnett got his first choice. After a speedy round of voting (this year hand-held electronic devices replaced paper ballots) the Matta painting led the votes and was announced as the committee's first purchase. In the second round the Kuba textiles won out, becoming the next acquisition and just about wiping out the acquisition fund. 
 Then the real one-on-one lobbying began. As the winning curators received congratulations (''They say the Matta was the best buy per square inch,'' Ms. Katzew wryly noted), the losers, crestfallen, fielded condolences. And a few began working the room to solicit additional financial pledges. 
 That's when Mr. Singer dropped to his knees before Mr. Bohnett, who quickly promised to pitch in $50,000. Mr. Singer could also be seen on his cellphone, calling a Japanese arts patron who did not participate in this year's event.
 ''People are trying to put syndicates together,'' Mr. Bohnett offered over dessert. ''The curators know that they need to act now, or they might never get their piece.'' 
 Mr. Singer for one was not giving up his food vessels easily. ''This year was funny because the objects were so expensive,'' he said. ''But it's not the worst thing. It makes you try even harder.'' 
 By the time the gala began emptying out, Mr. Singer said he had raised $180,000 of his needed $280,000. By midnight he sent an e-mail message noting that it ''looks like it's a done deal, with pledges from 11 different donors.'' 
 And he clearly counted the food vessels toward his winning streak. ''It's very heartwarming and satisfying,'' he added, ''to know that my art candidates and my presentation of them resonated so well with the audience today.''

HEADLINE: Christine Todd, Jeffrey McLean

 BODY:
First Lt. Christine Elizabeth Todd, an Air Force pilot, and Lt. Jeffrey John McLean, a Navy pilot, were married Saturday at Fox Point Lutheran Church in Fox Point, Wis. The Rev. D. William Knapp, the church's pastor, performed the ceremony. 
 The bride, 26, is taking her husband's name. She s a refueling tanker pilot, flying KC-135 Stratotankers. She is stationed at Mildenhall Royal Air Force Base in England. In 2008, she took part in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. She graduated from the United States Air Force Academy. 
 She is the daughter of Kathleen K. Todd and Richard T. Todd of Mequon, Wis. Her father, now retired, worked in Milwaukee as the derivatives sales manager for U.S. Bank of Minneapolis. Her mother works in the Milwaukee office of the Internal Revenue Service, for which she manages the leadership development program of the Taxpayer Advocate Service.
 The bridegroom, also 26, flies F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters. He is stationed in Virginia Beach and graduated from the United States Naval Academy with distinction. He also received a master's degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Oxford, where he was both a Fulbright Scholar and a Truman Scholar. He is the president of the Truman Scholars Association, the alumni organization for the Truman Scholarship. 
 He is a son of Mary and Don McLean of Mequon. His mother is the Kellner Professor of Early Childhood Education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. His father works in Milwaukee as the chief pilot of Midwest Airlines. 
 The couple met while students at Homestead High School in Mequon. They starting dating when she was a freshman and he a sophomore. They parted as friends when he went off to Annapolis in 2000, and she was preparing to enter the Air Force Academy the following year. Both come from families of distinguished military pilots and both had long had dreams of carrying on that tradition.
 Through the years, the couple kept in touch over the telephone, and rekindled their romance at the Navy-Air Force football game in 2003. By the time Navy had won that game, the couple decided that in the future, nothing would come between them, not even the Atlantic Ocean. 
 ''She will hopefully be restationed somewhere near Virginia by next year,'' Lieutenant McLean said. ''It's tough, but we've been through many long cellphone conversations and done many trips back and forth to England, but I can't wait for the two of us to be closer together -- it would be nice to take a weekend drive and be able to see her.''

HEADLINE: A German Wave, Focused on Today

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
TO judge from the German films that have made their way onto the world stage in the last few years German cinema is drawn almost obsessively to the nation's historical landmarks, of which there is clearly no shortage. Recent award-winning exports have taken on Nazis (''Downfall''), the Stasi police state (''The Lives of Others'') and the pains of reunification (''Good Bye Lenin!'').
 But alongside these big movies with important themes and a capital-H notion of history, a cluster of thoughtful, low-key independent films has emerged, most from a loose network of filmmakers known as the Berlin School. The work of Christian Petzold, 49, a senior member of this quasi-movement, has a particularly charged and complicated relationship with history. 
 Unlike many German directors, Mr. Petzold has no interest in excavating the past. But he also realizes that making movies about his country's uncertain present means having to contend with traces and aftermaths, and perhaps even telling a few ghost stories. 
 Mr. Petzold and his peers were educated in the '80s and '90s, dreary times for German cinema, during which most filmmakers were not only uninspired but also indifferent to the particulars of contemporary life. ''We told ourselves we need to make realistic movies,'' Mr. Petzold said, speaking recently by phone from his home in Berlin. ''There were no movies about '89 in Germany, no movies about the German Democratic Republic, no movies about the new bourgeoisie. It was as if German movies were not paying attention.''
 Mr. Petzold's latest film, ''Jerichow,'' which played at the Venice and Toronto film festivals last year and opens at Film Forum in Manhattan on Friday, is set in a depressed region in northeast Germany near the Baltic Sea. Thomas (Benno Furmann), a former soldier, returns home from Afghanistan and takes the only job he can find, working for Ali (Hilmi Sozer), a Turkish immigrant made good who runs a chain of roadside food shacks. It's not long before sparks are flying between Thomas and Ali's leggy blond wife, Laura (Nina Hoss).
 If the setup seems familiar, that's because Mr. Petzold is borrowing his genre conventions from James M. Cain's classic pulp novel ''The Postman Always Rings Twice,'' which has inspired several film adaptations, starting with Tay Garnett's 1946 noir with Lana Turner. ''Jerichow'' grew out of a conversation between Mr. Petzold and his regular collaborator, the filmmaker Harun Farocki. While shooting Mr. Petzold's previous feature, ''Yella'' (2007), partly set in Wittenberge, an industrial town in the east, the two men came across huge abandoned factories, and the talk turned to labor and class conflicts.
 ''American history is full of struggles of workers against owners, and I was asking why that isn't reflected in American movies,'' Mr. Petzold said. ''Harun said, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is the American class-struggle movie. And I liked the idea that American cinema often deals with politics on the micro level.''
 He could be describing the approach of his own films: compact, methodical dramas that bring a steely focus to the tensions and contradictions of a reunified Germany, as they reverberate in everyday life.
 ''I think like a Westerner,'' said Mr. Petzold, who was born in Hilden, a town near Dusseldorf, ''so the East is an interesting region for me.'' 
 ''There wasn't the development like we had in the West,'' he added. ''You could find cities like they were in the '20s, with a church and a factory and a town square. That's where they found their lovers. In the West we would drive our cars to the malls and have popcorn and beer in the parking lot.''
 But since reunification the westward migration of East Germans and the collapse of East German industry have created a landscape of what Mr. Petzold called ''ghost towns,'' eerily depopulated and frozen in time. The area where ''Jerichow'' takes place reminded him of Walker Evans photographs and reinforced a connection to the Depression-era setting of ''The Postman Always Rings Twice.'' But ''I didn't want to just take an American story and put it in Germany,'' he said. ''I wanted to find it in Germany.''
 In ''Jerichow'' a rote love triangle is complicated on all sides by cold, hard economic truths. While writing the film Mr. Petzold found himself coming back to a single question: ''What happens to love when there is no work anymore?'' In an emotional moment Laura blurts out the film's blunt thesis: ''It's impossible to love without money.'' 
 The movie also brings in the complicating factor of race. In making one member of its central trio an immigrant, ''Jerichow'' recalls another shrewd remake by a German director, ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' (1974), Rainer Werner Fassbinder's socially conscious melodrama of forbidden love inspired by Douglas Sirk's ''All That Heaven Allows'' (1955). 
 ''Jerichow'' uses genre devices to prod viewers into confronting their possibly unexamined prejudices. Laura and Thomas's coupling seems predestined, and as soon as the plot wheels start turning, Ali, whom Mr. Petzold described as ''an immigrant with a blond German girl, a Range Rover, a house in the forest,'' is the designated outsider, not least in his own mind. ''He's more German than the others,'' Mr. Petzold added, ''but he's also more estranged than the others.''
 Mr. Petzold's overriding vision of contemporary Germany as a phantom zone started to form in ''The State I Am In'' (2000), the first film he made for theatrical release after working in television for several years. It depicts a nuclear family haunted by the demise of the radical left, unable to shake the failed revolution's long hangover. The parents are former anarchists on the run; their teenage daughter wants nothing more than a normal life. 
 The pointedly titled ''Ghosts'' (2005), an inverted chance-and-coincidence film in which the connections among the characters are fleeting and perhaps even imagined, transplants a Grimm fairy tale about a grieving mother into the wooded parks and alienating urban spaces of present-day Berlin.
 Suffused with a sense of perpetual transit Mr. Petzold's films often feature extended driving scenes. But instead of celebrating the romance of the open road, they use the automobile as what he called ''a pressure chamber for drama.'' Car crashes are pivotal in both ''The State I Am In'' and ''Yella,'' in which Mr. Petzold nudges his spectral characters into a supernatural framework lifted from Ambrose Bierce's short story ''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'' (the basis for the 1962 cult film ''Carnival of Souls'' and M. Night Shyamalan's ''Sixth Sense'').
 The titular heroine of ''Yella'' (played by Ms. Hoss) heads west, looking to start over. (''You read in the newspapers of the East that there are no young women anymore,'' Mr. Petzold said. ''The women leave first, not the men; the men are conservative.'') En route Yella's resentful ex-husband drives them into the Elbe River, which formed part of the old border between East and West. She survives and goes on to thrive as a high-powered financier, but her progression through a series of glassy hotels and boardrooms has an ominous, dreamlike air. The late-capitalist world, the film slyly suggests, is akin to a land of the living dead.
 Mr. Petzold's films are hardly academic, but their cerebral bent reflects his educational background. After obtaining a master's degree in German literature, he enrolled at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin, known as the country's most intellectually rigorous film school, where he studied with Mr. Farocki and Hartmut Bitomsky, both politically inclined critics and documentarians.
 Mr. Petzold and his academy colleagues Thomas Arslan (''Vacation'') and Angela Schanelec (''Passing Summer'') have been unofficially installed as the founding figures of the Berlin School, the most notable development in German movies since the New German Cinema of the 1970s introduced Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders to audiences worldwide. A wave of younger filmmakers has followed, including Maria Speth (''Madonnas''), Christoph Hochhausler (''Low Profile'') and, perhaps most promising of all, Maren Ade, whose latest film, ''Everyone Else,'' won prizes at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. 
 Many Berlin School filmmakers have found critical support at home and abroad but have also faced a backlash from those in the German film industry who consider their movies too small or arty or, in some cases, apolitical. In response one of the directors, Ulrich Kohler (''Bungalow''), published a polemic titled ''Why I Don't Make Political Films'' (translated into English in a recent issue of Cinema Scope magazine). ''A cinema that doesn't want to participate in the exploitation of history is not politically ignorant,'' he wrote.
 The brand of German cinema made with the export market and Oscar night in mind is interested mainly in ''closing doors,'' Mr. Petzold said. ''After you see a German movie about Auschwitz, Auschwitz is gone.''
 French critics have called the Berlin School a ''Nouvelle Vague Allemande,'' a German counterpart to the rabble-rousing French New Wave. Mr. Petzold prefers to think of the revolution in more modest -- and more concrete -- terms. ''With the Nouvelle Vague they set out to destroy what came before,'' he said. ''In our case we thought we just had to reinvent something.''

HEADLINE: The Family That Job-Hunts Together

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail:Generationb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
 STEVE DIAMOND had a highly successful, 30-year career as an actuary overseeing Fortune 500 companies' pension plans. By applying that same rigor to his family finances, he was able to retire five years ago at age 55.
 By then, he and his wife, Andrea, had put aside money for their three sons to attend college. Their eldest, Matt, 24, graduated last year with a five-year dual degree from Johns Hopkins University and its Peabody Conservatory ($225,000). The middle son, Jeremy, 22, graduates this weekend with a communications degree with honors from American University ($180,000). Ethan, 17, the youngest, a high school junior, hopes to attend a college with a five-year architectural program.
 Mr. Diamond's success allowed his wife to stay home, raise the boys and volunteer for several boards in this well-to-do suburb.
 Their plan was to live here until Ethan graduated, then, once the nest was empty, sell their six-bedroom house and start anew. 
 ''Before retiring,'' Mr. Diamond said, ''I spent a couple of weeks constructing a financial model to demonstrate whether we could live on the assets we'd accumulated. And we could.''
 ''I looked at a number of different sets of assumptions I thought were reasonably conservative and sensible,'' explained Mr. Diamond, who has a master's in actuarial science and is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries. ''I factored in inflation and the possibility of an underperforming market.''
 He would periodically review his model's assumptions and discuss their prospects with his wife. ''He'd say, 'We're ahead of ourselves, we're in good shape,' '' Mrs. Diamond said.
 But last fall, when the nation's economy collapsed so did Mr. Diamond's model.
 ''If you did a probability distribution of what could happen, what we've experienced since last fall is well below a 5 percent probability,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''But here we are.''
 And where is that?
 Mr. Diamond at 60 is looking for an actuarial job. Mrs. Diamond at 55 has found a part-time library position and is seeking full-time work.
 Matt, the oldest son, had a job offer in Baltimore withdrawn just as he graduated, and has lived at home for the last year.
 Jeremy, who had three high-powered internships in television news during college, will move home on Sunday, the day after graduation, also unemployed.
 Instead of nearly empty, their nest is full, and no one has consulted Mr. Diamond's model for months. ''I don't have to look at it,'' he said. ''I know the numbers. If we don't find employment, either we have to lower our cash outflow or die young.''
 The Diamonds know they're more fortunate than most. They've built a cushion that has shielded them from the worst, and depending on how long this goes on, they may be fine.
 ''I have a fair degree of confidence, but it's not unshakeable confidence,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''At the end of the day we can sell the house and move to a place where the cost of living's not like northern New Jersey. We're not going to starve; that won't happen. Intellectually, I know that. But emotionally this last year is the most stressful of my life. Some nights I can't sleep. My weight is up. It's affected my health.''
 It has been a humbling time. Mrs. Diamond, who has a master's degree in library science and was chairwoman of the library committee at her sons' school for a decade, is applying for work with a 25-year gap in her resume. ''On one application, there was a whole page of databases I didn't know and had to leave blank,'' she said.
 In November, Mrs. Diamond and Matt, whose major at Johns Hopkins was neuroscience, were vying for the same job, a research analyst for a pharmaceuticals company -- until she withdrew. ''As a mother, I felt it was more important for Matt to get his foot in the door,'' she said. It didn't matter; the position was frozen. No one was hired.
 Matt, as it turns out, was the canary in the family's coal mine, feeling the recession well before the government named it. During college, he had two internships composing computer-generated background music for commercials and films. He was so good at it that a Baltimore company offered him a full-time position, starting at $30,000.
 ''They even showed him where his office would be,'' Mrs. Diamond said.
 But just weeks before he graduated, the company announced a job freeze. In July 2008, Matt moved home, built a Web site and began sending e-mails to music houses and anyone he found online making films. ''I really wanted this,'' Matt said. ''I felt like a musical person, like it's something I could see myself doing.''
 Mrs. Diamond had always told her boys that if they pursued what they loved, things would work out, but now she's less sure.
 During Matt's college years, his father had suggested a more traditional profession, and lately has wondered if he should have pushed harder. ''Any number of times I asked Matt, Would you like to be a doctor?'' Mr. Diamond recalled. ''I asked if he'd be interested in entertainment law. It's a way to make money and still be connected to music.''
 After six months with no prospects, Matt enrolled in January to take two computer science courses at a local college, and is now thinking that may be a more practical career choice. ''I e-mailed all these music houses over and over, did everything I could, to the point I'm thinking, do I want it that badly to put myself through this ridiculous process,'' he said. ''When I had the job at the music house, I was living my dream, but now it doesn't seem live or die with music. I can always do music in my spare time.''
 JEREMY still hopes for a news job with a network TV station. His three internships included stints at MSNBC and the ''Weekend Today'' show. His junior year he was news director for the campus TV station; the student who had that position the year before was hired right out of college by the CBS affiliate in Dover, Del. ''I have to put aside my feelings that my class got a raw deal,'' Jeremy said. ''I try to keep optimistic.'' 
 He's not happy about moving home. ''My parents give me everything,'' he said, ''but I don't want to put more strain on them. I should be handling my own stuff.''
 Mr. Diamond's actuarial mind had him thinking this would be a good moment to be graduating from college. ''I thought the baby boomers would be retiring, opening up jobs, but now the baby boomers can't retire, making it very difficult for the kids.''
 He worries his sons may get caught in a demographic black hole. ''By the time the economy turns around, it's not just experienced people they'll be competing with,'' he said, ''it's also kids coming out of school after them. People will be piling up and how it gets sorted out is quite worrisome.''
 The father tries not to blame himself for the family's setbacks, but sometimes he does. ''I feel bad about Andrea having to go back to work,'' he said. ''If I had a job, none of this would be going on.''
 ''Stop it,'' Mrs. Diamond said. ''You worked so hard all those years.''

HEADLINE: The Crisis Came. Mexico Didn't Fail. Surprised?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
-- Just for argument's sake, let's compare Mexico's management of the swine flu epidemic that broke out here last month with China's handling of SARS in 2002. The Chinese initially tried to deny there was an outbreak, were slow to combat its spread and resisted cooperation with foreign investigators. By the time SARS was brought under control, more than 700 people had died.
 Mexico's conduct has been different. The authorities may have been slow to identify the threat, but once they did, they quickly notified international health agencies, acted efficiently to prevent the epidemic from mushrooming, and began working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. As of Friday, the death toll was 45.
 That response flies in the face of recent descriptions of Mexico as a ''failed state'' that is ''on the verge of civil war'' -- phrases that seem a staple on American talk radio, cable television and political blogs. Apocalyptic language like that is based on the violence of Mexico's battles with the drug cartels that supply the American market, and with the severity of its economic downturn, which has been complicated by the fact that more than 80 percent of its trade is with the United States. 
 Both trends are indeed playing out, but what they mean for Mexico's future is far from certain. At any rate, they stand in contrast to a number of fundamental changes that I have seen here over the last month -- my first extended stay in this country since a four-year stint as The New York Times bureau chief here ended in July 1990. 
 For example: In contrast to the secretive, suspicious one-party state I left behind, the Mexico on view today is clearly a democracy -- flawed and fractious, but up and running. Many Mexicans, especially young people and artists with whom I spent time, also seemed more comfortable with their identity as a people and nation than their counterparts in the 1980s, when intellectuals focused relentlessly on grievances against the United States. 
 Such shifts in attitude are matters of degree, of course, and have their limits. ''There have been transformations,'' Lorenzo Mayer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico, said in an interview. ''But a true transition, we haven't had that yet. There are many things from your time that continue the same.'' 
 Still, it is worth recalling how insular Mexico could be. There was, for instance, the official response to the last crisis that nature inflicted on the country: a September 1985 earthquake here. That disaster, which I helped cover, killed at least 5,000 people, but the exact number will never be known, in part because of the government's reaction. President Miguel de la Madrid declared a news blackout, and the Foreign Ministry didn't just refrain from seeking assistance from abroad; it turned down an aid offer from the United States.
 Just before President Obama visited here on April 16, in contrast, the Mexican Senate approved a request by the government of President Felipe Calderon to allow the Mexican Navy to participate, for the first time, in annual exercises with the United States and other nearby countries. During Mr. Obama's trip, Mr. Calderon even briefly addressed Mr. Obama in English in public at the Mexican White House; that was something that Mexican presidents always avoided in my day, for reasons of sovereignty, self-image and the very complicated history of American-Mexican relations. 
 None of this suggests that Mexico has become a model state. Far from it: Even though more than 70 years of one-party rule have ended, corruption and impunity continue to be huge problems. The state and privileged interest groups are still very cozy, with the teachers' union replacing the oil workers' union as the current favorite. And television is still dominated by two networks that seem very deferential to the government -- a more conservative one than the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled when Mexico was my beat. 
 ''We're stuck in the worst of all worlds, because even though there are now more players in the political game, the game itself is pretty much the same one, of elite rotation,'' said Denise Dresser, a political science professor here. ''What you've created is a perverse system of oligopolistic elites with vested interests and a willingness to use their veto power to prevent the changes that are needed but which they don't want.''
 Mr. Calderon also seems to have fallen victim to a tradition that Mexican presidents, who are limited to a single six-year term, make some grand gesture to differentiate themselves from their predecessors. He decided to confront the drug cartels head on, only to discover that he may have bitten off more than he can chew; that partly accounts for the dead bodies frequently turning up in parts of the country where that conflict is playing out -- and for the fears up north. 
 The violence has, indeed, sometimes been dramatic and it is often cited by the same doomsayers in the United States who point to a recent United States Joint Command report that identifies Pakistan and Mexico as candidates for ''rapid and sudden collapse.'' But that Pentagon assessment is a reminder of testimony by Gen. Paul Gorman, then the head of the United States Southern Command, to Congress in 1984. Over the next decade, he warned then, Mexico could become the United States' ''number one security problem.'' That is not what happened. 
 Many of the changes I noticed here, both positive and negative, are clearly a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994. That accord has resulted in epochal changes for Mexico, including the virtual disappearance of the ejido, a communitarian system of landholding that many Mexicans once regarded with almost mystical nostalgia. 
 ''Mexico has become a de facto economic colony of the United States,'' Joseph Contreras, a correspondent here for Newsweek magazine in the 1980s and again this decade, writes in ''In the Shadow of the Giant,'' a new book that examines the recent evolution of the relationship between the two countries. ''The Americanization of modern Mexico transcends mere dollars and cents. It can be seen in the influence of American traditions, resources and values on Mexico's social mores, foreign policy, consumer tastes, health problems and even everyday language.'' 
 Today, like it or not, the two countries are bound together inextricably in ways that would have been unthinkable during my time here. There is an old expression here, originally applied to economics and trade, that says ''when the United States sneezes, Mexico catches cold.'' The events of the last month suggest that the reverse may also be literally true. Or, as Jorge Castaneda, a former foreign minister who now teaches at New York University, put it: When it comes to living together, ''Mexico has no choice, and Washington has no choice, period.''

HEADLINE: Using Air and Ground Attacks, Pakistan Strikes Back at Taliban-Controlled Areas

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL

 BODY:
The Pakistani military pressed its multipronged assault on three Taliban-held districts northwest of the capital, Islamabad, on Saturday, claiming significant gains but also blaming militants for endangering noncombatants by firing indiscriminately and basing themselves in civilian homes.
 As terrified people continued to flee the fighting, the outskirts of the conflict areas are facing a critical need for more shelter and supplies. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has registered more than 120,000 residents displaced from the three contested districts -- Swat, Buner and Dir -- and surrounding areas, and warns that several hundred thousand more are likely to leave as well. For the moment, most people are able to find their own shelter, renting space or moving in with extended families in urban areas, the agency said, but such options are rapidly diminishing. 
 Military statements issued Saturday reported 15 militants killed in helicopter attacks in the Swat Valley district capital, Mingora, and as many as 40 militants killed in other parts of the district, news agencies said. Those claims -- and the military's overall count of more than 140 slain insurgents -- are impossible to verify independently, given that aid agencies and journalists are barred from the conflict areas. 
 A provincial official, Iftikhar Hussain, accused the Taliban of causing civilian deaths. ''The militants are using the civilian population as a human shield, and they have dug trenches in civilian areas,'' Mr. Hussain told reporters at a news conference in Peshawar. 
 Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani held an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday, calling afterward at a news conference for popular support for the military operations. The army ''can only be successful if there is support of the masses,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. 
 Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country mired in political and economic crisis, has been deeply divided over its response to the militants, who are still seen in some sectors of the government and military as a secondary threat compared with India and who have actually received some covert support from factions within the intelligence services in the past.
 Though the current government has sought to assure the West that it is taking the militants' advances seriously, the issue has become a great source of tension with the United States, in particular. 
 After the Sept. 11 attacks and the American-led invasion of Afghanistan to oust Al Qaeda and the Taliban, the United States relied on Pakistan as its most important regional ally and has given Pakistan's military more than $1 billion a year since 2001. But the Taliban managed to regroup in the porous border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan and is now spearheading wars in both countries. 
 Pakistan intensified its military campaign to reclaim Swat and neighboring districts last week only under intense pressure from Washington, and after enduring months of a regional power struggle with the Taliban. 
 The Pakistani Army has estimated that a force of about 4,000 militants took advantage of a peace agreement in northwestern Pakistan in February to seize control of much of Swat. 
 Similar agreements in two areas to the south, the semiautonomous tribal areas of North and South Waziristan, made those regions a ministate for Qaeda and Taliban militants, drawing missile strikes by remotely piloted American drone aircraft. The drone strikes might have helped push the Taliban, and some Qaeda elements, out of the tribal belt and into Swat, making the valley and its neighboring districts more important to the Taliban. 
 On Saturday, Pakistani officials said a new missile strike in South Waziristan killed nine people, including six foreign militants, The A.P. reported.

HEADLINE: Big Cheese

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
CHEETOS GIANT
 We think of ourselves as sophisticated creatures, and the many brilliant minds of the consumer-industrial complex often think of us that way, too. But sometimes what we want seems pretty simple. Sometimes, we just want something big. 
 A case in point, perhaps: giant Cheetos. Or, more properly, Cheetos Giant. Either way, this is a new variety of the familiar bagged snack food, officially introduced on April 1, but not a joke. Its point of differentiation from the classic Cheeto is relative size. Don't worry, it's not as big as the one on the front of the bag, which is about the size of a baby's head -- that image has been ''enlarged to show detail.'' The Cheetos inside the bag are, roughly, the size of golf balls. Still pretty big, Cheeto-wise. Is this something you have always wanted? Is it something, perhaps, that you would find particularly pleasing or fun or even comforting right now? 
 ''We're in a tough economic time, and during tough economic times, people need to lighten up and unstress,'' Justin Lambeth, a vice president of marketing at Frito-Lay, asserts. ''And you know, that's what Cheetos does. It's a natural extension of the brand's personality. So, it's a perfect time to introduce the product.'' So why not, say, Ruffles the size of Frisbees? ''Cheetos is about being playful, it's about being silly,'' Lambeth replies in a thoroughly unsilly tone. ''It's about tapping into the 12-year-old in all of us. It's quirky. So this just seemed like a natural extension.'' Pause. ''For all those reasons.'' 
 Well, O.K. The bag describes its contents as ''Dangerously cheesy taste in a dangerously cheesy ball!'' The phrase ''dangerously cheesy'' has a trademark next to it. To me, the contents do look dangerous. But then even my inner 12-year-old finds Cheetos a little frightening, with the product's unnaturally glowing orange color, curious ''dust'' and hard-to-explain shape suggesting the byproduct of an industrial accident rather than a food stuff. So I'll leave the reviews to others. Taquitos.net says: ''There was a pretty good cheese taste, plus a lot of corn-puff taste from the vast cheeseless interior. The crunch level was somewhere between the level of Cheetos Puffs and Cheetos Crunchy.'' Seriouseats.com: ''I imagine this is what eating a ball of Styrofoam is like. The skin inside my mouth felt sore after being repeatedly scraped by Cheetos shards.'' USA Today agreed with Frito-Lay marketers that big ol' Cheetos ''make folks smile.'' 
 Consistent with the familiar proliferation of brand variations in many product categories, there are already many varieties of Cheetos, with worldwide sales of just over $3 billion last year. The snack was introduced in 1948, and since 1986 the brand's mascot has been Chester Cheetah, who today is a sort of cool troublemaker. He approves of Cheetos-eaters using the snack to thwart annoying or self-centered people. The campaign for Cheetos Giant does not specifically play on the recession, although it ''highlights the giantness of the product,'' Lambeth says. (He notes that since last year Cheetos has officially been marketed primarily to adult consumers. Presumably that's at least partly because PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay, is among 15 or so snack, food and soda conglomerates that have pledged not to market certain products to children under the age of 12.) ''Part of the fun of the product is consumers trying to figure out whether it's a single bite or a double bite,'' Lambeth says. ''Whether they stuff or whether they just chomp on it.''
 That does sound like fun! Or let's just agree that it might be, if you're into Cheetos. But is it recession-specific fun? The appeal of the big seems to transcend any economic moment: People who bought immense trucks during better times still loom behind me on the road, and comically large television sets dominate millions of American living rooms; fast-food customers hoist supersize drums of soda regardless of the Dow's condition. And while sometimes ''big'' means a bargain (bulky jars of mayonnaise at Costco, etc.), it's worth noting that the 7*-ounce bag of Cheetos Giant costs the same as an 8.5-ounce bag of comparatively petite Cheetos Puffs. In other words the Giant variety offers less Cheeto for your money -- so the pleasure of bigness must be its own reward. Maybe that's the point. Needlessly large homes and jewelry do seem further out of reach these days; maybe needlessly large Cheetos give fans access to the little dose of big they crave.

HEADLINE: Of Pigs, Planes and Protectionism

 BODY:
The World Health Organization, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Animal Health have stated flat out that properly cooked pork ''will not be a source of infection'' for influenza A(H1N1). 
 That has not stopped China, Indonesia, Russia and a dozen more countries from banning imports of pork products from the United States, Canada and others touched by the virus. Egypt hasn't had a case of flu, yet the government ordered herds slaughtered. Afghanistan quarantined its only known pig, in the Kabul zoo. 
 The last pigs reported to have contracted the swine flu probably got it from a human in Canada. Unfortunately, the aversion to pigs and their products is not simply a case of bad science. It is another example of the dangerous insularity and protectionism that has rippled around the world since the start of the financial crisis. 
 Russia took the opportunity to ban all meat products from Mexico and parts of the United States. Even before the flu outbreak, China had deployed several arguments to try to keep out American pork. India has imposed new tariffs on steel imports; Argentina slapped import licensing requirements on products from textiles to tires. Congress put a Buy American clause in the fiscal stimulus plan. 
 Egyptian pig farmers, Christian Copts, believe the government is using the crisis to punish them. Other measures, like the suspension of flights to Mexico by Argentina, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru and China, might be misguided attempts to quell popular fear.
 What these measures are clearly not about is protecting public health. 
 The W.H.O. explicitly advised against travel bans, stating that they would do nothing to stop the spread of the virus. Indeed, these disproportionate responses might end up undermining the world's ability to deal with future pandemics, as afflicted countries will be less willing to disclose the extent of the threat they face.
 As the world works its way through what will be a couple of more years of dismal economic performance and likely social unrest, governments should temper the fear-mongering and self-serving protectionism. They must buttress the rules, treaties and organizations that have promoted global integration and rising prosperity for a half century. That is the best way to deal with an uncertain and dangerous world.

HEADLINE: Free Fall's Over, but Where Are We Landing?

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho 

 BODY:
 BACK in September, when financial reality was still merely horrible but not yet catastrophic, a local software start-up called Balihoo was poised to expand. 
 It already sported the outward trappings of tech world success: an airy space in an old brick warehouse downtown, renovated with recycled wood and glass; a roomful of 20-somethings in fleece pullovers, their mountain bikes hanging from wall-mounted racks; and a hot new product. 
 All that Balihoo needed was more money, and it was about to get some. Three venture capital firms beckoned with offers to invest a fresh $3 million in the young company.
 Then Lehman Brothers collapsed, beginning a string of spectacular Wall Street failures. As primal fear seized the financial system, money suddenly became as difficult to secure as true love on a reality dating show. The venture capitalists changed their minds. 
 ''All that interest disappeared,'' says Balihoo's chief executive, Peter Gombert. ''It was nuclear winter.'' 
 In October, Balihoo laid off 10 people in Boise and braced for more painful days. But in the last several weeks, the venture capitalists have returned, enticed by Balihoo's strong sales, and also by something infinitely more valuable: glimmers of renewed faith in parts of American commerce. ''Risk'' no longer seems like a radioactive word. 
 ''The spigot turned back on,'' says Mr. Gombert, who now expects to raise as much as $5 million. Some of that money will allow him to hire four or five people who will help Balihoo continue to make software that enables national brands to customize local advertising campaigns. 
 ''We still will be pretty conservative in our growth,'' he says. ''The economy still hasn't rebounded, and one of the worst things we could do is spend that money fruitlessly. Everybody's still feeling the pain, but we're starting to see a little creep up in confidence.''
 Three months into a new presidency begun in the midst of deepening economic desperation, the myriad programs of the Obama administration appear to have taken the edge off the financial crisis while generating momentum toward economic recovery that remains, by most estimates, at least several months away.
 After the convulsions of last fall, when seemingly impregnable financial institutions fell and cash all but vanished from many areas of commercial life, borrowers with decent credit -- from home buyers to corporations -- are finding money available on increasingly attractive terms. Home sales are up in many markets, albeit at sharply lower prices. Consumer spending, still shrinking, has nonetheless halted its panicked retreat. 
 Yet the economy remains pitifully weak, with distress abundant from strapped households to anxious corporate boardrooms. More than two million jobs disappeared over the first three months of the year as the unemployment rate soared to 8.5 percent. With wages still shrinking or evaporating, stock portfolios and savings accounts ravaged, and the future still uncomfortably uncertain, millions of households are likely to keep scrimping, challenging any potential recovery.
 ''We've just had the worst hit to wealth in the history of the data,'' says Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm the Investment Technology Group. ''The labor market data is unambiguously horrible.''
 So will the Obama administration's apparent achievement in arresting an economic free fall yield a sustainable revival, creating millions of jobs, generating fresh business opportunities and restoring a sense of optimism? 
 Can programs aimed at reinvigorating the financial system make money flow, allowing companies to expand and hire? Will federal spending amount to something like a pinata at a children's birthday party, with the proceeds scattered willy-nilly? Or will that money help catalyze a genuine economic renewal?
 BOISE, a metropolitan area of 600,000 people set in the high desert, is as good a place as any to try to figure this out. In many respects, the local economy presents a microcosm of the recent American experience, making it a useful laboratory.
 A former trading post on the Oregon Trail, Boise now has microbreweries, coffee houses and bohemian chic boutiques inhabiting brick storefronts downtown. Beefy men in chamois shirts debate fishing tackle over steins of beer, while others with goatees and pierced lips sip chai lattes and discuss herbal medicine. 
 A lattice of trails threads into the surrounding Rocky Mountain foothills. A combination of outdoor appeal, local technology jobs and affordable homes has attracted thousands of families to the area. Many have escaped expensive, traffic-filled lives in cities like Seattle, Los Angeles and Phoenix. Some have settled in Craftsman-style homes north of downtown. Many have landed in suburbs west of town, where vast stretches of farmland have been carved into subdivisions.
 In what now stands as the guiding narrative of precrisis American life, abundant land fertilized by easy finance delivered a local construction boom, much as it did in Florida, California and elsewhere, on seemingly every patch of soil not occupied by a toxic waste dump. Speculators poured in on organized bus trips, driving prices skyward. 
 But after too many homes were built and prices had climbed beyond any rational connection to local incomes, Boise suffered the same punishing pullback that has afflicted much of the country.
 Prices of existing homes in the Boise area leapt from an average of $130,000 in 2003 to $206,000 in 2007 but fell to $170,000 by the end of 2008, according to Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Building construction jobs in the Boise area plunged to 3,000 in March from 5,000 in the summer of 2006, according to the Labor Department. Over that same period, the local unemployment rate soared to 8.6 percent from 2.4 percent.
 Exacerbating that picture is the crisis confronting Boise's largest employer, Micron Technology, a manufacturer of memory products used in cellphones and other electronics. In the face of a global production glut and weak consumer demand, Micron has lost more than $2.7 billion over the last two years.
 Layoffs have shrunk the company's local work force to about 6,000 today from 10,000 three years ago, with another 1,000 jobs to be excised this year.
 ''We're spending very, very conservatively,'' says Micron's president and chief operating officer, Mark Durcan.
 Micron's headquarters feel like a dusty trophy from another era -- a campus of boxy buildings ringed by parking lots, with reception areas reminiscent of hospitals, and carpeted floors chopped into cubicles. Among locals, one hears talk that Micron, despite the company's assurances to the contrary, cannot possibly remain here much longer.
 ''Micron is a big scare,'' says Danielle Cullip, a Realtor at Serenity Real Estate. ''The fall of Micron is going to be horrendous.''
 Micron's troubles help explain why Paramount -- a suburban development with plans for 1,500 homes -- remains only one-third built five years after it was begun. ''THIS STREET IS TO BE EXTENDED IN THE FUTURE,'' read placards affixed to barriers where pavement gives way to empty, scrub-covered earth. 
 Paramount is the work of a local developer, the Brighton Corporation, whose principal, Peter Oliver, grew up in a hippie commune in New Mexico. ''All I ever wanted was indoor plumbing and cable television,'' Mr. Oliver recalls.
 Now he makes his living peddling the comforts he once craved, offering a quintessential slice of American suburbia. Yet the credit that nurtured this lifestyle for decades is gone, putting his homes beyond reach of many families. In this new, post-easy-money era, many households are relinquishing aspirations for more, bigger, newer. 
 ''This isn't a correction,'' Mr. Oliver says. ''It's a full-blown reset.''
 Still, at a recent showing of Paramount's model homes, nearly 500 people arrived for a look at gleaming kitchens and family rooms.
 ''People with decent jobs and decent credit are saying, 'It's time to buy,' '' says Mr. Oliver. ''People get to a certain point where they're just sick of feeling bad about stuff.''
 Real estate agents and mortgage brokers say they have seen renewed interest from first-time home buyers. They credit lower mortgage rates -- the result of the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration pumping cash into markets -- as well as another administration initiative unleashed in February: First-time home buyers are eligible for tax credits up to $8,000.
 ''It's gotten buyers off the fence,'' says Suzi Boyle, a mortgage originator at Evergreen Home Loans in downtown Boise.
 Last month, Jason Sears, an easygoing, single 31-year-old, offered $140,000 for a four-bedroom house in a gentrifying part of town. Ms. Boyle secured him a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.7 percent.
 Mr. Sears works as the operations director at the local Boys and Girls Club, an organization financed largely by corporate donations. Back in January, with donations withering, he was too frightened about his own job security to buy a home. Things have changed. ''I do feel a little more secure,'' he says. 
 In March, sales of area homes leapt 48 percent compared with the previous month, though that was still down 8 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the Ada County Association of Realtors.
 ''We know it's not getting worse, and that's almost enough,'' says Marc Lebowitz, the association's chief executive.
 BOISE still faces hurdles. So much lending poured into real estate development that the area is encircled by a kingdom of empty lots, making banks on the hook for those loans reluctant to take risks on other ventures.
 ''There's probably an eight-year supply of building lots,'' says Dave Player, senior vice president in commercial lending at Mountain West Bank, a regional lender.
 As speculators absorb losses, breadwinners surrender wages, and low introductory rates on mortgages reset higher, a foreclosure wave appears to be gathering force. In some suburban areas, like Meridian, foreclosures increased nearly 75 percent over the first three months of the year, according to RealtyTrac.
 ''If we don't get those foreclosures stopped, this is going to be long and painful,'' says Ms. Boyle of Evergreen Home Loans. ''Foreclosures are killing us.''
 The federal government has long portrayed foreclosures as a crucial national problem, but ever since the financial crisis began, it has failed to find solutions.
 In February, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced a plan aimed at sparing as many as four million distressed homeowners from foreclosure by rewriting their mortgages. Only a few thousand have been modified so far, the Treasury says, though the department has signed contracts with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers obliging them to consider modifying delinquent loans. 
 The agency says it expects to see the pace pick up soon, but analysts are worried that the Treasury program may never provide enough help. Moratoriums on foreclosures adopted by some institutions are now running out, long before the Treasury program gains momentum. If banks suffer new losses as homeowners run into trouble, they could tighten their lending anew and further suffocate the economy just as it is showing signs of improvement.
 ''This is shaping up to be a disappointment,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.
 Another crucial initiative has also been slow to develop: a Treasury plan to encourage investors to buy bad bank assets using government loans and thus free banks to lend more aggressively. That program isn't expected to become operational until the middle of the year, and many investors are wary of the assets. 
 Similar troubles confront a program aimed at freeing money for auto loans, credit card lending and other consumer finance. 
 ''Investors are worrying about the government's penchant for changing the terms of the deal,'' says Alan S. Blinder, a former member of the Federal Reserve and an economist at Princeton. ''The belief is there's a danger that the government's going to put more restrictions on you if you participate.''
 Andrew Petrehn isn't sure about the details of the programs being unleashed in Washington, but he is certain that no benefits have reached him. In December 2007, he and his wife, Saundra McDavid, expanded their popular barbecue restaurant, Andrew's Rib Shack, leasing a 3,500-square-foot space in Boise. They borrowed $150,000 from a local bank. A private equity firm discussed expanding their brand as far as San Diego. 
 But as the recession unfolded, the new restaurant drew few customers. The private equity firm went away. The couple cut staff to 6 from 25 and reduced hours. In February, they shut the doors. These days, they cater out of a rented church kitchen. 
 Mr. Petrehn is keen to own a restaurant again. ''There's prime locations that are vacant right now and potentially very cheap,'' he says. But no one is willing to lend him the money. ''The banks are still shut down.''
 Even successful ventures are feeling the crunch. Kevin C. Settles, co-owner of Bardenay, a chain of restaurants known for distilling its own rum, vodka and gin, has seen sales slide only about 1 percent at its two Boise-area locations. Yet his banker recently bumped up the interest rate on his line of credit by 2.5 percentage points -- ''for no apparent reason,'' he complains.
 Food costs have fallen and high unemployment has made it easier to hire quality people -- ideal conditions for expansion, says Mr. Settles. But he doesn't think he can get capital.
 Bankers are unapologetic. ''We're doing commercial lending, but they're going to have to make sure they have cash flows,'' says Joey Perry, vice president at D. L. Evans Bank, an Idaho lender that received $20 million in federal bailout money.
 AMONG some economists, a sense has taken hold that the Obama administration's plans have been unduly shaped by political pragmatism: Given public disgust over bonuses paid to executives at bailed out financial institutions, Congress is reluctant to hand over more money, forcing the administration to resort to gimmickry in an effort to repair lenders without further nicking taxpayers.
 Others say that focusing too narrowly on the immediate financial and economic programs misses the true significance of the Obama administration's undertaking. Not since Franklin D. Roosevelt stepped into the White House in the Great Depression has a new president confronted such a stark challenge. 
 In addition to his financial system and federal spending initiatives, Mr. Obama has already annunciated a ''long-term strategic vision'' for the economy, centered on expanding health care and education while embracing renewable energy, argues David M. Kennedy, a historian at Stanford University, whose book, ''Freedom From Fear,'' recounts Roosevelt's New Deal.
 ''They understand the task is not just to restore the economy to business as usual but to put it on a sounder footing going forward,'' he says. 
 In the first weeks of Mr. Obama's tenure, he persuaded Congress to approve $787 billion worth of federal spending to stimulate the economy -- $288 billion in tax cuts plus $499 billion to aid states and local governments.
 In crucial ways, this spending has already had an effect, say economists. It extended unemployment benefits and food stamps, while cutting by nearly two-thirds the amount that laid-off workers must pay to retain their health insurance. 
 But whether it revives economic activity remains unknown. The tax cuts are only now being distributed. Only about $75 billion has been dedicated, mostly to public works projects like road-building.
 ''The moment of truth is coming soon,'' says Mr. Zandi. ''If we don't see something real in the data by June, then I get very nervous.'' 
 Boise's mayor, David H. Bieter, is hopeful. The federal stimulus package includes $2 million for energy efficiency projects in Boise, like retrofitting buildings. 
 And the recently passed federal budget includes $2 million to extend the reach of the city's geothermal system, which taps groundwater to heat downtown buildings. The mayor portrays that project as a crucial piece of Boise's efforts to position itself as a center of clean energy.
 At the United Brotherhood of Carpenters union hall, George Suite, a father of seven, hopes all of this federal spending will translate into a steady paycheck. He has worked only three weeks over the last year and is struggling to pay his mortgage while living on a $371-a-week unemployment check -- which has replaced the $720 in weekly take-home pay he once enjoyed.
 ''The banks are getting all that bailout money,'' he says. ''What about working people?''
 Others here are more confident that the funds streaming out of Washington will eventually make a difference.
 Tony Robinson, who was laid off from a sales job at a local division of Microsoft in January, recently took a new position at a local start-up, Inovus Solar. The company makes solar-powered street lights and high-efficiency conventional lighting -- the very products communities across the country are adding with their stimulus money.
 ''The potential of this is unbelievable,'' he says. ''It's going to be the tech sector over the next decade.''

HEADLINE: NEW YORK ON LESS: When 'Dinner and a Movie' Means A Home-Cooked Meal and a Video

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
It doesn't take much to generate a spirited discussion about the world of dating in New York.
 Last week, the City Room blog asked how the recession has affected people's dating lives. The query elicited scores of responses: Some lamented how hard times have hurt the chance for romance, while others offered a more optimistic view that dating these days simply requires a little more creativity.
 And not surprisingly, there were several comments about the pros and cons of going Dutch. Following are a selection of comments: 
 Having moved to New York a year ago, I've noticed even midrange dates can add up quickly. I think the trick is to start off going to a few reasonably nice places and then maybe downshift into the moderate zone to give her a sense of what everyday life might be like together. My terror of appearing cheap definitely colors my approach.
 However, the girls I've met here generally have not been blown away by chivalrous suitors. A sincere, funny guy who treats her well will likely make a better impression than an opulent meal at Daniel. That's what I tell myself anyway.
 Danny Palmer
 I'm more than happy to go Dutch, and I always offer to split the bill. And I'm certainly not opposed to an inexpensive date ... I would love to have someone to cook for and someone to take a long walk in the park with. What I'm concerned about is actually meeting people. I'm not going to invite someone into my home after just one or two dates and I'm not comfortable taking a walk in the woods with a near stranger.
 Stephanie Springer
 Most guys think it's appropriate to go Dutch, but if you poll the girls it's not the case. This isn't because we're cheap. It's because you feel special that someone took you out and thought that it was worth it to take care of the bill. Later on, anything goes. If I have a better job, then I'd certainly have no problem picking up the tab. But when you're still just dating (i.e., first couple of weeks), a guy who gets the bill is a must. It's like getting the door. Just think about how much more energy girls put into getting ready for dates than guys: the shoes, the dress, the hair, the makeup ... It's really just give-and-take. Emma Rabinovich
 Many of us are dating because the recession destroyed our marriages. Dan Lewis
 It really doesn't matter how much you spend on a woman or how well you get along or how well you treat her. Sure, women say that is important, but when dealing with women it's always been not what they say but what they mean. And what women really want is instant chemistry. Ask any woman who dates, especially those that use online services, and they will tell you that they can tell within five minutes if they are interested in someone or not. Here's the irony: I clearly am not the first man they met and there have been men they met who the woman thought provided that instant chemistry. So my follow-up question is, ''Where is that guy now and how come you are not still with them?''
 I am not female-bashing, and I know guys can be real jerks when it comes to dating. But as long as women think they can tell in the first five minutes and don't take the time to learn who the guy is, the dating sites will flourish.
 Barry Silverman
 I think the recession has put a strain on everything. Most of us work way too much to even have the precious time to think about dating.
 And the ''dating scene'' has turned into a complete free-for-all. It's become like an auction in a lot of ways. Patti Walls
 While this is not usually a first-date option, in my world, ''dinner and a movie'' means a nice home-cooked meal followed by a movie on my 8-foot screen. None of my dates has ever complained.
 A man who cooks well will always have an advantage.
 Mauricio Parra
 I'm long distance at the moment and the day-to-day Skyping is free, but the transcontinental plane tickets to see her this summer are pricey. My pocketbook is glad, though, not to be going on expensive dates. Paul Worrell
 With the perspective of a 20-year marriage, I would offer that picking up the tab is an evolutionary response, and speaks to the need for the woman to feel protected. That doesn't change.
 What does change is a heightened consciousness that allows us to have honest discussions about it. And in a life where a date for us constitutes sneaking out of the house for a cup of coffee while our oldest watches our youngest, that discussion, after all these years, is ongoing.

HEADLINE: What Plays in Vegas: The Broadway Brand

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
 FOR 49 years the topless showgirls of ''Les Folies Bergere'' defined the flashy, freewheeling theater scene here for those seeking satisfaction away from the craps tables. On a holiday weekend a few months ago couples streamed off the casino floor at the Tropicana Hotel for the late show of sexy song and dance, and they cuddled and snuck kisses amid the high kicks on the stage. 
 ''Folies'' had surpassed 29,000 performances; it seemed as if it would run forever. Instead it closed forever on March 28 after the Tropicana's management decided to seek fresher and hotter-selling entertainment. More than a month before ''Folies'' shut its doors the female-impersonator revue ''An Evening at La Cage'' at the Riviera finished its 24-year run. 
 Theater is undergoing a metamorphosis in Las Vegas. Since the 1990s, when Las Vegas began energetically selling itself not just as a getaway for gamblers and bachelor parties but as a family-friendly destination with theme parks and entertainments for all ages, Sin City has been a port of call for well-known Broadway musicals -- ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Jersey Boys,'' ''Avenue Q,'' ''Hairspray,'' ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''The Lion King'' -- that sometimes end up having a second life here, playing for years. In many cases these shows are slimmed-down, cost-efficient versions of the original Broadway productions, with performances scheduled twice a night to turn a maximum profit. 
 Initially such shows were meant to offer a different experience from the late-night Las Vegas stalwarts like ''Folies.'' But with tourism suffering here, as it is in many places in the United States, and hotel occupancy down almost 10 percent between December '07 and December '08, theater attendance has taken a hit. As a result Las Vegas is turning increasingly to familiar and reliable profit makers like Disney's ''Lion King,'' which will open May 15 in the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino's 1,735-seat auditorium, and Cirque du Soleil productions to be hedges against the recession.
 If ''Folies'' and ''La Cage'' never pretended to be Tony-caliber productions, they unquestionably provided some of the original sizzle on the Strip; ''Folies'' landed here about seven years before Howard Hughes and was as much a part of the city's modern incarnation as the flashing hotel marquees that Hughes, Steve Wynn and their brethren paid the wattage on. The loss of those two shows represents the end of a theater era in Vegas.
 The advent of the new, less-titillating Las Vegas theater raises questions about whether entertainment producers here are taking gambles of their own. After a long day at the tables will tourists cotton to ''The Lion King'' as they did to successful Las Vegas productions like ''Mamma Mia!,'' which ran for nearly six years and was seen by more than 2.4 million people before itself closing in January? Or will the returns prove lackluster, as they did for ''Hairspray'' and ''Avenue Q,'' which both folded after just a few months? 
 And just how many Cirque shows -- there are now six -- can this city sustain before they start stealing one another's audience or show a dilution in quality? Will the new strip-tease production ''Peepshow,'' an ostentatiously provocative, intentionally titillating musical revue now at Planet Hollywood, turn out to be as irresistible as producers hope? Or will people miss the old-fashioned ''Folies'' showgirls? 
 Some big-name concert performers have moved on too: Elton John recently ended his regular gig here after five years, and Celine Dion, who played for almost five years, has left to pursue other projects. Cher and Bette Midler, both familiar as headliners for Las Vegas audiences for many years, are now the major solo acts in town. But with the face value of their tickets higher than many other shows here, will their star power prove strong enough for their runs to last five years or more in a recessionary climate? 
 Veteran producers and entertainment marketers in Las Vegas are quick to offer assurances that, regardless of the unusual turnover in shows here in recent months, the theater scene is investing in improved and diverse entertainments that are robust enough to continue drawing capacity crowds across the Strip.
 ''In the current Vegas economy it's all about value right now,'' said Scott Voeller, the vice president for marketing at the Mandalay Bay, which is presenting ''The Lion King.'' ''People are cutting back, so we need to put offerings in front of our guests that are considered a good value.'' Referring to brand-name shows with strong track records of attracting audiences, like ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''The Lion King,'' Mr. Voeller added, ''I wouldn't want to be betting on something that wasn't a known entity right now.''
 But even known entities could be a gamble. Ben Feldman, an entertainment lawyer who represented some of the artists involved in ''Avenue Q'' -- which won the Tony for best musical in 2004 and is still running in New York but shuttered here after a brief run -- said he believed that the recession is leading Las Vegas visitors to buy tickets for a single show per trip, instead of the two or three shows they might see in a more prosperous economy. 
 ''In the good times, when you've got shows going to Vegas, with those huge hotels, you can make so much money,'' Mr. Feldman said, pointing out that guests tend to pick their entertainment from their hotel's offerings. ''But everything is like a stack of dominoes in Vegas. When the city hits a rough patch in the economy, like now, money can really dry up for projects like investing in theater productions.'' 
 Some producers in New York have decided to forgo Las Vegas altogether at this point, even though shows there can be less expensive to produce than road shows because the Las Vegas musicals are often shortened and have no transportation costs. ''Hairspray'' and ''Avenue Q,'' both presented at trimmed lengths, never found steady audiences, unusual in a city where shows and concerts often run for years. And while some Las Vegas Internet chat rooms have speculated about when, if ever, the still-running, still-a-hit Broadway show ''Wicked'' might come to Vegas, its backers opted to go with money-making extended engagements in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
 ''We threw our lot in with California, and we're very happy we did,'' said David Stone, a lead producer of ''Wicked.''
 In the current economic climate several theater producers here say that advance ticket sales have been declining, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, although more people are buying tickets on the day of the performance. 
 In interviews several visitors to Las Vegas said the expectation that they were narrowing their purchases to a single show during their stay was an accurate reflection of their plans.
 ''We'll probably see one show while we're here, if we can find a good one to see,'' Joe LeCluyse of Phoenix said as he and his wife, Buzzy, stood at a discount ticket booth -- Tix 4 Tonight -- to weigh their options. Among the available discount offerings that weekend were the musical ''Jersey Boys,'' the solo comedy ''Defending the Caveman,'' the magicians Penn & Teller, a few of the Cirque productions and a single $130 orchestra seat for the Elton John show.
 Despite a beating by critics, one of the new Cirque shows, ''Criss Angel Believe,'' draws a steady stream of patrons of the Luxor, the enormous pyramid-shaped hotel where the production plays in a 1,600-seat theater. Advertised as ''a haunting exploration deep inside the inventive mind'' of the illusionist Criss Angel, and costing $100 million to mount, ''Believe'' is one of six Cirque shows here; a seventh, an Elvis Presley show, is opening in winter. ''Our business overall is faring better than expected given the state of the economy,'' said Jerry Nadal, senior vice president of Cirque du Soleil's resident shows division. ''However we're having to work harder overall for the business we do get.'' 
 The six different Cirque shows are ''not cannibalizing each other,'' he said. ''Last year we had the best year we ever had, despite a tough fourth quarter. Now we've had to work harder for what we've got, but I think each of our shows has appeal that differs from the others.''
 If there are many unknowns about the short- and long-term future of tourism and theater in Vegas, one reassuring sign is that new productions are still opening. While New York theater producers are concerned about whether some Broadway houses will be open or dark next season, the producers of the Las Vegas productions of ''The Lion King,'' ''Peepshow'' and forthcoming fare say they are committed to long runs, pointing to the record-breaking success of ''Mamma Mia!'' as evidence that crowd-pleasing entertainment can still fill seats. (''Mamma Mia!'' closed in January at Mandalay Bay, which made room for ''The Lion King.'') 
 ''The scariest part for us is that people are making choices and have less money to spend, while the positive thing is that we believe what we're putting onstage here is so unique and special that people will still come to see it,'' said Scott Zeiger, co-chief executive officer of BASE Entertainment, the producer of ''Peepshow,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Jersey Boys.''
 ''But am I nervous? Am I worried?'' he said. ''That's the nature of every producer.''

HEADLINE: GOVERNOR CLINTONISM?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY. 
Adam Nagourney is chief national political correspondent for The New York Times. His most recent article for the magazine was a profile of Ken Mehlman, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

 BODY:
The Virginia Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, held at Richmond's sprawl of a convention center on a mild Saturday night in February, was particularly festive this year. The Democratic Party is enjoying a resurgence in Virginia, propelled first by the November victory of Barack Obama -- the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Lyndon Johnson -- and now by a lively battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. There are three men who want the nomination, but on this weekend, you could be forgiven for thinking that there was only one, and that his name was Terry McAuliffe. 
 There were McAuliffe signs everywhere, an exhausting blur of blue and yellow starting at the airport and rolling for nine miles to the entrance of the Greater Richmond Convention Center. There, bustling McAuliffe campaign workers, rolling around on electric carts, hoisted a McAuliffe for Governor banner over the street. A marching band stepped in place, before accompanying McAuliffe and his supporters as they paraded around the center, grandly announcing his arrival. Inside, volunteers scattered the hall with 2,500 McAuliffe fortune cookies, which crumbled open to reveal fortunes like high speed rail is in your future. The fortune-cookie count came courtesy of the McAuliffe campaign, which also reported that the campaign had purchased 39 dinner tables, printed 1,000 McAuliffe for Governor signs, issued 300 glow sticks to wave at the dinner and was paying for two after-dinner parties, with open bars. It was a display of political money and muscle that was quite unlike anything anyone had ever seen at the annual dinner. ''When I decide to do something,'' McAuliffe said as he marched along with his band, ''I do it.''
 And there was the candidate himself, an endless stream of energy and bonhomie. ''Mr. Chairman -- how are you, brother?!'' he said, fist-bumping C. Richard Cranwell, the 66-year-old leader of the Virginia Democratic Party. McAuliffe bantered with the young video-camera-wielding operative -- ''How you doing, Mike!'' -- that one of his rivals, Brian J. Moran, sent to follow him around. McAuliffe was as inescapable as his campaign paraphernalia, whizzing up escalators and down hotel walkways, popping up at receptions, hotel bars and meeting rooms. After leaving one late reception, McAuliffe passed a cab waiting for a fare in front of the Marriott Hotel, booming with reggae music, and stopped short. ''Yeah!'' he yelled, skipping into a dance on the sidewalk -- arms waving in the air, his aides grimacing at the sight of him doing what they have explicitly pleaded with him not to do in public. 
 McAuliffe was no less gregarious toward his rivals, who were also making the rounds -- Moran, a former state delegate, and State Senator R. Creigh Deeds -- even as he outtalked, out-handshook, outspent, outhustled, outshouted and just plain outcampaigned them across Richmond. McAuliffe, tipping back bottles of beer, stayed so late talking to party members at the Virginia Young Democrats reception -- he made sure I noted he was there an hour longer than Moran or Deeds -- that it seemed just a matter of time until the cleanup crew swept him out with a broom. McAuliffe is clearly not constrained by the demands of decorum you might expect to bear on a candidate for governor of the commonwealth. When his traveling chief of staff, Justin Paschal, dropped us off at what turned out to be the wrong place for a reception, driving off into the distance, McAuliffe charged down the sidewalk watching the taillights disappear, bellowing: ''Hey, stop him! That man stole my car!''
 Those people inside and outside Virginia who know Terry McAuliffe -- and many, many do, as he will tell you (''Oh, my goodness! Everybody! It's a huge positive'') -- know him mostly as a member of the court of the former First Democratic Family of the United States. He was Bill Clinton's chief fund-raiser, golfing partner and best friend; the national co-chairman of Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign; the man who stood by Clinton after he admitted his infidelity; and the man who guaranteed the Clintons' $1.3 million loan when they wanted to buy a house in Chappaqua. He was there when Hillary Clinton planned her race for the Senate. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the Clintons left the White House. And he was chairman and chief cheerleader for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, tirelessly making her case until after the last vote was counted. It was a display of loyalty that made McAuliffe seem a little like the last Japanese solider on a Pacific atoll.
 But those days of living on the national stage, of contemplating life as the next secretary of commerce and of holding court at his regular table at Cafe Milano, the Georgetown restaurant for Washington's self-styled celebrities, are behind him. At age 52, McAuliffe is running for governor of Virginia, which means his existence is now defined by promoting the unrealized economic potential of transforming chicken waste into energy, or by pledging to outlaw big trucks from the left lane of Interstate 81. Those Cafe Milano nights have given way to early dinners with Virginia bloggers. The reward is to run a state that has been slammed by the recession: the unemployment rate has risen above 14 percent in parts of southern Virginia. With revenues falling, the next governor may face a budget deficit of as much as $3 billion. ''Most businesspeople will tell you it's the roughest economic time they have experienced in the state in decades,'' Bob Holsworth, a Virginia political analyst, told me.
 After three decades' working to get other people elected -- a roster of Democratic names that includes Carter, Gephardt, Clinton, Clinton and Obama -- McAuliffe has moved to the front of the shop. These days, Terry McAuliffe, one of the best political salesmen in America, is selling Terry McAuliffe. 
 The primary on June 9 was always going to draw attention; Virginia has become the latest front in the battle between red and blue. Democrats have enjoyed a winning streak here -- Mark Warner and Timothy M. Kaine for governor in 2001 and 2005, Jim Webb for the United States Senate in 2006. But while the political demographics of Virginia are changing, this is far from a Democratic state. And the 54-year-old Republican candidate, Bob McDonnell, is coming off three successful years as attorney general and has skillfully sought to contrast himself as a ''common-sense conservative'' against big-spending Democrats in sway to unions. ''We're mindful of a little trend in Virginia,'' Kaine, the outgoing governor who is also chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told me. ''For 32 years now, the party that wins the White House loses the governorship in Virginia the next year. So I tell people: Just because we've been winning doesn't mean we're going to continue to win for one more year.''
 The governor's race, however, is particularly captivating because it has as its central character Terence R. McAuliffe, and he has -- not surprisingly to anyone who has followed his exploits -- launched a presidential-size battleship of a campaign across this state. In many ways, the first friend of the Clinton family is trying to continue a political legacy that appeared to have ended with Hillary Clinton's concession speech. And having seen more defeats than victories in his years in politics, he is leaving nothing to chance. He has overloaded the system here with money. And he has brought to Virginia the sophistication of campaign skills learned from winning with the Clintons in the 1990s -- and from losing to Obama last year. 
 Still, he faces plenty of obstacles. Memories of his long advocacy of Hillary Clinton do not sit well with some Obama supporters in the state, and Obama walloped Clinton in the Virginia primary by nearly 30 points. And no matter how studious and passionate McAuliffe can be about Virginia's problems, it's not clear how well his Barnum & Bailey personality will play with voters. His success as a fund-raiser and his connections as the ultimate party insider are the reasons he is a candidate at all, but those may not be the kinds of qualifications that appeal to economically anxious voters caught up in an anti-establishment mood. He is spending so much money that it has become an issue in the campaign. A video introducing Moran at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner drew gasps and applause when the words ''Money isn't everything'' flashed on the screen. (The Moran video was produced by Joe Trippi, who ran John Edwards's presidential campaign last year and takes obvious delight in shaking McAuliffe's tree. As the crowd hooted, Trippi sent out a note on Twitter: '' 'Money Isn't Everything' just flashed across the jumbo screen at the VA JJ. McAuliffe didn't seem happy. Who me?'')
 Even though McAuliffe has lived in the state for 17 years (a number that he tends to round up to 20), his identification with national Democrats means he has to fight the perception that he is an interloper. ''There is no reason to perceive him as a Virginia Democrat,'' Moran told me. ''Before the last six months, he's had little -- if any -- involvement not only in Virginia politics but in Virginia governance.'' 
 Bill Clinton told me: ''The only difficulty Terry may have here is whatever preconceptions voters might have about him at the beginning. I think he'll overcome them.'' The former president says that when McAuliffe came to his office last year, it was to seek counsel not on whether to run but on how. ''My advice was to let the voters see who he really is, what he knows and what he can do, and present the qualities that enabled him to be so successful helping me and so many others.''
 If McAuliffe wins, it will be in part because he has turned out to be an impressive candidate: endlessly energetic, at ease with voters, churning out a stream of proposals on the economy and on transportation. Still, McAuliffe the candidate could not be more at variance from the cool, cerebral and emotionally detached brand of politics embodied by the new president. Obama ran against exactly the kind of big-money 1990s politics that McAuliffe has come to represent. A McAuliffe victory would signal that despite all the talk of a new kind of politics for the party in the age of Obama, the old kind of Democratic politics is still doing quite well. 
 The four Virginians running for governor appeared together at a town-hall-style forum on a cold and rainy morning in April. The setting was the Microsoft Technology Center in Reston, and each candidate, in deference to the precise rules of their engagement, submitted to exactly 21 minutes of questions from an audience of northern-Virginia business leaders. It was not a debate, but it offered an opportunity to compare the field. McDonnell, Deeds and Moran diligently answered question after question. (''What are the top three things you would do to deal with our state's traffic congestion?'') It was a sedate morning.
 Until Terry McAuliffe hopped onto the stage. What about federal stimulus money for the commonwealth? ''As governor, I don't want my fair share,'' McAuliffe said. Pause. ''I want more than my fair share. I am going to call Barack Obama every day. Every day. I'm going to drive him kuh-RAY-zee.'' He was laughing, though not necessarily joking. High-speed rail? ''When I spoke to you four months ago, I said, 'The future is high-speed rail,' '' he said. ''Barack Obama said it last month. I was first! Now don't you tell him I said that.'' McAuliffe had a microphone, but he didn't need one. He rumbled on, hawking his economic plan. ''Have you read my plan?'' he asked, tilting his head toward the crowd in a faintly challenging way, towering over the room, his thick, 6-foot-2-inch frame topped by a pompadour of rolling waves of brown curly hair. If the other candidates were eat-your-spinach gubernatorial, McAuliffe was pure dessert. 
 Eventually people began drifting toward the door; it was time to get to work. But McAuliffe was not done. He glanced as the timekeeper flashed the ''time'' sign at him. ''Put those signs away,'' he said. ''Am I the last one? I'm glad to take questions all day. Put that thing down!''
 When McAuliffe let it be known at the Democratic convention in Denver last August that he might run for governor, more than a few people were surprised. Yes, he grew up in a political family in Syracuse; his father, Jack, the treasurer of the Onondaga County Democratic Party, took him to political dinners, pressed him into service licking envelopes and introduced him to his first president when he was 7 and L.B.J. was campaigning at Syracuse University. And McAuliffe says elected office is something he has always thought about; indeed, there has been speculation over the years about his running for governor of three different states: Virginia, New York and Florida. But it is hardly typical for someone who has worked behind the throne to decide to run for office. It would be like David Axelrod announcing a run for mayor of Chicago.
 After all these years of riding the hurricane -- and after a year in which he stumped nonstop on behalf of Hillary Clinton, appearing on television more often than most United States senators -- McAuliffe found himself last June contemplating the forced end of his adrenaline rush of a life. ''For 12 years, I have been stepping up to that plate every day swinging,'' he told me. ''Can you name anybody else doing it for 12 straight years? Nobody.'' So what was he supposed to do now? Go back to running a bank? Play golf? McAuliffe, as he himself has said, had enough money at age 30 from his lucrative business ventures to never have to worry about working again. At dinner one night, I reminded him that under Bill Clinton, he was in line to be ambassador to England. ''Dorothy would have loved it,'' he said, speaking of his wife. ''I think in England, after one month there, I'd be like. '' He looked up in the air and started banging his fists on the table like a bored infant. 
 So it was that last June, days before Hillary Clinton folded her campaign, he stood in a ballroom and watched as she spoke at a rally in San Juan. ''I'm ready to be up there,'' he said to my Times colleague Mark Leibovich.
 Still, many of his friends wondered how he would ever squeeze that big personality into the rigid mold of a modern-day candidate. Would someone whose life had been about the architecture of getting others elected -- raising money, calculating attacks on opponents, subjugating your own ego to make the brief for someone else -- be comfortable selling himself? Would he adjust to being ''on'' all day, talking to voters and contributors and party leaders and reporters, in a world of journalist-videographers on the hunt for a mistake? And perhaps most important, was he up to dealing with extraordinarily complicated issues and pervasive voter anxiety? 
 That last question seems particularly apt. In a world divided into ''political hacks and policy wonks,'' as Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser in the White House, put it in an essay in The Washington Monthly in 2004, McAuliffe would seem to fall into Category No. 1. McAuliffe jokes about it. When he was introduced as a policy wonk one night, he responded: ''I've been called a lot of things. That's not one of them.'' But when I pressed the question with him later, he said, ''People pigeonhole me -- I'm known for raising more money than any man alive. But you know what? I've always known about these issues. You can't be successful in life and not know this stuff. I had to go on 'Meet the Press' many times. You don't go in front of six or seven million people and wing it.'' 
 He said that he and Bill Clinton talked about problems facing the country over a light beer (McAuliffe) and Diet Coke (Clinton) in the White House living quarters. ''The president -- I don't know if he told you this -- but he and I talk policy all the time,'' he said. ''He and I would bounce ideas around, and I would clearly tell him when I thought he was wrong.'' McAuliffe was unable to recall an example of when he challenged the president. Still, I didn't see him stumped by any question he was asked during dozens of encounters with voters, his opponents and reporters. If anything, he had a tendency to overcompensate, to be the eager call-on-me-teacher overachiever intent on proving that he isn't just another political hack. ''No one else talks about the Dillon Rule,'' he boasted to a small group of voters one day, referring to the politically thorny -- and fairly obscure -- state edict that limits the authority of local governments.
 His campaign is tailored for these times. ''Jobs is the issue -- the issue, the issue, the issue,'' Cranwell, the Virginia Democratic chairman, told me. And wherever McAuliffe goes, he is surrounded by campaign placards reading, ''New Energy for New Jobs.'' He talks everywhere, albeit often vaguely, about using economic incentives to attract out-of-state industry and to promote clean-energy technology. When Terry McAuliffe pitches Terry McAuliffe, it is not as the former head of the Democratic National Committee but as the businessman who started his first enterprise, tarring driveways for Syracuse neighbors, when he was 14. ''If the biggest problem facing Virginia today were crime, Terry would not be a plausible candidate,'' says Paul Begala, who first worked with McAuliffe on Richard Gephardt's presidential campaign in 1988. 
 There are a few policy differences among the Democrats, in particular Moran and McAuliffe. Moran opposes offshore oil and natural-gas drilling and the construction of a coal-burning plant in Surry, and he has pledged to fight to repeal a 2006 state constitutional amendment banning gay marriages and civil unions. McAuliffe has said he is open to coal-burning plants and offshore drilling for natural gas, though only under stringent circumstances. While McAuliffe says he also opposed the gay-marriage amendment, he has argued that it is politically unrealistic to think the state's two Legislatures would ever vote to repeal it. Moran might seem to have an advantage on policy: his positions tend to appeal to the state's left-leaning Democratic primary voters, who have always been the ones most likely to turn out. McAuliffe, though, taking a page from Obama, says he believes he can significantly expand the number of voters participating in the primary -- the very strategy that helped defeat McAuliffe's own candidate in Virginia last year.
 terry mcauliffe has always been something of a showman, more Prof. Harold Hill than Tim Kaine. So is he a huckster? A carnival barker? A rascal? In truth, for many of those following the campaign, McAuliffe is a guilty pleasure: outrageous, eminently likable and, as Bill Clinton says, ''totally transparent.'' At a time when politicians have become so sanitized and cautious -- case in point: Al Franken in Minnesota -- and when so much personality has been leached out of the business by hypervigilant commentators, McAuliffe is a challenge to the politician-as-usual, the funhouse-mirror opposite of his rivals. He had no hesitation about pulling on a foot-to-head mustard-colored firefighter suit while spending a day working at a firehouse in Fairfax; he grinned in acknowledgment of how ridiculous he looked.
 Perhaps it is not so difficult making the transition from fund-raiser to candidate after all. Each requires the ability to swallow a certain amount of pride, to be relentlessly optimistic, even if it means embellishing the truth just a bit. ''He is unquestionably the best fund-raiser I have ever run into, anytime, anywhere,'' says Don Fowler, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee when McAuliffe was head of its fund-raising operation. ''He could explain a hurricane in positive terms.'' 
 As he campaigns, McAuliffe's economic plan is ''probably the most aggressive economic plan that has ever been put out in the country,'' if McAuliffe does say so himself. By the time he is done as governor, he will ''create more jobs than all the other 49 governors,'' Virginia will supplant California as the film-production capital of the world and Old Dominion University in Norfolk will become the nation's leading research university.
 He luxuriates in his reputation. In his sprawl of a home in McLean, there is a picture of the 1997 presidential inaugural behind his desk. The photograph is signed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and each used his pen to poke fun at McAuliffe's tendency to deploy superlatives when the subject is Terry McAuliffe. ''Thanks for being the best finance chair in the history of this or any other universe,'' Gore wrote.
 His campaign speeches are blasts of unbridled optimism. ''I don't like being second in anything,'' he says. ''They put up a wall, I'm not going to climb over it, I'm going to blast though it.'' It is a personality that has allowed McAuliffe to ride through three tumultuous decades in politics, drawing eye rolls but making few real enemies. (Of course, raising a lot of money for a lot of people has the effect of silencing potential critics.) He may be the only person who emerged unscathed from the initial post-mortems of the Hillary Clinton campaign. 
 ''I don't think anybody has any animus toward him,'' Bill Clinton told me. ''He never operates behind anybody's back. He never tries to outmaneuver you.'' 
 When Howard Dean replaced McAuliffe as chairman, there was a fair amount of backbiting during the transition. Dean's campaign was all about running against Washington insiders -- and there was no bigger example of the species than Chairman McAuliffe. But the rift has apparently been healed. ''People used to say how much enmity there was between us and all that stuff,'' Dean says. ''I think that was true three or four or five years ago. But we did a lot of things at the D.N.C. that we couldn't have done without McAuliffe.''
 McAuliffe moves in the rarefied atmosphere of big money and celebrity: Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Steven Spielberg are all part of his circle. But he also seemed at ease one day in Sandston when he met a Virginia voter, Ron Davis, who had just lost his job when the semiconductor plant where he worked was shut down. 
 ''There are a lot of people who were put out of work,'' Davis told the candidate. ''We need an advocate.'' 
 McAuliffe leaned toward Davis and, for a moment, sounded a bit like the man he used to play golf with Monday afternoons in Washington. ''I agree with you,'' McAuliffe said, almost in a whisper. ''This is what I talk about every day.'' 
 At the end of April, Bill Clinton flew to Richmond to campaign with McAuliffe for the first time. It was a scorching day, and there was no shelter from the sun as both men walked off the stage at the end of the rally to do what Clinton has always loved to do: shake hands with the crowd. After 10 minutes, the sun was too much, and Clinton stopped and ducked into the shade. McAuliffe kept going for another 20 minutes, circling around and around, looking for more hands to shake.
 Terry McAuliffe has been involved in national politics since 1980, when, at 23, he broke fund-raising records as Jimmy Carter's national finance director. The experience shows. His six-chapter economic plan is the calculated work of a candidate who understands that voters worry whether he is serious enough about state issues to perform well as governor. ''That was my idea,'' he said. ''I knew they would say, 'Terry hasn't been around Virginia.' I knew that in order for me to be successful, I had to do a campaign based on ideas.'' McAuliffe has methodically sought to build relationships with the state's considerable network of bloggers. As one of its first strategic decisions, the McAuliffe campaign imposed on the candidate a six-week embargo on out-of-state fund-raising trips.
 McAuliffe never goes a day without telling audiences that he will not attack his Democratic opponents, though as primary day approached, and the campaign heated up, he came increasingly close to breaking that pledge. And he took obvious delight in noting the history of friction between Deeds and Moran. ''Creigh hates Brian,'' he told me. ''Brian did to him last year what he's doing to me this year. They used to be good friends, I guess.'' 
 The benefits of having been a general in the Clinton army are evident every day. McAuliffe blew away his opponents in raising money over the first quarter of this year ($4.2 million, 82 percent of which came from out of state), saving him from the politically unpalatable step of writing a big check for his own campaign. When McAuliffe first began weighing a run for governor, he headed out on a ''listening tour'' to talk to voters, the same thing Hillary Clinton did when she first ran for the Senate in New York. Yet in all the time I traveled with McAuliffe, he rarely brought up Bill and Hillary Clinton. As important as the former president and the secretary of state might be to his success, McAuliffe has clearly decided not to emphasize that part of his history in Virginia. (Hillary Clinton, through a spokesman, declined a request for an interview, asserting she was constrained as secretary of state from making any comment that could be construed as political activity.)
 McAuliffe's unwavering advocacy of Hillary Clinton's campaign is one reason the Clintons like him so much. ''He is ferociously loyal,'' Bill Clinton says. But there are whispers of lingering resentment among some Obama supporters that he didn't stop fighting when the battle was obviously over; Moran told me that he has heard such complaints from ''numerous people'' and has no doubt it will hurt McAuliffe in the primary. ''There was a time when Democrats needed to come together behind our candidate, and he was very slow in doing that,'' Moran says.
 McAuliffe noted that after Clinton withdrew, he almost immediately moved over to helping Obama, campaigning for him in Virginia. ''Remember, I'm the chairman of the party who picked him as the keynote in '04,'' he told me. ''In '02, every time I went to Chicago I had breakfast with the guy, just he and I.'' Still, the Obama campaign was reluctant to put McAuliffe out as a surrogate in Virginia and did not do so until after conducting a poll to measure just how voters there viewed Hillary Clinton's chief promoter.
 Whatever Virginia thought about Hillary, Bill Clinton's popularity among Democrats is beyond question, and it was no surprise when at the end of April he turned up in Richmond to campaign and a McAuliffe film crew recorded the event for a potential future ad. The other candidates weren't happy. ''I like Bill Clinton, I voted for him, supported him, put up signs for him, distributed literature for him,'' Moran told me a few weeks earlier. ''I can beat Terry McAuliffe. I don't know if I can beat Bill Clinton.'' 
 McDonnell, the Republican candidate, is not talking publicly about how he might run against McAuliffe should that turn out to be the outcome. But he has dropped hints, with pointed remarks about McAuliffe's fund-raising history, his connections to Bill Clinton -- whose involvement could play differently in a general election than in a primary -- and his suspect Virginia pedigree. Creigh Deeds, who lost the attorney-general race by 360 votes to McDonnell in 2005, told me that McDonnell is ''going to be a very tough'' opponent in the general election. And Republicans and Democrats suggest that there is enough fodder in McAuliffe's history in business and in politics to allow Republicans to turn the subject away from the economy, notably a $100,000 investment he made in a now-failed company called Global Crossing, which produced an $18 million profit. 
 ''This guy has too many businesses, and this stuff is going to start coming out in dribs and drabs,'' says Steve Jarding, a senior adviser to Moran, who has recently started attacking McAuliffe on the Global Crossing investment. ''Tell me I'm wrong for being nervous.'' 
 McAuliffe shrugged when I asked him about Jarding's charge. He was sitting at dinner in Richmond, picking over a plate of penne with mushrooms and sipping a glass of red wine. ''What new are you possibly going to say about me?'' he said. ''There is nothing new. It's all been out there.''
 McAuliffe may be a guilty pleasure, but the big question now is whether voters will indulge. Despite the money McAuliffe has spent, most public polls suggest that the three-man race remains tight (though it is early and there are many undecided voters). ''There are a lot of people who like him but think, Can he really be a governor?'' Trippi says. 
 Still, for all his mischief and irreverence, McAuliffe has yet to make the disqualifying stumble that the other camps have been banking on. As much as McAuliffe enjoys flying near the sun, the fund-raiser-candidate seems quite aware that he is marketing himself to an audience very different from the contributors who used to be his constituency. He may have more self-discipline than his opponents think -- and perhaps more than he wants them to think. In April, McAuliffe was leaving a candidates' debate at the College of William and Mary when he heard in the distance the noise of a most unlikely competition: a gathering of students trying to break the Guinness world record for the most people taking part in a ''Thriller'' dance competition. As Michael Jackson's soft voice sailed through the trees (and a New York Times videographer recorded the moment), McAuliffe looked tempted, just for a moment, to step in line. But just for a moment. Then he turned and headed across the campus. The official post-debate reception at the Muscarelle Museum of Art awaited.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Have Come To the Greens

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER.

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 EVEN country clubs are having it hard these days.
 In September, the Ridgeway Country Club, which has been around since 1952 and decades longer in an earlier incarnation, lost about 65 families, a quarter of its membership. After all, when stock and bond accounts lose half their value, it becomes a challenge for even the run-of-the mill wealthy to justify plunking down a $25,000 initiation fee and $15,000 in annual dues to belong to a golf, beach or yacht club. Some of the members who left Ridgeway joined other clubs, but many gave up clubs entirely while the economy is mired in quicksand. 
 Now Ridgeway, facing a deficit of more than $1 million in a $4 million annual budget, has been put on the market for an asking price of $20 million. 
 Curiously, the club's sales pitch is aimed at buyers who would be interested in what club officials suggest is a half-hearted offer. 
 ''We're saying we don't want to sell the club,'' is the way Henry Shyer, the burly, blunt-spoken septuagenarian who is the club's president, said in explaining the apparent contradictions. ''But if you're running a business, you've got to be prudent.''
 The club admits it is trying to prevent a sale, and likely conversion of its 128 acres into a spread of single-family houses, by getting a transfusion of new-member blood before a buyer materializes. Even if a sale goes through, a buyer would have to let the club keep operating for five years, under terms the club has set out. Given the state of the housing market, the sudden appearance of a white-knight developer would seem improbable for now, and it may be awkward to attract new members for a club that will eventually be sold or possibly risks bankruptcy. Nevertheless, Mr. Shyer said, the club has gotten nine applications since word of its unhappy state got out.
 Ridgeway is not the only club that may have to face such predicaments. Jay Mottola, executive director of the Metropolitan Golf Association, which represents 255 private country clubs in the New York City region, said most clubs were experiencing twice their annual rate of attrition, which is around 7 percent, though none have closed down since the economy turned south. That mirrors a nationwide trend -- more than 600 private clubs said they faced serious financial challenges, according to a recent National Golf Foundation survey.
 One way Ridgeway, with 128 share-owning families and 55 weekday members, is trying to lure new members is by eliminating the $25,000 initiation fee for now. So $15,000 -- in monthly installments, no less -- will get you a year's use of a par-71 golf course, 10 tennis courts, a swimming pool and epicurean dining. 
 But Mr. Shyer, who is a partner in a family firm that imports eyeglasses, says the struggling economy is just part of the reason for the loss of members. Young people, particularly two-income couples, are no longer drawn to clubs the way they once were, he lamented, but prefer to spend weekends with the kids rather than on the fairway. 
 The fact is that golf itself is a flagging sport. The Metropolitan Golf Association said that in 1999, club members and guests played an average of 22,000 rounds. In 2007, that figure was down to 17,000. 
 ''My son, after a week of work, will spend time with the kids,'' Mr. Shyer said. ''There's lots of togetherness going on, and they're not going to leave to spend five hours on the golf course. It's a different world. I never cooked, but my son and his friends, they're in that kitchen doing things.''
 One way Ridgeway has tried to fight back is to shed its reputation as being less than welcoming to children. The club has recently let members bring children into the sanctum sanctorum of the Grill Room, and it is converting a staid stuffed-chair lounge into a game room.
 ''We are now children-friendly,'' said Mr. Shyer, adopting a marketing cliche with a note of exasperation.
 The club, whose membership includes dentists, lawyers, importers and at least one newspaper editor, is an opulent place. The women's lockers are made of oak, the men's of cherry, and the changing benches are covered with velvet. The women's locker room has a beauty salon, the men's a steam room. The showers are lined with black and green marble. The dining room can hold a wedding of 300 guests. 
 There is a fitness room, where Russell Schwartzreich, 63, of Armonk, a member for 26 years who made his living in frozen foods, was glistening with sweat after exercising on the weight machines.
 ''I love the place,'' he said with a breakout smile. ''The people -- they're down to earth. I come here to shower. My wife said I haven't showered at home in a year.''
 He said that one member, Phil Blum, is 98 and still comes and that another played golf until the year before he died at 100.
 Mr. Shyer, who joined the club in 1972, plays golf practically every day he doesn't work (he has a 19 handicap). He looked at a pond between the fairway and the putting green on the sixth hole and said wistfully, ''Do you know how many balls I have hit in that water?''
 He added, ''I'm not going to give this place up without a good fight.'' 
 But the hard fact is that half of Ridgeway's members are older than 60 and only 5 percent are younger than 40. Mr. Shyer is aware that some young people find country-club ambience a tad fusty. Yet, hope springs like a golf ball hitting the lip of a hole before popping out. Club leaders like Mr. Shyer are so sanguine that they purchased 45 golf carts this year.
 ''Please get across the message that we're not dying,'' he said. ''We're short families. If we get 50 or 60 members, we're flying.''

HEADLINE: Frugal Portland

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS. 
MATT GROSS writes the Frugal Traveler blog, which is updated every Wednesday at nytimes.com/travel.

 BODY:
''EVERYONE here looks great!'' is not the kind of comment you hear often in Portland, Ore., where outfits seem chosen to match the cloudy skies, fabrics tend toward the waterproof, and anything with buttons counts as formalwear.
 Yet those were exactly the words that burst from a woman who brushed past me one night at Lizard Lounge, a clothing store in the upscale Pearl District of Portland. And she was right. The crowd that first Thursday in April -- the first Thursday of each month has an evening of art-gallery openings and shopping parties -- was startlingly attractive, and in a very Portland way: functional but chic. One woman wore a black bob and a silvery, thigh-length, probably impermeable trench coat. Fleece abounded, but was form-fitting. Quiksilver's hard-to-find Limited Collection hung on the racks next to clothes by Nau, a local label whose jackets, polos and shorts lie on the sporty end of the fashion spectrum -- or is that the fashionable end of the sporty spectrum?
 One accessory, however, was ubiquitous: as breakdance crews windmilled and as the Portland legend Fogatron did his human beatbox routine, every hipster -- male, female or otherwise -- carried a plastic cup full of beer. Free beer. 
 And not just free beer but pretty good free beer. Next to the cash registers, barmen pumped kegs of hefeweizen and amber ale, both made by Widmer Brothers, one of the two oldest breweries in what has become the microbrew capital of America. (There are better beers in Portland, but compared with your usual party beer, Widmer's is premier cru.) People drank, refilled their cups and, eventually, with enough beer in their systems, bought expensive Nau gear -- at a First Thursday 20 percent discount.
 What this Frugal Traveler loved more than the free suds, however, was the utter normality. No one seemed surprised that drinks would be given away, let alone that they'd actually be worth drinking. And in that casual acceptance, I discerned a characteristic of Portland that would enchant me over the course of a week, as I explored restaurants and bars, artisanal cafes and mushrooming food carts, funky neighborhoods and weird little museums. Amid economic catastrophe -- Oregon has the country's second-highest unemployment rate -- there was a general indifference to wealth. In its place was a dedication to the things that really matter: hearty food and drink, cultural pursuits both high and low, days in the outdoors and evenings out with friends. It's the good life, and in Portland it still comes cheap.
 Take the two-year-old Ace Hotel, where I stayed for much of my sojourn. This boutique reincarnation of what was once the mildly dingy Clyde Hotel is in the heart of downtown, steps from major public transit stops. It was comfortable beyond what I'm accustomed to, with richly rugged wool blankets from Portland's Pendleton Woolen Mills on the bed and crushed-pearl-and-charcoal soap-on-a-rope by the sink. And, at $75 a night, it was eminently affordable, although I had to forgo an en suite bathroom and embrace the unexpected thrill of walking down the hall -- in nothing but my Adidas and my Ace hooded bathrobe -- to the sparkling shared (but private) showers.
 But it was the freebies that seduced me. Stacks of of-the-moment magazines -- Frank, Color, Tokion, ReadyMade -- lay about to read on lobby couches or take to your room. Elegant Jorg & Olif bicycles were available free to hotel guests. At the adjacent Stumptown Coffee, powerful French press brews were free Monday mornings till Tax Day. Rarely do I really like to hang around hotels, but like a cosmopolitan version of an all-inclusive Caribbean resort (the kind you swear to resent but wind up in a codependent relationship with), the Ace kept me in its warm, value-added embrace longer than I thought possible.
 Eventually, though, I would break away and go off -- by bike, by foot or by bus (a weeklong TriMet pass is $22.50) -- in search of sustenance, whether in sometimes stately, sometimes shabby downtown or over the Willamette River into the lazily gentrifying neighborhoods of the east side. 
 This was no easy task, because Portland is overflowing with great, affordable restaurants. In dozens of meals, I don't think I was ever truly disappointed with a single bite, nor did I ever leave hungry, nor did my friends and I ever spend more than $25 a person. In fact, if I had any regrets, it was that I felt duty-bound not to repeat a restaurant visit no matter how much I liked a place and wanted to return.
 This joyful stress would begin with the city's most important meal: breakfast. Despite its laid-back aura, Portland is an early-rising town, and its commuting cyclists need fuel for their morning rides. They could do worse than stop at Bunk Sandwiches, which in the six months since it opened has started a meat-and-other-things-on-bread renaissance by combining high-quality ingredients in innovative ways.
 The house creations appear each day on a chalkboard near the doorway -- an Oregon albacore tuna melt, a P.B.L.T. of pork belly, lettuce and green tomato pickles -- but at 7 a.m. there's really only one choice, the classic breakfast sandwich (sausage patty, sharp Tillamook Cheddar and a fried egg on a poppy-seed hard roll, $5). As is, it's stellar. But add anchovies ($2), and it's something else entirely, the fishy saltiness amping up the sausage's sweetness and the tartness of the cheese. Seven bucks may seem a lot, but for the best breakfast sandwich ever, it's a bargain.
 Another morning, I met my friend Alison Williams Colman and her husband, Laurence Colman, at Broder, a Scandinavian brunch spot on a quintessentially Portland section of Southeast Clinton Street. (Bike lane? Check. Brewery? Check. Discount art-house cinema? Vintage stores? Punk rock record shops? Check, check, check!) Broder was packed, but the free coffee in the next-door waiting room kept us going until we could squeeze into a table and order some smoked-trout hash. When the $41 check came, Alison surprised me by whipping out a $25 coupon she'd bought for $2 on Restaurant.com. The waiter accepted it without a peep (he got a big tip), and I marveled again at how well Portlanders live on so little.
 Portland's food carts may be the best example of that. Carts have existed for roughly a decade, offering low-cost lunchtime grub, but in the last couple of years they've exploded in numbers and ambition, with cuisines ranging from Mexican and Thai to Korean and Kazakh to Dutch waffles and Belgian fries. (A Russian cart even found brief fame as a destination on last season's ''Amazing Race'' finale, but it has since closed.) 
 Today, there are almost 400 carts around Portland, most of them clustered into ''pods'' that ring parking lots, and thanks to low start-up costs and Multnomah County's straightforward licensing and inspection regime, aspiring chefs can make their names without major investments. As a New Yorker I was jealous; as the Frugal Traveler, overjoyed at what I could find within a single pod. The slices ($2 to $3) at Give Pizza a Chance were excellent, with a thin inner crust, a thicker, chewy outer crust and fresh, brightly flavored toppings (like the tomatoes, basil, artichokes and onions on the ''Compost'' slice). Next door, at Tabor, I followed the painted instructions to ''Czech Out Czech Food'' and fell in love with the schnitzelwich ($6.50), a fried pork or chicken cutlet bound to soft bread with ajvar (a red-pepper spread) and stinging horseradish sauce. Brunch Box, around the corner, was making its own English muffins, plus crazy burgers like the OMG! ($6), a cheeseburger with egg, ham, SPAM and bacon; and the YouCanHasCheeseburger ($5), a patty stuck between two Texas-toast grilled cheese sandwiches. (Bring Lipitor.)
 One of the best things about food carts, in Portland and elsewhere, is getting to talk to the person who's cooking your meal. Ziba Ljucevic, who runs Ziba's Pitas, is one of the sweetest operators in all of Portland's pods. A Bosnian immigrant, she arrived in 2002 just after the Balkan wars, speaking almost no English but fluent in the culinary language of her homeland. Unlike Greek pitas, Ms. Ljucevic's are round, bready pies of surpassing lightness, stuffed with ground meat, spinach, zucchini or (my favorite) eggs, cheese and sour cream. For $5.95, she'll give you a quarter of each, plus cucumber salad and a puddle of ajvar, and if you chat with her, as I did, about regional pita variations among the former Yugoslav republics, she may throw in a free drink.
 The food carts even have Portland's second-favorite beverage covered. Spella Caffe, next door to Ziba's, pulls what I deemed the best espresso in Portland, rich and mellow. At $1.75, it's also the least expensive of the city's high-end coffee drinks. At Stumptown's several locations, the sharp, bitter and acidic shot costs $2. It's meant to go with milk, they say; alas, I can't drink milk.
 Meanwhile, at the three-month-old Barista, the champion barista Billy Wilson is trying something new. Instead of sticking with one roaster's beans, he puts Stumptown's, Intelligentsia's and Ecco Caffe's (among others) all on the menu (at $2.50 a shot), along with descriptions of their vastly different flavor profiles. Ecco's, for example, was ''dark berry,'' and it did indeed remind me that coffee starts its life as a berry on a bush.
 After breakfast, lunch and coffee, I put my insatiable hunger aside to explore both the well-known and obscure corners of the city. I invested $4 in a ride on the aerial tram, a gondola that ascends from the banks of the Willamette to the hilltop Oregon Health and Science University, where I gazed out over the city's many bridges, its low-slung east-side neighborhoods and the peaks of Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens on the horizon. I browsed labyrinthine Powell's Books -- Portland's unofficial library -- for an hour with no intention of buying. I popped into the free Museum of Contemporary Craft to see Darrel Morris's moving, large-scale embroidered ''drawings'' of funerals, a man in a suit and random people pointing.
 I also went to the Vacuum Cleaner Museum. Housed in a corner of Stark's Vacuums, it's a free display of antique floor-cleaning devices, from pneumatic canisters to decades-old stand-up models that could almost go on sale today. And I learned that while William Hoover is generally considered the vacuum's inventor, the guys at Stark's see Daniel Hess's bellows-and-brushes device as the original. (Who knew?)
 When I heard that Beau Breedlove, the former intern who at the age of 17 began an affair with Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, was signing copies of Unzipped magazine, in which he appears 98 percent naked, I hurried to Fantasy, an adult store, dutifully bought the latest issue ($8.99; no sales tax in Oregon!) and stood in line for my autograph -- a piece of history.
 And -- out of necessity -- I exercised. Often, I'd wake early for a run, jogging up through the blossoming cherry trees on the Willamette River's west bank to the Broadway drawbridge, or down the Eastbank Esplanade into the Springwater Corridor, a series of trails where the noise of the highways and industrial parks fell away, leaving me alone with the water, the trees and the geese. Once, I even rode the MAX Light Rail to Beaverton, where Nike's headquarters has a 1.9-mile track encircling it. Non-employees are technically forbidden, but unofficially this pleasant jog past reed-rimmed duck ponds is open to everyone. Plus, you can refuel at Nike's inexpensive cafeteria. Just don't wear Adidas running shorts, as I did. Even in informal Portland, that's a faux pas.
 One Sunday afternoon, my high-school buddy Tee Cherry and I visited the Burnside Project, an improvised (and free) skateboard park that epitomizes the frugal Portland spirit. Eighteen years ago, this spot under the east side of the Burnside Bridge was nothing but used syringes and dirty mattresses -- until a few skaters decided to take over. In the ensuing years, the park became famous for its challenging terrain and incessant evolution. Every year, its founders rebuilt it, and along the way learned the intricate (and valuable) art of pouring cement. Today it's a mecca for hard-core skaters, which Tee and I no longer are. Instead, we took our boards down the street to a nice ledge where falls meant dust and bruises rather than concussions and broken bones. Still, I felt, I'd paid my respects.
 All that exertion justified the other indulgences, which would resume around 4 p.m. with happy hour. Portland requires that its restaurants serve a certain amount of food with their booze, so even the fanciest places offer high-end treats at a big discount. My friends and I ate briny-sweet Willapa Bay oysters ($1 apiece) and short-rib macaroni and cheese ($5) at Ten01, one of the city's top restaurants, and at the pan-Asian Ping, in Portland's dilapidated Chinatown, we had Thai-style dried cuttlefish (paradoxically juicy) and Macanese pork-chop sandwiches.
 Happy hour didn't always mean food. On Mondays, it meant $2.50 pints of the wonderful smoked-malt Lompoc Strong Draft, at the New Old Lompoc tavern, and on Tuesdays, it meant $3.50 IPAs at Hopworks Urban Brewery, an energy-efficient brewpub that's a stop for cyclists on their way home from work.
 Happy hour's only drawback was that it obviated a proper sit-down dinner. Only by strenuous effort did I make it to Por Que No?, a colorful taqueria, and to Pok Pok, a Thai restaurant whose rendition of grilled boar collar was nearly as good as what I've eaten in Bangkok. Neither meal came to more than $25 a person, tip included.
 The rest of the time, I'd give up and go out. I played 50-cent rounds of Addams Family pinball and drank $2.50 Sessions beer at Ground Kontrol, an '80s-style video arcade, then walked around the corner to Backspace, a techno-geeky cafe-bar where I heard an almost-great local band called What's Up?, which melded a cresting wave of sound with the burbling bleeps of eight-bit video game soundtracks. At the Laurelthirst pub, the bluegrass band Jackstraw jammed, and I wound up chatting with a white-haired man in a tie-dyed shirt. He was Richard Milsom, known as Millstone, and five minutes into our conversation, apropos of nothing, he offered me the use of his woodland cabin by Mount Hood National Forest.
 Finally, and because, as my friend Becky said, a visit to a Portland strip club is inevitable, I wound up one night at the Acropolis Steakhouse Plus, a Vegas-y joint with a $3 cover charge that had been recommended by -- of all people -- my little sister. She liked it, however, not for the performers (who earned it its nickname, the A Crop) but for the ludicrously cheap steaks. My eight-ounce sirloin cost $5.50 and came deliciously medium-rare. This being Portland, the meat was locally sourced, too, from cattle on the owner's ranch.
 Weirdly enough, these busy nights would end early, and I'd be in bed shortly after midnight. In retrospect, this made perfect sense. Good living takes its toll on the body if not on the wallet, and we all need energy to face the next day's agenda of food, friends and frugality. And every evening, as I drifted off in my soft Ace Hotel bed, under the reassuring weight of that wool blanket, I would try to figure out how to answer a question I heard almost daily, from strangers and from old pals who saw how smoothly I'd settled into my Portland routine. ''So,'' they'd ask, ''when are you moving here?'' 
 I still don't know what to tell them.

HEADLINE: Laboratory Will Not Certify Pumps for Gas With 15 Percent Ethanol

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
GROUPS representing the nation's service station operators say they fear the possible legal and economic consequences of increasing the amount of ethanol in gasoline to 15 percent, from 10 percent, a change that ethanol producers have urged the Environmental Protection Agency to make. 
 The station owners say they fear lawsuits from customers claiming their cars were damaged by the E15 fuel. But they also note that existing pumps are not certified by Underwriters Laboratories as safe for use with E15 -- and U.L., which certifies the safety of a wide range of products, says it will not provide that certification.
 John Drengenberg, U.L.'s consumer safety director, said previous testing showed that the existing pumps were safe for up to 15 percent ethanol. But U.L. will not guarantee them for 1 percent more, he said.
 That means E15 certification cannot be given because there can be slight variations in the mixture of gas and ethanol, Mr. Drengenberg said -- E15 might actually include 16 percent ethanol. ''It cannot ever be said that this is exactly 15 percent.''
 Furthermore, while U.L. says 15 percent ethanol would be acceptable, it cannot retroactively and officially certify the existing pumps for dispensing E15, a spokesman, Joseph Hirschmugl, said. 
 That is a problem because state and local fire codes usually require stations to use equipment that a third party -- typically U.L. -- has certified as compatible with the fuel being sold. A fuel with much higher ethanol content, E85 -- which can be used only in flexible-fuel vehicles -- is dispensed through a different type of pump, which the U.L. has approved.
 That leaves service station owners wondering what they will do if E15 is approved. 
 Those retailers will have two choices, said John Eichberger, vice president for government relations at NACS, an association for convenience stores and gas stations. ''One, sell a product with noncompatible equipment, violate those rules and open themselves up to gross-negligence lawsuits,'' he said. ''Or try to find compatible equipment and replace their entire system. Unfortunately there are no dispensers certified for E15.''
 Joseph Hirschmugl, a spokesman for U.L., said his organization knew of no specific problem but must be cautious because adequate testing had not been done.
 For the gas station owners, the scary thing is the possibility of an accident or mishap that could result in a lawsuit, said Tim Columbus, general counsel for another service station trade group, the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America. Then people might start asking why uncertified equipment was being used, he said.
 In Growth Energy's request to the Environmental Protection Agency to allow an increase to E15, it insists that service stations won't have a problem. It says U.L.'s research ''supports that existing dispensers may be used successfully with ethanol blends up to E15.''
 But Mr. Drengenberg of U.L. says that is not true. U.L. approves of using up to 15 percent ethanol in existing dispensers, he said, but it does not approve of E15.

HEADLINE: When Your Sister Is the Story

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN The New York Times Company said it was prepared to start the clock on a shutdown of The Boston Globe, it was front-page news in last Monday's Washington Post. In The Times, it made the second paragraph of a short article inside the business section.
 In early April, when the company first threatened to close The Globe unless the paper's unions agreed to big concessions, it was at the top of the front page in Boston -- huge news about the 137-year-old paper. The Times, which only learned about the story on deadline, after it popped up on The Globe's Web site, published 343 words deep in its business section, quoting The Globe and relying on anonymous sourcing. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the Times Company's chairman, and Catherine Mathis, its spokeswoman, refused to comment or confirm the report. The Times did not follow up for days.
 The prospect that New England's largest and most influential newsgathering organization could be silenced had readers complaining about the parent company's refusal to explain itself -- and about the way its flagship newspaper, The Times, handled the story. The Times, which demands transparency and accountability from all sorts of other public institutions, found itself in the uncomfortable position of trying to cover one that had zipped its lip -- its own company. 
 ''We believe negotiations should be private,'' Mathis told me. But that's the business side speaking. The news side did not keep pushing hard enough, in my view.
 One reader, Andrew V. Marsters of Portland, Me., said that when the Times Company was threatening to kill a newspaper at a time of great upheaval in the industry, ''that is news. Is The Times bluffing? That would be a story. Is The Globe using hyperbole in an effort to curry favor with its readers, advertisers and local politicians? That would be a story, too. Whatever the case, New England is looking for an explanation, and it certainly isn't coming from The Times.''
 The Globe's immediate crisis ebbed a bit by Wednesday, when its largest union, the Boston Newspaper Guild, agreed to let its more than 600 members vote on a painful package of wage cuts, pension freezes and the elimination of lifetime job guarantees for senior employees. Regardless of the outcome, The Globe faces an uncertain future. Its circulation is down 13.7 percent in the latest reporting period, and advertising revenues are plunging. The newspaper is expected to lose $85 million this year. The concessions that the company is trying to get from the unions would save $20 million, less than a quarter of the projected loss, indicating more painful cuts ahead, almost certainly including jobs. 
 The Globe is a major drain on the Times Company, which lost $74.5 million in the first three months of this year and has imposed cost-cutting steps throughout its operations, including at The Times. Sulzberger told The Globe in a brief interview late last month that ''I do love The Globe,'' and said he was searching for a sustainable business model for it. The Times's Richard Perez-Pena, citing anonymous sources, reported Thursday that the company was actively shopping the paper.
 Times editors said they believe they have covered the Globe story appropriately and said they took the threats of closure as a normal part of hardball labor-management negotiations. Bill Keller, the executive editor, said that the way events unfolded through the week vindicated that judgment. If he had believed ''The Boston Globe was really on the brink of being shut down, we'd have put it on the front page,'' Keller said. 
 Janet Robinson, the chief executive of the Times Company, said, ''To characterize this as a negotiating stance is not accurate and does not convey the gravity of The Globe's financial situation.'' 
 Alex Jones, the director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, said: ''This is not a normal labor story. It's a life-and-death story.'' And Jones, who once covered the newspaper industry for The Times, expressed disappointment in how the paper had handled it. ''This was a very significant moment for American newspapers,'' he said. ''This was a story that begged coverage -- at least more penetrating and sophisticated coverage than it got.''
 The Times has published two longer articles about The Globe, both on the front of the business section. The first, in mid-April, focused on the shock in Boston at the prospect of losing an institution that plays a central role in the cultural and political life of the region. The second came on Thursday, after the Guild agreed to put the company's offer to a vote. Perez-Pena, who reported both of the articles, said, ''A lot of newspapers have had serious labor disputes and financial crises in recent years, and we haven't reported blow-by-blow on any of them, but we do try to hit the most important moments.''
 Bruce Headlam, the editor in charge of media coverage, said The Times had paid about as much or more attention to The Globe as to ailing newspapers in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and other cities. ''We've had a lot of newspaper stories on Page 1, to the point where we worry about being narcissistic in our coverage, and The Globe suffers from not being the first.''
 It is true that the outlines of the story have become depressingly familiar -- falling circulation and revenue because of the double blow of a deep recession and the rapid shift of readers and advertisers from printed papers to the Internet, where content is mostly free and ad rates are low. But when the story involves the most revered company in the industry -- and it happens to be yours -- I think there is a special obligation to be aggressive, which The Times has seemed loath to do. There are questions that want answers: How did The Globe, for which The Times Company paid $1.1 billion in 1993, get into a fix that seems dire even in comparison to many other struggling newspapers? What is the company's strategy? Could a storied newspaper family really shutter one of America's most important papers? 
 Perez-Pena has asked for interviews with Sulzberger and been turned down. A reporter for Reuters hung around outside a building where Sulzberger was giving a speech last week to ask him about the Boston situation. It can be hard, though, to chase your own boss down the street -- especially a boss who, when The Times won five Pulitzer Prizes, was warmly applauded for his steadfast support of the newsroom in trying times.
 I asked Keller about the difficulty of covering your own company. ''It's an utterly thankless task,'' he said. ''You have people assuming that what you write, if not dictated by the corporate P.R. department, is strongly influenced by the instinct for self-preservation.'' He said, ''We try to do a balanced job, the same as when we write about any institution.'' But he acknowledged, ''Historically, newspapers are not good at it.''
 Sulzberger said: ''I fully recognize that there is nothing more difficult for a news organization than covering itself. I am proud of the way in which The Globe and The Times have handled the coverage of the union negotiations.''

HEADLINE: Grosse Pointe Blues

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

DATELINE: GROSSE POINTE, Mich. 

 BODY:
 WITH an address in this town, where the e's are silent but still do all the work, a club doesn't need an elaborate name, nor even much of a physical plant. The Tennis House tells you everything you need to know. You either get it or you don't.
 One indoor Har-Tru court. An intermittently staffed wet bar with some dilapidated steel chairs covered in tartan vinyl. And upon entering, a doormat that says only ''Since 1936.''
 The club is so low profile that some people here aren't even aware of it. It was built, said Richard Klimisch, a longtime member, by Edsel Ford and is still owned by members of the Ford family who live nearby. 
 ''You used to have to wait years to get in, but now we can't even find enough members,'' said Mr. Klimisch, a former engineer and lobbyist for General Motors who considers himself very fortunate to have taken an early buyout several years ago. ''We need 100 just to cover the costs, and we're down to about 75. It used to be the most exclusive club in Grosse Pointe. Now, we're probably going to have to close it down.''
 Detroit is used to playing through pain -- having endured, over the years, the 1967 race riots, the advent of fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and Kid Rock's marriage to Pamela Anderson. But this is Grosse Pointe, one of its grandest suburbs, a community along Lake St. Clair, where -- if some generalization can be permitted -- the mansions have porte-cocheres and loggias; and the Fords, Chryslers and Dodges on the block might be last names.
 The automotive industry's current woes are so severe, members of the local ruling class say, that they feel threatened to an extent they haven't before. With Chrysler in bankruptcy and G.M. -- even after receiving $15.4 billion in federal loans -- at the brink of it, too, gloom and fear are hardly abstract quantities. 
 Auto executives have been as ridiculed as any high-flying group in recent years, with their private jets, falling sales and spectacularly huge losses. Grosse Pointe's clubby culture always seemed solid. But now, as the industry lays off its white-collar workers in greater numbers, the suburb is suffering and residents seem surprised -- and maybe even a little angry. The troubles go much deeper than the fate of one threadbare tennis court.
 ''There are so many houses for sale along Lake Shore Drive,'' said Joe Warner, editor of The Grosse Pointe News (one of the last papers in the country to advertise ''butlers'' in its classifieds). ''Even through all Detroit's ups and downs, those houses just never came on the market. They stayed in families for generations.''
 Mr. Klimisch's wife, Prudence Cole, a career counselor, described a ''level of fear'' even among her executive-level friends. One manager at G.M., she said, asked her advice recently about preparing to re-enter the job market.
 ''Now a few years ago, an executive from G.M. would never have asked me that,'' Ms. Cole said. ''People came to equate the company with stability. You had a job for life. It had 100 years of prosperity and suddenly that's all gone.''
 At University Liggett School, a K-12 private school in Grosse Pointe Woods where tuition runs as high as $20,000, that fear of the unknown has needed to be addressed just as much as lost income. ''We've identified 20 to 25 young children out of an enrollment of 540 whose families have expressed concern about the future of Chrysler and whether or not they'll remain full-paying or will need a lot of financial aid,'' said Kevin Breen, the associate head of the school. 
 These are not Chrysler employees but families with businesses that supply the Big Three with parts. ''They don't know until they get the news from Washington about forgiving Chrysler's loans whether the company will be able to make good on their accounts payable,'' he said. 
 Mr. Breen was quick to note that the school has dipped into its shrinking endowment and, over the last three years, tripled the financial aid it disperses. ''And we have some families who we are relying on more heavily than ever to partner with us,'' he said.
 Over the last year, the Big Three have cut more than 15,000 white-collar jobs, and G.M. has said it plans to cut more. In Michigan, the white-collar unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, a full percentage point higher than the national average.
 Kay Agney, a real estate agent in Grosse Pointe, said foreclosures had resulted in depreciations of some properties on the order of 35 percent or more -- ''say, a $1.2 million house going for $700,000 or $800,000,'' she said.
 It isn't just Grosse Pointe. Bloomfield Hills, Orchard Lake and Birmingham -- the newer-money suburbs to the west of Detroit that are near Chrysler and that grew in stature when G.M. moved some operations to the nearby city of Pontiac -- are struggling, too, making the entire group of towns feel like a very small campus these days. 
 Automotive executives really are household names, such that when a woman at the bar of the Townsend Hotel in Birmingham describes herself as an ''aesthetician, which means I do hair removal,'' and says that Dieter Zetsche, the former head of Daimler-Chrysler, was a client, it's understood that she's talking about sculpturing his famous mustache.
 (Bloomfield Hills -- where nearly half the houses were valued at $1,000,000 or more in 2000 -- and Birmingham are a bit like a Midwestern and suburban version of the Hamptons. There are modern houses on out-of-sight estates. Grosse Pointe would be more like Nantucket but without scrimshaw.)
 All around the rich Detroit suburbs you hear familiar stories about the impact, though many believe their woes to be beyond the familiar, ''because I would argue that we've been hit harder than other parts of the country,'' said Denise Ilitch, a regent of the University of Michigan and the publisher of Ambassador, a local party-pages magazine. Her father, Mike Ilitch, started Little Caesar's pizza and owns both the Detroit Tigers and the Red Wings. 
 So the charitable boards on which Ms. Ilitch and her cohort sit and the luxury retailers they keep in business, are all faced with the unfortunate plague that in the restaurant business is called a bad location. Except the location, in this case, is the entire community. Her cohort includes Debbie Dingell, the G.M. executive who is married to Representative John Dingell; Danielle Karmanos, the wife of the Compuware founder Pete Karmanos Jr.; and Julie Taubman, who married into the family of A. Alfred Taubman, the mall mogul.
 Linda Dresner, who owns a clothing boutique in Birmingham, said her store was ''speaking to fewer people'' these days, though recently she still held a J. Mendel Trunk sale and last week was donating clothes for the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit's spring auction.
 Luigi Bruni, the hairstylist up the road, said that he was making more house calls to blow out clients' hair, and willing to give discounts.
 ''If, for example, I have a lady who's an executive secretary at whatever-whatever car manufacturer, and she just got laid off, I'll figure out a price she can work with,'' Mr. Bruni said, adding: ''That's just a hypothetical customer.''
 And then there are the clubs. Even grande dames like the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club have been forced to genuflect to hold onto members.
 ''They've become more family-friendly, more casual,'' said Mr. Warner of The Grosse Pointe News. ''You're seeing a little less resilience to host a corporate golf outing than there used to be.''
 While Mr. Warner dropped one of his memberships this year, he also added one. ''They lowered the golf initiation fee from $35,000 to $2,500 and said I could finance it with no payment for a year,'' he said, smiling sheepishly. 
 The Detroit News reported that other clubs had been sending gift certificates to residents of entire neighborhoods in hopes of finding new members and likened it to ''borrowing the sales tactics of Wal-Mart.''
 These people feel compelled to identify with the city's laborers -- their hard work and hard luck the very essence, after all, of Detroit. ''What's really odd is when you hear some people in Congress saying 'Well, just let the auto industry go down,' '' said Douglas Hess, a Grosse Pointe lawyer who retired from G.M. seven years ago. ''It's inconceivable to me to be cavalier about the auto industry at the same time that they're worrying about saving these New York bankers.''
 ''I don't think the rest of the country can appreciate the strength of character and the toughness that goes on here in Detroit,'' said Ms. Karmanos, a glamorous local figure with a billionaire husband and foundation involvement galore. She was sitting in the conservatory of their mansion in Orchard Lake -- near a fireplace of striated marble.
 She feels fortunate. Her husband's company is not directly affected; the N.H.L. team he owns -- the Carolina Hurricanes -- is in the playoffs; and she is home expecting twins.
 ''I wake up every day and ask God, 'How can I help my community?' '' she said, adding that her father had worked on the line at a Ford plant and that she would ''rather die than drive a foreign car.'' She added: ''Detroit will come together and survive.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 17, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the declining fortunes of Grosse Pointe, Mich., a community where many of Detroit's top executives live, misidentified the family shown in a 1968 picture from Slim Aarons's book ''A Wonderful Time.'' It is the family of Mrs. Roy Chapin Jr., whose husband was the chairman of American Motors in the 1960's and '70s -- not Mrs. Roy Chopin.

HEADLINE: Homage to a Depression-Fueled Eccentric

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Vineland 

 BODY:
 THE last time the economy sank this low, a man who had lost the last of his fortune in the stock market crash heard that land in a town he had never visited was selling for $1 an acre. He started walking from his home in New York City toward South Jersey in the fall of 1929, and when he arrived at dusk one day two weeks later, he bought four acres, sight unseen.
 But the homestead where George Daynor planned to start over again -- at the age of almost 70, he claimed, after striking gold in Alaska and surviving the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- turned out to be something less than Edenic. 
 ''It was a junkyard in the middle of a swamp,'' Kevin Kirchner said as he visited the site one day this week, scratching at the gray beard he hates but dutifully starts growing each February so he can portray Mr. Daynor at Founders' Day each May (this year on May 16). Then, as Mr. Daynor used to tell it, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said, ''You have all the material here to build a palace.'' 
 Mr. Kirchner paused for moment to let that particular revelation sink in -- he has to pause to let a lot sink in when telling the story of a man for whom ''eccentric'' is an insufficient adjective -- and then picked up one of the old bricks he and a band of volunteers are using to rebuild, in the middle of one economic crisis, a long-defunct landmark that was first built in response to another: Mr. Daynor's Palace of Depression. ''He was probably a borderline genius-nutball, right on that edge,'' Mr. Kirchner, 58, said.
 In the middle of the Great Depression, Mr. Daynor built his junkyard palace on Mill Road here to send a message that is worth hearing again in our own hard times: You may not have much, but what you do have may turn out to be worth more than you think. ''The only real depression is a depression of individual ingenuity,'' Mr. Daynor said to one of the film and TV crews that visited when the Palace of Depression was a popular tourist attraction, from the 1930s through the 1950s. 
 The palace was also the home he shared with his common-law wife, Florence, and he expanded and ornamented it over the years with the scavenging, untutored aesthetic of a fort-building boy, until it looked like a troll's fairy-tale hideaway, what Mr. Kirchner likes to describe as ''the Christmas Grinch castle.'' He used tortoise shells, bed frames, bottles, broken bits of anything, and all those junked fenders, bumpers, generators and other auto parts. He mixed the claylike soil with the fluid leakage from the cars, slapped his found treasures into place with it, and watched it all bake hard in the sun. 
 The 18 spires he built on wagon-wheel bases rose like stalagmites from the roof. He fashioned a Devil's Den in the basement, where he claimed to keep the Jersey Devil on its occasional visits. He charged visitors a quarter for a tour.
 ''He would squirrel around and gather stuff and then he'd build with it,'' said Jeffrey Tirante, 50, who watched bulldozers level the palace in 1969, five years after Mr. Daynor's death, and who visited its remnants with his friends and their guitars as a teenager. In 1986, he had his wedding at the ticket booth, the only original structure that survived intact. ''It was supposed to be a monument that represented what people could do for themselves, pulling their own weight.''
 For the last decade, Mr. Kirchner and Mr. Tirante have formed the odd-couple core of the volunteer effort to rebuild the palace. ''I think bricks and mortar,'' said Mr. Kirchner, the City of Vineland's construction official and director of licenses and inspections. As for Mr. Tirante, who recently started a company that makes what he describes as ''replicas and dashboard icons,'' Mr. Kirchner said, ''He's an artist -- he thinks different.''
 Mr. Kirchner remembers visiting the palace as a boy of perhaps 5, the summer that all of his uncles came to visit, one week after the next, from Pennsylvania. ''We brought one of them here, and then they all wanted to see it,'' he said.
 The palace closed in 1957 after one of Mr. Daynor's publicity stunts -- his false claim to the F.B.I. that the kidnappers of a young boy had visited -- landed him in prison for more than a year for obstruction of justice. Vandals damaged the palace when he was gone, and he was too old to rebuild when he returned. He was buried in a pauper's grave. The city bought the property from his widow, and demolished what was left when it was deemed a safety hazard.
 In 1998, when the city was considering the overgrown land as a site for low-income housing, Mr. Kirchner suggested rebuilding the palace as a city park instead. He soon had $11,000 in donations, and 400 volunteers offering materials and labor. For several years the efforts of the newly formed Palace of Depression Restoration Association -- Kevin Kirchner, president -- consisted mainly of wading through the complex process of securing a wetlands permit from the state. (The site borders a stream where Mr. Daynor drank, bathed, and caught fish and frogs for supper.) 
 Mr. Daynor left no blueprints, but an architect cobbled together some, based on old photographs, newsreels, postcards and also -- an unexpected benefit from Mr. Daynor's ignominious demise -- the aerial shots the F.B.I. took during the investigation. Mr. Kirchner and his volunteers spent two years clearing the land with a chainsaw, then started building. Vandals knocked their work down once, then again, then again.
 ''After the third time, I was ready to just bring the bulldozer out and give everything up, '' Mr. Kirchner said. Mr. Tirante, who rides the bus here from his home in Philadelphia most weekends to work on the project, encouraged him to press on, and they did. ''We'd be up on the second floor by now if they hadn't wiped us out.''
 The construction season started at the site a few weeks ago, with more volunteers than in any previous year, and by the end of the summer Mr. Kirchner hopes to have the walls of the first floor finished. He estimates another three to five years of work before the project is done. Artifacts and building materials destined for the new palace -- dug up from the site, or donated -- fill half of his garage, part of his son's barn, and all of another storage unit. Every time an old building in the city is torn down, Mr. Kirchner scavenges it the way Mr. Daynor once might have.
 The original palace was doomed from the start because Mr. Daynor, for all his Depression-bred ingenuity, never gave it a proper foundation. ''When we first dug we hit the original base, but it was so crumbled we took it out,'' Mr. Kirchner said, pointing to where concrete will soon be poured and a solid new wall will rise. ''We want this one to stand.''

HEADLINE: Make Art, Save Planet, Earn Cash

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
IN his choreography for Momix, his troupe of dancer-illusionists based in Washington, Conn., Moses Pendleton conspicuously worships at nature's altar, charming rattlesnakes, lizards and scorpions beneath towering saguaro in ''Opus Cactus'' (2001) and unleashing phosphorescent creatures to frolic through the atmosphere of Earth's nearest neighbor in ''Lunar Sea'' (2005). 
 He said that he conceived ''Botanica,'' his latest bouquet of dance, athleticism and fantasy, as an herbal remedy for an ailing world. The evening-length work -- Mr. Pendleton's first in four years and the 28-year-old company's most intricate project yet, requiring two live-video cameras, a multitude of projections and assorted large props -- will run for three weeks starting May 12, when Momix begins its annual residency at the Joyce Theater.
 Set to a score layered with birdsongs and Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' ''Botanica'' is a visually drenched and fanciful four-part meditation on the rhythms of the New England year. The work's many elements include a river of fluttering ice-blue silk, dancers standing in for the stems and faces of feathery sunflowers, and elaborately masked centaurs performing a country line dance. 
 ''We came to the idea that 'Botanica' is Moses's garden,'' said Cynthia Quinn, Mr. Pendleton's companion and co-director, with whom he has a daughter, Quinn Elizabeth Pendleton, who dances with Les Ballets de Monte Carlo.
 But despite its organic aura, ''Botanica'' took root amid the cold surfaces of Mercedes-Benz automobiles and Kohler bathroom fixtures, and the ka-ching of the Las Vegas empire of Steve Wynn. 
 Since 1981 Momix, one of just a handful of for-profit dance companies, has sought out commercial work -- from presentations at corporate gatherings for Fiat, BMW and MAC cosmetics to a television advertisement for Hanes underwear -- to bolster its bottom line.
 More recently Mr. Pendleton has used his corporate liaisons as informal workshops or high-end residencies, plucking ideas for new performances out of those generated for clients. ''Botanica'' is a result of three such collaborations, as well as a workshop with Diana Vishneva of the Kirov Ballet and countless hours in Mr. Pendleton's studio.
 As the economy falters, the unusual business arrangement has helped Momix expand its scope -- subsidizing rehearsal time, larger performance spaces and more elaborate props than the company might afford on its own. 
 ''The people have provided some means with which we can continue working on the things that we believe we should work on,'' Mr. Pendleton said of his corporate boosters. ''With all of these events, they were profitable, and I think they were profitable on an aesthetic level too.''
 Margaret Selby, the president of CAMI Spectrum and the ensemble's manager said: ''Moses has had to work very intelligently. There's no extravagance.''
 Momix is, after all, a small, mom-and-pop operation with a fluid roster of 20 to 35 dancers divided into two or more groups, run by an irrepressible board of two from their chicly dilapidated home. 
 As a for-profit company Mr. Pendleton and Ms. Quinn shoulder the burden of operating expenses -- currently, between $2 million and $3 million a year -- without federal money, grants or tax-deductible contributions. This year 20 or so Momix dancers will present 300 performances around the world, from Schenectady, N.Y., to Santiago, Chile. The cost to develop a new show: $400,000, give or take. 
 ''Art doesn't work if business doesn't work,'' Ms. Quinn said.
 Mr. Pendleton elaborated. ''We have to operate under business principles because if the business collapsed, we wouldn't be able to give all our lovely dancers a salary and health insurance,'' he said. ''I think we have gotten beyond worrying about being populist and all of this as a description of being superficial. It's important to not just be a meaningless terrorist with an elitist art position that no one ever sees.''
 Certainly other companies have dipped their toes in the corporate world. Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company shot a kinetic advertising campaign for Puma. ''Caught,'' a signature work of David Parsons of Parsons Dance, was performed for a dinner for International Olympic Committee delegates during New York City's bid for the 2012 Olympics. And Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson of Complexions Contemporary Ballet choreographed a couple on last season's ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' 
 Momix had begun laying the groundwork for a ''plant piece'' in a 2006 workshop at Steve Wynn's Las Vegas resort when Kohler and Mercedes-Benz came courting.
 ''It's interesting that these projects were really about being greenish, and it all fit together,'' Ms. Selby said. Kohler, for instance, wanted to promote water conservation; Mercedes-Benz, reduced emissions. 
 ''I think Momix has a special appeal because what they do is unlike anything else people have seen,'' she said. ''It's beautiful, there's a sense of humor, it's sexy, it's fun, and it straddles the two universes, the artistic and the commercial. So when corporations come to Moses, they really want to do work through Moses's vision. 'The bold look of Kohler' '' -- the company's marketing campaign for kitchen and bath fixtures -- ''was a natural fit.''
 So too, it turned out, was the request by Mercedes-Benz executives that Mr. Pendleton help convey the company's commitment to environmental awareness at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, which attracted a million visitors.
 ''At that time economics were under focus, but more the questions were about where the auto industry was going in terms of carbon dioxide and emissions reductions,'' said Chris Horn, the director of global communications for Mercedes-Benz. ''We gave Momix a briefing about what our intentions were. We asked them to be as creative as they wanted to be. They had complete liberty in choosing a format and choreography and a theme. And they came back to us with a show ideal for a stage we had.''
 Strutting down a ''car walk'' 165 feet long by 45 feet wide, Momix rolled out gigantic trees with dancers clinging to their branches, who then took the trees apart and used the parts to make a car. 
 ''The performance was exceptionally well received and served us well for what we wanted to accomplish and achieve,'' Mr. Horn said. ''It was the dominating element of the show and made the national German news.''
 Still, this winter, three years after playing among corporate gods, Mr. Pendleton and Ms. Quinn remained unsure as to whether they had a full-length work on their hands, or merely a collection of physical haiku. And the enormous props, including one of the trees sprung from the imagination of Michael Curry, a puppeteer, prop maker and frequent collaborator who also conjured up a triceratops, required downsizing to move into smaller performance venues. 
 For economic reasons Momix will use only 10 dancers for the tour of ''Botanica'' until it's clear the production is successful. (So far, so good. A recent 14-week tour of Italy resulted in sold-out shows and the addition of at least one performance to the schedule.) In place of a second production of ''Botanica,'' a second Momix group is rotating in repertory with ''Best of Momix,'' a compact potpourri of the company's most popular works, like ''Baseball'' (1995) and ''Momix in Orbit'' (1999).
 Whether or not audiences buy into the idea that the earthly delights on offer from ''Botanica'' might cure what collectively ails us, Mr. Pendleton is thrilled to be riding what he calls ''the green, Obamic wave.'' 
 ''There should be a stimulus package for things of culture, things of nature, those things that inspire us,'' he said. ''Beauty -- this is part of the business of life. Beauty is not pork.''

HEADLINE: The Credit Card Squeeze

 BODY:
At a time when everyone is talking about troubled banks, Congress can provide relief to millions of their increasingly alarmed customers. Many credit card holders are complaining about unexpected increases in fees or interest rates that double or triple for no reason. 
 The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that at least 10 million cardholders have seen their interest rates skyrocket in the last six months through no fault of their own. The center has also found that instead of changing their behavior in anticipation of tough new Federal Reserve rules that will take effect in July of next year, most big banks continue to engage in practices that provoked the public outcry and the Fed's response in the first place. 
 Five of eight top credit card issuers in the country have added new fees on transactions like cash advances or for monthly maintenance. One major card company began charging a late fee of 3 percent on unpaid balances, which means that on a $5,000 balance, the cost of being just a day or so late jumped from $39 to $150. 
 Fortunately, however, Congress is moving to turn much of the Fed's reform package into law. The House has already passed its version by a wide margin, giving Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, the support she has been seeking for years for the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat now facing a tough re-election fight in Connecticut, is trying to steer a somewhat tougher version of Ms. Maloney's bill through the Senate. 
 Both bills require adequate advance notice of rate increases or changes in terms. Both make it far harder for students to get credit cards and for banks to increase rates on existing balances. Both end the practice of charging interest on balances already paid. The House bill would give banks a year to deal with these new rules; the Senate would give them nine months. That is already too long for many customers.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argues that banks need the extra year to adjust. Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York, says the Fed's leisurely timetable is ''unconscionable.'' He should make this same point with his Senate colleagues in order to make the new law go into effect much sooner. 
 From the looks of it, the banks are ratcheting up fees and interest before the Fed's rules kick in and it is too late. This makes an earlier deadline imperative.

HEADLINE: Symbolic Spaces

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
While it is often assumed that a wholesale rejection of the art of the past occurred in the 20th century, in fact traditional subjects for artists have persisted to a remarkable extent, albeit in altered form. Sometimes they even emerge reinvigorated. For instance, two exhibitions at Art Sites in Riverhead draw their inspiration from ideas of home and domesticity, themes that underlie several centuries of still life and genre painting, the latter involving images of domestic interiors and social life.
 One of the shows is in the gallery; the other is outdoors on the two-acre riverside property, the artworks scattered among the grass and trees. Both exhibitions were organized by Glynis Berry, the co-founder (with Hideaki Ariizumi) of this plucky little nonprofit art space, which has earned a dedicated local following since it opened three years ago. Though economic times are tough and funding is hard to come by, Ms. Berry says they are committed to keeping the gallery open. 
 The gallery exhibition features the work of two well-known contemporary artists, Ted Victoria and Darlene Charneco. It is a big show, titled ''Home,'' with more than 45 works, most dating from the last couple of years, spread over three rooms. Though the artists use different materials and appear to have little in common with each other, their work is a linked by an examination of networks and communities as part of a larger investigation into ideas of home and habitation.
 Both make paintings, though not in any conventional sense. Mr. Victoria constructs small, low-tech, animated light-box assemblages with subtle moving images. Ms. Charneco's works are more difficult to describe, though they are essentially collages. She starts with a wood base, painting it with circles, then adding a thick layer of transparent resin into which she sticks nails, clusters of toy houses, miniature fences and trees. They look like social experiments in imaginary Petri dishes.
 For me, Mr. Victoria's light box assemblages are the more interesting of the two bodies of work. They look at first like simple tableaus -- we see a chair and ball in a living room; a light bulb; a television and ticking clock. It is nothing special. But the scenes are enlivened by movement and clever juxtapositions of scale. Watching the objects slowly spin and turn gives us a sense of space unmoored. With his domestic illusionism, Mr. Victoria turns the mundane into the marvelous. 
 Born and raised in Riverhead, Mr. Victoria first came to the attention of the New York art scene with installations of images of swimming sea monkeys filling storefront windows. His light boxes are more ambitious, but rely on more or less the same technology -- light projections using objects reflected in mirrors. The exception is ''Watching TV on LSD #1'' (1998), which incorporates a live television image through the use of concealed antennae.
 The outdoor exhibition, ''YC3,'' which stands for Yurt City 3, is the third iteration of a collaborative outdoor sculpture project coordinated by Sheila Ross and Laura Ten Eyck, Canadian artists based in New York. Conceived in response to the city's lack of affordable housing and studio space for artists, it consists of 10 prefabricated tents, yurts and other temporary shelters. Together they serve as a testing ground of ad hoc vernacular architecture.
 Some structures are more practical than others. Ms. Ross's ''Junior 1 Bedroom'' (2009) is an amalgam of tents in the shape of a one-bedroom apartment with an additional front room. It is surrounded by a white picket fence and a freshly planted garden. It is a tent-city version of the American dream. By contrast, George Schmidt's ''Meeting House'' (2009) is a miniature, elevated, blue clapboard structure in the shape of a meeting hall. Viewers can insert their heads at either end of it to see and talk to one another. The confined setting creates an intensified interaction. 
 Among the most engaging pieces is Todd Knopke's ''Inside Out and Outside In'' (2009), a giant mural landscape made of pieces of scrap fabric sewn together and then turned inside out to create a tent. This forces viewers to enter the tent, to be within the picture in order to view it. Happily, it is very beautiful in there; the fabric glows in the sunlight as if it were stained glass. I had the momentary sensation of sitting in a distant European chapel.
 Jose Krapp, Derrick Wilson, Ms. Ten Eyck and an artist known only as Fletch round out the selection of artists, all of whom have contributed interesting, enterprising works. They remind us that home is a symbolic space as much as a physical location. First and foremost, it is a place that we can call our own. 
 ''Home,'' through June 7, and ''YC3,'' through Oct. 18, at Art Sites, 651 West Main Street (Route 25), Riverhead. Information: artsitesgallery.com or (631) 591-2401.

 BODY:
My mother, who lives with us and our two young children, is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Her impairment isn't immediately obvious, but she constantly violates basic rules of behavior -- belching at the table like Buddy the Elf, which my kids think is a riot, or making rude comments like: ''You are extremely fat.'' 
 I usually begin a babbling monologue. I want to explain her condition, but be respectful to my mother. Any ideas? 
 L.N., Chevy Chase, Md.
 Here's the thing, devoted daughter: You and your family are under extreme pressure. Being your mother's caretaker must present countless occasions when you might just as easily laugh as cry. So I say: Do both.
 Your kids aren't the only ones who giggle at belches and farts -- as Judd Apatow's oeuvre so audibly demonstrates. Cut them some slack. It's probably a nice release for them. Just make sure they understand, later, why belching is O.K. for their grandmother, but not for them.
 Her inappropriate remarks to others is a different matter -- though common in Alzheimer's patients. She may hurt people's feelings. No elaborate monologues required. Better to jump in with something simple, like: ''I'm sorry for my mother. She isn't well.''
 That should diffuse the situation. If not, chalk it up to yet another inequity suffered at life's end -- then run. 
 44 Going on 11
 My daughter, who is 44 and divorced, is stuck in a time warp: she dresses in Woodstock tie-dye, has her hair styled as if it were 1950, and wears no makeup at all. On the other hand, she's slim, has a prestigious job and owns her own home. She would love to find love again. How can I get her to ''gild the lily'' without alienating her?
 Anonymous
 After 44 years, do you mean to tell me that it still comes down to: ''You're wearing that?!'' 
 You know far better than I how your daughter responds to your suggestions for beautification. And I doubt we are going to alter that dynamic at this stage.
 How about introducing some neutral third parties? Give her a gift certificate to a good salon for her 45th birthday, and treat her to a haircut with a new stylist. Or enlist a personal shopper at a nice boutique to help choose an outfit. 
 While she's busy with that, break into her house and steal the tie-dye -- which you can then donate to the Grateful Dead's ''80th Birthday'' tour. 
 Take-Mom-to-Work Day
 I'm graduating from college, and my mother has already found me a great job. The catch is we'll be working for the same company, on different floors. She already has plans for all the fun we'll have together, but I'm worried. I want to maintain my independence without making her feel left out. What are the boundaries?
 Anonymous
 Many years ago, The Times ran an article about a sweet little boy, off to his first day of school, claiming he wasn't frightened to go -- just worried that his mother would be lonely at home without him. 
 That wasn't you, by any chance, was it?
 Your mother can take care of herself. I promise. If working at the same company feels too close for comfort, find yourself another job. (And good luck with that, in this economy.) 
 Otherwise, sit her down for a heart-to-heart and set some ground rules: No calling you ''sweetie'' at staff meetings, or generally acting like a mother hen at work. No one ever got ahead at the office by being thought of as somebody's kid -- unless the kid in question was Edgar Bronfman Jr.
 Let your mother know you value your independence, but set a regular date -- dinners on Tuesday, maybe -- so she's assured of seeing you, too. I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised. You may be the sunshine of her life, but everyone likes a little shade from time to time. 
 Mother's Day Pie
 On Mother's Day, my two siblings and I take our parents out to dinner. My sister is married with a child, so she's a party of three. My brother and I are single. When the bill arrives, my sister pays one-third of it. But with her husband and son eating, shouldn't she contribute more?
 Anonymous
 Minefield at Table 12!The answer here depends on relationships and relative means -- not math. I can certainly envision a more pro rata division of the check: one-half to the married sister, and the balance split by the singletons. But I can also see this as a group gift to your mother, in which case the equal division makes sense. 
 If it's bothering you -- and your siblings can discuss matters like this without going all Cain and Abel -- raise it with them. Otherwise, leave it alone -- or ask your mother to pick her favorite child, and let that one pay the entire bill. 
 Training
 My 2-year-old son frequently has play dates with a friend's daughter. My friend has an expensive train set-up at her house, which is off limits to the girl. My son is obsessed with trains and can't stay away from them. But my friend insists that they are off limits to him, and that I should do a better job of distracting him. I think she should put the trains away when we come over. How can I ask without looking like an overprotective mother?
 Anonymous
 Too late, Mommy. I'm afraid the ''anal and overprotective'' train left the station sometime in the early '90s. 
 No parent I knew when I was a kid ever watched me play -- along with adult friends, no less -- unless by ''friend'' you mean a pack of Newports and a glass of chardonnay.
 For the record, I agree with you. Convincing a toddler that a toy is off limits makes G.M.'s auto challenges look like child's play. So if you can't persuade your friend to stash the trains, perhaps you could move the conversation along by setting up the toddlers next to her good china or Steuben figurines?
 Choo-choo!

HEADLINE: After the Stress Tests

 BODY:
The long-awaited results of the bank stress tests are in. Now comes the real-world test, both of the health of the banks and, equally important, the Obama administration's strategy and resolve to confront the banking debacle. Unlike the stress tests, in which it was foreordained that no bank would be allowed to fail, the outcome of the real-world test is cloudy. 
 To recap, the purpose of the tests was to assess how much each of the nation's 19 largest banks would lose if the recession deepened and how much additional capital, if any, they would need to raise to survive such losses. Total potential losses for this year and next year were set at $600 billion, and 10 of the big 19 banks were ordered to raise a total of $75 billion in additional capital, which some of them began doing right away on Friday. The rest were given a clean bill of health. 
 The test conclusions are not wildly differently from other more-or-less consensus estimates. Still, whether $75 billion in capital will be enough to prevent more bailouts and to get the banks lending again depends primarily on how the economy performs. The regulators assumed that it would begin to recover modestly next year, but projections of what may happen, and when, vary widely. 
 That brings us to one of the biggest problems with the stress tests. They were supposed to supply clarity, a foundation for renewed confidence in the banks to function normally. Instead, investors, consumers and taxpayers alike must wait and see.
 Will a modest economic bounce (that may or may not occur) and a mixture of new capital, fiscal stimulus and other government interventions revive the banks? That is a matter of great debate. What is known is that buying time, rather than forcefully intervening to restructure weak banks, can be a dicey gambit. Prolonged bank weakness could reinforce economic weakness, as happened in Japan's lost decade in the 1990s. 
 That is not the only problem with the stress tests. While the results have focused mainly on the 10 banks that need to raise capital, some of the banks deemed well capitalized have seized on the results to suggest that they should be freed from the extra government control that came with the bailouts. They seem to believe that if they repay the original bailout money from last year, they should be allowed to resume business as usual. 
 They must be disabused of that notion. Linking a payback with cessation of oversight would be premature. Government aid for the banks has gone far beyond the initial cash infusions, including government guarantees for hundreds of billions of dollars of bank debt, tens of billions funneled to them via the bailout of American International Group, and increased backing from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Treasury is also gearing up to offer up to $1 trillion in financing for investors to buy up banks' bad assets. All the props must be removed -- and there must be a full accounting for all of the support and subsidies -- before Washington considers giving the banks freer rein. 
 And even then, regulation must be greater than it was before the crisis. The banks, of course, resist that, and it is unclear whether the administration intends to be aggressive in pursuing new laws and regulations. But the portents are not good. 
 Recently, when the banking industry worked to defeat a measure to let homeowners have mortgages modified in bankruptcy court, the administration did not fight back, even though President Obama had long professed support for the measure. And the administration's main regulatory proposal for a single regulator to monitor systemwide risk is overbroad, putting more faith in a new regulator than in new rules. 
 In the end, the fallout from the stress tests may say more about the Obama administration's willingness to reform the banks than about the banks themselves. We're listening.

HEADLINE: Districts Say Busing Needs More State Aid

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: BEDFORD 

 BODY:
 AFTER her son, Jake, struggled in seventh grade at Fox Lane Middle School last year, Lori Lerner of Bedford Corners decided that Winston Preparatory School, 30 miles away in Norwalk, Conn., had the right program for his attention-deficit disorder and other learning disabilities. But while the Lerners were willing to pay for a private school, they could not drive the 45 minutes each way because of work. 
 Instead, Jake took a bus provided by the Bedford Central School District under state law, and he has had a terrific eighth-grade year at Winston Prep, Ms. Lerner said. ''I pay taxes, and I am paying for my son's education, so I feel entitled that Bedford pays for his transportation,'' she said. 
 But some other Westchester County school districts are hoping for relief from such transportation costs, which can run to tens of thousands of dollars per student annually. And some districts are working together to keep transportation costs down.
 By law, most county districts must provide transportation to children attending private schools within 15 miles or special-needs schools within 50 miles of their district. In the economic downturn, districts are struggling to balance this transportation mandate with academic expenses and want more help from the state. 
 ''It's not that we don't want to give this to the child, but we need help from the state,'' said Nancy Tucci, school board president for the Rye Neck school district. ''We have other constraints, and this is an uncontrollable cost.''
 Rye Neck has 1,500 students and spends $1.2 million, or 3 percent of its total budget, busing children out of the district. Transportation costs for individual special-needs students can exceed $50,000 a year, Ms. Tucci said.
 Larger districts are also paying more than $1 million busing students out of district: the Chappaqua district is budgeting $2.3 million for next year, the Mamaroneck district $1.4 million and the Scarsdale schools roughly $1.4 million, officials said.
 The White Plains school district, which has 7,000 students, expects to spend $1.6 million next year transporting 64 children for special-needs education. That is an average of $25,000 per child, said Fred W. Seiler, assistant superintendent for business. As a city district, White Plains is exempt from transporting traditional private school students.
 Affluent districts in Westchester typically get the minimum state transportation aid, 6.5 percent of their transportation costs, because it is calculated based on relative property wealth, said John Ross, assistant superintendent for business at the Blind Brook-Rye school district. Lower-income districts can get aid of up to 90 percent.
 Mr. Ross saves his district money by informally sharing some bus routes with neighboring districts; he tried to set up a consortium with several neighboring districts when he went to Blind Brook eight years ago but could not get it off the ground.
 ''Some school districts worry that if four or five districts are in a consortium, children could be on a bus an extra 15 or 20 minutes,'' he said. ''But you can lower costs by routing more efficiently.''
 Recognizing the problems districts are having fulfilling their transportation mandates, the State Board of Regents recommended in its 2009 state aid proposal that districts reduce costs by using administration services provided by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services, said Jonathan Burman, a State Education Department spokesman.
 Before going to Blind Brook, Mr. Ross set up two transportation consortiums for Boces that are still in use, sharing buses and routes. One links Irvington, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings-on-Hudson and Ardsley; the other connects Bronxville, Eastchester, Pelham and Tuckahoe.
 These consortiums save $1,400 per student a year, said Douglas Carter, who manages the consortiums as transportation coordinator for Southern Westchester Boces. ''We spend $6,200 to $6,700 per pupil in our consortium,'' he said. 
 Thomas P. Higgins, assistant superintendent at the Putnam/Northern Westchester Boces, said he recently met with superintendents from 12 northern Westchester districts to discuss a possible plan for sharing or eliminating routes that cross districts. 
 For Ms. Lerner, having her district transport her son Jake to a private school that fits his learning style has been a huge relief.
 ''I am eternally grateful to have this because there is no way for my son to attend this school without it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Joy and Anticipation For Soldiers' Return

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J. 

 BODY:
 IN the next few weeks, the largest overseas deployment of the New Jersey National Guard since World War II is scheduled to come home, 2,850 soldiers returning to their loved ones. As head of the family support program for the Teaneck Armory, Master Sgt. Minnie Hiller-Cousins has to make sure those loved ones are mentally prepared for those soldiers.
 ''Put on your helmets!'' Sergeant Hiller-Cousins ordered the 50 wives and mothers who had come to a recent monthly family meeting at the armory. ''And keep those helmets on! Everyone must wear a helmet.''
 Over the next half-hour, as the sergeant explained the services available to their returning soldiers -- job counseling, health care, therapy for post-traumatic stress -- the wives and mothers progressed from feeling very silly in the helmets to feeling very uncomfortable in them. 
 ''It's heavy,'' said Cathy Jefferson, whose husband, Tom, is finishing his second Iraq tour.
 ''Hot and sweaty,'' said Iris Walls, whose husband, Gregg, is completing his first.
 ''It makes your hair itchy,'' said Adriana Roldan, whose husband, John, is also coming to the end of a second tour.
 ''Yes, it is miserable,'' said Sergeant Hiller-Cousins, who knows firsthand, having herself done a tour of Iraq in 2004. ''You wear that helmet long enough, your neck will hurt. Your soldier's been wearing that helmet every day for the last year. That helmet was their life.''
 The sergeant's lesson in empathy was not over. She gave several of the women yellow roses, then told them those may be the only roses they receive for a while. ''Soldiers in a combat zone, they forget to be sensitive,'' the sergeant said. ''It doesn't mean they're crazy, it means they're stressed out. When they get back to normal, you'll get your roses. Until then, if you need roses, give yourself roses.''
 RETURNING soldiers will not be the only ones on edge. The last year has been long and exhausting for the families holding down the home front, often made tougher by the national economic collapse.
 Although, by law, Guard members are guaranteed their jobs back, that is little solace if their employer goes out of business. National Guard members come from all walks of life, from stockroom workers at the now defunct Circuit City to stock brokers at the now defunct Bear Stearns.
 The unemployment rate for combat veterans ages 18 to 25 in 2008 was 14.1 percent, compared with 11.6 for nonveterans that age, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Veronica Cobb's husband, Rahaman, is due home in a few weeks with no job to return to. ''We've got a mortgage, we've got four children, we're definitely concerned about him not having a job,'' said Mrs. Cobb, a bus driver. For 14 years, Mr. Cobb was a data operator for The Star-Ledger of Newark, but the paper downsized while he has been in Iraq. Mr. Cobb opted for a buyout, his wife said, because they feared he could lose his job in a subsequent layoff. He was going to leave the Guard, but if he cannot find work, he plans to re-enlist. ''I don't want that,'' Mrs. Cobb said. ''I need him home.''
 Mrs. Walls's real estate business has nearly ground to a halt, and because her husband, Gregg, an accountant, has been deployed, she cannot work the extra hours she would like, to make up some of that lost income. Thursday nights, he would watch their two young children so she could stay late at her Manhattan office. ''You might get a rental walk in off the street,'' she said. Sunday is the big day for open houses. ''I couldn't always get a sitter.'' 
 Their children, 4 and 7, are at the stage when they need a parent, she said. ''Even when I'm working, it's hard to focus, I'd always have to run back for them.''
 ''November to February was scary,'' Mrs. Walls said. ''I did almost no business.''
 During her husband's first tour, Mrs. Jefferson, an assistant school librarian and the mother of five, got all the bills paid. This time, she has e-mailed her husband letting him know she is behind on many. ''I didn't want him coming home and being surprised,'' she said.
 Jean Michele Moore's husband, Patrick, a construction company director, has spent the last 18 months away, first training at Fort Benning, Ga., then stationed in Iraq. Mrs. Moore has been balancing a demanding job as a sales trainer for a pharmaceutical company with caring for her stepson, Austin, 12, who has Asperger's syndrome.
 She had lived with Austin about a year when his father was mobilized. ''Suddenly, I was a single parent for a child not my own,'' she said.
 This is not an economy where people can afford to take their jobs lightly. ''I don't have the kind of job where it's O.K. to have a bad day,'' Mrs. Moore said. ''No matter how I feel, I have to be smiling.'' And smiling is not natural on those mornings when the baby sitter arrives at 6:30 to get Austin on the bus to his special needs school, so Mrs. Moore can race off to an early meeting.
 STILL, at a time when so many Americans have lost jobs, these families count themselves lucky. Their soldiers have served their country and provided a dependable income with generous government benefits in exchange for this year of living dangerously.
 While her husband has been in Iraq, Mrs. Roldan bought their first house, a three-bedroom, one-bath in Bergenfield for $240,000. They could afford it, she said, because the Department of Veterans Affairs gave them a 4.5 percent fixed-rate mortgage, with no closing costs and no down payment.
 Before being deployed, Mr. Roldan, a mechanic, worked a second job as a superintendent at a Cliffside Park building, which provided his family with a basement apartment, rent-free.
 After he left, Mrs. Roldan became the superintendent. ''I thought I'd just be taking out the trash and recycling,'' she said. If only. She has had to teach herself to snake out toilets and sinks. ''I wind up snaking something about once a month,'' she said. Twice, the 18-unit building lost heat last winter. She learned how to drain a boiler and change the valves. And while the second deployment has been harder -- in addition to Brandon, 6, the couple now have a second child, Samuel, 18 months -- Mrs. Roldan said: ''I'm stronger, I feel I can do anything that comes this way. I've changed.''
 Mrs. Moore recently bought a house that her husband has not yet seen. ''I've sent him pictures, that's it,'' she said. ''I knew what he wanted -- it's the right house at the right price. I'm not putting my life on hold because he's gone a year and a half. It's not fair to me, not fair to Austin.''
 Mrs. Moore and her stepson have grown closer in their time alone together. With her help, he earned his Tenderfoot badge in Boy Scout Troop 77 in Westfield. ''It took him a little longer than most kids, but he can't wait to tell his dad,'' she said. To help Austin understand when his dad will return, she made a paper chain with 52 links. Each week, they rip one off, Austin writes a short note and they mail it to Iraq. ''Austin's not a great communicator, if he says 'tomato paste,' it's a big deal,'' she said. ''This is a way for him to send something to his dad.'' She keeps that chain in the dining room and they're both focused on how short it is getting. ''We don't have to talk about it, Austin sees his dad will be home soon.''
 THE happiest man at the Teaneck Armory may be Staff Sgt. Steve Lawrence, a National Guard recruiter. In 2008, he was tops in the state, putting in 30 recruits. As the economy fell into recession last year, he had people come in he had never seen in his four and a half years recruiting. ''I had a couple of real estate brokers,'' he said. ''That was new -- surprised me.''
 Sergeant Lawrence says the biggest reason people give him for signing up is education benefits: The Guard pays full tuition for any New Jersey state college.
 A very bad economy is very good for military recruiting. The national strength of the Guard is currently 358,000, 10,000 ahead of its goal. New Jersey currently has 6,230 in the Guard, against a goal of 5,990.
 As a result, the military is cutting signing bonuses and making it tougher to enlist. In the last few months, the National Guard has lowered the maximum age of eligibility to 35 from 42; raised the qualifying test score on the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery to 50 out of 100, from 31; and stopped taking anyone convicted of a felony, as well as most with misdemeanors, according to Sergeant Lawrence. ''The Guard will have a better quality of soldier,'' he said.
 Retention is up, too. For the first six months of this fiscal year, the state goal was to get 354 Guard members to sign for another tour; 433 have.
 So retention bonuses have been slashed. Until recently, the Guard paid a $15,000 bonus if a soldier re-enlisted for six years and $7,500 for three years; now it is $5,000 for six years and no bonus for three.
 Recruiters' quotas have dropped, to one per month from 1.75.
 ''The last six months, people were realizing the military has a lot to offer,'' said Lt. Col. John Sheard, the state recruiting commander. ''The economy is absolutely a factor. One of the building blocks. Like I tell people, I get my check every month on the 15th and 30th.''
 ABOUT 30 percent of this deployment is on its second tour, and the consensus among family members, state officials and soldiers stateside is that, to date, this has been a less dangerous, less stressful deployment. It appears that as announced at the outset, most of the soldiers have spent their time running Camp Bucca, a prison in southern Iraq.
 Still, family members are holding tight as they come down the homestretch. ''You never know about a suicide bomber or some inmate causing bodily harm,'' Mrs. Jefferson said.
 Each night, when Mrs. Roldan puts her 6-year-old to bed, they pray for a safe return. ''We pray for John in Spanish, I say it and Brandon mumbles with me.''
 Those who are doing this a second time, like Mrs. Jefferson, have tried to learn from their mistakes. When her husband got off the plane after his first tour, he greeted the family, but then she was hurt when he drifted back to his military buddies. ''The soldiers congregated in little groups, ignoring us,'' she recalled.
 ''This time, I have different expectations,'' she said. ''I understand he's been with these people for a year, that's what he's used to. Change takes time.''
 A few weeks ago, Mrs. Roldan felt sure she had come to her bitter end. In the span of a month, her mother suffered what was apparently a stroke, her husband's father had heart surgery and she was trying to buy a home herself, dragging two little boys from open house to open house. ''It was late, and I sat at the computer and I wrote John a long e-mail,'' she said. ''I wrote and wrote. I wrote everything I was upset about. I couldn't take it any more. I said, 'I can't believe I'm going through this by myself, I can't believe you did this to me.' I was crying, I was angry.''
 Then she deleted it and went to bed.
 ''I am done, I am so done,'' Mrs. Walls said. ''I'm always feeling frazzled and angry and like I want to kill somebody.'' In July, after her husband has been home a month, Mrs. Walls has planned a vacation to Miami -- with her girlfriend. ''I need me time. All I want to do is breathe and not be juggling all the time. I want to run again, go to the gym. My eating habits have been bad. A lot of stress puts on the pounds. I feel ugly, horrible.''
 Mrs. Roldan has planned a weekend trip to Atlantic City for July with two girlfriends who also have husbands deployed. ''We're not taking cellphones,'' she said. ''We want them to see what it was like. If they have trouble with the kids, they can fix it.''
 Even so, they cannot wait for those soldiers. ''Looking forward to it?'' Mrs. Jefferson said. ''Yes, I truly am.''
 ''Miss him so much,'' Mrs. Walls said.
 ''We need him so bad,'' Mrs. Roldan said.
 Mrs. Moore can see it clearly: ''I just want to sit with him on the porch and have a glass of lemonade -- actually, maybe a glass of wine.''

 SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL ARTS FESTIVAL May 20-31. This multidisciplinary festival lost a sizable chunk of financial support from the city this year, so the sixth annual event was cut to two weeks from three. Still, a lot of innovation is packed into a short period. Theater highlights include the Cho-In Theater of Seoul, South Korea, presenting ''The Angel & the Woodcutter,'' a wordless adaptation of a traditional Korean folk tale, and ''Gobo.Digital Glossary,'' a surreal take on the Everyman story by the AKHE Group of St. Petersburg, Russia.

The Musical Theater Conference will offer ''Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' with a book, music and lyrics by Daniel Zaitchik, and ''Tales of the City,'' based on the novels of Armistead Maupin, with a book by Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and music and lyrics by Jason Sellards, a founding member of the band Scissor Sisters. John Garden, who has performed with Scissor Sisters, is collaborating on the music. The annual puppetry and cabaret and performance conferences are also on the list. (860) 443-1238, theoneill.org.
 GOODSPEED MUSICALS In addition to revivals of two big, traditional musicals at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam -- ''42nd Street'' (through June 28) and ''Camelot'' (July 10-Sept. 19) -- the company will offer a new-ish show at the nearby Norma Terris Theater in Chester. ''Lucky Guy'' (Tuesday through June 14), about dreamers and schemers in the Nashville country music business, has a book, music and lyrics by Willard Beckham. The show was presented 10 years ago at the American Stage Company in New Jersey and at a few other places before and since, but it has been revamped for this developmental production. Warren Carlyle (''A Tale of Two Cities'') is the director. (860) 873-8668, goodspeed.org.
 INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS AND IDEAS New Haven, June 13-27. The Katona Jozsef Theater Company's production of ''Ivanov'' (June 24-27), Chekhov's classic drama about a self-absorbed and self-loathing Russian landowner, will be one draw at this annual multidisciplinary festival. The company, from Budapest, will then take the production to the Lincoln Center Festival in New York (see below). Other works include ''First Love,'' an adaptation of the novella by Samuel Beckett, presented by the Gare St. Lazare Players Ireland. (888) 736-2663, artidea.org.
 SHAKESPEARE ON THE SOUND Norwalk. Shakespeare summer theater can be both traditional and innovative: the newly appointed artistic director in Norwalk, Joanna Settle, has drafted Stew, of ''Passing Strange'' fame, to create an original score for her site-specific ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' her first production for the company. The show, with a multicultural cast, will play both Pinkey Park in Rowayton (June 16-28) and Baldwin Park in Greenwich (July 4-12). (203) 299-1300, shakespeareonthesound.org. 
 WESTPORT COUNTRY PLAYHOUSE Mark Lamos, Westport's new artistic director, is overseeing his first season, though this summer's productions were chosen before he took the post. Coming up: the A. R. Gurney play ''Children'' (May 26-June 13), Jonathan Larson's ''Tick, Tick...Boom!'' (June 23-July 18) and the Alan Ayckbourn comedy ''How the Other Half Loves'' (July 28-Aug. 15).

 District of Columbia
 CAPITAL FRINGE FESTIVAL July 9-26. This diverse mix of theater, dance, clowning, mime and other art forms that haven't even been named yet will take over downtown Washington. More than 100 performing-arts groups are expected to present their wares in more than a dozen locations. (866) 811-4111, capfringe.org.
 KENNEDY CENTER Two recent Broadway musicals -- ''The Color Purple'' (June 30-Aug. 9) and ''Spring Awakening'' (July 7-Aug. 2) -- are on the schedule, but anyone seeking something different in Washington might also consider another Kennedy Center show. The popular Washington-based Synetic Theater will present the fourth installment in its Silent Shakespeare series of wordless adaptations, in this case ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (May 28-June 14). (202) 467-4600, kennedy-center.org.
 Georgia
 GEORGIA SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Atlanta. Don't expect an entirely reverent season here: ''MacHomer'' (Aug. 26-30) is a solo show created and performed by Rick Miller in which he impersonates the cast of the television show ''The Simpsons'' as if they are playing parts in ''Macbeth.'' The rotating repertory season is a tad more traditional: ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (June 10-July 31), ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (June 25-Aug. 1) and ''Titus Andronicus'' (July 9-Aug. 2). (404) 264-0020, gashakespeare.org.
 Idaho
 IDAHO SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Boise, June 5-Oct. 3. It might not be out of the question for a deer or goose to amble across the stage of the festival's amphitheater, since the 760-seat outdoor arena is nestled in a nature reserve. Those who surely will trod the boards include the casts of ''The Comedy of Errors,'' ''The Seagull,'' ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood,'' ''Twelfth Night'' and ''A Tuna Christmas.'' (208) 336-9221, idahoshakespeare.org.
 Illinois
 STEPPENWOLF THEATER COMPANY Chicago.

Steppenwolf will also offer ''First Look 101,'' an opportunity for 101 participants to spend 10 weeks (June 1-Aug. 9) behind the scenes, observing the process of developing a new play from first rehearsal to last performance. In the Downstairs Theater, Anna D. Shapiro (who won a Tony Award for directing ''August: Osage County'') will direct Bridget Carpenter's ''Up'' (June 18-Aug. 23), about a man who once was able to fly by attaching balloons to his lawn chair and has ever since tried to recapture the buzz of rising to those heights. (312) 335-1650, steppenwolf.org. 
 Kentucky
 MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME STATE PARK AMPHITHEATER Bardstown. Another summer in Bardstown means another production (the 51st) of ''Stephen Foster -- The Musical'' (June 6-Aug. 14), a boisterous celebration of the music of Foster, who wrote ''Camptown Races'' and ''My Old Kentucky Home.''

 Massachusetts
 BERKSHIRE THEATER FESTIVAL Stockbridge, May 21-Dec. 30. Ibsen is probably not the first playwright who springs to mind when people think of summer theater in the Berkshires, but ''Ghosts'' (Aug. 11-29), starring Randy Harrison (''Queer as Folk'') as Oswald, is one of the bold choices at this festival. In addition to four productions on the main stage, another four are scheduled for the Unicorn Theater. (413) 298-5576, berkshiretheatre.org. 
 CAPE PLAYHOUSE Dennis. This Cape Cod theater once provided summer stomping grounds for the likes of Shirley Booth and Tallulah Bankhead and still regularly draws Broadway types; Gary Beach, Malcolm Gets and Hunter Foster are among those expected to make the trip this year.

Johanna Day, currently appearing on Broadway in ''August: Osage County,'' will play the mother. (508) 696-6300, vineyardplayhouse.org.
 WELLFLEET HARBOR ACTORS THEATER May 20-Oct. 4. Increased programming to celebrate this theater's 25th anniversary means plenty of shows and special events are lined up on the two stages -- the Harbor and the Julie Harris -- into the fall and beyond. The focus this summer is on comedy, including Michael Frayn's ''Noises Off'' (July 1-Aug. 1) and ''The Little Dog Laughed'' by Douglas Carter Beane (Aug. 6-Sept. 5). (508) 349-9428, what.org.
 WILLIAMSTOWN THEATER FESTIVAL July 1-Aug. 24. There are always plenty of highlights here, but the actor brothers Nate (''United States of Tara'') and Rob (''The Daily Show'') Corddry, appearing as Sam Shepard's messed-up siblings in ''True West'' (July 15-26), is one intriguing option. Also on the main stage: ''Children'' (July 1-12) by A. R. Gurney; ''The Torch-Bearers'' (July 29-Aug. 9) by George Kelly, starring Marian Seldes; and Simon Gray's ''Quartermaine's Terms'' (Aug. 12-23), directed by Maria Aitken (''The 39 Steps'').

 Minnesota
 GUTHRIE THEATER As part of its festival honoring the playwright Tony Kushner, the Guthrie is presenting several theatrical events as well as a number of ancillary programs. (Festivities began on April 18 and continue through June 28.) The centerpiece is Mr. Kushner's newest play, commissioned by the Guthrie, ''The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism With a Key to the Scriptures,'' which the writer said was initially sparked by a book he found several years ago in his grandmother's home in Louisiana after she died: ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism, Capitalism, Sovietism and Fascism'' by George Bernard Shaw (through June 28). There is also a revival of the 2003 show ''Caroline, or Change,'' with music by Jeanine Tesori and book and lyrics by Mr. Kushner (through June 21) and ''Tiny Kushner: An Evening of Short Plays'' (through June 7).

 New York City
 59E59 THEATERS Like a microcosm of the larger city, this Midtown theater will have a summerlong series of festivals of its own, starting with Americas Off Broadway (through July 3), a selection of productions that focus on aspects of the past, present and future American experience. The East to Edinburgh Festival follows (July 14-Aug. 2), an annual early look at shows headed to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, and after that comes another annual ritual, Summer Shorts (July 24-Aug. 29), this time including ''The Killing,'' an unproduced play by William Inge. And finally: the second annual 1st Irish Festival (Aug. 26-Oct. 11), produced by the Origin Theater Company, which will offer a number of works at 59E59 Theaters as it sprawls to various city sites in a celebration of Irish culture and theater. (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org.
 THE ANTIDEPRESSANT FESTIVAL Williamsburg, Brooklyn, June 5-July 4. No one tops the Brick Theater when it comes to oddball concepts for theater festivals. (Recent examples include the $ellout Festival and the Pretentious Festival.) This summer's fiesta is meant as a diversion at a time of plummeting stocks and rising unemployment. Nineteen productions are planned, including ''Exit, Pursued by Bears,'' about the fictional vice president of a Chicago sanitation union who leads a double life as Tickle Bear, the center of an anonymous online furry sex community; and ''Schaden, Freude and You: A 3 Clown Seminar,'' which provides the audience with a chance to laugh at others as a means of fighting depression. In this case the ''others'' are clowns, so they're used to it. For more extroverted types, the Brick is including ''Suspicious Package: Rx,'' a sequel to last year's ''Suspicious Package,'' an interactive theater piece that put audience members, each wearing a Zune media player, into the middle of a film-noir-type mystery. This year a trip to the future is in store. (212) 352-3101, bricktheater.com.
 DELACORTE THEATER Central Park. It's nearly time for the long lines, big names and free tickets that mark the Public Theater's annual plays in the park. First up is ''Twelfth Night,'' starring Anne Hathaway as the cross-dressing Viola (June 10-July 12). Daniel Sullivan will direct a cast that also includes Julie White, Audra McDonald, Raul Esparza, Hamish Linklater and Stark Sands. Next comes ''The Bacchae,'' a version of the Euripides tale directed by JoAnne Akalaitis, with music by Philip Glass (Aug. 11-30). Meanwhile, at the Public's East Village home, things look busy: ''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson: The Concert Version'' by Alex Timbers (through May 24) and ''Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 8 and 9)'' by Suzan-Lori Parks (June 5-28) are on tap as part of the new Public Lab series. In addition the theater will play host to David Hare (''Stuff Happens'') for an evening of monologues: one, ''Berlin,'' concerns a wall coming down in Germany, while the other, ''Wall,'' is about a wall going up in Israel. ''Berlin/Wall'' (Thursday through next Sunday) is directed by Stephen Daldry (''Billy Elliot''). (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org.
 ENCORES! SUMMER STARS June 12-July 3. Fans of New York City Center's popular Encores! concert musicals will be off to see ''The Wiz'' in the series's annual summer production that involves a more fully staged effort than a standard Encores! event. The all-black rock-musical adaptation of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' by L. Frank Baum opened on Broadway in 1975, won seven Tony Awards and ran for 1,672 performances. The director Thomas Kail, the choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler and the musical director Alex Lacamoire will team up, as they most recently did for ''In the Heights,'' while the R&B singer Ashanti will make her theatrical stage debut in the role of Dorothy. (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org.
 ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2009, May 22-June 27. This year's version of the venerable series of new one-act plays involves 10 works in two evenings and includes plays by Leslie Ayvazian (''Nine Armenians'') and Kia Corthron (''Force Continuum''). (212) 352-3101, ensemblestudiotheatre.org.

(hudsonwarehouse.net). 
 INWOOD SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Now that you've decided you like the outdoor Shakespeare experience, a bit farther north you can check out part of the 10th summer season of the Moose Hall Theater Company, which is presenting Shakespeare's ''Merchant of Venice'' (June 3-20) at the Inwood Hill Park Peninsula. And, to shake things up, Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' (July 15-Aug. 1). (212) 567-5255, moosehallisf.org.
 LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL July 7-26.

The production, commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, will be presented at the BAM Harvey Theater. (718) 636-4100, muslimvoicesfestival.org.

 PLANET CONNECTIONS THEATER FESTIVITY June 9-28. Expect to see recycling bins, reusable tickets and organic wine in the lounge when this new, eco-friendly festival makes its debut with the intention of fostering social awareness. Each of the more than 30 productions will be set up to benefit a particular nonprofit organization by donating a percentage of proceeds, soliciting volunteers or otherwise supporting the organization. The ideas behind the comedies, dramas and musicals range from the overtly political, like ''The Katrina Project: Hell and High Water,'' based on interviews with the hurricane's survivors, to lighter fare, like ''Suckers,'' about a group of vampires. (The latter benefits the Red Cross Blood Bank of course.) (212) 352-3101, planetconnectionsfestivity.com.
 POTOMAC THEATER PROJECT June 30-July 26. The annual summer mini-fest from this politically minded company, which transplanted itself to New York in 2007 after 20 years in the Washington area, will include ''The Europeans,'' by Howard Barker, directed by Richard Romagnoli, and ''Therese Raquin,'' Neal Bell's adaptation of the Zola novel, directed by Jim Petosa.

Lord) will be part of the group's annual celebration of work by emerging writers. (212) 279-4040, spfnyc.com.
 SUMMERWORKS TriBeCa, June 3-27. It is safe to assume that Clubbed Thumb will offer unusual fare in an annual event that in past years has presented works by inventive writers like Jordan Harrison, Sheila Callaghan and Ann Marie Healy. Coming up: ''punkplay,'' by Gregory Moss, about a suburban teenager who joins a runaway and tries to change his life through punk rock music; ''Precious Little,'' by Madeleine George, about a pregnant professor who learns her child may have abnormalities and finds comfort in the gorilla cage at the zoo; and Kristin Newbom's ''Telethon,'' about the familial bonds among the staff and residents of a group home for the disabled. (212) 352-3101, (clubbedthumb.org).
 UPTOWN SERIES Two plays written and directed by women will make up the season at Second Stage Theater's annual festival devoted to emerging writers.

Three shows will run in rotation: ''The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged),'' ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and ''Pericles.'' (845) 265-9575, hvshakespeare.org.

(252) 473-3414, thelostcolony.org. 
 Oregon
 OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Ashland, through Nov. 1. Shakespeare is naturally the biggest star at Ashland, not only as a playwright this year -- ''Macbeth,'' ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and others -- but as a character too. ''Equivocation,'' by Bill Cain, is a political thriller in which Robert Cecil, the first Earl of Salisbury, commissions Shakespeare to write a play about the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, at the same time warning him to portray King James I in a good light. (541) 482-4331, osfashland.org. 
 Pennsylvania
 PHILADELPHIA LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE Philadelphia, Sept. 4-19. More than 100 artists of all stripes will participate in this wide-ranging annual festival.

 AMERICAN SHAKESPEARE CENTER Staunton. In January this Shenandoah Valley theater was in tough financial straits, but a fund-raising drive brought in more than $250,000 to help it keep going. And ''going'' means presenting plays 52 weeks a year in the Blackfriars Playhouse, a 300-seater modeled after the winter home of Shakespeare's company, the King's Men. This summer: ''Much Ado About Nothing'' (June 17-Aug. 28), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (June 18-Aug. 29) and ''Titus Andronicus'' (July 12-Aug. 30). Anyone visiting before mid-June can catch ''The Comedy of Errors'' (through June 14) or a pair of shows that go well together: ''Hamlet'' and Tom Stoppard's ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' (both through June 13). (877) 682-4236, ASCStaunton.com.
 Wisconsin
 AMERICAN PLAYERS THEATER Spring Green, June 6-Oct. 4. The Madison Repertory Theater closed in March, a casualty of the weak economy, but 40 miles away in Spring Green, the American Players Theater is offering the repertory subscribers free seats at some productions this summer. And the surviving theater is not shrinking this year but expanding: The new, 200-seat, indoor Touchstone Theater will offer ''In Acting Shakespeare'' by James DeVita, ''Old Times'' by Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' in rotation. Outside, at the 1,148-seat theater known simply as Up the Hill, five productions will take turns: ''The Comedy of Errors,'' ''The Winter's Tale'' and ''Henry V'' by Shakespeare; ''The Philanderer'' by George Bernard Shaw; and ''Hay Fever'' by Noel Coward.

 LUMINATO Toronto, June 5-14. Toronto will be busy with theater, dance, music and film when this multidisciplinary festival takes over stages and streets for the third year, its hub at the Yonge-Dundas Square in the heart of downtown. Theater highlights include the Builders' Association's ''Continuous City'' and ''Nevermore,'' a dreamlike piece from the Catalyst Theater in Edmonton, that uses movement and music to delve into what must have been a frightful place: the mind of the tormented genius Edgar Allan Poe. The biggest event, and certainly the longest, is the North American premiere of ''Lipsynch,'' the latest creation of the director and theatrical everyman Robert Lepage, which clocks in at nine hours. Mr. Lepage tells nine stories in that time, each exploring the sound and range of the human voice. (416) 872-1111, luminato.com. 
 SHAW FESTIVAL Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, through Nov. 1. Noel Coward is probably best known for his full-length comedies, like ''Blithe Spirit,'' currently being revived on Broadway, but he was a miniaturist as well. ''Tonight at 8:30,'' his series of 10 short plays, will take over all three stages at this Ontario festival devoted to George Bernard Shaw. Of course a couple of Shaw plays are planned too, as well as several other productions, among them Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten'' and Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's ''Sunday in the Park With George.'' (800) 511-7429, shawfest.com. 
 STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE FESTIVALOntario, through Nov. 1.

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IN September, New Yorkers will celebrate the quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's voyage, and if you ever wondered what Hudson encountered when he arrived, you can turn for answers to Eric W. Sanderson, who reimagines 1609 Manhattan in stunning and exuberant detail.
 Mr. Sanderson, a senior ecologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, has painstakingly produced an ambitious work titled ''Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City'' (Abrams, $40) with vivid illustrations by Markley Boyer. 
 Drawing on 18th-century British military maps, Mr. Sanderson has recreated what F. Scott Fitzgerald called the ''fresh, green breast of the New World'' that greeted Dutch sailors on Hudson's Half Moon and what Mr. Sanderson describes as ''the old-growth forests, stately wetlands, glittering streams, teeming waters, rolling hills, abundant wildlife and mysterious people.''
 Most of those rolling hills (Mannahatta in an American Indian dialect meant ''island of many hills'') were obliterated when the street grid was superimposed in the 19th century. 
 Mr. Sanderson's book, published in conjunction with a companion exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York, reveals that Mannahatta had more ecological diversity per acre than Yellowstone National Park, more native plant species than Yosemite and more species of birds than the Great Smokies. 
 ''If Mannahatta existed today as it did then,'' he concludes, ''it would be a national park.'' 
 After reading ''The Hudson-Fulton Celebration: New York's River Festival of 1909 and the Making of a Metropolis'' (Fordham University Press, $39.95) by Kathleen Eagen Johnson, you'll be sorry you missed the tercentennial. On that occasion, the city and state produced an extravaganza that remains unrivaled in New York's historic commemorations.
 As Kenneth T. Jackson reminds us in the foreword, New Yorkers ''felt overshadowed by their presumably more historic and sophisticated rivals to the north and south.'' And on this occasion, they sought reassurance about both their own evolution and its role in their ascendancy as the nation's economic, political and cultural capital. 
 Anyone who questions the value of a good Catholic school education must read Patrick J. McCloskey's ''The Street Stops Here: A Year at a Catholic High School in Harlem'' (University of California Press, $27.50). Mr. McCloskey's heartfelt eyewitness account of his year at Rice High School is accompanied by keen analysis that echoes the conclusions of academic experts.
 ''All students, regardless of their ethnic background, social class, family problems, or future plans and regardless of their scholastic level entering high school, are taught basically in the same way,'' Mr. McCloskey writes. 
 Several books, including one by Jimmy Breslin, have been written on the Mafia cops case: the story of two city detectives who in 2005 were charged with being in league with mob hit men and committing two murders themselves. If you're still looking for even more detail, ''Friends of the Family'' (William Morrow, $26.99) by Tommy Dades and Michael Vecchione with David Fisher promises ''The Inside Story of the Mafia Cops Case,'' as the subtitle puts it. (Mr. Vecchione heads the investigations division for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes; Mr. Dades is a former detective who worked on the case).
 Some questions are still being pondered, though, including one posed by the authors themselves. ''Even after the whole thing was done and the Mafia cops had been put in a cell to rot forever,'' they write, ''there was still one question that never got answered: At the beginning, were these guys killers who became cops or were they cops who became killers?''
 Joey Gallo died at 43, though not before leaving an indelible imprint both on New York and on American culture. In ''The Mad Ones: Crazy Joe Gallo and the Revolution at the Edge of the Underworld'' (Weinstein Books, $24.95), Tom Folsom deftly evokes a wacky world populated by the sort of characters celebrated by Jack Kerouac.
 ''The only people for me are the mad ones,'' Kerouac once wrote, ''the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn.'' 
 Mr. Gallo fit the definition, and Mr. Folsom, who in an earlier book creditably re-created the world of the drug dealer Nicky Barnes, does the same for a man mythologized by cultural trailblazers from Bob Dylan to Gay Talese. 
 These days, the title ''The Jews of Sing Sing: Gotham, Gangsters and Gonuvim'' (Barricade Books, $22.95) might suggest a slim monograph rather than a full-length book. But Ron Arons, whose great-grandfather had been imprisoned there, provides a welcome reminder that no ethnic or racial group has a monopoly on crime. Mr. Arons writes that while Jewish community leaders disputed the extent of crimes by Jews in the early 1900s, the organizations they formed to combat that crime were highly successful. 
 In the title of his new biography, Paul David Pope describes his father and grandfather as ''Unreasonable Men'' (Barricade Books, $25). Nobody would dispute either that characterization or that both were larger than life. 
 The ambitious subtitle is ''A Father and Son Who Changed America, the Birth of the National Enquirer,'' and the stories about Generoso Pope and his son Gene, as the author writes, ''encompass immigration, ambition, wealth power, ruthlessness, crime, punishment, betrayal and redemption. 
 ''They involve organized crime and its role in my grandfather and father's climb to riches and power, as well as mayors, governors and presidents,'' he continues, ''and [provide] a fascinating look into the corruption that fueled New York City politics for so many decades.''
 Few cities offer as much food for thought as New York. Now comes ''Gastropolis: Food and New York City'' (Columbia University Press, $29.95). The work, edited by Annie Hauck-Lawson and Jonathan Deutsch, two City University professors, is a veritable feast. 
 ''New Yorkers have formed relationships with food that have helped shape the identity of their great city,'' they write. ''Whether you find yourself extracting the last slurp from the paper cup at the Lemon Ice King in Corona, eating fiery Jamaican jerk chicken fresh off the oil-drum grills at Badoo's in Flatbush or enjoying a cool ocean breeze with a Nathan's hot dog in hand on the Coney Island boardwalk, New York City allows the edible sensibility of traveling the world.'' 
 This is one book you can tell by its cover: a delightful illustration by Monica Gurevich of a city where you can eat your heart out.
 ''Walking the streets of New York City, you constantly come face to face with history,'' Michelle Nevius and James Nevius write in ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'' (Free Press, $16.95). 
 Even many native New Yorkers, and certainly out-of-towners, know less than you'd imagine about the city's history. This book, which includes 14 walking tours, is for them; it's a smart and entertaining window on the city of the past. It's Manhattancentric, but here's hoping for more on the other boroughs. More maps and addresses would be welcome, too.
 ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt'' by T. J. Stiles (Knopf, $37.50,) has been widely praised, and rightly so. 
 Vanderbilt, who founded the New York Central Rail Road, was instrumental in putting the ''empire'' in Empire State. His statue still stands at the onetime gate to the city, gazing down on Park Avenue from Grand Central Terminal. 
 ''It is fitting that he should stand guard over the infrastructure he created,'' Mr. Stiles writes in this epic biography, ''more grand and more central than it was even in his own time, so vitally important to the city that rose to greatness under his influence.''

HEADLINE: The Editors of Summer

BYLINE: By CAROLINE H. DWORIN

 BODY:
TEN days ago, in the North Meadow of Central Park, a lithe 28-year-old named Eben Kaplan stepped up to the plate for the opening game of the season for The Paris Review. At 5:30 that Thursday afternoon, 13 team members were on hand to play (and a couple more, from the magazine's airy office in a TriBeCa loft, to cheer).
 They came on this cold, sunless day to challenge the DC Comics, the home team, thanks to its possession of a coveted, season-long permit to play softball on the field.
 Mr. Kaplan, a former manuscript reader for the review, who is now a Web editor for the Council on Foreign Relations, hit a lead-off home run. Light-footed and with exceptional speed, he rounded the bases like a greyhound after a hare. A cheer went up from the bench, occupied by just a couple of the magazine's staff members but many of its alumni. 
 ''Well,'' murmured Mr. Kaplan's teammate, Josh Pashman, a ghostwriter and poker player, who was working on an interview for the magazine. ''It's all downhill from here.'' 
 As it turned out, it was just the start. The team scored five runs in the top of the first, at which point the band arrived, in the form of Chris Carroll, wearing a hooded sweatshirt.
 Mr. Carroll, a dark-haired, rosy-cheeked former Paris Review intern and now an editorial assistant at Lapham's Quarterly, removed a silver-plated trumpet from a soft leather case and oiled the valves. Suddenly -- flawlessly -- he shook the ball fields of Central Park with the galloping cavalry charge from the ''William Tell'' Overture, as players on the adjoining field turned and stared. 
 ''Rossini,'' Mr. Carroll said, smiling slightly. ''But I always knew it from the Bugs Bunny cartoons.''
 Each spring for at least three decades, starting in late April or early May, media softball with all its pranks and rivalries returns to the diamonds of Central Park. The undertaking involves dozens of players, largely in their 20s, 30s and 40s. 
 And this season, coming as it does on the heels of possibly the worst year in memory for the publishing industry, the idea of repairing from the office to the green of the park seems especially appealing. 
 Over the past year, caught between an ailing economy and the struggle of print publications in an increasingly digital age, one after another title has trimmed its sails, migrated to the Web or closed up shop entirely. The shock has been felt especially in New York, home to so many publications and to so many who read them or work for them. And the body count continues to rise, with the attendant impact on the softball season.
 February brought the folding of Trader Monthly, a magazine for the financial community, whose team planned to play this year. On April 30, Conde Nast announced the closing of Portfolio, its glossy business monthly, laying off more than 80 people. It had planned to play the New Yorker on June 16.
 Adam Spangler, a 6-foot-3 31-year-old who runs a Web site dedicated to soccer, suspects he will miss the physical activity as much as the work. Last year, Mr. Spangler played many positions for the Vanity Fair team, but in September he left to take a job as an editor at Men's Journal. Just a few months later, he was laid off, along with several other editors. 
 ''I most definitely miss it,'' Mr. Spangler said of the Vanity Fair team, which recently expanded to include members of the advertising department. ''If they'll have me, I'll play this year. But I heard just yesterday they had a record turnout of people who wanted to play.'' 
 Some potential players may also have their eye on another ball of sorts.
 ''You'd expect there to be a lot of networking in our games,'' said Matthew Pressman, an editorial associate of Vanity Fair, who started coaching his magazine's team last season. ''There's not been a lot. But I wouldn't be surprised, with the Damocles of layoffs now hanging over us, I'm sure there'll be some trying to win favor of prospective new employers.'' 
 Matt Dellinger, a former multimedia editor for The New Yorker, coached his first season in 1999, a challenging time for the magazine. The staff was still adjusting to the shift to the sleek Conde Nast tower in the heart of Times Square, having left their rambling old offices on West 43rd Street.
 ''That had its own effect on morale,'' Mr. Dellinger said. ''People were sad to leave the old building, but softball made a nice pick-me-up. It created a sense of fun.'' Post-game drinks are often consumed at Tap a Keg, on Broadway near 105th Street, an easy walk from the park, and a location that permits pizza delivery. 
 To play a game on a field in one of the city's parks, a team needs only enough bodies, a ball and a permit from the parks department. These permits, which allow a team to play from mid-April to mid-September, are only $16 for a two-hour game. But there is a certain amount of competition for fields and time slots, and preference goes to previous permit holders and youth organizations.
 ''It's a very tricky process to get these permits,'' said Nathaniel Rich, coach, outfielder and senior editor for The Paris Review, a team without a permit. ''And once you have one, you're kind of locked in for life.'' 
 There are a lot of theories about how a team gets a permit, Mr. Rich added, ''but I haven't been able to crack it.'' As a result, itinerant teams eager to play must call around to those teams with permits and offer to challenge them. 
 Some teams, efficiently organized into leagues, schedule full seasons, bringing athleticism and seriousness to each game. 
 Others take a very different approach. In the past, The Paris Review has entrusted one of its interns with the responsibility of dressing as the team's mascot, the hadada bird, to run around flapping and squawking to heckle the other team. 
 Many publications encourage a friendly, beery, disorganized melange of editorial and advertising staffers to participate along with interns, friends of interns and the occasional offspring. Some call these folk alumni -- others call them ringers -- but in any case they possess a tight and enduring connection to the squad.
 ''Mark Singer has three sons,'' said Mr. Dellinger, referring to one of the staff writers at the magazine. ''They're all good. But Jeb, his oldest, has this amazing arm. You put him in center field, and he can catch a one-hop fly ball and gun it to home plate.'' 
 Mr. Dellinger has recollections of Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, turning out at East River Park back in 1999 to play second base for his publication. A few years later, he watched George Plimpton, the lanky patrician of literature and sport, who co-founded The Paris Review in 1953, pitch wearing a pair of shorts. 
 ''He brought out a bottle of Dewar's right after a game,'' Mr. Dellinger recalled. ''And I'd found a martini kit at a garage sale, and mixed up some martinis.''
 Many news organizations have fielded teams for years. Brian Lehrer, first baseman and the host of ''The Brian Lehrer Show,'' coaches the team for WNYC, the city's public radio station, where he has worked and played ball for 20 years, and he remembers great rivalries within the city's public broadcasting landscape. 
 ''It was WNYC versus Channel 13, and we used to play for a cup,'' Mr. Lehrer said. He also described a more literal transformation of the media softball landscape.
 ''During the bad old days of the Great Lawn Dust Bowl,'' he said, ''you were literally taking your life in your hands, playing on an outfield like a moonscape, where there were unpredictable divots and ridges anywhere you might turn, and not a blade of infield grass to be found. 
 ''But it didn't matter,'' he added. ''Because we loved softball.''
 Teams with permits can play whomever they want, especially if someone finds a particular matchup amusing. Once, said Mr. Dellinger, who said he has been referred to as the ''Vince Lombardi of magazine softball,'' The New Yorker magazine challenged the New Yorker Hotel to a game. Though the hotel, a sprawling Art Deco structure on Eighth Avenue and 34th Street, has no connection with the publication, it is sometimes confused with its headquarters. 
 ''We thought it would just be, 'Oh, ha-ha, fun game,' '' Mr. Dellinger said. ''But it was all these maintenance guys who played in serious leagues in Queens.'' 
 The hotel's employees took up the challenge with an unexpected intensity, and decimated the magazine team, leaving it, despite its loss, with a sparkly red trophy made to commemorate the event. 
 A curiosity of media softball is the on-the-field prowess of High Times, given that the publication is dedicated to the appreciation of marijuana.
 Since its founding in 1991, the team, known as the Bong-hitters, has been both feared and lionized. And while many teams yearn to beat The New Yorker simply because it is The New Yorker, many also cower at what Steve Bloom, the former editor of High Times, refers to as ''the legend of the Bong-hitters.''
 ''We had a 29-game undefeated streak in the early 2000s,'' said Mr. Bloom, who now runs a Web site called CelebStoner.com. ''High Times was once a pretty wacky team. When we played The New Yorker for our very first game, our mascot, Dready Duck, took the first pitch from Roger Angell. He threw a very high pitch, and Dready Duck spun around three times and missed.'' 
 Three years ago, tired of shenanigans, teams without umpires and the disorder of 30-man line-ups, Mr. Bloom formed the New York Media Softball League. The organization, whose six teams represent just a fraction of media teams, promised to abide by certain rules, including the requirement that each obtain its own permit, use an umpire for all games, and include in their rosters at least two women. 
 Members of the league include High Times, BusinessWeek, WNYC, The Wall Street Journal, DC Comics and The Daily Beast, the Web site founded by Tina Brown, which, at the last minute replaced the shuttered Trader Monthly but is coached by the magazine's former editor, who now works at the Web site. 
 One other rule: No ringers allowed. ''You bring in a friend or two, that's O.K.,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''But you can't cherry-pick.''
 On a warm Monday evening a couple of weeks ago, the WNYC Independents were on field No. 10 for their first practice of the season. The players wore T-shirts in the station colors of red, black and white, with four smart red baseballs across the front containing the letters WNYC. 
 Their numbers included the newscaster Lance Lucky and John Schaffer, host of the programs ''New Sounds'' and ''Soundcheck.'' They played until the setting sun cut a vivid green swath across the park, and when they were finished, they sat on the grass, laughing and knocking sand from their shoes.
 In the next field over, another team kept going even as the light faded. 
 A new moon appeared like a thumbnail. In the dusk, on the field next door, half a dozen wild-haired, lean-limbed college-age men and one woman, all dressed in shabby shorts and T-shirts, played as though they were benign versions of the children of ''Lord of the Flies.'' A sandy-haired pitcher stood like Pan, barefoot on the mound, bathed in the evening light. 
 Asked what team they belonged to, a young man with curly dark hair rose from a catcher's squat and looked up. 
 ''We're the Bong-hitters,'' he replied as with perfect thwacks, the batter drilled balls great distances into the night. The catcher said his name was Rosenthal, but added that, while some team members had written things, ''none of us actually work for the magazine.'' 
 Among the squad for The Paris Review on that sunless season opener in April were a literary agent or two, some former readers of the magazine, and Karen Maine and Benjamin Platt, two interns, who, having just concluded their stints, found themselves competing against each other for the same, very few publishing jobs. 
 By the end of the game, the team had won grandly, 20 to 11.
 In the bottom of the second, Jim Rutman, a tall figure out in left field, leaped high, plucked the ball from the air and tumbled backward onto the grass. Then, almost casually, he raised his glove to display the ball safely inside.
 No, he did not work for The Paris Review, he said as he left the field. He was a literary agent. ''But with the limited opportunities right now,'' the agent said, ''one has to do what one can.''

HEADLINE: West Coast Chef, East Coast Assignment

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN. 
E-mail: theisland@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MELVILLE 

 BODY:
 THE calamari stays on the menu. Preferably fried. That was the first marching order tossed out at James McDevitt, a West Coast chef with a sophisticated, organically inclined palate, after he took over the kitchen of the bifurcated operation known as the Four Food Studio and Cocktail Salon in 2007. 
 Mr. McDevitt, now 37, grinned and bore it: he set his crispy calamari in a cradle of turbo-spicy lemon grass sauce, sneaked in some organic watercress and watched diners try to handle the heat. And also watched them amp up their patronage of the Cocktail Salon part of the operation. A win-win. Calamari's latest incarnation on the menu: crisped to a fare-three-well and augmented by mango, coriander, sambal aioli and, back by popular demand (his own), watercress. 
 ''I had been used to cooking in small places, some of them my own, where it was all about the food,'' he said recently, seated at a table in a back room with a lime-green ceiling and a kaleidoscopic purple rug. ''Here it's not.'' Except that for him it still is.
 Asked to make a selection from his own ever-evolving menu, Mr. McDevitt, who met his wife, Stacey, a native of East Northport, at Scottsdale Culinary School in Arizona, opted for the English pea ravioli decorated by favas, ramps, asparagus and fresh-shaved summer truffles, followed by Alaskan halibut with peppers, olives and capers in a jazzy salsify puree. Were the homemade popcorn-flavored ice cream still on the menu, he would have grabbed that. (When the owners of Four open Two, a yakitori/sushi/steakhouse in New Hyde Park, next fall, Mr. McDevitt guarantees 15 exotic flavors of ice cream on the menu.)
 Before having two children, the younger of whom is autistic and requires special care, Mr. McDevitt and his wife did the mom-and-pop thing at their boutique restaurants in Scottsdale (Restaurant Hapa) and the Napa Valley. He was the head chef; she was the pastry chef and also ran the front of the room. 
 Despite his brief stint as a celebrity judge on ''Top Chef,'' Mr. McDevitt is a back-of-the-room sort of guy. Though he caved on the calamari issue, he drew the line at adding a generic penne a la vodka to his menu. Rock shrimp risotto and sheep's milk ricotta gnocchi are more his style. And his side dish of crispy brussels sprouts with mint, scallions, honey and mustard is actually creating converts.
 Located in the heart (if it has one) of Melville, Long Island's fast-track corporate corridor, the Four Food Studio was known not so much as a purveyor of fine meats and vegetables as it was a meet market and network nexus for the movers-and-shakers-and-Lamborghini-lovers at the top of the Island's singles hierarchy. 
 Mr. McDevitt, whose laurels include being named best new chef of 1999 by Food and Wine magazine (an honor shared with the mercurial Rocco DiSpirito) and the 2001 James Beard Foundation ''rising star,'' continues to marvel at the quirks of his clientele. They may be clueless about skate, but offer them Kobe beef at $18 an ounce and there's sure to be a bruiser in the bunch who demands 20 ounces. Overkill, according to the chef, who doesn't quite see the customer as always right. 
 He recalls, during his unhappy tenure as part of the five-chef team (talk about overkill) hired to re-invent Le Cirque in New York City, dishing out eight ounces of Beluga caviar and setting it before a doll -- yes, a doll -- that two of his regular clients brought in once a year on its ''birthday.'' Dining with a doll, he said, guarantees some great doggie bags.
 Mr. McDevitt, who is half-Japanese and half-Irish, grew up on the move -- his father flew planes for the Navy and later worked in weapons intelligence -- but grew up cooking. His breakfast scrapple, a mixture of cornmeal and sausage, was a family staple. ''I made it like a pate,'' he said. He remembers barbecuing at age 4, also the age when he whipped up his first batch of pork gyoza with a recipe handed down from his maternal grandmother. To this day, he and his mother bicker over the exact allotment of ingredients.
 His parents, adventurous eaters, once tricked him into eating dog in Korea when he was 14. ''They told me it was chicken stew,'' he said. ''At the time, I thought it was cool, but let's just say I never did it again.'' Nor did he, while cooking at a Scottsdale hotel, agree to prepare monkey brains for a special client. ''I told the hotel manager that even if I could get it, I wouldn't serve it,'' he said.
 Mr. McDevitt's co-ownership of Budo, the Napa restaurant of his dreams, entailed a daunting $5 million, three-year investment in construction and building materials but ended in heartbreak when it was ravaged by floodwater three years ago on New Year's Eve. He never envisioned himself cooking at a high-octane enterprise like Four Food Studio, but here he still is.
 The ''Austin Powers'' meets ''Clockwork Orange'' decor? Not his call. The absolute reliance on an array of fresh produce -- he orders up 40 pounds of ramps without blinking an eye -- is Mr. McDevitt's signature. What can he possibly do with 40 pounds of ultraperishable ramps? ''Everybody loves ramps, but they're only around for a few weeks a year, so I pickle them,'' he said.
 Mr. McDevitt said signs of the economic downturn are more evident in the parking lot -- there is no longer a scrum of Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Ferraris vying for prime valet parking spots -- than in the dining room. On Monday night the kitchen sent out 250 covers (as in separate dinners). On Saturday night it served 300 dinners and ferried 250 plates to bar patrons. What does he most miss from Napa and Arizona? His homegrown artichokes.

HEADLINE: A Public-Private Career

BYLINE: By ROGER FERGUSON. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY father was interested in savings and investing, so from a young age I was talking with him about C.D. rates and interest rates. As a child of the Depression, he was focused on retirement savings. My family also had a numerical bent. My father was a cartographer, and his father was an architect. 
 In junior high I entered an integrated school, which was unusual in the early 1960s. I went to the Sidwell Friends School for high school, where black students were a minority. My academic career was a reflection of the changing views regarding integration during those years. 
 I developed a passion for economics at Sidwell. In 1966, when I was 15, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Andrew Brimmer as the first black governor of the Federal Reserve system. It was my first exposure to the importance of the Fed. 
 An English teacher recommended I go to Harvard. I got a job on campus cleaning bathrooms as a scholarship student. Other students would clean when fellow students weren't around. I didn't care when I cleaned; I was proud of my work. 
 That experience taught me that no job is too small to do well. I even received a letter from some classmates commending me on how well I cleaned bathrooms. 
 After graduating, I went to Cambridge on a Harvard fellowship to study history. When I returned, I wanted to study both law and economics, but there was no official program for that at Harvard, so I created my own. The administrators let me move back and forth between schools and I graduated with a J.D. and a Ph.D. in economics. 
 I got a job at a Wall Street corporate law firm, but I realized that law was not my passion. After three years, I left and became a management consultant for McKinsey & Company.
 I moved to the Federal Reserve when a fellow Harvard graduate, Larry Summers, deputy secretary of the Treasury at the time, asked me if I was interested in a policy-making position in the administration. I joined the board of governors and eventually became its vice chairman. 
 The board combined practical policy making with a moderately academic tone contributed by a large number of Ph.D. economists. I was the only Federal Reserve governor in Washington on 9/11. I decided to stay in the Federal Reserve building; otherwise, there would be no central point of contact for Wall Street. 
 The board had to make several decisions. One we made was to not encourage the administration to shut down the banking system, because consumer confidence would have plummeted and the economy would have suffered even more.
 A year ago, I left the reinsurer Swiss Re where I had worked for a year and a half and joined TIAA-CREF. It was an opportunity to lead a company, and it brings together my background and my interest in helping employees in the nonprofit sector. 
 I was pleasantly surprised that TIAA-CREF's portfolio was so robust. We had minimal subprime exposure and were nicked, but not knocked down.
 I've learned it's best to surround yourself with people who are at least as good if not better than you are. Some chief executives think they've got to be the dominant voice at the table. I've tried to foster an atmosphere where people speak up and challenge my views. 
 In late January, Austan Goolsbee, President Obama's economic adviser, called and asked if I'd serve on the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and I agreed. 
 I've been to the White House a couple of times so far. There's a good give and take at the meetings. Our primary focus is the recession and getting the economy moving.

THE FIRST TYCOON
 The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt
 By T. J. Stiles
 Illustrated. 719 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $37.50
 Americans have always been ambivalent about men who turn small businesses into gigantic ones. We marvel at their cleverness and daring -- and envy the manifold pleasures they buy and discard at whim. Yet we assume that anyone so big must also be bad. Tycoons get blamed for making the marketplace less free, for corrupting politicians, for exploiting the ordinary folk who work in their companies. Some of the corporate rich then try to enhance their reputations with ostentatious philanthropy. No wonder that in this most capitalist of nations, our leading capitalists usually garner as much suspicion as love. 
 Cornelius Vanderbilt spent little of his long life fretting over his image. If Americans were not grateful for the many steamships he built, the major railroad lines he integrated into a common system, the stock market panics he soothed and the Grand Central Terminal he constructed with his own millions, that was their fault, not his. Vanderbilt was the richest man in 19th-century America; at his death in 1877, he possessed, at least on paper, one-ninth of all the American currency in circulation. But like other corporate giants of his era and ours, he saw no reason to apologize for manufacturing and managing commodities everyone wanted and needed. ''Vanderbilt was many things, not all of them admirable,'' T. J. Stiles says in this perceptive and fluently written biography, ''but he was never a phony. Hated, revered, resented, he always commanded respect, even from his enemies.''
 That respect stemmed, in part, from how he earned his fortune. During the early years of the republic, most rich Americans had inherited their wealth from mercantile or planter ancestors. Like their fellow patricians across the Atlantic, they tended to equate good breeding with the right to rule. Vanderbilt left school at the age of 11. But as a self-taught, self-made entrepreneur, he had no equal.
 Vanderbilt grew up on Staten Island, the son of ambitious farmers who were determined to profit from the commercial bounty being frantically pursued in the booming city across the bay. Cornelius routinely took his father's boat to Manhattan and back; sometimes, he spent all night in the small vessel in order to grab the first job the next morning. By his 20th birthday, Vanderbilt had made enough cash to compete for trade up and down the coast. While a tiny number of men his age were leisurely studying the classics in Cambridge and Princeton, Vanderbilt became a prosperous ''shopkeeper of the sea.'' He was also one of the first Americans to learn to construct and operate steamships -- the greatest innovation in transport since the invention of sail. 
 Vanderbilt erected a continental empire on his love and mastery of the age of steam. It was a perilous industry: captains eager to destroy the competition routinely pushed engines beyond their limits. Boilers exploded. Ships crashed into one another. Deaths were common. Vanderbilt often challenged other owners to races, piloting boats of his own design with ferocious cunning, if not always to victory.
 But the Commodore (a name he cherished) accomplished his most impressive feats away from the steering wheel. By slashing fares and buying out rival firms, Vanderbilt achieved a near monopoly on steamship travel between New York and Boston. During the California gold rush, he hacked out a passage through Nicaragua to carry the forty-niners and their mail from ocean to ocean. Midway through the Civil War, he loaned his largest and fastest ship to the Union Navy to chase down Confederate raiders. Once victory was won, he switched his energies to the railroad business and soon controlled a network of lines that ran from New York to Chicago. 
 Like a great athlete, Vanderbilt lived to compete. As a septuagenarian, he still relished racing a team of fancy horses on the outskirts of Gotham. His ''resolution is indomitable,'' The New York Herald gushed. But Henry J. Raymond, the editor of The Times, introduced a new metaphor by likening Vanderbilt to a robber baron. Similar to the medieval German nobles who ''swooped down upon the commerce'' of the Rhine ''and wrung tribute from every passenger that floated by,'' Vanderbilt gained maximum profits by gaining maximum control of whatever market he entered. 
 Manipulating stock prices was as essential to that end as offering low fares and efficient service. In the fall of 1869, Vanderbilt arrested a Wall Street panic by pumping millions of dollars into companies on the verge of failing. But he had helped bring on the ''Black Friday'' crisis in the first place by flooding the market with shares of his own railroads to foil the plans of Jay Gould, a rival baron. ''Vanderbilt appeared in the role of a hero,'' Stiles says. ''Closer inspection reveals that a blood-chilling ruthlessness infused all his actions.'' 
 Stiles, the author of a biography of Jesse James, writes with both the panache of a fine journalist and the analytical care of a seasoned scholar. And he offers a fruitful way to think about the larger history of American elites as well as the life of one of their most famous members. 
 Vanderbilt may not have been the ''first'' tycoon in the United States -- the fur merchant John Jacob Astor probably deserves that title. But, as Stiles contends, the Commodore was a leading exemplar of a new class of businessmen. All were Northerners, and most believed fervently in the strong Union their toil and wealth had knit together. 
 Corporate ethics, however, were honored more in banquet rhetoric than in deeds. Vanderbilt and his cost-conscious brethren naturally preferred friendly negotiations to forceful or dishonest tactics. Yet when polite methods failed, they were quite willing to buy off politicians, double-cross former partners and have the police break up strikes by their workers. Although Vanderbilt habitually dressed in the simple black-and-white outfit of a Protestant clergyman, his only religion was economic power. ''Vanderbilt,'' Stiles writes, ''was a paradox -- both a creator and a destroyer.'' 
 Several of his 13 children had reason to feel a similar ambivalence about the old man. As kind patriarch, the Commodore either employed his sons or staked them to businesses and careers of their own. He also carefully scrutinized the marriage choices of both daughters and sons and treated them to some of the most lavish weddings in the land. Vanderbilt was quick, however, to judge any sign of dependency as a flaw of character. He labeled one son a ''sucker'' for borrowing money. Another son tried to keep his gambling addiction a secret from his father, lest Vanderbilt cut him off. 
 As a notoriously ''hard man,'' the Commodore had just a little room in his heart for charity and none at all for guilt. The one time he donated a substantial amount of money was to seed the university in Nashville that bears his name. What motivated that late-life gift, characteristically, was a desire to reconcile the South and North so that, under the leadership of a new elite, the whole nation might prosper. 
 Soon after Vanderbilt's death, such confidence was shaken by a wave of violent strikes and increasing alarm about the plight of the urban poor. A generation of reformers and radicals convinced the public thatclever capitalists with untrammeled powers could not be trusted to make decisions that benefited the majority of Americans. Since last year, the entire world has had to relearn that lesson. Yet the Commodore also grasped the need for strict regulation, if only for his corporate underlings. As a longtime secretary put it, ''He thought every man could stand watching.''

HEADLINE: Rally May Be Cause For Hope, or a Blip

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IS it safe to exhale yet?
 Many investors abandoned stocks entirely as the market fell into a steep decline, wiping out more than 50 percent of the value of the broad stock market through early March.
 Perhaps that's why there has been relatively little celebration of what has already been an extraordinary rally -- by some measures, one of the most powerful stock market surges since the Great Depression. 
 In the two months since March 9, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has climbed 37.4 percent, putting the market back into positive territory for the year. The S.& P. 500 closed on Friday at 929.23 
 Still, for investors, the crucial question is always where the markets are heading, not where they've been. With so much still wrong with the economy and the financial system, the possibility of major disruptions can't be ruled out, and some long-term bears are holding their ground. 
 ''I'd resist the temptation to jump on the bandwagon now,'' said David A. Rosenberg, who stepped down last week as chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, and believes we are still in a very long bear market.
 But despite a daunting array of problems that continue to weigh on the markets, a growing coterie of analysts have become cautiously upbeat. 
 ''I'm of the view that this is a bull market,'' said Lazlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. For the first 60 days of a market upturn, Mr. Birinyi says that the current rally's 37.4 percent gain ranks it behind only the 41.6 percent surge of 1933. 
 The rapidity of the current upturn is noteworthy, he said, because 25 percent of a bull market's gains typically occur in its first two months. He said that suggests that the S.& P. 500 is likely to reach 1,690 over the next two to five years. 
 Naturally, not everyone is so sanguine.
 James McDonald, the chief investment strategist of Northern Trust in Chicago, for example, stressed the underlying problems in the economy and financial system, which he said, will continue to make many asset classes quite risky, particularly the domestic stock market. 
 In quick succession, he cited a list of enormous problems: the continuing global recession, the ongoing housing downturn in the United States, the likelihood of rising foreclosure rates, lingering uncertainty about the banking system and the credit markets, and the ongoing need for government intervention on a massive scale throughout the economy
 Still, he said, financial conditions do appear to be improving, and so his firm is recommending a modest shift in its ''defensive'' portfolio posture, moving ''incrementally'' from cash into high-yield bonds. He believes investors should keep some cash on hand until there is clear evidence that the housing downturn has stopped. Only at that point would he recommend a more aggressive bet on domestic stocks.
 William H. Gross, co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, says that this rally is a bull market, and that a bottom ''probably has been reached.''
 In his analysis, though, the basis for the current rally does not necessarily augur well for the future. ''We think that it's mainly due to the end of deleveraging -- forced liquidation of stocks and other assets by hedge funds and the like, which is what we had certainly all of 2008,'' he said. He called the rally ''sort of like a snapback reflex where you bend the branch and you let go and it snaps back.''
 He cautioned that the government's rescue efforts, while necessary, have significantly changed the economy and the financial system, with detrimental effects for broad market returns down the road. 
 ''First thing investors should do is get real,'' he said. ''Expect returns from assets in a diversified portfolio of only 5 to 6 percent, not double digits.''
 Given that likelihood, and the significant risk of further disruptions, he suggested emphasizing ''high-quality corporate bonds.'' He said that while it's probably wise for individual investors to hold some stocks, he would not recommend ''jumping into a stock market that's 35 percent higher than it was 3 months ago.'' 
 Byron Wien, chief investment strategist of Pequot Capital Management, has been predicting a market upturn for months. He believes that the current rally will continue a while longer, bringing the S.& P. 500 above 1,000. Beyond that is another question. ''I'd be careful right now,'' he said. ''At this point, I'd limit myself to higher-quality stocks, and to corporate bonds.'' 
 JEREMY GRANTHAM, chairman of the investment management firm GMO, has been relatively bullish for several months. But in a market letter last week, he discussed the probabilities of the rally morphing into a ''lasting bull market'' that would return to its October 2007 highs within several years. He said that much will depend on whether the economies of the United States and ''other leading countries kick up by later this year or early next year.'' If they do, he said, it's ''50-50'' as to whether the market falls again below its March lows. And if the economy does not recover fairly soon, the chances of a major market decline are quite high. 
 Mr. Rosenberg, who is joining a Toronto investment firm this week, is unequivocal. The fundamental problem right now is that the economy is quite fragile, he said: ''It's being held together by tape and glue.'' 
 Asked what advice he'd give individual investors, Mr. Rosenberg said: ''I'd be locking in my gains right now.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths PRYDE, HARRY

 BODY:
PRYDE--Harry. Long time advocate for affordable housing, passed away March 30, 2009, following a three year illness. Born to Ruby and Aubrey Pryde, on a depression-era farm near Sunnyside, Washington, Harry planned a life trajectory that would take him from asparagus fields in the Yakima Valley, to Seattle, to Washington D.C., and to most of the world. After completing his degree in Economics and Business at Washington State University, he served two years as an officer in the U.S. Air Force, with an extended posting in (then French) Morocco. 
Following his military service he entered the University of Washington in what is now the Evans School of Public Affairs to earn a Master's degree in Public Administration. There he met his future wife, Ann Catoni, in an Administrative Law class. Before completing his studies, Harry held an internship as Assistant City Manager of Port Angeles. Following graduation, he worked at the University of Washington in the Association of Washington Cities and the Institute of Governmental Research, an experience that he often remarked he greatly valued. It was in these years that Harry confirmed his belief in the interplay of higher education and the formation of public policies on critical issues such as urban planning and housing. Harry entered the business world as a home builder, starting with a few houses in the Northgate area. In time he founded Pryde Corporation, a diversified company responsible for developing and building homes, apartment complexes, office buildings, convalescent centers and condominiums. He built one of the first condominium buildings in Seattle in 1970 on Capitol Hill overlooking Lake Union. Harry devoted many years to working on national and local housing issues. In 1983, he was elected president of the National Association of Home Builders the first builder from the northwest to be elected to this position. He had also been president of the Seattle and Washington State Master Builder's Association. He was inducted into the National Housing Hall of Fame, as well as the local and state Master Builder's Association Hall of Fame, and the University of Washington Construction Hall of Fame. He served on numerous civic, state, and national boards, including the Seattle Housing Authority, Washington State Affordable Housing Commission, Washington State Housing Finance Commission, and the Washington State Housing Task Force. He was a founder of Enterprise Bank in 1988, and on the Board of Directors of both the Seattle and Bellevue Chambers of Commerce. He was a Director of DASH (non-profit housing for low income families). He also was a Director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle. In his private capacity and as a friend and advisor of public figures, Harry Pryde continued to emphasize the importance of affordable housing. His ongoing multiple interests in public policy and economics in housing were recognized when he received the 2006 Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington. He established a fellowship in 2002 to provide internships in Washington D.C., for graduate students in the Evans School of Public Affairs so students may gain insight into national and global policy. Having learned to play the violin as a boy, Harry remained devoted to musical and other cultural activities. He enjoyed attending concerts of the Seattle Symphony as well as lectures and seminars on public affairs. Harry and his wife Ann have been donors to many cultural, civic, and academic organizations. Harry had a fascination for the world at large. He was a prolific traveler with a global curiosity, seizing every opportunity to visit other nations. He sought to expand and encourage knowledge and understanding through the experience of travel, as when he led his family on a historical tour of Europe and the Aegean Sea in 1973. Other family activities included riding the rapids through the Grand Canyon, sailing the Gulf Islands and around Vancouver Island, and weekly skiing at Crystal Mountain. He enjoyed golf, his time boating and skiing with family and friends, and his many walks on the beach. He was a voracious reader, well-informed and forthright in his opinions. He remained active and engaged with the world throughout his life falling ill while skiing in Sun Valley. Harry Pryde valued principles of hard work, established in his early childhood on the family farm. He constantly sought to expand his and others' knowledge of the world. His family expresses great admiration and a deep appreciation for all he accomplished and for all he gave, his love and his caring. He is survived by Ann, his wife of 52 years, three children, six grandchildren; by his sister, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, several nieces and nephews and many devoted friends. A celebration of his life was held on Sunday, April 19 at 3pm at the Seattle Yacht Club.

HEADLINE: Caution Flags Raised Over Ethanol Industry's 15% Solution

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
THE Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to make an important and far-reaching decision this year that will affect more than 500 million gasoline engines powering everything from large pickups to family cars to lawn mowers: whether to grant the ethanol industry's request to raise the maximum amount of ethanol that can be added to gasoline. 
 That request has engine manufacturers and consumer advocates worried about possible damage, service station owners in a tizzy over the financial and legal implications and a leading petroleum industry group saying the move is unwise and premature.
Specifically, ethanol producers are asking that the maximum ethanol content in the most common blend of gasoline be increased from 10 percent -- a limit set about three decades ago -- to as much as 15 percent. The blend the industry hopes will become common is known as E15, but the E.P.A. could approve a blend between E10 and E15. 
 Last year, nearly three-quarters of the gasoline sold in the United States contained some ethanol, according to the American Petroleum Institute. E10, which is 10 percent ethanol, is by far the most common fuel, though the E.P.A. has approved the use of ethanol blends up to 85 percent -- but only for the limited number of new and late-model cars and trucks certified by manufacturers as ''flexible fuel vehicles.'' The ethanol industry wants E15 to replace E10 as the standard fuel found at most stations. 
 The issue came before the E.P.A. in early March when Growth Energy, an ethanol lobbying group, and 54 ethanol manufacturers asked the agency for a waiver of the Clean Air Act so that more ethanol could be added to gasoline.
 Although the request went largely unnoticed by the public, it got the attention of anyone who makes or sells gasoline engines, as well as some environmentalists and consumer advocates.
 Approving E15 would have a huge impact on consumers, said Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety, and could cause problems including the voiding of car warranties. ''There's a lot to worry about,'' he said. ''All a consumer has to do is look at the fuels section of the owner's manual, which says that the use of fuel above 10 percent ethanol may result in denial of warranty claims.''
 Nearly 250 million cars and light trucks are registered in the United States, according to Experian Automotive. But the impact would be even broader. Kris Kiser, executive vice president of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, estimates that a change would affect 300 million engines in everything from chainsaws to weed trimmers. 
 The National Marine Manufacturers Association says 12 million boat engines would also be affected.
 Growth Energy, whose co-chairman is Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general, has told the E.P.A. that it has proof from several studies that E15 will not damage engines and will result in cleaner air while reducing the nation's reliance on oil. 
 The studies were done by groups including the federal Energy Department, the State of Minnesota, the Renewable Fuels Association, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Minnesota Center for Automotive Research and Stockholm University in Sweden. 
 Michael Harrigan, a former Ford Motor Company fuel-system engineer who is now a consultant to Growth Energy, said automakers had been doing enough testing that there should be no problems using E15. 
 And Tom Buis, the chief executive of Growth Energy, said, ''We are confident in the science we prepared.'' 
 But confident or not, Growth Energy is opposed by groups that say some of the studies it cites are inconclusive. The critics also say its assertions are unproved and in some cases misleading.
 While automakers generally favor wider use of biofuels, Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing 11 automakers, said Growth Energy had failed to prove that E15 would not damage vehicles engineered to run on a maximum of 10 percent ethanol. More testing is needed, he said.
 Mr. Kiser, of the outdoor power equipment group, said some initial tests already indicated that E15 could cause serious problems -- including safety issues -- with some small engines. 
 At Honda, which makes a wide range of engines for products from minivans to power generators, the concern is that the effects of a big increase in an additive like ethanol are unknown, said Edward B. Cohen, vice president for government and industry relations at American Honda. ''The impact can be on the emissions system, like the catalytic converter,'' he said. ''It can be on the various tubes or couplings that are part of the fuel system, and it could affect the performance of the vehicle, particularly cold starting.''
 Honda can design engines to run well on new gasoline blends, Mr. Cohen said. The issue is the legacy fleet, whose engines were designed over two decades for varying requirements. There is no single answer, Mr. Cohen said, to the question of how E15 would affect them.
 The American Petroleum Institute is also concerned, said Robert Greco, the group director of downstream and industry operations. He said more research was needed -- probably several years' worth -- before the institute would be convinced that E15 was safe for so many different kinds of engines.
 ''We think that the current waiver request is premature,'' Mr. Greco said. 
 And Jeremy Martin, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., said there was not enough solid information on which to make a decision with such a broad impact. ''We shouldn't just look at a little data and extrapolate,'' he said. ''There are rules here, and there are procedures. And there is a proper engineering way to come to this determination. One can guess about the most likely outcomes, but that is not sufficient to put all the fleet at risk.''
 Wendy Clark, group manager and principal researcher in the fuels performance group at the Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said a lot of credible organizations were studying E15. But she said it was too early to know for sure how engines would be affected.One question is how many of the studies will be done before Dec. 1, the date by which the E.P.A. is required by law to make its decision.
 Mr. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety said: ''What the ethanol people are asking the consumer to do is bear the risk. If only 1 percent of the vehicles on the road had E15-related problems, that would be about 2.5 million.''
 Among those concerned about the proposed change are service station owners, many of whom fear that their pumps and fiberglass storage tanks would need to be replaced. They also fear legal problems including lawsuits from customers claiming their vehicles were damaged by the fuel.
 ''It is a horrible thing for our members,'' said Carl Boyett, president of the Society of Independent Gas Marketers.
 In their March request to the E.P.A., proponents of the waiver said E15 would provide ''increased energy security, enhanced economic development, creation of American jobs, reduced transportation costs and environmental benefits.'' The ethanol manufacturers said the increase is necessary because of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. That act includes a renewable fuels standard that requires a steady increase in the use of biofuels -- to 36 billion gallons in 2022 from 11 billion gallons this year. To meet the goals, refiners must add biofuels to gasoline.
 The industry has been meeting the requirements. But Americans are now buying far less gasoline than was expected when the law passed. That decline has the industry worried that as early as 2011 or 2012 it will be impossible to meet the renewable fuels standard with a 10 percent limit, Mr. Greco said.
 Mr. Buis of Growth Energy said: ''We are up against a blend wall. That cap needs to be raised.''
 While adding more ethanol would help refiners meet the law, it would not improve fuel economy. An October 2008 study for the Energy Department tested 16 late-model cars and found, on average, that mileage dropped 5 percent with E15 compared with gasoline that contained no ethanol.
 In deciding whether to raise the cap, the E.P.A. says it must consider not just emissions, but also vehicles' durability and drivability ''over their useful lives.'' The agency says it is possible it might approve the use of E15 for some vehicles or engines but not for others. 
 Mr. Buis of Growth Energy said that the advantages and safety of E15 were clear and that allowing higher ethanol content would help to make the nation less dependent on petroleum. 
 ''You know, some people don't want to do anything -- they just want to test, test, test or study, study, study,'' Mr. Buis said. ''You know, this nation has been stalling for 30-some years from becoming energy independent.''

HEADLINE: Gaps Appear in G.O.P. Solidarity

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After being stingy with their support in the early days of the Obama administration, significant numbers of House Republicans have begun breaking from their party leaders and voting for legislation moving through the Democratic-led Congress.
 Scores of House Republicans joined Democrats in recent days in pushing through measures meant to rein in credit card companies, increase federal resources to pursue financial fraud and crack down on predatory housing lenders -- all legislation opposed by top House Republicans. On the credit card and financial fraud bills, only a minority of Republicans ended up opposing them. 
 ''It is hard to say we shouldn't put in more stringent standards on mortgage lending, given what has happened in the past,'' said Representative Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican who backed all three measures. 
 Democrats say the fracturing suggests that rank-and-file Republicans are growing nervous about their leadership's near-blanket opposition to the agenda that Congressional Democrats and President Obama are pursuing, particularly on measures that have obvious popular appeal. 
 ''Look at credit cards,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''A good number of Republicans understand this is something important to voters and consumers. If you are getting ripped off by a credit card company, it doesn't matter if you are Democratic, Republican or independent.''
 House Republicans say they are picking their battles, and they demonstrated remarkable unity this year on the most crucial legislation -- the president's economic stimulus bill and the budget -- for which there were no defections. They also expect to close ranks if Democrats move forward with energy and health care bills they find objectionable.
 ''There is a truism in baseball and in Congress,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 3 House Republican, who opposed the lending, financial fraud and credit card measures. ''You can't swing at every pitch. But where we think the interests of the American people require a strong unified opposition, we let our membership know that and we have a high degree of success.''
 Other Republicans say the credit card, mortgage and fraud bills may be popular but are not the sort of high-profile initiatives that will define the party, which is trying to emphasize its stances on national security and fiscal issues.
 ''On the biggest issues, like the wasteful, trillion-dollar 'stimulus' spending plan or the Democrats' fiscally irresponsible budget, House Republicans have stood together and sent a clear and unified message that America deserves better,'' Michael Steel, a spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said in a statement. ''On other issues, unsurprisingly, there are healthy differences of opinion, and that is reflected in the vote on various bills.'' 
 The Republican willingness to join with Democrats on some legislation has come gradually but does suggest that the notion of bipartisanship is not the mirage some have declared it to be. If the trend continues, it could become problematic for the Republican leadership, especially if it is interpreted as a lack of confidence in the party's opposition stance. 
 In January, just three House Republicans were willing to side with Democrats in approving a measure giving women more opportunity to sue over pay discrimination, even when it was evident that the bill would be the first signed by Mr. Obama. Forty Republicans backed a children's health measure that had become a major theme of Democrats after two vetoes during the Bush administration.
 Then came the total Republican rejection of the stimulus measure, which surprised both the administration and Congressional Democrats, who had calculated that some House Republicans would be motivated to support the $787 billion measure that funneled money to states and communities.
 But in the aftermath of that vote, rank-and-file Republicans have shown some desire to join Democrats behind bills. Thirty-eight House Republicans voted for a broad public lands bill that set aside millions of acres, 70 supported a national service bill and 70 supported new Food and Drug Administration curbs on tobacco. 
 In recent days, 105 of the 178 House Republicans backed the credit card bill, and 117 the financial fraud bill. The mortgage legislation drew 60 Republican votes despite opposition by the top three Republican leaders and the senior Republican on the banking committee, who said it would make it more difficult for qualified homebuyers to get loans.
 Republicans who have found themselves splitting from their leaders say that they are making choices based on policy and that they have come under no pressure to stick with the party.
 ''There are things in those bills that some of us consider to be important,'' said Representative Dan Lungren, a California Republican who backed the credit card, fraud and lending measures. ''There has not been any strong condemnation or any strong sense of obligation imposed on members on these things. On the stimulus package and the budget, that was different.''
 More consensus legislation could be on its away; a major Pentagon purchasing overhaul passed the Senate unanimously last week and sped through a House committee without opposition. 
 Not all measures are bridging the partisan divide; a hate crimes bill that passed the House this month drew support from only 18 Republicans. But in other instances, some Republicans are finding common ground with Democrats.
 ''There are just some issues that I agree with them on,'' said Mr. Simpson, of Idaho. ''I thought that credit card bill was a good vote, quite frankly.''

HEADLINE: The Smoot-Hawley Act Is More Than a Laugh Line

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR the last 23 years or so, complete strangers have come up to me all over this country to ask if there really was such a thing as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act or if I made it up. 
 Yes, there really was such a thing. And while it's been the subject of some controversy for economists and historians, it also played a special role in my little life. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, sometimes called Hawley-Smoot, was the subject of a monologue I gave ad lib, just off the top of my head, in the movie ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' on Stage 15 at Paramount Studios on or about Nov. 15, 1985. It stayed in the movie, and when that movie was released in 1986, that scene, my first of any size in any movie, made me a star -- although a star of only cult proportions, unlike, say, a Ronald Reagan. For me, that is the primary significance of that piece of legislation. 
 Otherwise, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a wildly misguided attempt by two Republican senators, Reed O. Smoot of Utah and Willis C. Hawley of a very different Oregon, and the Republican-controlled Congress to stimulate domestic production by raising (''raising or lowering ... anyone, anyone?'') tariffs on many goods from abroad. Signed reluctantly by President Herbert Hoover, who most certainly did know better, the law did not do much to ameliorate the onrushing Depression, but it did anger foreign trading partners. They slapped retaliatory tariffs on American-made goods.
 World trade slumped.
 As the great economist Ludwig von Mises has said, causes and effects in economics are impossible to connect, so we do not know what effect Smoot-Hawley had on worsening the Depression. In economics, each case has elements of uniqueness. Economics is not physics, and experiments are impossible to conduct with enough control to consistently give us predictable results. We do not know at all what effects Smoot-Hawley, as compared with the collapsing world economy, had on trade. 
 At the time of its enactment, exports were only about 5 percent of the economic output of the United States and still outweighed imports. (Even now, exports are a smaller part of output in the United States than in any other large developed nation.) To say that the act, which applied to a distinct minority of imports and which raised tariffs generally by only about six percentage points, caused the Depression is almost comical. It did no good, but compared with the titanic monetary policy disasters of the era, the effect of Smoot-Hawley was probably very small, or so most mainstream economists believe. 
 However, a number of well-known people, especially my former colleagues at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, the late Robert Bartley (a genuinely great guy) and Jude Wanniski, began in the mid-1970s to popularize the notion that Smoot-Hawley and not monetary policy mistakes was the real cause of the Great Depression.
 This popularization was a form of intellectual entrepreneurship, in which people carve out an appealing idea and then try to make capital of it. In this case, the argument actually has some usefulness in cautioning us against adopting protectionism on a large scale as a way out of our current economic troubles. That is, while it is a mistaken notion, it still has some beneficial effects. While the proponents of attributing large effects to Smoot-Hawley are not generally prominent in economics, they are well known and their views keep us on the straight and narrow about the virtues of free trade. (These, too, have been seriously questioned in recent years by economists as respected as Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Adam Smith idea that free trade always benefits every nation that practices it is very much in question now.)
 Anyway, that's Smoot-Hawley, or Hawley-Smoot, my main economics lesson of this Sunday.
 I would also respectfully like to make a personal observation about money. Lately it has come crushingly upon me that when I was a child, I was stupendously extravagant by the standards of the 1950s and 1960s. ( I still am.) What must my mother and father, who grew up in the Great Depression, who had to work for every dime, who had to live with economies I cannot imagine, have thought of my extravagance?
 Yet, even when the United States was in recession, as it was repeatedly when I grew up, my father never complained about my spending (my mother did occasionally). My parents sent me to an expensive college without loans or a scholarship or a job. They bought me beautiful clothes and happily paid for my travel. But how they must have churned inside at my Aga Khan way of life. How must the parents of all of us of my generation have marveled at our hideous sense of entitlement. Or maybe it made them happy that they could afford it. I don't know. I just know that my parents lived modestly and spent their declining years in comfort.
 For my generation, I am not at all sure the story will be the same.

 BODY:
THE NEWS The number of houses under contract for sale unexpectedly rose in March, as did construction spending, according to new figures from the National Association of Realtors and the Commerce Department. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Troubles in housing -- falling prices, mortgage defaults, foreclosures and weak demand -- have been at the core of the economic slump, so hints that the housing industry has arrested its slide are welcome. Though prices and sales have continued to deteriorate nationally, they are starting to revive in some of the markets that were hit first and hardest by the downturn, like Sacramento, Calif., Las Vegas and parts of Florida.
 THE NEWS Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the economic free fall of the last nine months was nearing an end and that he expected the United States to begin a fragile recovery by the end of this year.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Bernanke tempered his assessment -- his most upbeat in a long time -- by noting that even though the economy seemed to be stabilizing, net job losses would probably continue well into 2010 and the unemployment rate would almost certainly climb further. Even so, Mr. Bernanke told a Congressional committee, ''we are in much better shape than we were in September and October.'' 
 THE NEWS The broadest of the main stock market indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500, rallied to close higher on Monday than where it began the year.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though still far below their 2008 peaks, stocks have rallied strongly for two months, erasing the deep lows plumbed in early March, as investors snapped up bargain-price stocks they saw as over-punished by the recession and the financial crisis. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index has done even better, turning positive for the year in early April and continuing to post solid gains. Glimmers of revival in the banking and construction industries continued to buoy stocks later in the week.
 THE NEWS Assessing the soundness of the country's largest banks, federal regulators delivered a more upbeat verdict than expected: All are solvent now, and the amount of fresh capital they collectively need to raise by November is just $75 billion. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The government's ''stress tests'' for the 19 financial institutions deemed too big to let fail sized up their ability to ride out two years of even deeper recession than has yet been seen; 10 of the 19 were deemed to be adequately capitalized, and most of the capital shortfall was concentrated in just four institutions -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo, GMAC and Citibank.
 THE NEWS The American economy lost fewer jobs in April than economists expected, with payrolls shrinking by 539,000. The unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent, however, in part because the labor force was swelled by people seeking jobs again after having given up trying to find work in earlier months. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though the labor market remains extremely weak, the April payroll figures were less disastrous than those of the first three months of the year, when a total of more than two million jobs were lost. Economists saw signs that the pace of job loss would continue to moderate, not least because most of the effects of the federal stimulus plan have yet to be felt.

HEADLINE: Inside the List

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
NUDGEONOMICS I: ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness,'' by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, has been inching up the paperback nonfiction extended list, landing at No. 22 this week. Don't be fooled by the punchy cover and boldly Gladwellian title -- the book (originally published by Yale University Press) is short on connectors and coolhunters and long on anecdotes about Swedish pension systems, organ donation waiting lists and other wonky but fascinating subjects. Still, ''Nudge'' has gotten a boost from thought leaders as diverse as Barack Obama (who tapped Sunstein to lead the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) and Kathie Lee Gifford. When Gifford spotted the book in a recent ''Today'' show lineup of spring must-reads, she growled, ''This needs a nudge!'' and flicked it onto the ground, replacing it with her opus ''Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg.'' Gifford's book, which apparently does not refer to 401(k) contributions or new F.D.A. rules about chicken farming, drops to No. 17 on the extended hardcover list this week. The wisdom of the market in action? 
 NUDGEONOMICS II: If television personalities aren't showing ''Nudge'' the love, politicians sure are. In a recent cover article titled ''Nudge-ocracy,'' The New Republic examined the way ''Nudge''-type thinking -- which holds that policymakers can improve people's choices by tweaking the ''architecture'' of the decision -- has penetrated all areas of the Obama administration's policy, from the banking bailout plan to its proposals on carbon emissions and health care. Meanwhile, over in Britain, Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago and a founder of the subfield of behavioral economics, has gotten all nudgy with the Conservative leader David Cameron. American Democrats, British Tories: which side is ''Nudge'' on? Thaler has described his notion of ''libertarian paternalism'' as ''beyond left and right -- it uses right-wing means to achieve progressive ends.'' One Tory policy adviser put it more grandiosely, telling The Guardian that ''behavioral economics might be our equivalent of [Gordon] Brown's neoclassical endogenous growth theory.'' A blurb for the inevitable movie tie-in edition?
 NUDGEONOMICS III: O.K., what's really in this ''Nudge'' stuff for you and me? In a new ''bonus chapter,'' Thaler and Sunstein include a list of 20 new ''nudges'' suggested by readers of their Nudge blog (nudges.wordpress.com). They include urinals dotted with fake flies (to encourage better aim) and a ''procrastinator's clock'' that would be fast by a constantly shifting number of minutes. I particularly like this one: Instead of opening with the generally bogus promise ''I'll be brief,'' public speakers should say, ''Please interrupt me if I speak for more than X minutes.'' Come to think of it, this is great advice for nattering celebrity authors. That means you, Tori Spelling! Her book ''Mommywood'' is trending mercifully Kathie Lee Gifford-ward, dropping to No. 6.

HEADLINE: Republican Orthodoxy and the G.O.P. Center

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Hole in the Center'' (column, The New York Times on the Web, May 5):
 Ross Douthat calls ''making sure that the dollars keep flowing to their constituents back home'' the ''highest allegiance'' of moderate Republican senators in the Northeast and considers these senators ''intellectually vacuous.'' 
 He prefers that Republican senators stay true to the ideals of small government and trickle-down economics, which still keeps the dollars flowing to the constituents but guided to the wealthy. 
 Republicans seem to have forgotten the larger goal: the good life. They need to find solutions to real problems, not all these invented fantasies of Communist infiltration, Jack Bauer ticking time bombs and marriage threatened by, of all things, love. 
 Republicans aren't starving the beast that is government to the size where they can drown it in a bathtub; they are starving America to the point where New Orleans can be decimated by one storm. 
 Ideology should serve only as an adviser, not as the answer to every problem. Allowing ideology to rule over the real situation on the ground is ''intellectually vacuous.''
 Daniel Newsome Elizaville, N.Y., May 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat's criticism of Senators Arlen Specter, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins is so lacking in specifics that it's hard to know what his problem is with them. But the key is found in the assertion that their votes for President Obama's stimulus package ''tells you most of what you need to know about their supposed fiscal conservatism.''
 So ''a better sort of centrist'' sees tax cuts as the solution to every fiscal problem, it would appear, no matter the urgency of the crisis. The ''innovation'' Mr. Douthat calls for within the Republican Party is great, he suggests, as long this bit of conservative orthodoxy survives.
 His coming race aside, isn't this exactly why Senator Specter felt he had to leave the Republican Party? 
 Niels Aaboe New York, May 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 If the Republican Party wants to be defined by issues from the conservative right, then it will surely see more defections like that of Senator Arlen Specter. 
 The world is changing, and if we want a viable two-party system, the Republicans should re-evaluate their principles instead of trying to pound an increasingly large square peg into a shrinking round hole.

HEADLINE: Stimulus to Pay for More Summer Jobs

BYLINE: By KAREN ZRAICK

 BODY:
Citing the soaring unemployment rate among New York teenagers and young adults, state and city officials announced on Saturday that money from the federal stimulus program would be used to expand the number of summer jobs. 
 Gov. David A. Paterson said $18.5 million would be directed to the city so it can offer 51,000 jobs, an increase of 8,000 from last year. 
 ''Spring is job-hunting season,'' said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who joined Mr. Paterson and other elected officials at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan to provide details of the jobs program. ''But as we know, these are not the best of times when it comes to landing work.'' 
 The program has already received 81,000 applications, said Jeanne B. Mullgrav, commissioner of the Department of Youth and Community Development. Participants earn the minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, and attend workshops on topics like financial literacy and job preparedness. Employers include city agencies and nonprofit groups as well as private companies, which are eligible to receive tax credits for hiring low-income youth.
 ''What is unique about this particular endeavor,'' Mr. Paterson said, ''is that rather than the normal jobs that young people have working in pools and parks and beaches, we will expand those opportunities to work with community organizations and businesses.'' 
 The unemployment rate in New York City among 16- to 19-year-olds has doubled in the past year to 22 percent, Mr. Paterson said, adding that federal stimulus money will allow the state to increase its own job-creation programs. 
 Without the additional money, the city would have been forced to reduce the number of summer jobs this year, Mr. Bloomberg said.
 The increased financing also allowed the city to raise the age limit for applicants to 24 from 21 as a way to help college students. The program will accept applications until May 15. Applications are available at schools and libraries and online at www.nyc.gov/dycd.
 Michael Udensi, 17, a high school senior from Queens, said he gained skills and confidence working two years ago in the office of a state senator. 
 ''I realize that I am capable of achieving whatever I set my mind to,'' he said as he stood in front of Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Paterson. Michael has submitted his application for this summer, he said, and he is waiting to hear back.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls For Changes On Card Fees

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Saturday called on Congress to pass a bill intended to stop credit card companies from imposing certain late fees.
 Saying that he is focusing on ''clearing away the wreckage of this recession,'' Mr. Obama focused his weekly radio address on the credit card legislation in Congress. 
 ''Americans know that they have a responsibility to live within their means and pay what they owe,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But they also have a right to not get ripped off by the sudden rate hikes, unfair penalties and hidden fees that have become all too common to our credit card industry.''
 Mr. Obama will hold a town-hall-style meeting on Thursday in New Mexico to promote the legislation, White House officials said. The House has passed its bill; a slightly different version awaits action by the full Senate. 
 American banks are facing new rules issued by the Federal Reserve that are intended to prevent abusive credit card practices. The rules are supposed to be put in place by July 2010; several lawmakers and consumer groups say that is too late to help people who are struggling now.
 The credit card bill would try to remedy that by codifying the rules now. It would, among other things, make it illegal to market the cards to minors.
 ''You shouldn't have to fear that any new credit card is going to come with strings attached,'' Mr. Obama said, ''nor should you need a magnifying glass and a reference book to read a credit card application.''
 ''It is past time for rules that are fair and transparent,'' he added.
 Mr. Obama said he was calling on Congress ''to take final action to pass a credit card reform bill that protects American consumers so that I can sign it into law by Memorial Day.''
 ''There is no time for delay,'' he said. ''We need a durable and successful flow of credit in our economy, but we can't tolerate profits that depend on misleading working families. Those days are over.''

HEADLINE: Dwindling, G.O.P. Won't Look Inward

BYLINE: By MARK PAZNIOKAS

DATELINE: Hartford 

 BODY:
 ON June 4, Newt Gingrich is to address a shrinking Connecticut Republican Party that has sworn off God, guns and gays as wedge issues and rallied around the Yankee ideals of ''common sense'' and ''fiscal responsibility.''
 Not exactly bumper-sticker material. But this is a state where the G.O.P. has badly withered as Republicans in other states thrived using gay marriage, abortion and the death penalty to energize social conservatives and twice elect George W. Bush as president. 
 The percentage of Republican voters in the state has dropped in each of the past 15 years, leaving Democrats with a 730,338 to 427,110 advantage, according to state voter registration information. Unaffiliated voters number 884,023.
 Today only 1 in 5 Connecticut voters are registered Republicans, a 20 percent drop since 1994, when Mr. Gingrich was a Georgia congressman leading Republicans out of the wilderness to their first United States House majority in 40 years.
 Republicans lost their last Congressional seat last year. Their 37 members in the 151-seat State House of Representatives are the fewest since the post-Watergate landslide of 1974 left them with 33 seats. In the State Senate, they hold 12 of 36 seats.
 ''The few Republicans who are left are like this boat in the middle of the ocean, and they are lost,'' said Roy Occhiogrosso, a Democratic consultant who came of age during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, when Democrats felt similarly adrift.
 Republicans concede to being badly outnumbered as they gear up for the 2010 elections, when their only statewide office-holders, Gov. M. Jodi Rell and Lt. Gov. Michael C. Fedele, will be up for re-election.
 They applaud the recent efforts by national leaders to explore how the party should respond to the 2008 losses, as well as ways to reach out to moderates in the wake of the defection by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to the Democratic Party.
 But they say they feel no need for introspection.
 ''I don't think that the Republican brand in Connecticut necessarily needs to change,'' said John McKinney of Fairfield, the Republican minority leader of the State Senate. ''It's a brand of fiscal responsibility, of trying to grow our economy, making sure Connecticut continues to work for its citizens. It's a brand of social moderation. It's a brand of strong environmental protections.''
 Lawrence F. Cafero Jr. of Norwalk, the Republican minority leader of the State House, said he has confidence in his party's message, even though the G.O.P. has lost State House seats in the last three elections. He blamed the national party's image and recent federal elections for the setbacks.
 ''It just totally drowned out what we as Connecticut State Republicans stood for and, more importantly, actually accomplished,'' he said. ''I think over the past two years, and certainly continuing into this session, we have tried to position ourselves as the party of common sense.'' 
 In 2007 legislative Republicans took credit for persuading Mrs. Rell to give up an income-tax increase she proposed to finance state aid for local education. At the party's annual fund-raiser, the Prescott S. Bush Dinner, Mr. Cafero was treated to louder applause than the governor.
 Mrs. Rell, who has done little to expand the party's base, skipped the dinner last year. A spokesman said she intends to be in Stamford for the event on June 4, when Mr. Gingrich will be the featured speaker.
 Mr. Gingrich, who has not renounced cultural issues, may be slightly off message. On his Web site, he wrote, ''There is no attack on American culture more destructive and more historically dishonest than the secular Left's relentless effort to drive God out of America's public square.''
 That is not a Republican talking point in Connecticut.
 Republicans here would rather talk about tax policy, which is setting up as the only wedge issue from this year's state legislative session. State lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn their session the night before Mr. Gingrich's speech.
 The Democratic majority says the state's deficit, which is estimated at $8.7 billion over the next two years, cannot be closed without a multibillion-dollar tax raise. Republicans say the gap can be closed with deep spending cuts, including employee concessions and an early retirement plan.
 Connecticut Republicans choose to de-emphasize them, but some of their starkest differences with Democrats can be found in votes on social issues like same-sex marriage and the death penalty.
 In 2005, Republicans in the House voted 48 to 4 against repealing the death penalty. Democrats voted 56 to 41 to repeal it, but it failed. Another bill to repeal it is expected to come up this year.
 Last month, Republicans in the House voted 27 to 9 against a bill codifying a court decision legalizing gay marriage. Democrats voted in favor, 91 to 17.
 ''I really don't think those issues win or lose elections,'' said Christopher Healy, the Republican state chairman.
 Last week, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, led a brainstorming session about how the Republican Party needs to position itself nationally. He seemed to step back from the party's past reliance on social issues -- and gave a nod to the party's neglected cousins in New England.
 On CNN, Mr. Cantor said that the party needs to be ''relevant to the challenges that people in the Northeast are facing; to the challenges that educated, affluent people are facing; to the challenges that people in the inner city and African-Americans are facing.''
 ''I think what Eric Cantor is doing is great,'' said Rob Simmons of Stonington, a Republican congressman who lost his Second District seat by 83 votes in 2006, a loss he attributed to the unpopularity of the Bush administration.
 Mr. Simmons, who is running for the United States Senate next year, said he was encouraged by the Republicans' shift in emphasis from social issues to the ballooning federal debt as President Obama and the Democratic Congress try to stimulate the economy.
 ''What really excites me is that on April 15 we had tea parties all over Connecticut,'' Mr. Simmons said, referring to antitax protests. ''People are frustrated.'' 
 They were frustrated in 1991, when the Democratic majority joined with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, to enact Connecticut's first broad-based tax on wages. More than 40,000 protesters gathered on the lawn of the State Capitol to hang Mr. Weicker in effigy. 
 The next year, Republicans gained only three seats in the General Assembly. The balance of power remained unchanged.

HEADLINE: Global Health Priorities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Seeks a Global Health Plan Broader Than Bush's AIDS Effort'' (news article, May 6): 
 President Obama plans to backtrack from a campaign pledge on significantly increased global AIDS financing. Planned increases for other areas in global health, while welcome, fall far short of the investments required to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals despite the president's express commitment to them. 
 As the economic downturn forces the administration to rethink priorities, global health must not -- and in a multitrillion-dollar budget need not -- lose out. This economic crisis will cause many people pain, but it need not cause death. Most people will weather this economic storm. 
 But if the United States fails to make the necessary investments in global health, there will be needless, avoidable and extensive loss of life -- people who will not even survive to see the end of this storm. 
 Fiscal responsibility cannot and should not be restored at the expense of the health of the world's poorest and most marginalized citizens.
 Eric A. Friedman Washington, May 6, 2009
 The writer is senior global health policy adviser at Physicians for Human Rights.

HEADLINE: Essence of the Architect

BYLINE: By MARTIN FILLER. 
Martin Filler is a longtime contributor to The New York Review of Books and the author of ''Makers of Modern Architecture.''

 BODY:
CONVERSATIONS WITH FRANK GEHRY
 By Barbara Isenberg
 Illustrated. 290 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $40
 When architects cannot erect they write, and thus we can expect an imminent increase in publications by underemployed practitioners of the building art. However, good times or bad, producing books has been mandatory for architects ever since the modernist masters (and masterly self-publicists) Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier committed their ideas as well as their plans to print.
 Frank Gehry, the most acclaimed American architect since Wright, is not a natural-born writer. To satisfy the considerable demand for personal explications of his work, Gehry, who turned 80 in February, has avoided the agony of authorship and cooperated with several interviewers on transcribed texts during the past decade. The best of them -- the architectural historian Kurt Forster's ''Frank O. Gehry/Kurt W. Forster'' and the curator Mildred Friedman's ''Gehry Talks'' (both released in 1999) -- contain valuable insights into the subject's idiosyncratic approach to a profession he has recast as an experimental art form and advanced as a technical discipline. 
 Barbara Isenberg's ''Conversations With Frank Gehry'' is the latest attempt to elicit the essence of his creative method in his own words. Isenberg, a Los Angeles-based writer on the arts, exhibits neither Forster's intellectual sheen nor Friedman's comprehensive expertise, but nonetheless offers worthwhile new information for architecture devotees and an engaging introduction for general readers. 
 Doubtless eager to remain in her subject's good graces, Isenberg poses few questions of the confrontational sort that wise interrogators withhold until the end of a session, lest they be shown the door. For example, from her upbeat recapitulation of Gehry's Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn -- a large-scale mixed-use urban redevelopment centered on a professional basketball arena -- you'd never know that the scheme has aroused heated opposition from community groups and planning experts, or that its future is imperiled by the current economic crisis. 
 Isenberg is no Oriana Fallaci, that fearless guerrilla of take-no-prisoners Q. and A., but she occasionally goads her subject into revealing responses. For example, Gehry (ne Goldberg) is vexed by her query about his adopted surname. He defensively counters that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn also assumed new nomenclature, and wonders, ''Why are people so interested in the name change?'' -- an odd complaint from the biggest name in contemporary architecture. 
 Until the stupendous success of Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao -- which opened in 1997 and rendered his false modesty preposterous -- the architect cultivated the persona of a neurotic bumbler much like Woody Allen. In ''Conversations With Frank Gehry,'' he finally admits it was just a pose. As he explains, ''Architects in New York . . . were kind of attracted to me as long as I was subordinate to them. As soon as I came out with work that got attention, there was kind of a backlash from them. . . . They think I'm an 'aw shucks' guy and then I turn out to be every bit as ambitious as they are.'' 
 Isenberg begins her chronological account David Copperfield style, with Gehry's childhood in a Toronto working-class Jewish family. When he was 18, the Goldbergs resettled in Los Angeles and could not have picked a better environment for a nascent architect. The city has been more hospitable to design innovation than any other American metropolis, thanks to a benign climate that forgives inexpensive materials, an open-minded citizenry receptive to new forms of domestic living, and an air of creative freedom antithetical to the conformist tendencies of mainstream architectural firms in New York and Chicago.
 Gehry was doubly fortunate to have been trained at the University of Southern California, where the first-rate architecture department sought inspiration in Pacific Rim paradigms instead of European precedents favored at East Coast institutions. Los Angeles also provided the Canadian emigre with a parallel education in American popular culture, typified by the region's cheap but gutsy ''dingbat'' construction vernacular and personified by the Hollywood stars Gehry was bedazzled by and subsequently befriended. 
 ''One night we saw Jennifer Jones get out of a limo,'' he recalls, ''and I thought how elegant she was; years later, I was doing her house, and I told her that story.'' Gehry drops stellar names with a frequency made tolerable by his lack of boastfulness. ''I don't know what to make of fame,'' he insists. ''I see somebody like Brad Pitt, who I know, and what he goes through, and I wouldn't want to go through that. . . . I only get maybe 1 percent of that, and it's scary already.''
 All that notwithstanding, Gehry indicates why hanging out with the rich and famous can help an architect's business. During a trip to Bilbao, Gehry was dragooned by Thomas Krens, mastermind of the New York Guggenheim's Basque country offshoot, into joining an all-star motorcycle posse with Jeremy Irons, Diane Von Furstenberg and Barry Diller. Gehry reconnected with Von Furstenberg, who served on the board of the American Center in Paris, which he designed. She introduced him to Diller, her entertainment-mogul husband, who later asked Gehry to build the IAC headquarters in New York. (That pairing was brokered by the real estate developer Marshall Rose: ''I had known his wife, Candy Bergen, for many years,'' Gehry notes.)
 Things weren't so easy before Gehry ascended to celebrity heaven. Starting in 1965, he executed a highly creditable series of jobs for America's most enlightened postwar commercial builder, James Rouse. But the architect craved artistic status of a sort he'd never win as a developer's hired hand, and severed that lucrative connection. 
 Gehry broke out with an audacious 1977-78 remake of a Santa Monica bungalow for himself and his young second family. He enmeshed the pink-shingled exterior in chain-link fencing and corrugated steel, impaled it with an angular wire-glass skylight and exposed the interior's wooden lath like a Gordon Matta-Clark house-deconstruction sculpture. This residential bombshell nailed Gehry's avant-garde credentials but left establishment patrons baffled or disgusted. He lost the commission for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles to the Japanese newcomer Arata Isozaki and seemed destined for another humiliating local rejection when a new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was announced in the late 1980s.
 Gehry recounts a nightmarish evening while that coveted assignment hung in the balance. Jennifer Jones and her second husband, the conglomerateur and art collector Norton Simon, invited him to their birthday party for David Niven, where the host promoted Gehry to Dorothy Chandler, the imperious dowager of Los Angeles philanthropy. ''I don't like his work,'' Chandler sniffed. ''And he will not be considered to design a concert hall.'' Another guest disparaged a nearby Gehry house with a crude epithet, and a servant spilled a tray of buttered vegetables onto the hapless architect.
 Alas, Chandler didn't live long enough to witness the triumphant opening of Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003. Sited across the street from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Gehry's pitch-perfect auditorium and the voluptuous forms that envelop it consigned Chandler's prissy sub-classical bandbox and its notoriously dead acoustics to the dustbin of architectural (and musical) history. Disney Hall furthermore proved that Bilbao was no fluke, and that Gehry could never have prevailed without a careerist drive as ferocious as his formidable talent.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a review on May 10 about ''Conversations With Frank Gehry,'' by Barbara Isenberg, referred incorrectly to the art collector Norton Simon, a promoter of Gehry's work. He was Jennifer Jones's third husband, not the second. (That was David O. Selznick.)

HEADLINE: The American Press on Suicide Watch

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IF you wanted to pick the moment when the American news business went on suicide watch, it was almost exactly three years ago. That's when Stephen Colbert, appearing at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, delivered a monologue accusing his hosts of being stenographers who had, in essence, let the Bush White House get away with murder (or at least the war in Iraq). To prove the point, the partying journalists in the Washington Hilton ballroom could be seen (courtesy of C-Span) fawning over government potentates -- in some cases the very ''sources'' who had fed all those fictional sightings of Saddam Hussein's W.M.D. 
 Colbert's routine did not kill. The Washington Post reported that it ''fell flat.'' The Times initially did not even mention it. But to the Beltway's bafflement, Colbert's riff went viral overnight, ultimately to have a marathon run as the most popular video on iTunes. The cultural disconnect between the journalism establishment and the public it aspires to serve could not have been more vividly dramatized. 
 The bad news about the news business has accelerated ever since. Newspaper circulations and revenues are in free fall. Legendary brands from The Los Angeles Times to The Philadelphia Inquirer are teetering. The New York Times Company threatened to close The Boston Globe if its employees didn't make substantial sacrifices in salaries and benefits. Otherpapershave died. The reporting ranks on network and local news alike are shriveling. You know it's bad when the Senate is moved, as it was last week, to weigh in with hearings on ''The Future of Journalism.'' 
 Not all is bleak on the Titanic, however. The White House correspondents' bacchanal was on tap for this weekend. And this time no one could accuse the revelers of failing to get down with the Colbert-iTunes-Facebook young folk: hip big-time journalists now stroke their fans with 140-character messages on Twitter. Or did. No sooner did boldface Washington media personalities ostentatiously embrace Twitter than Nielsen reported that more than 60 percent of Twitter users abandon it after a single month.
 The causes of journalism's downfall -- some self-inflicted, some beyond anyone's control (a worldwide economic meltdown) -- are well known. To time-travel back to the dawn of the technological strand of the disaster, search YouTube for ''1981 primitive Internet report on KRON.'' What you'll find is a 28-year-old local television news piece from San Francisco about a ''far-fetched,'' pre-Web experiment by the city's two papers, The Chronicle and The Examiner, to distribute their wares to readers with home computers via primitive phone modems. Though there were at most 3,000 people in the Bay Area with PCs then, some 500 mailed in coupons for the service to The Chronicle alone. But, as the anchorwoman assures us at the end, with a two-hour download time (at $5 an hour), ''the new telepaper won't be much competition for the 20-cent street edition.''
 The rest is irreversible history. This far-fetched newspaper experiment soon faded, even in San Francisco, the gateway to Silicon Valley. Today The Examiner, once the flagship of William Randolph Hearst's grand journalistic empire, exists in name only, as a flimsy giveaway. The Chronicle is under threat of closure. 
 But this self-destructive retreat from innovation is hardly novel in the history of American communications. In the last transformative tech revolution before the Internet -- television's emergence in the late 1940s -- the pattern was remarkably similar. The entertainment industry referred to TV as ''the monster,'' and by 1951, the editor of the industry's trade paper, Variety, was fearful that the monster would ''eventually swallow up practically all of show business.'' Movies had killed vaudeville a generation earlier. This new household appliance threatened to strangle radio, movies, the Broadway theater, nightclubs and the circus. And newspapers too: ''NBC's New 'Today' Attacked by Papers as Competition'' screamed a front-page Variety headline in 1952. 
 The vulnerable establishments in all these fields went nuts. Most movie studios pushed back against the future by refusing to sell their old movies to television or allow their stars to appear on it. Few seized the opportunity to produce programs for the new medium. Instead, some moguls tried to compete by exhibiting sports events by closed-circuit in networks of movie houses. In 1952-53, Cinerama, 3-D and Cinemascope were all heavily promoted to try to retain movie audiences. None of these desperate rear-guard actions could slow the video revolution. Movie newsreels, movie palaces, radio comedy and drama, and afternoon newspapers, among other staples of the American cultural diet, were all doomed.
 And yet in 2009, Hollywood movie studios, radio and the Broadway theater, though smaller and much changed, are not dead. They learned to adapt and to collaborate with the monster.
 In the Internet era, many sectors of American media have been re-enacting their at first complacent and finally panicked behavior of 60 years ago. Few in the entertainment business saw the digital cancer spreading through their old business models until well after file-sharing, via Napster, had started decimating the music industry. It's not only journalism that is now struggling to plot a path to survival. But, with all due respect to show business, it's only journalism that's essential to a functioning democracy. And it's not just because -- as we keep being tediously reminded -- Thomas Jefferson said so.
 Yes, journalists have made tons of mistakes and always will. But without their enterprise, to take a few representative recent examples, we would not have known about the wretched conditions for our veterans at Walter Reed, the government's warrantless wiretapping, the scams at Enron or steroids in baseball.
 Such news gathering is not to be confused with opinion writing or bloviating -- including that practiced here. Opinions can be stimulating and, for the audiences at Fox News and MSNBC, cathartic. We can spend hours surfing the posts of bloggers we like or despise, some of them gems, even as we might be moved to write our own blogs about local restaurants or the government documents we obsessively study online. 
 But opinions, however insightful or provocative and whether expressed online or in print or in prime time, are cheap. Reporting the news can be expensive. Some of it -- monitoring the local school board, say -- can and is being done by voluntary ''citizen journalists'' with time on their hands, integrity and a Web site. But we can't have serious opinions about America's role in combating the Taliban in Pakistan unless brave and knowledgeable correspondents (with security to protect them) tell us in real time what is actually going on there. We can't know what is happening behind closed doors at corrupt, hard-to-penetrate institutions in Washington or Wall Street unless teams of reporters armed with the appropriate technical expertise and assiduously developed contacts are digging night and day. Those reporters have to eat and pay rent, whether they work for print, a TV network, a Web operation or some new bottom-up news organism we can't yet imagine.
 It's immaterial whether we find the fruits of their labors on paper, a laptop screen, a BlackBerry, a Kindle or podcast. But someone -- and certainly not the government, with all its conflicted interests -- must pay for this content and make every effort to police its fairness and accuracy. If we lose the last major news-gathering operations still standing, there will be no news on Google News unless Google shells out to replace them. It won't. 
 One of the freshest commentators on Internet culture, Clay Shirky, has written, correctly, that nobody really knows what form journalism will take in the evolving post-newspaper era. Looking back to the unpredictable social and cultural upheavals brought about by Gutenberg's invention of movable type, he writes, ''We're collectively living through 1500, when it's easier to see what's broken than what will replace it.'' So who will do the heavy journalistic lifting? ''Whatever works.'' Every experiment must be tried, professional and amateur, whether by institutions like The Times or ''some 19-year-old kid few of us have heard of.''
 What can't be reinvented is the wheel of commerce. Just because information wants to be free on the Internet doesn't mean it can always be free. Web advertising will never be profitable enough to support ambitious news gathering. If a public that thinks nothing of spending money on texting or pornography doesn't foot the bill for such reportage, it won't happen. 
 That's why the debate among journalists about possible forms of payment (subscriptions, NPR-style donations, iTunes-style micropayments, foundation grants) is inside baseball. So is the acrimonious sniping between old media and new. The real question is for the public, not journalists: Does it want to pony up for news, whatever the media that prevail? 
 It's all a matter of priorities. Not long ago, we laughed at the idea of pay TV. Free television was considered an inalienable American right (as long as it was paid for by advertisers). Then cable and satellite became the national standard.
 By all means let's mock the old mainstream media as they preen and party on in a Washington ballroom. Let's deplore the tabloid journalism that, like the cockroach, will always be with us. But if a comprehensive array of real news is to be part of the picture as well, the time will soon arrive for us to put up or shut up. Whatever shape journalism ultimately takes in America, make no mistake that in the end we will get what we pay for.

HEADLINE: A Cablevision Customer Grabs the Clicker

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A flicker of hope was spotted over the dark hulk of Madison Square Garden the other day upon the disclosure that Cablevision was considering spinning off the Knicks and the Rangers.
 For a brief moment, this news was as hope-inspiring in its own way as the sighting of LeBron James shopping for a townhouse in the historic Chelsea district would be. This revelation set off frissons of optimism, akin to Mark Messier's discovering the fountain of youth, and having enough potion left over for Wayne Gretzky, both of them hankering for a Simon and Garfunkel reunion at the world's most mediocre arena. 
 Against their better judgment, Knicks fans and Rangers fans dared hope for something more than the false glimmers of improvement that tantalize New York fans in the dead of winter. 
 But every year, before it gets to be really springtime in these parts, fans of the back-and-forth sports (as Red Smith called them) realize that hope was illusive, that they are in the grips of perpetual darkness, as manifested in the Dolan touch.
 The spinoff may just be a corporate version of the head fakes that used to make good old Patrick Ewing leave his feet while his man banked an easy layup. Remember that? Corporations do pump fakes, too. Gotcha. 
 Then came reality. The Dolans and their Cablevision empire are probably just messing with our minds, establishing a value for their various assets in this fluid post-Greenspan, post-Lehman Brothers, post-Madoff market.
 The most depressing news of all for sports fans was the possibility that the Dolans might just as soon keep the Madison Square Garden enterprise for the son and heir James L. Dolan while selling off the Cablevision end of the business. 
 Under Dolan the Younger, the Knicks once again did not make the playoffs this spring while the Rangers self-destructed in the first round, after firing one coach to bring in another one who got rattled in the postseason. Brilliant. Because there are no term limits for Dolan, as there blessedly have been for certain other scions one could name, presumably the Knicks and the Rangers exist to keep him busy into old age. 
 Even in this wounded economy, there must be somebody else who could afford to take a crack at improving the Knicks and the Rangers. Dolan did air out the place after the Isiah Thomas fiasco by bringing in Donnie Walsh and Mike D'Antoni, who gave off a sense of competence. Let them be competent in somebody else's stewardship. 
 As one of Cablevision's customers on Long Island, I sometimes see flickers of improvement in their basic service. When something knocks my multiple clickers out of alignment, I can dial up Cablevision, and a live human actually answers and tells me how to get back to all the junk on most of their channels. They are getting the knack of answering the telephone, I will give them that.
 But I despair of the Dolans ever getting anything really right for long. Here's a case in point: last November, on the morning after Thanksgiving, we got up in the darkness and performed the great American ritual of buying a major appliance -- in this case, a high-definition television set. We even succeeded in linking the new set into the Cablevision system, to discover the most marvelous programming, called VOOM HD. Where had this been all our lives?
 For a month, my wife and I sat and watched operas and museums and travelogues, in the most gorgeous colors and details, but the best show of all was something called ''Artland USA,'' in which two knowledgeable hosts roamed this huge, weird nation, finding art from the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, white with foam. God bless America, indeed. There were lunatics everywhere, creating art with used tires, empty beer cans, rocks and driftwood, oil paint and watercolors.
 In my home den, in the company of my wife, I was transfixed by the creativity of the artists, but also, I will confess, with the wry smile and quick wit (and long legs) of one of the hosts, Mame McCutchin. Then one night in late December, ''Artland'' vanished, along with Mame and her co-host, Charles Luxton. Gone with the wind. Like Patrick. Like Oak. Like Starks. Like Van Gundy. Like Marv. Like Messier. Like Richter. Just gone. 
 Turned out Cablevision had lost a ton of money (I've seen estimates of $45 million to $65 million) because, allegedly, other systems did not subscribe to the 15 channels on VOOM HD. I'll leave that to the lawyers. 
 To Knicks fans, of course, those numbers are nothing. The Knicks have blown more money on obtuse general managers, obsolete coaches, nimwit point guards and lumbering centers. Here they had some sensational programming but not the commitment to stick with it. What does that say for the future of the Knicks and the Rangers? 
 Turns out Mame is still out there, being quirky, via a Web site, alareiks.blogspot.com. And Cablevision still does what it does, spinning this way, spinning that way, like a willy-nilly corporate version of Stephon Marbury. Cablevision claims it had a good first quarter and is now performing head fakes for the business community. It's early May. Does anybody know where New York's winter teams are?

HEADLINE: Banks Brace for Credit Card Write-Offs

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
It used to be easy to guess how many Americans would have problems paying their credit card bills. Banks just looked at unemployment: Fewer jobs meant more trouble ahead.
The unemployment rate has long mirrored banks' loss rates on card balances. But Eddie Ward, 32 and jobless, may be one reason that rule of thumb no longer holds. For many lenders, losses are now starting to outpace layoffs.
Mr. Ward, of Arkansas, lost his job at a retail warehouse in April and so far has managed to make minimum payments on his credit card debt, which he estimates at $15,000 to $20,000. Asked whether he thinks he will be able to pay off his balance, he said, ''Not unless I win the lottery.''
In the meantime, he said, ''I'm just doing what I can.'' 
Experts predict that millions of Americans will not be able to pay off their debts, leaving a gaping hole at ailing banks still trying to recover from the housing bust.
The bank stress test results, released Thursday, suggested that the nation's 19 biggest banks could expect nearly $82.4 billion in credit card losses by the end of 2010 under what federal regulators called an adverse economic situation.
But if unemployment breaches 10 percent, as many economists predict, the rate of uncollectible balances at some banks could far exceed that level. At American Express and Capital One Financial, around 20 percent of the credit card balances are expected to go bad over this year and next, according to stress test results. At Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, about 23 percent of card loans are expected to sour.
Even the government's grim projections may vastly understate the size of the banks' credit card troubles. According to estimates by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, card losses at the nation's biggest banks could reach $141.5 billion by 2010 if the regulators' loss rate was applied to their entire credit card business. It could top $186 billion for the entire credit card industry.
In the official stress test results, regulators published losses only on credit cards held on bank balance sheets. The $82.4 billion figure did not reflect another element in their analysis: tens of billions of dollars in losses tied to credit card loans that the banks packaged into bonds and held off their balance sheets. A portion of those losses, however, will be absorbed by outside investors.
What is more, the peak unemployment level that regulators used to drive their loss estimates is roughly what current rates are on track to reach. That suggests that if the unemployment rate gets much worse, credit card losses could be worse than what regulators projected.
And many economists expect the number of job losses to climb even higher. On Friday, the unemployment rate reached 8.9 percent as the economy shed 539,000 jobs. The unemployment rate and the rate of credit card charge-offs, or uncollectible balances, have been aligned because consumers who lose their jobs are more likely to miss payments.
Banks wrote off an average of 5.5 percent of their credit card balances in 2008, while the average unemployment rate was 5.8 percent. By the end of the year, the rate of credit-card write-offs was 6.3 percent; more recent data was not available.
Experts predict that the rate of credit-card losses could eventually surpass the jobless rate because of the compounding effects of the housing crisis and lackluster consumer confidence. Shortly after the technology bubble burst in 2001, credit card loss rates peaked at 7.9 percent.
''We will blow right through it,'' said Inderpreet Batra, a consultant at Oliver Wyman, which specializes in financial services.
Unlike in prior recessions, cardholders who recently lost their jobs are unlikely to be able to extract equity from their homes or draw down retirement accounts to help pay off their debts. That means borrowers who fall behind on their bills are more likely to default, leading to higher losses.
After writing off about $45 billion in bad debts during 2008, credit card lenders are bracing for the worst year in the industry's history. Not only are losses spiraling, but also lawmakers are on the verge of passing a set of tough new consumer protections that could have a devastating effect on profits. This week, the Senate is expected to take up the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights after the measure passed in the House with a strong bipartisan vote of 357 to 70.
Over the weekend, President Obama pressed lawmakers to approve the new rules, which would curb the ability of card issuers to raise interest rates retroactively on consumers and would require them to reduce hidden fees and penalties. He hopes to sign the legislation by Memorial Day.
For the banks, the economics of the credit card business are increasingly troubling. As the recession has dragged on, cardholders have sharply reduced spending. New customers with strong credit histories are increasingly hard to find.
And the most troubled borrowers are so deeply mired in debt that card companies are willing to strike deals to remove late fees and reduce card loan balances. The average American household is saddled with nearly $8,400 of credit card and other revolving debt, according to Moody's Economy.com.
Every major credit card issuer has been approving fewer new applicants, reining in credit lines and canceling unused accounts. And Meredith A. Whitney, a prominent banking analyst, expects credit card lenders to cut the lines of credit they extend to borrowers by a total of $2.7 trillion through 2010. That is equivalent to a 57 percent reduction in the credit they made available two years ago at the height of the boom.
Within the card industry, all eyes are now focused on the sharp increase in unemployment. At Citigroup, executives noted that the company's 10.2 percent credit card charge-off rate for the first quarter had broken its ''historic correlation with unemployment'' and showed no sign of letting up.
American Express, Bank of America and Capital One Financial showed first-quarter loss rates that hovered around 8.5 percent, roughly tracking the unemployment rate. All three said they expected higher losses in the coming months. Even Chase Card Services, which charged off just 7.7 percent of its card loans in the first quarter, expects its loss levels to surpass unemployment by the end of the year.
Card executives say there will little improvement until the economy stabilizes and consumers are more optimistic.
Cindy Schneider of Connecticut, 53, is a long way from being confident about her finances.
She is not making any money from her job as a real estate agent and cannot find work elsewhere. Her husband's pay was just cut 10 percent. And she worries about how they will pay off a $5,000 balance on their credit card.
When her credit card company recently raised her interest rates, saying she was three days late with a payment, Ms. Schneider transferred the balance to another card with a lower rate.
''We are borrowing from Peter to pay Paul,'' she said.

DEAR DIARY:
 Almost 28 years ago, we were married at the Greek Orthodox cathedral on East 74th Street. We had hired a hansom cab to carry us after the ceremony through Central Park to our reception at the Tavern on the Green.
 As we neared the restaurant, our driver noticed Mayor Edward I. Koch and a small entourage walking toward the restaurant. The driver slowed down a little to time it perfectly: The mayor arrived at precisely the moment we did. 
 As I stepped down from the carriage, the mayor -- never one to miss a photo-op -- gallantly assisted me down and asked, ''May I be the first to kiss the bride?'' Amid the cameras clicking, my new father-in-law was heard: ''You've got the Greek vote!'' Well, maybe he got the vote, but I had a joyful moment in the spotlight with the charismatic Mayor Koch. 
 We have since moved to Florida, but that remains one of the fondest memories of my 30 years in Manhattan.

 Dear Diary:
 As I left the 42nd Street library late one afternoon during rush hour, I saw what appeared to be a homeless man standing on the corner. I eyed him as I waited for the light to change.
 He was over six feet tall, with wild hair and tattered clothes and wearing a huge wall-to-wall grin. And he had a twinkle in his eye.
 There must have been at least 20 people waiting on the corner, but no one else seemed to notice him.
 He stood as still as a statue -- holding a small white sign with something written on it in black felt-tip marker. I was about 10 feet away and squinted to read it.
 His sign said, ''Tell Me Off for a Dollar.''
 I laughed out loud.
 Just then, an off-duty security guard walked up to this guy with the sign, handed him a bill, and began talking. First about his girlfriend and everything she had wanted him to do on Valentine's Day.
 The man with the sign listened intently. He nodded sympathetically.
 Then the guard started to vent about his job. And the economy. By the time he got to the topic of John Gotti, he was ranting and raving. Escalating fury tumbled out of him.
 I stared in fascination.
 After several minutes, the now red-faced security guard failed to show any signs of calming down.
 When he finally took a breath, the man with the sign interjected, very politely: ''Time's up. You got your money's worth today, baby!'' The security guard nodded, took a deep breath, shrugged, and said: ''O.K. See you next time.'' And walked away.Diana Reid Haig
 Dear Diary:
 When using the A.T.M. at the Washington Mutual branch at 45th Street and Lexington Avenue on a day when the stock market hit new lows, the screen showed three corporate logos. It announced that Washington Mutual (one logo) was now part of Chase (second logo). 
 Below, equal in size, was an announcement of a promotion involving Duane Reade (third logo).
 A woman began using the A.T.M. next to mine and gasped out loud, ''Oh my God!'' She then started laughing, turned to me and said, ''I thought it said that Washington Mutual and Chase are now part of Duane Reade!''
 Then she added, ''I suppose it could happen.''

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Upbeat About Face-Lift

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When Lincoln Center kicks off its 50th anniversary festivities on Monday with performances by the likes of Itzhak Perlman and Wynton Marsalis, it will, in a way, be celebrating the future more than commemorating the past. 
 The event, after all, will be taking place in the newly renovated Alice Tully Hall, which reopened in February. Its auditorium has received rave architectural and acoustical reviews, and its lobby cafe, at 65, is attracting so many people that extra seating has been added.
 Lincoln Center still has more than $200 million to raise in a tough economic climate to pay off the last of the redevelopment's $1.2 billion bill. And plans are still unclear for a renovation of Avery Fisher Hall, a major undertaking that is not part of this phase of redevelopment. 
 But all around the campus are signs that the overhaul of Lincoln Center, the country's largest performing arts center, is in the home stretch. On balmy days people have been hanging out on the new bleachers, opposite Alice Tully's entrance on the corner of Broadway and West 65th Street, and on the steps leading down to the front doors, just as Lincoln Center officials had hoped.
 ''There's a theme here, and the theme is how best in the 21st century to maximize the use of these precious public spaces,'' Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, said in an interview. ''Also for the general visitor to feel welcome, feel they're invited and have a place to hang out. We're multiplying the number of places people can say, 'Meet me at. ...' ''
 The skeleton of the green roof that will cover a new restaurant overlooking the north plaza reflecting pool, in front of Lincoln Center Theater, is taking shape; it is scheduled to open in September 2010. A black-box theater designed by the architect Hugh Hardy and suitable for smaller, experimental productions -- originally supposed to take up space in the center's garage -- is planned for the roof of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, though it still needs city approval. The grove of trees, with scattered seating, in front of the library is about to open to the public.
 And the whole campus now has free WiFi. 
 Among other changes to come are the openings of the new visitor space and discount-ticket hub in the former Harmony Atrium, between 62nd and 63rd Streets, and of WNET's glass-walled public-television studio, on Broadway and 66th Street, next to Alice Tully. By 2011 a new pedestrian bridge will span 65th Street; conceptual designs have been approved. 
 In the David H. Koch Theater, home to New York City Ballet and New York City Opera, the work has been expanded to add two side aisles to the orchestra level. While the opera has been displaced by the construction -- which includes a larger orchestra pit and new seats -- the ballet is managing to perform around the renovation work. The theater officially reopens in November. 
 But the redevelopment is not without remaining challenges, including how to pay for it all. Having raised $940 million, Lincoln Center has $235 million more to go. The center's constituent groups, which are sharing the cost, have $100 million left to raise. 
 While eliciting contributions is now more of an uphill climb than when the plans were conceived, Mr. Levy said he remained optimistic. ''The economic climate has made the balance of the fund-raising slower,'' he said. ''People feel they need a little more time to make an initial gift or a supplemental gift. But the reception has been positive.''
 ''We're going to raise every penny of this money,'' he added. ''We're confident about that.''
 One fund-raising effort is centered on the new Columbus Avenue staircase and promenade, which Lincoln Center is naming after Beverly Sills, the soprano who died in 2007. In her years on the campus Sills presided as chairwoman of Lincoln Center and of the Metropolitan Opera, led the New York City Opera and served on the board of Lincoln Center Theater. Donors are being encouraged to make gifts in her honor. 
 Another way that Lincoln Center will help pay the bills is by turning over its plazas and theaters to the Fashion Week tents that for the last 16 years have filled Bryant Park for a week each February and September. The fashion shows will move in September 2010, and while Mr. Levy would not disclose the value of the five-year agreement, he said it would be ''very meaningful for the upkeep of the campus.''
 That leaves Avery Fisher Hall. The British architect Norman Foster won the competition to redesign the inside in 2002, and the New York Philharmonic board approved his plans in 2005, but since then the redesign has stalled. Lincoln Center is in discussions with the Philharmonic to frame a new constituency agreement -- the current one expires in June 2011 -- after which they will address a renovation, Mr. Levy said. 
 ''Even though we're on one 16-acre campus, the life of each of these institutions is organic, and they're ready when they're ready,'' he added. ''I think it's a mistake to force this. It's such a major commitment of time and sweat equity, such a displacement and sacrifice for employees and audiences.''
 Zarin Mehta, president of the Philharmonic, said the orchestra would proceed when the timing is right. ''The renovation of the hall, whichever form it takes, will have to take place,'' he said. ''This is economically not the best time to do anything.''
 Mr. Levy suggested that the choice of architect and the scope of the renovation, which had been limited to the building's interior, should be revisited in light of the campus's new aesthetic, by Diller Scofidio & Renfro.
 ''I think we need a fresh look on how best to approach it in light of all that's happened,'' Mr. Levy said. ''There are new board members at the Philharmonic, and we've learned a lot about architecture ourselves. We've visited a lot of halls. We're smarter and better prepared clients. In light of that we'll sit down together and take a look.''
 Mr. Mehta does not seem to share this view. ''The choice of Foster was made by a joint committee of the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center, and the discussion of anything else has not taken place,'' he said. ''I see no reason to change.''

HEADLINE: Despite Recession, Personalized Health Care Remains in Demand

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Thanks to patients who still value their health in hard times, the recession has barely slowed the growth of concierge medical practices, which charge hefty membership fees for highly personalized care and around-the-clock access.
 From Seattle, where the movement began in 1996, to South Florida, where its largest concern is now based, physicians with boutique practices say they are losing far fewer patients for financial reasons than they had expected. While some new practices are not filling as quickly as they might, they continue to attract a steady flow of patients willing to pay thousands of dollars for the privilege.
 The practices typically charge at least $1,500 a year, with the most elite services asking $25,000 or more per family. The fees cover a thorough physical exam and enable physicians to limit the number of patients they see so they can provide premier service. 
 Doctors give patients their cellphone numbers and schedule leisurely same-day appointments with no waiting. Some make house calls, though patients still need health insurance to pay for hospitalizations and specialists. 
 Most of the 20 physicians and executives interviewed said that a small number of patients had decided not to re-enroll in recent months, citing lost jobs or devalued portfolios. They tend to be like Susan Schwartzman, a book publicist from Yonkers who said she had given up her concierge doctor because of declining income, but only after first canceling her gym membership and swearing off restaurants. 
 For the most part, however, boutique practices have shown resiliency. Doctors said the recession seemed to have reaffirmed the importance of health care to their patients. With jobs scarce and stress at a peak, many may see a link between continued health and continued employment. And with savings depleted, they recognize that assiduous preventive care may help them avoid costly chronic conditions and hospitalizations.
 ''It's the old penny-wise, pound-foolish thing,'' said Dr. C. Scott Molden, who practices internal medicine in St. Louis with MDVIP, the largest consortium of fee-based doctors. ''I tell people, 'You cannot afford to not be in my practice. You cannot afford to be sick, even with insurance.' What I'm offering is to keep people out of hospitals.''
 Ted McCallum of Newtown, Conn., said that after losing his job as a hotel manager in June, he decided to stick with his MDVIP doctor, Robert L. Ruxin of Ridgefield, because their 20-year relationship provided stability in unsettling times.
 ''It did involve forgoing some of the luxuries I've gotten used to,'' Mr. McCallum, 57, said about losing his job. ''But I wasn't willing to forgo this one.'' 
 ''As the saying goes, If you have your health, you're a rich man,'' he added.
 Similarly, Janet K. Yerta, an 82-year-old retiree in Atlanta, has remained with her MDVIP physician, Dr. T. Kirkland Garner, despite watching her investment income wither. ''I'm not one of those people that's running over with money,'' she said. ''But there are two things I value: my salvation and my health.''
 Critics of concierge medicine consider it elitist and say it has widened the already significant class disparities in American medicine. They also say it has exacerbated the shortage of primary care physicians by leaving more patients to be treated by a shrinking pool of doctors.
 But advocates counter that the concierge movement reflects deep exasperation with the two-hour waits and 10-minute appointments of conventional primary care. Given the burnout among physicians who must see more than two dozen patients a day, they say the concierge model may sustain doctors who would otherwise hang up their stethoscopes.
 Dr. Thomas W. LaGrelius of Torrance, Calif., who leads the Society for Innovative Medical Practice Design, a professional association of concierge physicians, estimated that there were 5,000 such doctors in the United States, out of an estimated 240,000 internal medicine physicians and related subspecialists. 
 MDVIP, which started in Boca Raton, Fla., in 2000, expects to add more than 80 doctors to its network of 300 this year, said Darin Engelhardt, the firm's president. The company is privately held and does not release detailed membership data, but Mr. Engelhardt said that renewal rates among its 100,000 patients had remained at its usual level of 93 percent a year during the recession. Each MDVIP doctor is limited to 600 patients, who each pay $1,500 to $1,800 a year.
 ''I'm happily able to report that we have not seen any adverse impact from the economy,'' Mr. Engelhardt said. ''What we've been told by patients is that during difficult times like this, they are reassessing their priorities and that their health care needs come to the forefront.''
 Dr. Dragan Djordjevic, a Chicago physician who affiliated with MDVIP two years ago, said he had expected a lot of dropouts. ''Every day, patients would come in and talk about how the economy was killing them,'' he said. ''So naturally, I'd go home thinking they were going to cancel.'' 
 But Dr. Djordjevic said that he had lost perhaps only five patients from 600 since the beginning of the year, and that they had been easily replaced from a waiting list of more than 100.
 Peter W. Hoedemaker, the chief executive of MD$(2$), a concierge medical provider based near Seattle, said the company had been pleasantly surprised by patient enrollments at its new office in Chicago. The five MD$(2$) practices, each with two doctors, charge $25,000 per family and limit each doctor to 50 families. About a dozen openings remain in Chicago, Mr. Hoedemaker said, far fewer than projected, and the group is looking to expand to New York City. 
 As the economy crumbled last fall, Dr. Cynthia L. Williams of Torrance worried about the unfortunate timing when she sent letters in November informing her 2,200 patients that she would be converting to a $2,000-a-year concierge practice. Nonetheless, she said, she had signed up 315 patients and was adding one a week. ''On my busiest day I'm seeing 14 patients, but on a lot it's eight,'' she said. ''In the old practice, I was booked about one patient every 12 minutes, about 25 to 30 a day. I love it, and I think my patients love it.'' 
 Many of the doctors boasted of their ability to keep patients out of emergency rooms by intervening by phone for conditions like diverticulitis or an abnormal heart rhythm. They said their deep knowledge of their patients helped them detect subtle changes and danger signs. 
 ''A close personal relationship with a physician is not something that's easy to find anymore,'' said Dr. David L. Elliott, an MDVIP physician in Phoenix. ''People find it valuable.''

HEADLINE: Top Colleges See Little Fall In Freshman Commitments

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG; Tamar Lewin, Lisa W. Foderaro and Rebecca R. Ruiz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In an early indication that the economic downturn may not have disrupted students' college choices as much as schools had feared, more than a dozen top colleges said last week that accepted applicants had committed themselves to attending next fall at about the same rate as last year.
 Among the private colleges reporting little variation in their admissions yields were Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Wesleyan, Smith, Kenyon and Whitman. Among public colleges, the Universities of Virginia and Wisconsin reported similar results. 
 But those yields came at a price: many of the colleges said they had increased their financial aid budgets, often significantly, over last year's.
 The dean of admissions at Pomona College in California, Bruce Poch, said, ''For all the Chicken Little and Henny Penny hysteria and dire predictions, it seems to have worked out just fine here.'' At Pomona, 384 applicants sent in their deposits, only 6 fewer than the goal the college had set. The class is ''essentially full,'' Mr. Poch added, though some students on the waiting list might be offered admission.
 The dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard, William R. Fitzsimmons, had anticipated a drop in the yield of as much as 5 percentage points because of the poor economy. But about 76 percent of those accepted to Harvard, or nearly 1,560 applicants, have signaled their intention to attend -- ''right where we were at the end of last year,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said. 
 As much as 65 percent of the incoming freshman class at Harvard could end up receiving direct, need-based scholarships, compared with 58 percent in the current freshman class, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. In response, Harvard expects to increase its undergraduate financial aid budget by $9 million, or 7 percent. 
 At Yale, nearly 70 percent of those accepted, or about 1,330 students, have signaled their intention to enroll, a percentage nearly identical to last year's, said Jeffrey Brenzel, the dean of undergraduate admissions.
 ''Our yield so far has been significantly stronger than we expected,'' Mr. Brenzel wrote in an e-mail message. ''Given the economy, we thought that more students not eligible for need-based financial aid from Yale might accept merit scholarships offered by a number of excellent colleges.''
 The next freshman class at Yale is oversubscribed by about 17, which does not bode well for the 468 applicants on the waiting list.
 Princeton's yield of 60 percent this year is a percentage point higher than last year's, which is noteworthy given that the university is trying to increase its freshman class size by about 60, to 1,300.
 Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., said it too had received a response from accepted applicants at a rate similar to last year's -- about 35 percent, or 760, said they would attend. The senior associate dean of admissions, Greg Pyke, said he was surprised that the economy had not ''really driven the yield down.'' He credited Wesleyan's increasing of its financial aid offers as a factor. 
 Another situation being closely monitored is whether public universities are being overrun with candidates, as some high school seniors seek a less expensive education than many private colleges offer.
 At the University of Virginia, this year's yield -- 49 percent, representing 3,100 deposits -- is only 1 percentage point higher than last year's. The University of Wisconsin said its yield this year -- 41 percent, or about 5,550 deposits -- was a drop of 2 percentage points from last year's. But the university said appeals of financial-aid decisions among accepted freshmen had increased 20 percent over last year.
 The State University of New York at New Paltz said it had gotten the admissions yield it wanted: about 20 percent, compared with 24 percent last year. But to lower its yield, New Paltz had to close off applications at about 15,250 and offer several hundred fewer acceptances than it did a year earlier. 
 ''The next question is whether the deposits are hard or soft,'' said L. David Eaton, the vice president for enrollment. Mr. Eaton said he wondered whether some students had put in a $250 deposit to New Paltz, as well as deposits elsewhere, to hedge their bets.
 Georgetown University, Providence College and Hartwick College were among those that said last week that they still had openings in their incoming freshman classes. Officials at the University of California, Los Angeles, said they would not have data before June 1.
 All told, the institutions that have reported their yields are a fraction of the nation's estimated 2,000 four-year colleges, which means it will probably be months before the full picture is known.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Holding Steady
 In Sheepshead Bay
 While some shop owners throughout the city have been grieving over the legions of loyal customers they have lost because of the recession, Howard Blady, who runs Klearview Appliance in Sheepshead Bay, keeps the latest gloom in perspective. 
 He is grateful that the recession hasn't meant a recurrence of burglaries at his store -- a big problem when crime was higher.
 This Russian-immigrant community on the outskirts of Coney Island has prospered so much that Mr. Blady is confident that a recession will have little impact. His father, Michael, first opened Klearview Appliance nearby in 1965. Howard now runs the daily operations and is president of the Nostrand Avenue Merchants Association in Sheepshead Bay. He discussed the business climate in a recent interview.
 Q. What signs of the recession do you see in your shopping district?
 A. On a surface level, I don't see any effects. We haven't lost any stores. For example, the butcher closed. He didn't close because of the recession. He had enough. 
 Q. How has the recession affected your business?
 A. Over the winter, which is our slowest season, we put our delivery people on a four-day week, and we did that by using a shared-work program that New York State offers. [It provides unemployment benefits to workers whose hours are cut.] At the end of March, we put all of our men, all of them, back on a five-day week. Now it's beginning, our season, and we're as busy as we've been, as the last seasons. For example, we had those hot days in April, we were busy because people thought about buying an air-conditioner. They'll never skimp on air-conditioners.
 Q. How have the buying habits of local Russian immigrants changed over the years?
 A. Dad used to advertise in the Russian newspaper in 1975. Then, they bought a 25-inch Zenith Panorama color TV and a Sanyo portable washer, the kind that rolls about, and you hook up to your faucet in the kitchen. Then, as the years have gone by and many of them become successful, they buy very nice kitchen appliances. They buy high-end kitchen appliances. 
 Q. How do you compare this recession to other downturns?
 A. 1981, that was a more difficult time. I remember changing price tags on my samples approximately every six weeks because the prices kept going up and up. [They were raised by the manufacturers.]
 Q. It sounds like your neighborhood hasn't been hurt by the recession as much as other neighborhoods. Is that the case?
 A. Here, business is steady. We didn't take the ride up. We're not taking the ride down.

HEADLINE: Shrinking the Prison Population

 BODY:
Congress took an important step last year when it passed the Second Chance Act to help former inmates return to their communities. If properly financed and carried out, the act could cut recidivism, and ruinous prison costs for the states, by helping them develop programs to provide job placement, drug treatment, mental health care and other services that former prisoners need to build viable, crime-free lives. 
 Congress does not have to look far for proven programs. New prison sentencing and re-entry policies are already taking hold in several states, thanks in part to work by the Council of State Governments' prison policy arm, the Justice Center, with the support of the Pew Charitable Trust's Center on the States.
 Their results have been especially impressive in Texas and Kansas, law-and-order states that were facing huge increases in their prison populations before they turned to the Justice Center for analyses and policy suggestions. Last month, representatives from both states testified about their experience before a House appropriations subcommittee. 
 State officials said that after studying the problem they found their prison populations were being driven up, not by crime, but mainly by breakdowns in their parole and probation systems. 
 Simply put, they were sending too many people back to jail. Many were drug-addicted or mentally ill offenders who could be safely dealt with in community programs. 
 Legislatures in both states decided to expand community-based drug treatment and mental health services, and encouraged localities to provide closer supervision for released inmates. The changes, put in place two years ago, have yielded especially strong results in Texas. State officials said that the new system had already reduced parole revocations by an astonishing 25 percent and helped the state avoid a projected increase in the prison population that would have cost the Texas treasury hundreds of millions of dollars.
 With the economy in recession, and prison costs rising, states that used to lock up as many inmates as possible are looking for sensible alternatives. President Obama has asked Congress to commit more than $100 million to prisoner re-entry programs, with three-quarters going to the Second Chance Act. That would be a good down payment, but only a down payment, on what is needed.

HEADLINE: Ad Losses Put Squeeze On TV News

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
It is getting so bad for local television stations that some are turning to newspapers for help.
 The bankrupt Tribune Company has merged its TV stations and daily newspapers in Miami and Hartford, and it already produces a lighthearted morning show in south Florida with the help of the newspaper's columnists. Bob Gremillion, the executive vice president for publishing, calls it a ''circling the wagons'' approach.
 No one would dispute that ''the two industries are very challenged,'' he said. ''We're combining and fighting together.''
 The mergers are an example of local TV's agonizing search for new business models as some balance sheets turn red. Starting Monday in Chicago, four stations' news departments are combining their camera crews. In other markets, stations are adding newscasts on the cheap even as they lay off people. On the opposite extreme, a handful of stations are closing their news divisions completely. 
 The news for stations has been grim lately: without election advertisements to defray the losses in automotive ads, a cross section of station owners reported 20 percent to 30 percent quarterly drops in revenue last week, suggesting that the local TV business is almost as weak as its print counterpart.
 ''Unfortunately, there was nowhere to hide during the current storm, as declines in both local and national advertising accelerated,'' Timothy E. Stautberg, the chief financial officer for the E. W. Scripps Company, which owns newspapers in 14 markets and TV stations in 10 markets, told investors last week. 
 About two-thirds of Americans say they regularly get news from local TV, according to the Pew Research Center. News is responsible for 40 percent to 50 percent of a station's revenue on average, and many stations are still profitable. But owners see their audiences splintering and they see their parent networks bypassing them on the Web. What they are struggling to maintain is relevance.
 Station revenue is down across the country: at E. W. Scripps, down 20 percent compared with the same quarter last year; at Belo, the owner of 20 stations, down 23 percent; at LIN TV, the owner of 29 stations, down 21 percent. The media conglomerates are also affected; the News Corporation reported a station revenue decline 28 percent and the Walt Disney Company reported a 30 percent decline.
 Underscoring the weakness in the overall advertising market, struggling car companies like General Motors and Chrysler -- traditionally among the top sponsors of local news -- have essentially cut their ad spending in half from a year ago, according to the station owners. To a lesser degree, News Corporation said, ''virtually every category was down in the quarter.'' 
 Ads from political candidates and advocacy groups usually buoy stations in election years, so odd-numbered years are generally weaker. But this year the declines are much more dramatic. 
 Even before the ad shortfalls, news departments were feeling the effects of the recession. Robert A. Papper, a journalism professor at Hofstra who surveys TV newsrooms every year, found that local stations shed 1,200 news jobs last year. Mr. Papper also found a 13 percent drop in reporter salaries and a 11.5 percent decline in anchor salaries. 
 At the same time stations are trimming staff, they are trying -- just like newspapers -- to transform into 24-hour news-gathering operations with robust Web sites. But the comparisons to newspapers end there, at least in the minds of many in the industry who are betting that the TV losses are not permanent. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, said Thursday, ''My own personal feeling is that we will see a return to television advertising faster than we see it to newspapers.'' 
 By then, though, some stations may not be broadcasting anymore, at least not in their current form. Some experts are predicting consolidations in saturated local markets. Recalling an old expression, Dennis Thatcher, the chief operating officer of Mission Broadcasting, said the current scramble for ad dollars is like ''dinner for three in a two-porkchop world.'' 
 In Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Mission's station is the one going hungry. Last month, Mission shut the news division at the struggling station, WYOU, and put syndicated entertainment shows in place of newscasts. 
 The station draws strong ratings for CBS's prime-time shows, ''but the audience went other places for news,'' Mr. Thatcher said, still sounding saddened a month after the decision. Despite anchor swaps, set redesigns and new newscasts at 4 and 7 p.m., WYOU could never effectively compete with the two powerhouse stations in the market. 
 ''It's one of the most difficult decisions you have to make as a broadcaster, and one I hope I never have to make again,'' he said. 
 In Mission Broadcasting's other markets, though, stations are adding news. Mr. Thatcher recently added a morning newscast in Abilene, Tex., and is weighing whether to add weekend newscasts in Terre Haute, Ind. 
 Other station groups across the country are also increasing newscasts. Mr. Murdoch said Fox stations were doing so because ''we have the staff there. It doesn't cost money.''
 Mr. Papper said many stations are doing more with less; in 2008, network affiliates set ''a new record for the amount of news'' on weekdays, with an average of 4.6 hours a station. 
 Much of this news, its producers acknowledge, is recycled from the day's newspaper or taken from wire services. Nevertheless, the stations play an important role. In a speech at a broadcasting convention last month, Fred Young, who recently retired from Hearst-Argyle Television, said that ''when news is breaking, it usually pulls the news consumer back to the local television station -- the spot at which most of them are most comfortable.'' 
 To be able to afford to cover the news, an increasing number of stations are sharing their camera crews in arrangements called pools. NBC and Fox stations started pooling some resources last year in cities like Philadelphia and New York. This week, two more stations will join the pool in Chicago, leaving one lone holdout, WLS, among the major affiliates in the Windy City. 
 Partnerships between local newspapers and local broadcasters are happening in a similar vein. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last summer, the Tribune station WSFL, a CW affiliate, moved into the building housing the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper, also owned by Tribune. The print and TV -- actually, make that text and video -- employees are now assigned to stories by a single assignment desk, and they are bringing back all the necessary elements for a story, be it video for TV or audio clips for the Web site, Mr. Gremillion said.
 Last month the station started a lively four-hour morning show. Borrowing elements of the ''Today'' show, the hosts sit around a coffee table and intersperse news headlines and weather reports with celebrity gossip and, on Friday, a segment about the ''top five worst TV moms in history.''
 ''It's a conversation,'' said the executive producer, Jose Suarez. 
 The newspaper's personal finance, fashion and television columnists, among others, regularly appear on TV, either on set or via a webcam connection from home. Mr. Gremillion said the morning show ''gives the station a personality.'' 
 ''It's clear that local news is what differentiates us from other media,'' he said.
