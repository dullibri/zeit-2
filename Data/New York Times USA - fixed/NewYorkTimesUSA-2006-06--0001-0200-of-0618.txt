HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Home Buyers Pay Higher Interest on Mortgages, Study Finds

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Black and Hispanic home buyers entering the fast-growing market for subprime mortgages tend to pay higher interest rates than whites with similar credit ratings, a statistical study by an advocacy group says. 
 The subprime industry makes loans at higher interest rates to people who cannot qualify for regular mortgages.
''When we compared borrowers with the same risk characteristics, African-Americans and Latinos were still more likely to get the higher-rate loans,'' said Debbie Gruenstein Bocian, a researcher at the group, the Center for Responsible Lending. 
 A spokesman for the mortgage banking industry challenged the conclusion, saying the report did not take into account all the legitimate questions about family wealth and debt, house appraisal and other factors that underwriters must consider when making a loan. 
 Racial disparities in mortgage lending have been studied and debated for decades, with the focus shifting in recent years from the practice of denying mortgages in certain minority neighborhoods, or redlining, and a lack of loans for minorities to the pitfalls of the subprime industry.
 As many as one in five home loans are now subprime, totaling more than $500 billion a year, said Keith S. Ernst, an author of the report who is an analyst at the lending center, in Washington.
 Borrowers typically pay two percentage points higher than they would for conventional loans. Some, judged the riskiest cases, are charged higher rates, forcing them to pay hundreds of dollars extra a month. 
 The study, using federal and industry figures from 2004 to analyze a sample of 50,000 loans, found that among subprime borrowers with similar credit ratings, blacks and Hispanics were 30 percent more likely than whites to be charged the highest interest. 
 In response to earlier studies of racial disparities, the mortgage industry has argued that the varied financial backgrounds of borrowers and a tendency for minority buyers to offer lower down payments were mainly responsible.
 The authors of the new report said they had, for the first time, taken credit scores and down payments into account, leaving an unexplained racial difference. 
 Doug Douglas, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said in a telephone interview that although ''the issue of disparities is very important,'' the new study still failed to capture the complexity of mortgage underwriting, especially in the subprime market, where borrowers do not have top credit ratings under traditional criteria. 
 The findings were endorsed by representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Council for La Raza. The authors said high-cost lenders appeared to focus on minority neighborhoods. They expressed concern about incentives that lending agencies give to mortgage brokers, saying the incentives reward brokers for steering customers to the most expensive loans.
 Joe Falk, a board member of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, said brokers fully disclosed all fees and were unfairly castigated for offering consumers alternatives that fit their needs and preferences.
 ''We've expanded home ownership by going into neighborhoods not served by others,'' Mr. Falk said by telephone from Miami.

HEADLINE: Remaking the Memorial Foundation

 BODY:
Gretchen Dykstra's resignation last Friday as head of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation took almost no one by surprise. Some of the blame for the foundation's problems will surely fall to Ms. Dykstra's account. But the real difficulty is structural. The foundation, which is private, was given a job it should never have had: to build the memorial. That made its real job -- raising money for the memorial -- harder than it should have been. 
 Now is the time to fix this mess. The vague relation between the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Memorial Foundation should be clarified. The development agency, in partnership with the Port Authority, should take over the task of building the memorial.
That will put the emphasis back where it belongs. All along, the Memorial Foundation has seemed far more interested in building a 9/11 museum than the memorial itself. In part, this was simply the attraction of creating something the foundation could take credit for, as opposed to a memorial whose design was stipulated in advance. But the foundation's emphasis on the museum also stems from its belief that without a museum the memorial is incomplete. That may be. But there will be time to design and build a museum after the memorial has been set back on the right track. 
 The foundation lost sight of a simple fact: the memorial designed by Michael Arad was the result of a careful public process. The museum is an afterthought that has never been vetted publicly. But while there were many advocates for the museum at the foundation, it was hard to find any for the memorial, thanks in part to some very confused allegiances on the board of directors. 
 The time to end that confusion is now. If the Memorial Foundation can raise money for the memorial -- and, down the road, a museum -- then it should do so. If it can't, then it's hard to say why it should exist at all.

HEADLINE: Galbraith Is Remembered As a Giant in Many Fields

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 31 

 BODY:
Over decades the world came to know John Kenneth Galbraith as a maverick economist, author and diplomat, towering in intellect and stature, lacking in modesty and holding steadfast to his liberal beliefs. 
 But to most of the nearly 1,000 people who attended a memorial service Wednesday afternoon for Mr. Galbraith, who died April 29 at age 97, he was also Ken, a man with a generous heart who liked single-malt scotch neat and heady intellectual discourse among friends, whom he made easily and kept for life.
 Mr. Galbraith was, speakers at the two-hour service at Memorial Church at Harvard said, a force who constantly challenged authority, shaped and questioned the nation's economic philosophies, translated them for the masses and deplored war. He was also a champion of the young, a satirist and an institution in his Cambridge neighborhood, where he housed an undergraduate student each year. He also owned a farmhouse in Vermont and a chalet in Switzerland.
 ''He was the republic's most valuable subversive,'' wrote the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., in a piece originally published in The Washington Post and read by his son, Stephen Schlesinger. ''Underneath his joy in combat, he was a do-gooder in the dark of night.''
 Derek C. Bok, the former Harvard president, said Mr. Galbraith, who was a longtime professor at the university, had asked to retire at 65 to pave the way for young professors. He advised the university on its stock portfolio and, in the early 1970's, predicted that it was about to lose money, and asked that he not receive further salary increases.
 ''You may laugh,'' Dr. Bok said, ''but I assure you that letter has never been duplicated since.'' 
 Gloria Steinem befriended Mr. Galbraith in the 1960's, years after meeting his wife, Catherine Atwater. Mr. Galbraith, who rose early to write for two or three hours each morning, published fiction works under the name Mark Epernay. Ms. Steinem, who cared for the manuscripts one winter while Mr. Galbraith skied in Switzerland, said he had seen the name Epernay on a wine bottle and used it.
 While working in the White House under President John F. Kennedy, Mr. Galbraith used to beat staff members and reporters in the card game Pounce by telling of his adventures and playing his cards while his competitors were rapt in the tale, Ms. Steinem said. She said she believed that his generosity of spirit showed in his work.
 ''His public and private selves were never dissonant,'' Ms. Steinem said. ''We'd be sitting by the fire at his home in Vermont and he still spoke with semicolons. But he smiled.''
 Mr. Galbraith's biographer, Richard Parker, said he last saw him a few days before he died, and took Mr. Galbraith a Japanese translation of his biography. Although Mr. Galbraith did not speak Japanese, he told Mr. Parker, ''Given the enormity of the subject I shall devote my remaining days to work,'' Mr. Parker said.
 At Mr. Galbraith's funeral, Mr. Parker saw that the funeral home left the inventory tag on the coffin of Mr. Galbraith, who stood 6 feet 8 inches tall. It said his name and ''oversized,'' Mr. Parker said.
 ''John Kenneth Galbraith, oversized,'' he said. ''They got it just right.''

HEADLINE: Tearing Iraq Apart

BYLINE: By Thomas X. Hammes. 
Thomas X. Hammes, a retired Marine colonel, is the author of ''The Sling and the Stone: On Warfare in the 21st Century.''

DATELINE: Oxford, England 

 BODY:
THE White House is right to insist that our postwar goal is a unified Iraq, as opposed to one divided along ethno-religious lines. So why is the administration taking so many actions that make holding the country together virtually impossible?
 In January, President Bush diverted nearly half the money allocated to reconstruction in Iraq to other needs, including security. Given that our current strategy is nicknamed ''Clear-Hold-Build,'' where does that leave us? Clear-Hold-Hope? Mr. Bush's decision sent a terrible signal to the Iraqis about our resolve. It is even less understandable since the expense of the critical reconstruction program is a small fraction of our annual cost in Iraq. 
Next, the administration deeply cut financing for democratization efforts, many of them undertaken by nongovernmental groups. The proposed budget for fiscal 2007 asks for a paltry $63 million. This token sum -- in a war that costs some $200 million a day -- may simply reflect a belief that the security situation prevents such efforts from being effective. But democratization has always been one of the administration's cherished goals, and cutting spending there sends the wrong message. 
 The latest administration budget also recommends cutting overall Army and Marine troop strength. If Mr. Bush and his advisers are really committed to sustained support for the ''long war'' in Iraq, how do they reconcile that with cutting the budgets for the most engaged forces? 
 President Bush and his aides have also repeatedly hinted at significant troop reductions in Iraq this year -- perhaps to as low as 100,000 from the current 130,000. This is despite the growing violence in Baghdad and the fact that our military leaders in Iraq have consistently said that we can withdraw troops safely only if conditions improve. The administration may simply be talking fewer troops to reassure the electorate before midterms. Unfortunately, American voters are not the only audience. What do the Iraqis think? 
 The administration has long stated that the so-called Provincial Reconstruction Teams -- groups of 100 or so political, economic, legal and civil-military relations specialists who help distribute aid and advise regional Iraqi officials, which have had success in Afghanistan -- are critical to our strategy in Iraq. Yet The Washington Post reported in mid-April that only 4 of the proposed 16 teams had even been inaugurated. 
 In addition, the Army staffs and units in Iraq, even those training Iraqi security forces, continue to be undermanned. Meanwhile, former colleagues outside the war zone -- in the Joint Forces Command, the European Command and the Pacific Command -- tell me their commands remain at full strength. It seems the Pentagon does not consider the Iraq war important enough to shift from its peacetime manning models.
 Last, the administration has repeatedly said efficient and law-abiding Iraqi security forces are central to our strategy, yet has failed to provide them with more than minimal equipment. Three years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, most Iraq troops are still using open-backed trucks and unarmored S.U.V.'s. 
 Let's face it: this laundry list of inaction on the part of the Bush administration leaves a prudent Iraqi with no practical choice but to prepare for a United States withdrawal long before the Iraqi central government and security forces are capable of running the nation. For most Iraqis -- Arab or Kurd, Sunni or Shiite -- this will mean looking to religious and ethnic militias, criminal gangs and Islamist insurgents for protection. This, in turn, greatly increases the chance of civil war. 
 The militias are already looking ahead: some are carving out safe areas they will use as bases in the coming war by driving Iraqis of other ethnic and religious groups out of mixed neighborhoods and villages. Iraqi government officials estimated that more than 100,000 families have already fled their homes. This falling back on militias and preparing for internecine conflict is not a new phenomenon. It is exactly what we saw in Afghanistan nearly two decades ago. Once the Afghans believed the Soviet troops were finally pulling out, the various insurgent groups stopped fighting the invaders and began positioning for a multisided civil war. That conflict, of course, lasted until the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001. 
 The Bush administration, despite all its missteps since the fall of the Baathists, has clung to one correct idea: that an intact Iraq is a better outcome than a splintered one. To keep it unified, however, the White House must commit to long timelines and to providing the money necessary for both the military and reconstruction efforts. The alternative is for Mr. Bush to change his mind and tell the American and Iraqi people that we must start planning for a peaceful division. 
 In any case, the uncertainty resulting from trying to have it both ways will result in the worst possible outcome: open civil war.

HEADLINE: Bush's Realization on Iran: No Good Choice Left Except Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
After 27 years in which the United States has refused substantive talks with Iran, President Bush reversed course on Wednesday because it was made clear to him -- by his allies, by the Russians, by the Chinese, and eventually by some of his advisers -- that he no longer had a choice.
 During the past month, according to European officials and some current and former members of the Bush administration, it became obvious to Mr. Bush that he could not hope to hold together a fractious coalition of nations to enforce sanctions -- or consider military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites -- unless he first showed a willingness to engage Iran's leadership directly over its nuclear program and exhaust every nonmilitary option. 
Few of his aides expect that Iran's leaders will meet Mr. Bush's main condition: that Iran first re-suspend all of its nuclear activities, including shutting down every centrifuge that could add to its small stockpile of enriched uranium. Administration officials characterized their offer as a test of whether the Iranians want engagement with the West more than they want the option to build a nuclear bomb some day. 
 And while the Europeans and the Japanese said they were elated by Mr. Bush's turnaround, some participants in the drawn-out nuclear drama questioned whether this was an offer intended to fail, devised to show the extent of Iran's intransigence. 
 Either way, after five years of behind-the-scenes battling within the administration, Mr. Bush finally came to a crossroads at which both sides in the debate over Iran -- engagers and isolaters, and some with a foot in each camp -- saw an advantage in, as one senior aide said, ''seeing if they are serious.''
 Mr. Bush, according to one participant in those debates, told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice several months ago that he needed ''a third option,'' a way to get beyond either a nuclear Iran or an American military action. 
 Ms. Rice spent a long weekend in early May drafting a proposal that included a timetable for diplomatic choreography through the summer.
 ''Nobody wants to get to that kind of crisis situation -- whether it is us or the next administration -- where you either accept an Iranian weapon or you are forced to do something drastic,'' said the participant, who declined to speak on the record about internal White House deliberations. 
 The idea of engagement is hardly new. When Colin L. Powell was secretary of state, several members of his senior staff argued vociferously that the United States needed to test Iran's willingness to deal with the United States -- especially in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
 There was strong opposition from the White House, particularly from Vice President Dick Cheney, according to several former officials. 
 ''Cheney was dead set against it,'' said one former official who sat in many of those meetings. ''At its heart, this was an argument about whether you could isolate the Iranians enough to force some kind of regime change.'' But three officials who were involved in the most recent iteration of that debate said Mr. Cheney and others stepped aside -- perhaps because they read Mr. Bush's body language, or perhaps because they believed Iran would scuttle the effort by insisting that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty gives it the right to develop nuclear fuel. The United States insists that Iran gave up that right by deceiving inspectors for 18 years.
 In the end, said one former official who has kept close tabs on the debate, ''it came down to convincing Cheney and others that if we are going to confront Iran, we first have to check off the box'' of trying talks. 
 Mr. Bush offered a more positive-sounding account: ''I thought it was important for the United States to take the lead, along with our partners, and that's what you're seeing. You're seeing robust diplomacy.''
 As part of the diplomatic timetable, Ms. Rice will be in Vienna on Thursday to endorse an international offer to Iran that includes several plums. Among them will be the dialogue with Washington that Iran has periodically sought, a lifting of many long-standing economic sanctions, and even light water reactors for nuclear power with Russia and the West controlling access to the fuel. 
 Yet skepticism abounds. ''It's true that the conditions are significantly different than they were four or five years ago, but candidly they are not as favorable now for the United States,'' said Richard Haass, who as the head of the State Department's policy planning operation during Mr. Bush's first term was a major advocate of engagement with Iran. 
 First, the new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinijad, ''has vowed that the country will never back down on enriching uranium. 
 ''Oil's at $70 a barrel instead of $20, said Mr. Haass, now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''And we are bogged down in Iraq,'' where the United States is vulnerable to Iranian efforts to worsen the violence and arm the insurgents.
 But the internal debates in the White House included vigorous discussion of the risks associated with any effort to negotiate with foes suspected of seeking nuclear weapons. And in this, Mr. Bush already has bitter experience. 
 In its dealings with North Korea, which Mr. Bush branded a member of the ''axis of evil'' along with Iran and Iraq, the administration also decided a few years ago to try limited engagement, locked arm-in-arm with neighboring nations. 
 But North Korea has kept making weapons fuel, and the allies have not stayed united: China and South Korea continue to aid the North. The Iranians have doubtless noticed. 
 The question now is whether there is any middle ground between Mr. Bush's demand that Iran give up everything, and Iran's insistence that it will give up nothing. Without breaking that logjam, the American-Iranian dialogue may never begin.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan, Unraveling

 BODY:
Something has gone alarmingly wrong in Afghanistan, previously touted as the Bush administration's one quasi-successful venture in nation-building. Afghanistan's rising carnage still has not reached Iraq-like levels. But the trend is running in decidedly the wrong direction. Poorly thought-out American policies are at least partly to blame. 
 Unless Washington starts correcting its mistakes, parts of Afghanistan could start tumbling back toward the kind of anarchic chaos that once made such areas an attractive sanctuary for international terrorists like Osama bin Laden.
 The warning signs go well beyond this week's deadly outbreak of anti-American rioting in Kabul -- the worst violence there since the Taliban were evicted from Afghanistan's capital in 2001. And Kabul is widely acknowledged to be the most secure place in Afghanistan. 
 The past few months have also seen a stronger than expected Taliban military revival (with open help from supporters in Pakistan), a lengthening list of Afghan civilians accidentally killed in American military operations, a badly flawed United States-backed opium eradication program, and rising public disenchantment with Washington and its leading Afghan ally, President Hamid Karzai. 
 Afghans have long been renowned for their hostility toward foreign troops on their territory, as the 20th-century Russians and the 19th-century British learned the hard way. Until now they have made a conspicuous exception for the 21st-century Americans, who helped them shake off Taliban misrule and then promised their poor and war-shattered country an international rebuilding effort on the model of the post-World War II Marshall Plan.
 More than four years later, Afghanistan's patience is running out. America's military presence is seen as narrowly focused on Washington's own agenda of hunting down Al Qaeda fighters and indifferent to Afghan civilian casualties and Afghanistan's own security needs. 
 Armed militia commanders still rule many areas. Some provincial cities and villages are back under the control of the same corrupt officials the Taliban won cheers for chasing out a decade ago. Farmers have fallen victim to a poppy eradication program unaccompanied by realistic plans for alternative economic development. 
 The answer is not for Washington to scale back legitimate American objectives. Pressing the fight against Al Qaeda is essential to America's own national security. Combating Afghan's growing narcotics trade is a vital precondition for any healthy economic development there. 
 What Washington needs to do is fight a lot smarter. It should begin talks at once with Afghanistan's government to arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement on basic ground rules governing American military personnel in their interactions with Afghan civilians. It should reinforce its anti-narcotics drive with development programs that allow farmers to find adequate replacement livelihoods in more constructive lines of work. 
 Most Afghans do not want to go back to the horrors of the recent past. Washington needs to re-enlist their support by demonstrating that it cares not just about Afghanistan's strategic geography, but also about a decent future for its people.

HEADLINE: U.S. MAKES OFFER TO MEET IRANIANS ON NUCLEAR PLAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations for this article, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Wednesday that the United States would join Europeans in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, but only if Tehran first suspended its uranium activities, which are thought to be a cover for developing nuclear arms.
 The declaration, by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was a shift away from decades of refusal to hold broad, direct talks with Iran. But Iran has long said it would not agree to preconditions, and the administration's offer appeared to be aimed as much at placating American allies as at wooing Iran. 
Ms. Rice announced the shift on the eve of talks in Vienna with European, Russian and Chinese envoys aimed at resuscitating a faltering American-led effort to forge a common front against Iran's nuclear program. The American goal is to present Iran with a package of economic and political benefits if it ends its uranium activities, and a threat of sanctions if it does not. 
 The shift followed a searching, two-month debate and an accelerating campaign by European leaders to get President Bush to make a dramatic gesture to energize the stalled European-led nuclear talks with Iran, American officials said.
 Skepticism from Vice President Dick Cheney and others who have opposed concessions to Iran was overcome, the officials said, when it was realized that refusal to move toward the European view would mean that the administration would be blamed for failing to do its utmost to defuse the crisis, making it harder to rally world opinion against Iran. [News analysis, Page A8.] 
 Still, American and European officials said, Russian and Chinese support for the package was not yet guaranteed. 
 ''The United States is willing to exert strong leadership to give diplomacy its very best chance to succeed,'' Ms. Rice said before leaving for Vienna. She added that ''the United States will come to the table'' with its European partners ''and meet with Iran's representative'' if Iran met the stated conditions.
 It was not clear whether the American offer would prompt any change in Iran's longstanding opposition to preconditions. An official Iranian news agency initially labeled it a ''propaganda move.'' 
 Ms. Rice said the American shift, however qualified, removed ''the last excuse'' for Iran to refuse to cooperate. President Bush later described the new approach as one that put the United States into ''a leadership position in solving this issue.''
 ''Our message to the Iranians is that, one, you won't have a weapon, and two, that you must verifiably suspend any programs, at which point we will come to the negotiating table to work on a way forward,'' Mr. Bush said at the White House.
 The United States conveyed its readiness to meet through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, and in a call to Iran's United Nations ambassador, Javad Zarif, by the American ambassador, John R. Bolton, offering Mr. Zarif an advance copy of Ms. Rice's announcement.
 Outside of Iran, Ms. Rice's announcement brought nearly universal praise, especially in Europe, though Russia and China seemed guarded about the conditions the United States attached to its offer.
 A senior State Department official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution, said President Bush had briefed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on the details. ''We have a little bit more negotiating to do,'' the official said. ''We just have to make sure that everybody's on board. We think the Russians will be.''
 The administration has not entirely frozen Iran out of contact in recent years, despite Mr. Bush's labeling it, along with Iraq and North Korea, part of an ''axis of evil'' in his State of the Union Message in early 2002. 
 The United States had contact with Iranian officials during the war in Afghanistan and the early stages of the war with Iraq. Iraq and Afghanistan are neighbors of Iran, and Iran has long wielded influence over their internal affairs.
 American talks with Iran were cut off in mid-2003 after the United States charged Iran with involvement in the bombing of civilians in Saudi Arabia. But there were talks at the end of that year and the beginning of 2004 to speed American relief to Iran after the earthquake in Bam.
 In addition, last year Ms. Rice announced that the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, would be authorized to talk with Iranian officials about the situation in Iraq, including infiltration of insurgents and aid to Shiite militias. But these talks have not taken place.
 With Washington's new position now public, the European, Russian, Chinese and American negotiators are to focus on details of the incentives and threats of punishment. The United States has quietly made one significant concession to the Russians on this score, by allowing language that would remove any threat of force from the document being discussed.
 In addition, the United States has agreed to a Russian and Chinese demand to require that even if the Security Council threatens sanctions, the sanctions would not be imposed without another Council vote.
 What all these face-saving arrangements leave unstated, however, is that the United States appears determined to enlist other countries to impose economic penalties, like a crackdown on bank activity in Iran, if the Council fails to act in the face of further Iranian defiance.
 Getting worldwide support for a tough policy toward Iran has been hard because Iran, which moved last summer to resume uranium enrichment, is technically correct in saying that this activity, defined by Iran as peaceful in nature, is allowed under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that it signed. 
 The West maintains that because Iran has concealed many of its activities from the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has forfeited its right to enrich uranium. 
 A package of incentives is to be presented Thursday in Vienna, if American plans are fulfilled.
 The threat of sanctions, as envisioned by the United States, Britain and France, is to take the form of a commitment to a resolution to be adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which implies penalties if Iran refuses to suspend its enrichment of uranium. Russia and China are opposed to invoking Chapter VII but may relent if they are persuaded by American assurances that sanctions would not be adopted without another vote of the Council.

North Korea Project Halted
 A project to build two nuclear power plants for North Korea in exchange for its agreement to allow United Nations inspections of atomic sites was formally ended yesterday by the United States, Japan, South Korea and European Union. The contractor, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, was formed in 1995 to build two light-water reactors, from which it is difficult to extract weapons-grade plutonium, but the Bush administration never fully supported it.

HEADLINE: 2 New Captains of the Economy Face Volatile Global Markets

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
One reached the pinnacle of wealth and prestige as a dealmaker on Wall Street. The other was an academic superstar, brilliant but somewhat shy and more at ease in Bermuda shorts than suits.
 But now they find themselves side by side in confronting a stiff new test: helping to guide the economy from a period of fast growth and cheap money through one of higher interest rates, jittery markets and a falling dollar.
Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and President Bush's choice to become his new Treasury secretary, is expected to arrive at his post at a time when global financial markets are suddenly more volatile and investors are more risk-averse than they have been in years.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the former Princeton economics professor who became chairman of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1, has already endured a baptism of fire as the Fed has struggled over when to stop raising interest rates. 
 Just a few weeks ago, bond prices dropped and critics complained that Mr. Bernanke lacked ''manhood'' or at least ''Street cred'' as an inflation fighter. In more recent days, investors have been rattled by the opposite fear: Mr. Bernanke might be too tough and push interest rates higher than they had thought, potentially slowing or reversing the liquidity-driven investment boom of recent years.
 Mr. Paulson provoked speculation about the dollar even before he left Mr. Bush's side at the announcement of his nomination on Tuesday morning. 
 Mr. Paulson called for ''steps to maintain our competitive edge in the world,'' a bland remark that some investors nonetheless interpreted as code for using a weaker dollar to make American exports cheaper in other countries.
 ''These two captains are forced to navigate in some very choppy waters,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. ''The message that the Fed is sending is that they don't have a clear grasp on the goings-on of the economy, and the same could be said of the Bush administration.''
 At first glance, the pairing of Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson looks like an attempt to recreate the celebrated collaboration between Alan Greenspan and Robert E. Rubin in the 1990's, when the economy and the stock market soared and the federal budget swung from deficits to surpluses.
 Mr. Greenspan, who ran the Fed, was not an academic but shared Mr. Bernanke's penchant for poring over economic data and challenging conventional wisdom.
 Mr. Rubin, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, had, like Mr. Paulson, been a chairman of Goldman Sachs. He teamed up with Mr. Greenspan to champion tough restraints on government spending, employed his credibility on Wall Street to assure financial markets that Mr. Clinton was serious about dealing with the budget deficit and played an influential role in shaping foreign policy.
 Mr. Paulson, whose nomination has been praised by Democrats as well as Republicans, is almost certain to win easy Senate approval and become a central player on Mr. Bush's team.
 But analysts say both he and Mr. Bernanke need to establish their credibility in financial markets at a time when the economy is in a major transition. 
 For the first time in nearly two decades, inflation is on an upward rather than downward trend. Energy prices remain near historic highs, even though oil prices dropped on Wednesday as immediate fears of a confrontation with Iran eased. Long-term interest rates -- the fuel that powers the housing market when they are low -- are on the rise.
 Meanwhile, the economy faces structural budget deficits that will not disappear without major changes in taxes and spending, and the Fed could find itself in a clash with the Bush administration if budget deficits remain high.
 Perhaps most important, however, investors around the world have become more anxious about the United States' huge trade deficits and its ballooning foreign debt. That is pushing down the value of the dollar, a trend that would help reduce trade imbalances but has also elevated worries about a more painful crash for the American currency. 
 Much of the uncertainty stems from a shift at the Federal Reserve and other central banks. After propping up economic growth by keeping interest rates far below normal levels, the central banks are removing the cushion of cheap money.
 ''The marketplace over all is being forced to reabsorb risk that formerly had been underwritten by the big three central banks -- the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China,'' said Paul McCulley, managing director of Pimco Advisers, the giant bond management firm. ''When you've got all three taking away the punch bowl, the partyers at the party are not going to be happy.''
 Mr. Bernanke arrived at the Fed when monetary policy was already at a tipping point. Having raised short-term interest rates under Mr. Greenspan's guidance for nearly two years by the time Mr. Bernanke took over, Fed officials knew they were nearing the point where they could stop. But because there is such a long lag time between changes in monetary policy and their impact, inflationary pressures were on the rise and economic growth was still torrid.
 In late April, Mr. Bernanke confounded markets even as he struggled to explain that the Fed needed to keep its options open by basing decisions on incoming economic data rather than maintaining monetary policy on automatic pilot.
 Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on April 27, Mr. Bernanke set off a rally by announcing that the Fed might pause in its rate increases to assess the impact of its previous increases.
 What startled bond investors was Mr. Bernanke's added twist: that the Fed might pause even if ''the risks to its objectives are not entirely balanced'' meaning that it might take its foot off the monetary brakes, at least temporarily, even if there were signs of slightly higher inflation risks.
 Bond investors, suspecting that Mr. Bernanke might be soft on inflation at a time when energy prices were shooting up, began demanding higher yields on long-term Treasury bonds.
 Pundits began accusing Mr. Bernanke of vacillating.
 ''In jest, I've been saying that Mr. Bernanke needs to regain his monetary manhood,'' Larry Kudlow, an economist and talk show host, recently told viewers on CNBC. ''He was people-pleasing Wall Street. Now he has got to go back on message.''
 Barry Ritholtz, an economic consultant and operator of an economic blog, the Big Picture, went further and called Mr. Bernanke the ''Neville Chamberlain of inflation fighters.''
 ''I got the sense that Mr. Bernanke was appeasing the stock market,'' Mr. Ritholtz said in an interview. ''It's not that he has to go out and prove his manhood and his street-fighting cred. It's just that he has to navigate at a particularly perilous moment in the economy, and he has to navigate absolutely flawlessly.''
 Two days after raising the prospect of a pause, Mr. Bernanke compounded the confusion by venting his frustration about being ''misunderstood'' during an off-camera conversation with Maria Bartiromo, a correspondent for CNBC.
 Word of the comments set off another round of feverish trading on April 29. Last week, Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers at the Senate Banking committee that his remarks to Ms. Bartiromo had been a ''lapse in judgment'' and that in the future, he would communicate only through formal channels.
 Despite the bumpy path, Mr. Bernanke's first few months have been far smoother than Mr. Greenspan's arrival in August 1987. Bond investors, convinced that Mr. Greenspan could not match the inflation-fighting prowess of his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, quickly pushed up interest rates on long-term Treasury Bonds.
 Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds shot up from 8.8 percent to more than 10 percent during Mr. Greenspan's first two months as Fed chairman. The stock market, plagued by a host of uncertainties, fell 22.6 percent on October 19, 1987.
 By contrast, rates on 10-year Treasury bonds have climbed modestly since Mr. Bernanke took office, from about 4.5 percent to about 5 percent today. One crucial indicator of inflation expectations, the difference in price between regular Treasury bonds and special inflation-protected Treasury securities, are not much higher today than when Mr. Bernanke took over in February.
 Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said Mr. Bernanke's message had in fact been clear even if that left investors unsure about the Fed's next move.
 ''He is sending a fairly consistent message that says we're going to evaluate the data insofar as they affect the outlook,'' Mr. McKelvey said. ''This is child's play compared to what Greenspan had in the first two or three months of his term.''
 Mr. Paulson may face his own trial by fire. As Treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson would have authority over the government's policy on exchange rates and the value of the dollar.
 Mr. Paulson is likely to continue the policy of his predecessor, John W. Snow, in supporting a ''strong dollar'' but insisting that its value be determined by market forces. In practice, the administration has been content to let the dollar drift down in value for the last two years, a trend that makes American exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
 Mr. Snow did not have to grapple with any major currency disruptions, but Mr. Paulson may not be so lucky.
 ''There are fewer certainties,'' said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. ''He is walking into an environment where the dollar is widely perceived to be at risk.''

HEADLINE: Support Your Local Banker

BYLINE: By Otis White. 
Otis White, a public policy consultant, is a columnist for Governing magazine.

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
AFTER winning re-election as New Orleans's mayor, C. Ray Nagin promised a new beginning and an economic boom for his city fueled by federal financing for reconstruction. But in fulfilling that pledge, Mr. Nagin and his fellow Gulf Coast political leaders lack a vital resource that their predecessors of even a decade ago had: strong and engaged local bankers.
 One example, from Amarillo, Tex., would be Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding. Mr. Powell built a career the old-fashioned way: starting out as loan officer at a savings and loan in his hometown, jumping to the biggest bank in town and working his way to the top. By 1987, he was the chief executive of First National Bank of Amarillo and, in time, he wore every civic badge worth wearing: chairman of the chamber of commerce, member of the city housing authority, patron of the local boys' ranch, trustee of High Plains Baptist Hospital. Had disaster struck Amarillo in the mid-1990's, Mr. Powell could have stood at the front of the room and told federal officials every project worth supporting and every politician to avoid. 
Bankers rarely lead cities that way anymore, and their exit from the stage speaks to how communities have changed -- and why it may be harder to mend them when disasters strike.
 From the 1950's to the 1980's, bank chiefs were the capi di tutti capi of civic leaders in most cities, the bosses of all bosses. They ran important companies, but that wasn't why they were powerful. Their power came from continual involvement in civic work, an intimate knowledge of their communities and their occasional boldness.
 Ivan Allen Jr., the former mayor of Atlanta, provided a snapshot of one banker as leader when he wrote about a meeting with the president of Citizens and Southern National Bank, Mills B. Lane Jr., in the mid-1960's. Mr. Allen wanted to bring a Major League Baseball franchise to Atlanta but lacked a credible plan for building a stadium. 
 ''How bad do you want this stadium, Ivan?'' Mr. Lane asked.
 ''Bad.''
 ''You've got it,'' said Mr. Lane, who added that he would pledge the full credit of his bank to build the stadium and that he and other local executives would oversee construction. ''And if that's not enough to get it done, you and I can't get it done.''
 Mr. Allen was stunned that Mr. Lane was willing to venture the bank's money on such a speculative civic project (as it turned out, the stadium was built and the investment returned), but such things were possible in the 1960's because banks were joined at the hip to their communities. The law prohibited bank companies from owning banks outside their home states and sometimes even outside their home counties. So Citizens and Southern could grow only if Atlanta grew too. 
 And today? In most cities, the chief executives of the largest banks are no more involved in civic work than the branch managers of I.B.M. That's because, since the 1980's, bank-holding restrictions have eased, local banks have been bought by out-of-state companies and the people who run the banks have become branch managers. 
 The numbers tell part of the story: there are now about 7,600 commercial banks in the United States, down from 13,000 in 1980. But this decline, as big as it is, underestimates the impact on civic leadership, since the consolidations have been greatest among the larger banks that once led their communities. Today, the top three banks in Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Washington and scores of other cities are owned by companies headquartered elsewhere. (In New Orleans, only one of the top three is owned locally.) Even Mr. Powell's old bank, First National of Amarillo, was bought in the 1990's, first by Boatsmen's Bancshares, then by NationsBank (now Bank of America). 
 Bank presidents have become corporate nomads. A few years ago, I calculated how long bank executives from First Union Bank (now part of Wachovia Bank) stayed in Atlanta. From June 1994 to September 2000, there were three regional chief executives. With gaps, as one left and the next arrived, the average tenure was 20 months, barely time to attend a few chamber of commerce meetings, much less to lead the organization. 
 The decline of bankers as leaders has made cities more dependent on political leadership. Thankfully, there have been some gifted mayors in recent years, but where there haven't been, cities have suffered. There are few Mills Lanes around to instruct mayors on how to get things done.
 Nor are there many bankers left with the knowledge or authority to invest their banks' resources in bold rebuilding efforts. As the main federal contact for congressional, state, local and private leaders in supporting the recovery of the Gulf Coast, Mr. Powell must already be painfully aware of their passing.

HEADLINE: Back to the Beach

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
WHEN Jimmy Buffett hit Rockefeller Center plaza last week, to plunk away at his guitar for the ''Today'' show, the Bard of Margaritaville came barefoot and wearing vintage-looking board shorts and a T-shirt, as if to signal that summer had officially begun. Make that the Endless Summer. It has been decades since Mr. Buffett first tapped into the cultural sweet spot that is surf culture. And, while his take on beach bum narratives typically leads to a bar stool and the sun slipping behind the Key West horizon, that his philosophical roots are in the culture of wave-riding seems perfectly -- one could almost say, gin -- clear.
 Lately, the octopus grasp of surf culture has become so inescapable that it is hard to contemplate a time, just over a half-century ago, when surfers were legitimate counterculture types, a wave-riding minority of oddballs, semi-sociopaths, dropouts, athletically gifted isolates with the occasional drug or messiah problem, or just all-around good-time freaks. 
That was long before the waves at Ditch Plains on Long Island became so crowded after Memorial Day that one practically has to take a number before paddling out; before those Americans who call themselves surfers rose 90 percent to 2.7 million between 1987 and 2005; before Quiksilver, the surf wear behemoth founded by two surfing buddies, started clocking revenues of $541 million a quarter, as it did in the first months of 2006; before Laird Hamilton, the big-wave riding Adonis whose ego is commensurate with the 30-footers he routinely attacks, went from being the sport's Evel Knievel to being a spokesman for Davidoff cologne and American Express.
 Describing the surfer ''denizens'' of Windansea Beach in San Diego in his 1965 book, ''The Pump House Gang,'' Tom Wolfe wryly noted that ''surfing was just 25 percent sport and 75 percent way of life.'' It was, Mr. Wolfe wrote, ''a curious thing to build a communal life around.'' Even more improbable, it would have seemed then, was that the sport of ancient Hawaiians would one day provide the basis for a multibillion-dollar clothing business, which was celebrated last week at the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association's ninth annual conclave, its largest ever, held in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
 ''It's about the big brands that continue to dominate the core retail landscape and the small brands that bring newness to the younger core kids,'' Dick Baker, the association president, told 410 attendees, according to a fashion trade publication. Curiously, though, it may be that fewer of the fabled ''younger core kids'' are driving the surf style business than one might imagine. This is hinted at in Quiksilver's current description of itself as ''producers of clothing, accessories and related products for young-minded people and developers of brands that represent a casual lifestyle driven from a board-riding heritage.'' 
 ''Young-minded'' and ''board-riding heritage'' seem to suggest that one qualifies as a surfer if one has seen ''Step Into Liquid,'' the 2003 documentary on surfing's elite athletes and their secret haunts, and purchased a pair of Billabong shorts. And there is nothing wrong with that. But before the last remaining shreds of original surf style and culture are crammed into the grinder of commerce to be processed into sartorial scrapple -- made from equal parts flip-flops-and-board-shorts and T-shirts-and-hoodies and flat-fronts-and-Hawaiian-Punch-bucket-hat -- it may be worthwhile to revisit the original spirit of the sport. 
 ''I think with surfing, there was this absolute moment of almost innocence after the war,'' said John McWhinnie, who in 2001 organized a fine show of surf-related art titled ''Surf's Up''in East Hampton, N.Y. He was referring, of course, to the Second World War and the rebellious surf culture that emerged at its conclusion. 
 Almost concurrent with the arrival of the Beats on the cultural landscape, surfing produced its own array of rebels, dropouts and outlaws, albeit these radicals tended to have a tan. ''That was all transformed totally by 'Gidget,' '' Mr. McWhinnie said, referring to the unkillable 1959 Sandra Dee movie that was made from a novel Frederick Kohner allegedly based on the antics of his teenage daughter and a passel of her surf-crazed buddies at Malibu. ''That's when the commercial engines that drive the economy seized on this as another form of teenage rebellion they would commodify.''
 Who can blame them? It is possible that no sport practiced by fewer people has ever had the influence of surfing on American style. This proposition is put to the test this month as a batch of new books about surf culture arrives in bookstores, along with a gallery exhibit pitched at the surprisingly large cohort of secret surfers who happen to live in New York, the least obvious of surfing towns. 
 Among surf cultists (and rare book dealers) the handful of books put out over the past decade by the art director and surfer Tom Adler are genuinely coveted objects, beginning with ''Don James: Surfing San Onofre to Point Dune: 1936-1942.'' This modest volume compiles the photographs of Mr. James, a Los Angeles neighbor of Mr. Adler's who was an early beach boy turned surfer turned dentist. Mr. James's neglected scrapbook of photographs was ultimately enshrined in Mr. Adler's 1997 book, the pictures of surfers and board shapers and bathing beauties (both female and male) offering an enchanted view into the hedonistic promise of surf life along the southern California coastline at a time when there were probably no more than 200 practitioners of the sport. The effect of the book is like looking at flashcards from an American Eden. 
 Did Bruce Weber base his entire late oeuvre on these photos or does it just seem that way? ''I showed Bruce Weber the photos,'' Mr. Adler said. ''He had me print archival prints as Christmas gifts in 1995 and he encouraged me to publish the book.'' 
 Having stumbled onto the James trove, Mr. Adler soon realized there must be others and since then his T. Adler Books in Santa Barbara has published ''Surf Life 32 to 02'' (2003); ''Dora Lives: The Authorized Story of Miki Dora'' (2005), about the most renegade spirit the sport has yet to produce;''Surfing Photographs From the Seventies Taken by Jeff Divine'' (2005); and ''Surf Contest'' (2006). Graphically handsome, occasionally maddening in their reliance on images without captions or other information, the Adler books are nevertheless Aladdin's caves in terms of pure style.
 If the surf scene lately has ''taken on a commercial competitive look,'' one in which surfers appear branded and generic, said Mr. Adler, the books make obvious that this was anything but the case at the start. ''In the 60's there was a surfer uniform, but it was an outsider uniform'' that telegraphed cool, said Mr. Adler, whose show opening June 6 at Danziger Projects on West 26th Street pairs surfing pictures from his archive with graphic works of his own.
 ''The look was 501 Levi's, Jack Purcell tennis shoes or Jesus Christ sandals made by Clarks,'' Mr. Adler said. ''You wore a white crew T-shirt from J. C. Penney, which had a higher neck than other makes, short-sleeved button-down Madras shirts and plaid shorts that were slim legged and knee-length.'' In cold weather, surfers added woolen Pendleton shirts or else waterproof windbreakers made by McGregor under the label Scottish Drizzler. Anyone dubious of the alluring appeal held by this particular style might consult the pages of, say, GQ, whose June issue highlights a variety of looks that might have been lifted intact from ''Surf Life 32 to 02.''
 If surfing can be seen as a sport of fugitive grace and improbable physics and among the only athletic pursuits undertaken in a medium that itself is always in motion, then there is surely something futile in attempts to pin down its poetry. Still, Michael Halsband's ''Surf Book'' attempts this feat in low-key fashion by tracking down the legends who inspired the long-board surfer Joel Tudor, a legend himself, photographing them in deliberately artless fashion and, most important of all, getting down their stories of what may be a vanishing world. 
 This world often enough was built on randy, stoned, youthful antiauthoritarianism and a deeply American distaste for undertakings involving a group. Before the sport was served by huge-circulation magazines, it had its own kind of samizdat, pamphlets and fliers put out by garage publishers whose early graphics and grainy photos are now traded avidly on the Internet. 
 It might seem that the physically blessed soul that is the typical pro surfer would not be well served by enshrinement in a volume as hefty (and costly) as a headstone. Yet that is how the publisher Benedict Taschen has seen fit to commemorate the work of Leroy Grannis, godfather of surf photography, whose ''Surf Photography of the 1960's and 1970's'' comes in a pretentious slipcase, weighs more than 10 pounds and carries the rather daunting price of $400. Despite its bloated production, the book retains some of both the ornery pluck and the enduring sprightliness of the 88-year-old Mr. Grannis, who took up the sport 75 years ago in Hermosa Beach, Calif., and only stopped in 2001 when a doctor advised him that knee paddling was probably not the best thing for the hip he had just had replaced. 
 ''Back when I started out, money never entered into it,'' said Mr. Grannis last week by telephone from Carlsbad, Calif. ''It was a lot more relaxed before 'Gidget,' which changed everything, and when there wasn't all the movies and television programs bringing more and more surfers into the fold.'' 
 As much as for their images of perfect young bodies framed in the flat light of Southern California or the lambent aura that seems to characterize Hawaiian days, Mr. Grannis's pictures are most startling because the scenes they record and breaks they document are pristinely beautifully and impossibly vacant. ''It's getting to be so crowded now,'' said Mr. Grannis, referring to today's nearly three million surfers. ''It probably isn't as much fun.'' Unless, of course, it is.

 This invasion is of the journalistic kind as British news media enter the American market or seek to raise their profile here. The most recent example is the BBC World division of the British Broadcasting Corporation, which starts a campaign today to introduce Americans to a 24-hour news network on cable television that seeks to compete against CNN and Fox News Channel.
The campaign, with a budget estimated at close to $1 million, is promoting the arrival of the BBC World News network on American cable. The Cablevision Systems Corporation recently added the network to its digital lineup in metropolitan New York. The campaign, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, is aimed not only at potential viewers but also at Madison Avenue, to stimulate demand for commercial time, and at other cable system operators, to persuade them to offer BBC World News to their subscribers.
 ''We hope very much this is the start of a series of deals,'' said Richard Sambrook, chief executive at BBC World in London, who is working with Discovery Communications on American distribution for BBC World News. 
 The United States ''is the only region in the world where we're not available on a 24-hour basis,'' Mr. Sambrook said. Until now, he added, the only exposure Americans have had to BBC news was a daily, 30-minute program carried by local PBS stations. (The BBC America cable network that BBC World distributes to 49.4 million American homes offers only entertainment programming.)
 The campaign for BBC World News, carrying themes like ''News beyond your borders,'' portrays the network as providing coverage that is impartial and objective, enabling viewers, as several ads declare, to ''see both sides of the story.''
 In other words, ''Fair and balanced,'' but for real.
 ''In some ways the electorate is saying it's tired of partisanship in Washington, so conceptually there is an opportunity for a new voice to enter the cable news arena that is less polarizing,'' said Ed Keller, chief executive at the Keller Fay Group, an agency in New Brunswick, N.J., that specializes in word-of-mouth marketing. He likened BBC World News' chances of drawing viewers to the ability of a third-party candidate for president ''to make waves'' in 2008.
 The BBC news network is the third recent example of the British media aiming at Americans. In February, The Economist, the weekly newsmagazine published by Pearson, started testing in Baltimore a campaign to increase subscription and newsstand sales in the United States.
 And The Times of London, owned by the News Corporation, announced last week that it would begin publishing a daily newspaper for American readers, starting on Tuesday, with an initial print run of close to 10,000 copies to be distributed in New York and Washington.
 ''This has the feeling of Americans deciding they need something outside the system to get a perspective on what's going on,'' said Nick Shore, principal at the Way Group in New York, a strategic consulting company. ''It's a global version of a second opinion.''
 The interest in world news delivered from someplace outside the United States could be a reaction to ''the Wal-Martization of America,'' Mr. Shore said -- that is, responding to perceptions of news that originates here as homogenized or corporatized.
 Just as the ''cool Britannia'' trend has benefited Britain in fields like fashion and music, said Mr. Shore, who is British, ''in a knowledge economy, the intellectual version is 'cool knowledge,' '' learned from British sources of news and information.
 The campaign for BBC World News is intended to be thought-provoking. For instance, there are several posters that at first glance seem to display world maps. On closer inspection, the countries form provocative images like a captive kneeling before a soldier and a health worker carrying dead birds.
 A billboard at Broadway and 50th Street in Midtown Manhattan will ask passers-by to look at news photographs and decide which of two sharply different opinions they agree with. They can vote by cellphone text messages and the results will be tallied on digital displays on the billboard.
 The first photograph is of immigrants and the choices are ''citizens'' or ''criminals.'' Other ads will show American soldiers, with the choices of ''occupier'' or ''liberator''; Chinese flags, with the choices of ''befriend'' or ''beware''; and the bird flu, with the choices of ''imminent'' or ''preventable.''
 The idea is to convey that BBC World News ''never tells you what to think,'' said Ari Weiss, a creative director at BBDO New York who worked on the campaign with another creative director, Jerome Marucci.
 ''They were willing to push the envelope,'' Mr. Weiss said of the BBC World executives, ''and we don't always get to do that.'' 
 BBC World may also be pushing the envelope in trying to introduce a 24-hour news network to American viewers.
 ''It's not an easy job,'' said Jez Frampton, group chief executive at Interbrand in New York, a corporate identity consulting company. ''It is hard to break habits'' when it comes to watching news, he added, and BBC World News will be ''up against some pretty powerful news brands'' like CNN and Fox.
 Still, ''the BBC as a brand seems to be well respected in the U.S.,'' said Mr. Frampton, who is British, ''perceived to be independent, with a deep and strong reputation for telling the truth, impartiality and straightforwardness.''
 And the educated, affluent viewers at whom BBC World News is aimed ''may perceive some American news sources to be less than straightforward,'' he added.
 Other elements of the campaign include promotional spots on a New York radio station, WFAN-AM, that will report on the vote tallies on the digital billboard; so-called wild postings of signs on construction sites; posters on train platforms; and a media tour offering American reporters who cover the television industry interviews with BBC anchors and reporters.
 Two other agencies are working with BBDO New York on the campaign. Weber Shandwick, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is handling a public relations initiative and Mediaedge:cia, part of the WPP Group, is handling the media planning and buying. In its home market, BBC World uses as its creative agency a BBDO New York sibling, AMV BBDO in London.

HEADLINE: Midwestern Business Growth Outpaced Predictions in May

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 31 

 BODY:
Midwestern business expanded in May at its fastest rate in seven months, surging at a time when many economists had been expecting slower growth, a report showed Wednesday. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago said its business barometer rose from 57.2 in April to 61.5 in May -- the highest since October. Economists had predicted the index would fall to 56.0.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and the index has been above that level for more than three years.
 The Chicago region is heavily industrial, so economists often view the data as a factory-sector index, even though service firms are also surveyed.
 Machinery makers in the Midwest have been busy for several months replacing oil industry equipment damaged by hurricanes last year in the Gulf of Mexico.
 A report by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank this week showed that machinery output in the bank's five-state district surged 11.7 percent in April compared with a year ago.
 ''The manufacturing sector as a whole continues to look pretty strong despite the headwinds facing the economy,'' said Patrick Fearon, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
 Financial markets expect a Fed interest rate increase in June, and the Midwest manufacturing report was consistent with that view.
 On Wednesday, market sentiment deepened for a further rate increase after the release of minutes from the May 10 meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.
 Although the policy makers showed uncertainty about how much more they might raise interest rates, they expressed enough concern about inflation to persuade many traders that a 17th consecutive rate increase was likely.

HEADLINE: Advertising Commodities Can Be Tricky, but It Does Pay Off 

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS classify advertising into two broad types: informational advertising and image advertising.
 Classified ads, yellow pages and search engine ads are examples of the first category; they provide specific information about products and services.
These are quite different from ads for, say, soft drinks. Such ads do not typically offer new information. Instead, they seek to convey a positive image of a product by associating it with attractive people who seem to be having a lot of fun. If you drink the right brand of soda or beer, maybe you'll have fun, too.
 There is a third, lesser known type of ad called commodity advertising. These ads focus on generic products like agricultural commodities. Well-known examples are the ''California Raisins,'' ''Got Milk?'' and ''Real California Cheese'' campaigns. 
 Four agricultural economists -- Harry M. Kaiser, Julian M. Alston, John M. Crespi and Richard J. Sexton -- have studied these efforts in detail and outline how they work in the book ''The Economics of Commodity Promotion Programs'' (Peter Lang Publishing, 2005). There are two interesting features of commodity advertising programs: first, they are unreasonably effective, and second, they are unreasonably difficult to maintain.
 On the first point, the economists calculate that each dollar spent on advertising agricultural products like eggs, milk, beef, prunes and almonds yields $3 to $6 of additional revenue to producers.
 The ''California Raisins'' campaign was credited with increasing raisin sales 10 percent in the 1980's. According to the California Raisin Board, before the ad campaign, raisins were ''at best dull and boring.'' After the campaign, people were no longer ''ashamed to eat raisins.'' Well, maybe so.
 In any event, there are now over 60 active commodity marketing programs in California alone, involving spending of about $1 billion a year.
 But despite their success, the programs can be difficult to maintain. The problem lies in aligning incentives. The producer of a branded product pays all the costs and reaps all the benefits of its advertising spending, leading it to a carefully considered decision about how much to spend.
 By contrast, the benefits and costs of commodity advertising are spread unequally among many producers, making it tough to reach a collective decision about marketing levels.
 A California almond producer benefits from almond marketing efforts whether or not the producer contributes to them. So it is tempting to take a free ride on the payments of others.
 Mandatory programs provide one solution to this problem. Growers vote about whether to start a marketing program and, if the vote succeeds, all growers are required to participate.
 Not surprisingly, the growers who receive few benefits from the programs do not want to be forced to contribute.
 In early 1980's one almond grower, Saulsbury Orchards and Almond Processing, consistently sold most of its crop to a breakfast cereal maker. As part of the deal, Saulsbury helped to finance advertising for the cereal company. When it asked for reimbursement for these marketing costs, the Almond Board refused to pay, arguing that almonds were only a small part of the good being advertised.
 Saulsbury Orchards sued the almond marketing board and, in 1993, the case ended up in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which found that mandatory advertising violated Saulsbury's First Amendment rights of free speech and association.
 After that decision, dozens of challenges to mandated marketing programs arose in the 1990's. Apples, peaches, plums, grapes, kiwi -- a veritable cornucopia of producers challenged the programs, with several cases going to district courts and some reaching the Supreme Court.
 In 2004, federal appeals courts ruled that three highly successful programs -- for beef, pork and milk -- were unconstitutional. But in 2005, the Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that beef marketing programs did not violate the First Amendment, as they were considered protected ''government speech.''
 Despite this ruling, there are still over 70 cases being litigated; the outcomes will probably depend on specific details of the marketing programs. But it now seems likely that commodity marketing programs will continue to exist in some form or other.
 Professor Kaiser, Kent D. Messer, and William D. Schulze, economists at Cornell, argue that this is a good thing since commodity marketing is often beneficial to consumers.
 Consider the snack industry. From 1970 to 2001, per capita soda consumption more than doubled, while milk consumption fell by more than two-thirds. Surely, a few million dollars to promote milk consumption can not be bad, given the billions spent by the soft drink industry. Compare a soda and a candy bar with a carton of milk and a handful of raisins: which would you rather your child chose as a snack?
 Or look at the pharmaceutical industry. Drug companies spend billions to advertise their branded products while virtually nothing is spent to market generic drugs. The health insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield says that this is part of the reason brand drugs cost three times what equivalent generics do.
 It can be tricky to structure commodity marketing programs so that they overcome the free rider problem. But if this can be done, such programs may offer substantial benefits to both producers and consumers.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Oil Prices and Worries on Iran Ease a Bit 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and MARTIN FACKLER; Richard Latker contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday, buoyed by the first drop in oil prices in a week and by signs that the tension with Iran over its nuclear program might ease. 
 Newly released minutes of a Federal Reserve committee meeting made little impression on trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 73.88 points to close at 11,168.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,270.09, up 10.25 points. The Nasdaq rose 14.14 points, closing at 2,178.88. 
 Yesterday's advances slowed after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from the May 10 meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, but the market largely rebounded by the close. Despite yesterday's gains, the market ended May on a lackluster note, with all three indexes down for the month. The S.& P. 500 had its biggest monthly drop in almost two years. 
 The upturn yesterday came after a bruising day of trading on Tuesday, with a jump in oil prices and new concern that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again. 
 Minutes of the Fed's meeting showed that the central bank had considered raising its benchmark interest rate a half-point, twice the usual amount, to 5.25 percent. 
 But the committee decided that a quarter-point increase was enough because of the likelihood that ''core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year,'' the minutes said. ''Given the risks to growth and inflation, committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed.'' 
 With the inflation rate running at the high end of what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, considers a healthy range, there is some expectation of another increase when the committee meets again at the end of June. The minutes shed little direct light on what the Fed might do, but many economists read them to indicate that further increases are likely. 
 ''The Fed minutes are a bit discouraging to those looking for a June pause,'' Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note. ''So a hike is not yet a done deal. But it certainly seems more likely.''
 On top of price concerns, tensions over Iran have also rattled the markets lately. But yesterday, in remarks that apparently soothed investor concern, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States would be willing to join multinational talks with Iran if it suspended all its nuclear activities. The announcement was a reversal in policy for the United States, which has not had full diplomatic ties with Iran since the 1979-81 hostage crisis.
 The market's rebound coincided with the release of a survey by ADP Employer Services showing that private companies added jobs at a slower rate in May than in April.
 The prospect of rising inflation and interest rates and a weakening of consumer confidence in the United States helped bring about a broad sell-off in Asia's jittery stock markets earlier in the day. Indian shares tumbled and Japanese stocks fell to a three-month low.
 Although the downbeat consumer confidence figures reported Tuesday had been widely expected, investors in Asia took them as a harbinger of weaker demand for the consumer-goods exports that underpin most Asian economies.
 Comments from a Federal Reserve official on Tuesday, hinting at another interest rate increase in June, were also taken as a negative omen. And while economic growth in Asia has shown no objective indication of slowing lately, some investors are reading continued high oil prices as a sign that the growth may not be sustainable.
 Despite a series of corrections in recent weeks, investors are still sitting on large paper profits accrued during the increase in prices over the last year. In emerging markets like India, a fear that foreign investors are cashing their winnings can be a powerful incentive to sell.
 ''In an environment combining growth worries and inflation jitters, the instinct is to sell risky assets,'' said Tim Condon, the chief economist at ING Bank Singapore. ''Are those jitters warranted? In truth, the forward-looking indicators are as high as they've ever been and do not point to any drop-off in activity.''
 The selling in Asia yesterday capped the worst month for Asian equities since September 2002. The Sensex index in India closed 3.6 percent lower, after falling 6.4 percent at one point in the trading day; Australia's markets slid 2 percent, Japanese shares fell 2.5 percent and Singapore stocks shed 2.4 percent. Markets in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.
 In early trading today, stock markets in Japan, Singapore and Australia regained about half those losses as the prospect of a rate increase by the Fed drove up the dollar against local currencies. A stronger dollar helps sales of Asian exporters by making their products cheaper for American consumers. An hour after the open, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index was trading up 150.41 points, or 1 percent, to 15,617.74. 
 ''There's a sense that global growth may slow and liquidity will ebb,'' said William Belchere, chief Asia economist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.
 Yesterday in Japan, Asia's largest economy, the decline in American consumer confidence hit the share prices of major manufacturers like Sony, Toyota and Canon. Stocks have also weakened on fears that Japan's long stock rally could be losing steam, as the economy has appeared to enter a stretch of solid but unspectacular growth. 
 Major European stock markets, which finished trading before the release of the Fed committee's minutes, generally posted healthy gains.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills.

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., May 31 

 BODY:
New York Republicans tried to pull off an old-fashioned political fix at their state party convention on Wednesday as Gov. George E. Pataki and other leaders privately urged delegates to support William F. Weld for governor and John Faso as his running mate.
 But Republicans close to Mr. Pataki said the brokered ticket would be hard to manage, if not impossible. The reasons include the limited sway of the lame-duck governor, the commitment of delegates to their preferred candidates, and Mr. Faso's refusal to abandon his own campaign for governor, which has been gaining momentum despite concerns about his voter appeal in a general election. 
The Republican delegates are preparing to vote here on Thursday to designate either Mr. Weld or Mr. Faso as their choice for governor. Voters will select the nominee in a primary Sept. 12. According to advisers to both men, each has support from more than 40 percent of the delegates; more than 50 percent is needed to be the designee.
 The kingmaker of the convention appears to be Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County chairman, whose delegates control about 10 percent of the vote. His camp has remained neutral, and he went to lunch on Wednesday with Mr. Pataki and another Republican leader, State Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, to plot strategy in the Weld-Faso fight.
 In an interview, Mr. Mondello said that he, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno all wanted a Weld-Faso ticket -- or a Faso-Weld ticket, if more delegates are leaning toward Mr. Faso -- to avoid a bruising primary. Mr. Mondello said party leaders were buttonholing delegates nonstop to try for a count of which candidate was in the lead.
 But advisers to the three men said that their personal preference was Mr. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts and moderate Republican who has been an able fund-raiser.
 They also said that Mr. Pataki did not believe that Mr. Faso -- as an opponent of abortion rights and with some controversial votes from his days in the Assembly -- could overcome the Democratic designee, Eliot Spitzer, in an increasingly Democratic state.
 ''It's so close right now between these guys, and I'm hoping that the egos will deflate a little bit and the two of them can agree on a unified ticket,'' Mr. Mondello said. ''I have no sense of who will be at the top of the ticket. But we need to be united.''
 Mr. Weld and Mr. Faso have repeatedly said that they have no interest in being lieutenant governor, and Republicans close to Mr. Pataki acknowledged last night that they had little reason to believe that a Weld-Faso or Faso-Weld ticket would emerge.
 ''The governor feels he can't do that much to bring the party together,'' said one Republican who spoke with Mr. Pataki on Wednesday about the ticket and would only discuss that conversation on condition of anonymity. ''A decade ago the party leadership could cut deals, promise jobs. There's not much leverage when the governor is leaving at the end of '06.''
 Mr. Faso worked the convention hall throughout the day, shaking hands in the lunch line, darting among his pockets of support and pressing people to vote their will.
 ''Sometimes promises are made in disappearing ink,'' he said of the convention horse-trading.
 Gerard Borriello, a delegate from Queens who is supporting Mr. Faso, said that a Weld supporter tried to draw him to switch preferences on the merits. But he said he was a longtime admirer of Mr. Faso's.
 ''The Weld folks could've said anything they wanted in the one hand and burped in the other, but I'm not leaving John's side,'' Mr. Borriello said.
 Mr. Weld, meanwhile, moved to increase his share of votes by tapping a Republican turned Democrat turned Republican, Christopher L. Jacobs, as his running mate. Mr. Jacobs, 39, a Buffalo developer and school board member who became Mr. Pataki's secretary of state in early May, made a mixed impression at his first news conference. He incorrectly credited Mr. Weld as ''a key figure in creating the Massachusetts Miracle'' that fired up the economy there in the 1980's; Mr. Weld was elected in 1990.
 Mr. Weld said flatly that he would not drop out of the governor's race under any circumstances, even if Mr. Faso emerged as the designee. And he acknowledged that the outcome of Thursday's vote was largely in Mr. Mondello's hands.
 ''When the roll is called tomorrow for Nassau County,'' Mr. Weld said, ''I think you'll be able to hear a pin drop.''

HEADLINE: LeFraks Envision Even Bigger Skyline Across Hudson

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Standing atop a condominium tower under construction at the Newport complex in Jersey City, Richard LeFrak looked south at a forest of green-glass commercial towers and brick residential buildings that seem to leap from the waterfront. His family and their partner built them, 20 in all.
 Although the LeFraks cannot lay claim to the tallest tower (the 800-foot Goldman Sachs building at Paulus Hook), they have built more than a third of the high-rise skyline that has grown up along Jersey City's once dilapidated waterfront. And today, exactly 20 years after his father, Sam, embarked on a seemingly quixotic bid to transform these rusty old railroad yards into Newport, Mr. LeFrak is announcing plans for another hotel and four more apartment towers.
The announcement comes on the 20th anniversary of the start of Newport and calls attention to the part that the LeFraks have played in the current Jersey City housing boom. The new plans represent a $750 million investment, on top of the nearly $2.5 billion that the LeFraks say they have already plowed into Newport. 
 Mr. LeFrak, 60, said the family is making good on a promise by his father and Melvin Simon, the shopping center developer, to build a community where dilapidated piers, warehouses and railroad tracks stood. 
 ''We're celebrating that we got this far,'' said Mr. LeFrak, who was involved with Newport from the beginning and has now been joined by his sons, Jamie and Harry. ''We're celebrating that the vision of my father and Mel Simon is pretty well complete.''
 The scale of the undertaking is hard to imagine. At 600 acres, Newport is twice as big as Co-op City in the Bronx. There are 11 residential buildings containing 4,135 apartments, eight office buildings with 5.5 million square feet of office space, a 187-room hotel, a marina, a 1.2-million-square-foot mall and many other buildings and stores. Across the river from Chelsea, the complex stretches the equivalent of about 14 Manhattan blocks. Samuel J. LeFrak, who died in 2003 at 85 and built more housing in New York City during his life than any other private developer, saw the possibilities in Jersey City when most builders turned up their noses. 
 ''Sam was bigger than life,'' said Bob Cotter, director of planning in Jersey City. ''His dream was to build this city on the left bank of the Hudson River. He came over and did it. The waterfront has given Jersey City a panache that it never had.''
 But some urban planners, neighborhood advocates and residents have complained that Newport has a suburban sensibility. Many of the buildings stand alone, with little connection to one another, or to the older, grittier sections of Jersey City to the west, they say. There is a public esplanade along the Hudson River, with sweeping views of Manhattan, but it is bordered by Newport buildings, giving it the impression of a private enclave.
 ''I love living in a place that takes your breath away,'' said Monica Coe, an architect who has lived at Newport for 10 years. ''At night you see the sparkling lights of Manhattan, rather than the brick walls you'd get in Manhattan. But it's a little like living in a feudal holding.''
 Dan Falcon, a 15-year resident, said: ''Newport has been malled off from the city. We wanted the city to have access to the waterfront.''
 Mr. LeFrak does not dismiss the criticisms. ''It's a valid point,'' he said. ''We're trying to address that now that we have some density.'' 
 The company is filling in some of the empty space between buildings and adding street-front stores, to create street life, and small parks, if not the larger park-on-a-pier that some residents wanted. On a recent morning, office workers and women pushing baby strollers could be seen on the streets.
 The LeFraks are known for a kind of efficient, if unimaginative, boxy building that provides the maximum space for the rent. But the buildings in the next round are more interesting, with one, the Ellipse, a sleek, elliptical residential tower designed by the well-known Arquitectonica of Miami.
 In the late 1970's, the Jersey City waterfront was a web of train terminals owned by bankrupt railroads. Newport began not with Samuel LeFrak but with Mr. Simon and another mall developer who wanted to build a shopping center anchored with a Stern's department store.
 Mr. Simon's bankers urged him to find a partner to build housing. He put in a cold call to Sam LeFrak, persuading him to travel from his office in Queens. The developer then called his son.
 ''He said, 'Richard, you'd better take a look at this,' '' Mr. LeFrak recalled. ''I've been dreaming about something like this my whole life.''
 Sam LeFrak, in characteristic fashion, vowed to undertake ''probably the largest job that has ever been built since the pyramids'' and create the ''experimental prototype city of tomorrow.''
 Mr. Simon built the mall and the first office building, while the LeFraks built several apartment towers. ''He built all the other buildings with cash,'' Mr. Simon said. ''We couldn't afford to borrow the money.''
 Progress was slow and a devastating recession in the early 1990's sent the nascent ''Jersey gold coast'' into a tailspin, and the LeFraks say they had huge losses in the first 15 years. 
 But since 2000, they have built seven office buildings, attracting financial tenants from Manhattan like J. P. Morgan Chase, Knight Securities and Insurance Services Office with cheaper rents and tax breaks, surprising brokers who doubted that the New Jersey waterfront would ever attract office tenants.
 The LeFraks have the option of building more commercial space, but the vacancy rate is 14.1 percent, according to the brokers Cushman & Wakefield. And new housing is what's hot. K. Hovnanian and Equity Residential recently bought a commercial site on the waterfront, where they plan to build a 900-unit apartment complex. 
 Even Donald J. Trump has found Jersey City, lending his name to a $415 million project to build two residential towers, one 50 stories and the other 55 stories.
 Mr. Cotter said there are 7,000 apartments planned or under construction within a mile of City Hall, two or three times the number five years ago, fueled by the soaring sales prices and rents across the Hudson River.
 ''It's not Manhattan,'' Mr. LeFrak said on a recent walking tour of Newport. ''But it's not bad. And it just might,'' he paused, raising a finger, ''might, be better than Brooklyn.''

HEADLINE: Low Payments By U.S. Raise Medical Bills Billions a Year

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Employers and consumers are paying billions of dollars more a year for medical care to compensate for imbalances in the nation's health care system resulting from tight Medicare and Medicaid budgets, according to Blue Cross officials and independent actuaries. 
 A new study commissioned by Premera Blue Cross, based in Seattle, has found a rapid acceleration in higher costs to private payers in Washington State, for example, as hospitals and doctors grapple with constraints in the federal health insurance programs.
 The study found that in 2004, the most recent year for which full data are available, hospitals in Washington State charged an additional $738 million -- or 14.3 percent of their revenue -- to private payers to make up for Medicare and Medicaid underpayments. Similarly, doctors shifted $620 million, or 12 percent, said John Pickering, an actuary at Milliman Inc., a consulting and actuarial firm that conducted the study.
 A similar Milliman study in California for 2004 said that health plans and consumers paid an additional $4.5 billion for hospital care in that state to compensate for Medicaid and Medicare constraints. Milliman's California study, commissioned by Blue Shield of California, did not include physicians' charges.
 Will Fox, a Milliman actuary, said California hospitals had been hit particularly hard by Medicare payment policies in the last few years, ''and there is no reason to think this has let up.''
 Other research has come to similar conclusions across the country. Unpaid hospital bills, largely for the uninsured, are costing about $45 billion nationally a year and adding about 8.5 percent to the cost of health insurance for those who do pay, said Kenneth E. Thorpe, a health care economist at Emory University.
 Employers said the rising cost trends were, in turn, adding to the growing numbers of people without insurance. And when those people check into hospitals, they generate even higher costs for those employers and consumers who pay insurance premiums.
 ''This is a serious national problem, and it is only going to get much worse,'' said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a research and trade group for large employers. ''There are more uninsured, the hospitals are inefficient, and every year, Medicare and Medicaid hold down on increases to cover rising medical costs,'' she said. 
 Rich Maturi, a senior vice president of Premera, said the report would show ''employers and policy makers that they needed to address an unsustainable trend in the growth of cost-shifting.'' Business leaders, health plans and groups representing hospitals and doctors plan to meet in July to review the report and make policy recommendations. 
 Although many state budgets are overwhelmed by rising Medicaid costs, health care reforms intended to reduce the ranks of the uninsured that were recently enacted in Massachusetts and Vermont include more state money for Medicaid. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Partners Healthcare, the largest hospital group in Boston, jointly supported the Medicaid increases. 
 ''That was a real-world example of hospitals and insurers seeing that the had common interests,'' said Paul Ginsberg, a health economist who is president of the Center for Studying Health Systems Change, a nonprofit research group in Washington. 
 Hospitals across the country lost money on Medicare patients in 2003 after at least six years of declining profit margins, according to the latest report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress and federal officials.

HEADLINE: As Prices Soar, the Orinoco Belt Becomes an Economic Battleground

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Jens Gould contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela, for this article.

DATELINE: PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela 

 BODY:
The sludge in the glass jar on David Nelson's bookshelf here is thicker than molasses and was once thought worthless. But the Chevron Corporation, whose operations he runs in eastern Venezuela, has spent about $1 billion turning what was once called liquid coal into oil, helping transform a swath of scrub grass into a great frontier for oil production. 
 The region, the Orinoco Belt, is in fact so promising that President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela says it contains up to 235 billion barrels of recoverable oil; if true, the reserves would rival those of Saudi Arabia.
 ''We do know that the Orinoco is underdeveloped,'' said Mr. Nelson, 49, a geologist from California with 27 years' experience developing heavy-grade oil. ''And the resources in the Middle East are at their midpoint.'' 
 This great, largely untapped treasure is pitting a leftist government aiming to use oil revenue for social programs against multinational corporations like Chevron, which were invited here a decade ago to develop the Orinoco Belt, a 54-square-mile area some 120 miles south of here.
 With demand rising, worldwide supplies threatening to decline and oil prices near record levels, the struggle in this country underscores the growing debate between governments and oil companies worldwide over profits from technologically challenging but potentially lucrative oil fields -- whether in the Caspian Sea, the Arctic tundra or here in the Orinoco region. 
 Venezuela will be the host for an OPEC meeting on June 1, where Mr. Chavez can be expected to emphasize his country's vast potential. It clearly has a lot to gain from the Orinoco, where daily oil production has slid to 2.6 million barrels, from 3.3 million barrels five years ago. To underline the region's potential, President Chavez has asked oil companies from as far away as China and Russia to certify the size of the hefty reserves. 
 Saudi Arabia, still the giant among world oil suppliers and the leading force in OPEC consultations, scoffs at such boasts. 
 Yet, what is under the ground here in Venezuela, the Western Hemisphere's largest oil-exporting nation, has become so valuable that companies throughout the world want to drill for more, and Mr. Chavez, who regards his government as revolutionary, wants it to have a larger slice of the earnings. 
 In Venezuela, foreign companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP and Total of France could lose once-favorable terms and in essence be forced to transfer up to $8 billion in value to the government, just as some opportunities elsewhere are drying up. 
 The big oil companies are right to be rattled. In April, Mr. Chavez's populist government took control of 32 mostly marginal oil fields across Venezuela that had been managed by foreign concerns. Then on May 16, the National Assembly raised royalties on the four heavy crude oil projects of the Orinoco to 33.3 percent, from 16.6 percent, and is planning to increase taxes to 50 percent, from 34 percent.
 The government says it is preparing to capture a bigger stake in the Orinoco -- turning control of projects that produce 600,000 barrels a day over to Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. Energy officials say the government could take up to 60 percent control of the so-called strategic associations, as the projects are called. No timetable has been laid out, but leaders in the National Assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Chavez's forces, say it is only a matter of time.
 ''With the high price of petroleum on the market, we are going to share in the excess earnings of the strategic associations,'' Mario Isea, president of the assembly's hydrocarbons commission, which is allied with Mr. Chavez, said in an interview. ''They have gone years without paying royalties and effectively paying commercial taxes instead of petroleum taxes.'' 
 In the mid-1990's, President Rafael Caldera's government, eager to develop oil discovered in the 1930's, opened the region to foreign investment because the state oil company had neither the capital nor the technology to develop the Orinoco's semisolid sludge. Oil prices were low, world supplies easily met demand and Venezuela had on its hands a crude oil so heavy, so filled with impurities, that it was not even known as oil, but rather bitumen.
 But then, given a virtual tax holiday intended to stimulate investment -- the royalty rate was 1 percent -- the multinationals embarked on a process of drilling and, more recently, upgrades that permit refining Orinoco crude oil into a lighter, marketable product. 
 In the Hamaca field, an area the size of Houston that produces oil for Chevron, ConocoPhillips and the Venezuelan state company, oil now slurps through an octopus-like system of horizontal wells that reach out as far as 8,000 feet. 
 The drill bits are equipped with sensors that emit seismic signals measuring what they are passing through -- whether rock, sandstone, fine shale, sand or clay.
 ''Obviously, we'd love to find deposits with sweet light crude in shallow fields,'' said Mr. Nelson, who carefully explains the complex challenges his company faces. ''That's not where energy resources are, so we have to adapt.''
 Back in a control room near his office in this Caribbean port, geologists and engineers monitor wall-size screens and make quick decisions whether the drill needs to bore ahead, or move up or down.
 The idea is to have the drill moving fast, at hundreds of feet an hour, into blue-shaded patches, which signal porous material that would contain crude oil.
 ''Our goal is to first find sand and once we find it, stay in it,'' said Mike Waite, a senior geophysicist who leads the team monitoring the drilling.
 Just west of here, gunk from the Orinoco is turned into oil at the Jose Industrial Complex, a virtual city of pipes, water-treatment lagoons, smokestacks, pits and storage tanks. Since the first shipment of Hamaca oil left aboard the tanker Overseas Sophie two years ago, the project has produced an average of 180,000 barrels a day.
 Mr. Nelson said the project, among the most intricate in the world, is worth it, ''but you have to put some elbow grease into it.''
 ''These projects are big,'' he said. ''They're complicated. They have a lot of moving parts. You have a lot of complicated negotiations with governments. It's not a business of instant gratification.''
 All told, according to a recent Deutsche Bank report on the Orinoco projects, $17 billion has been invested, about $3.5 billion in the Hamaca project alone. Big energy companies, including some from Brazil and China, would like nothing more than free rein to ramp up investments and produce more. 
 Ali Moshiri, Chevron's Latin America exploration and production group chief, said in April that Venezuela needed $200 billion to develop the heavy oil reserves.
 ''There's a sense of urgency, not a sense of luxury,'' said Mr. Moshiri, who predicted that 90 percent of Venezuela's production would come from the Orinoco in the years ahead. 
 The government, to be sure, talks of increasing production to 5.8 million barrels a day by 2012, from 2.6 million barrels now. But Venezuela, which as a leading voice in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has advocated a particularly tough form of oil nationalism, wants to achieve this on its own terms. 
 Its energy minister, Rafael Ramirez, who is also the president of Petroleos de Venezuela, said in an interview that the deals that multinational companies signed with the government in the 1990's were ''absurd,'' giving Venezuela little in return.
 ''They are beholden to their stockholders, and we are beholden to our country,'' Mr. Ramirez said. 
 Venezuelan officials contend that exploration and production in the Orinoco has become easy, even risk-free, with a barrel of oil costing less than $1 to produce, down from $2 in 1995. 
 Energy officials here assert that the multinationals exaggerated the technical challenges and costs, swindling the state.
 They also argue that the companies have made extraordinary profits -- and will continue to do so even with higher taxes and royalties.
 ''They have made a fortune,'' said Mr. Isea, the president of the hydrocarbons commission. ''This remains an excellent business. I do not think anyone will leave.'' 
 Venezuelan officials say their measures are enshrined in a 2001 law that says the state oil company must have a 51 percent stake in projects; they sidestep questions about previous contracts being grandfathered in. 
 Mr. Ramirez and lawmakers also say that a 1945 hydrocarbons law permits the government to raise royalties when the price of oil goes up.
 The foreign companies, trying to avoid controversy, do not publicly dispute the Venezuelan government's statements. But Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported analysis group in New York, said: ''In Venezuela today, I don't believe contracts have meaning. And it affects the production, no matter what the Venezuelans say.''
 The game of oil brinkmanship continues, with Mr. Ramirez saying that the companies have few options.
 ''It's no secret for anyone that the big deposits, the giant ones, are finished,'' he said. ''There are no new oil regions that compare to the Orinoco Belt.''
 The recent Deutsche Bank report agreed, saying that ''few are likely to quickly turn their backs on reserves of the order seen in Venezuela.''
 ''They may not like Chavez,'' the report added. ''They may not like his regime. But they also know that he has probably done as much to support high oil prices through his rhetoric and posturing as any individual. This president is no fool. And at the end of the day, you go where the oil is.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Rejects An Invitation For Talks In North Korea

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 1 

 BODY:
North Korea on Thursday invited the top American nuclear envoy to visit its capital, Pyongyang, for bilateral talks, but the White House insisted that the North return to long-deadlocked six-nation talks instead. 
 North Korea invited Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and chief negotiator in the nuclear talks, to Pyongyang, indicating that it wanted to discuss an agreement that was reached last September but never carried out.
''If the U.S. has a true political intention to implement the joint statement, we kindly invite once again the head of the U.S. side's delegation to the talks to visit Pyongyang and directly explain it to us,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement released through the official Korean Central News Agency.
 North Korea agreed last September in the six-nation talks to abandon its nuclear program in return for energy assistance and security guarantees. But the agreement left unclear the issue of the sequence of events, and disputes arose immediately over whether disarmament or the award of benefits would come first.
 Also, North Korea has said it will not return to the multination talks unless the United States lifts a crackdown on financial institutions dealing with the government and North Korean companies suspected of counterfeiting American dollars and laundering money. The other nations involved in the talks are China, South Korea, Japan and Russia.
 North Korea, which has long pushed for direct talks with the United States, issued the invitation a day after the United States offered to hold direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program. Washington has shifted away from decades of refusing to hold direct talks with Tehran, though the United States included the precondition that Iran suspend its uranium activities.
 ''The United States is not going to engage in bilateral negotiations with the government of North Korea,'' said Tony Snow, the White House spokesman. ''The United States sticks by its position, which is, North Korea has to return to the six-party talks.'' 
 The United States and the North, which engaged in direct talks in the past, reached an accord in 1994 that called for the installation of two civilian nuclear reactors in North Korea and other assistance after the North abandoned its nuclear program. The accord broke down after American officials accused the North in the fall of 2002 of engaging in a secret uranium enrichment program.
 The six-nation talks began in the summer of 2003. The United States has consistently rejected North Korea's request for bilateral talks, though informal talks between American and North Korean officials have taken place on the sidelines of the six-nation negotiations.
 In its statement on Thursday, North Korea reiterated that it would not return to the talks unless economic sanctions were lifted. The sanctions, which are opposed by China and South Korea, are said to have squeezed the North financially. Banks around the world have limited their dealings with North Korea, concerned that they would be blacklisted by the United States.

HEADLINE: South Korea's Governing Party Suffers a Blow in Local Elections

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 1 

 BODY:
The governing party of President Roh Moo Hyun received a crushing blow in local elections on Wednesday, winning only one of 16 contests to choose big-city mayors and provincial governors, according to final results released Thursday. It was the worst election performance by any governing party in South Korean history. 
 Despite the discouraging results, Mr. Roh said there would be no major change in his economic or foreign policies. ''I accept the results as a trend of public opinion,'' he said in a statement released by his office on Thursday. ''The government will do its best to faithfully implement the policies it has been pursuing.''
His party, the Uri Party, remains a dominant force in the South Korean Parliament.
 The Grand National Party, the conservative opposition party that urged voters to use the election as a midterm referendum on Mr. Roh, won 12 races, including the one for mayor of Seoul. The other three seats were taken by an independent and two candidates from a splinter opposition party.
 Opposition candidates, mostly from the conservative party, won more than 10 times as many seats as the Uri Party did in the races to elect 230 chiefs of administrative districts and 3,621 members of local councils.
 The results of elections were the clearest sign yet of South Koreans' growing disenchantment with Mr. Roh, who has less than two years left in office, and the Uri Party.
 Mr. Roh's critics say his blunt rhetoric and austere demeanor have strained relations with the United States and created a widening division over his policies, including those having to do with relations with North Korea and housing prices.
 Commentators said the election outcome reflected popular frustration with Mr. Roh's government more than support for the scandal-ridden opposition, leaving room for a political recovery by Mr. Roh. Nonetheless, his efforts to change laws governing corporate behavior and reconcile with North Korea could lose steam, political analysts said.
 In a sign of the political volatility that the election results have already unleashed before the presidential election next year, Chung Dong Young, the chairman of the Uri Party and a possible presidential candidate, resigned Thursday, taking responsibility for the election results.
 By law, Mr. Roh cannot seek re-election.
 His popularity has plummeted recently with his government's failure to achieve a breakthrough in relations with North Korea, despite economic aid for the North, and its inability to reinvigorate the economy.
 ''The election results are the people's verdict on the government's failure in reform programs and its lack of leadership,'' said Lee Chung Hee, a political science professor at Hankook University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.
 Mr. Roh's election in late 2002 introduced a new generation of left-leaning former student activists into politics. They formed the foundation of Mr. Roh's administration and pushed for a nationalistic agenda of greater diplomatic independence from the United States and reconciliation with North Korea.
 They often dismissed their critics as ''antidemocratic'' or ''conservative blockheads,'' alienating millions of South Koreans who respected what the older conservatives had done to rebuild the economy from the ashes of the Korean War.

HEADLINE: Asian Cars Won 40% Of Market Last Month

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1 

 BODY:
Three decades ago, with fuel supplies running short and long gas lines around the corner, Asian cars won their first converts in the American market.
 Now that average gas prices are flirting with $3 a gallon, consumers are rushing to them again.
Sales figures reported Thursday showed that Toyota, Honda and other Asian manufacturers claimed a record 40 percent of the American market in May, when sales of fuel-efficient vehicles like the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Sonata all rose 20 percent or more compared with May 2005. 
 For Detroit companies, which have continued to aggressively market their costly new sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks despite the high gas prices, market share last month dropped to 52.9 percent -- their second-lowest in history. 
 It was their smallest level since last October, when sales plummeted after the companies stopped offering employee-discount promotions for all consumers. 
 Executives at Honda, which has long focused on fuel economy and does not sell any vehicles with engines bigger than six cylinders, said they expected to continue winning market share as long as gas prices stay high.
 Honda reported an 11.4 percent increase in May, pushed by both the Civic and the new Fit, a subcompact that went on sale in April. 
 Richard Colliver, an executive vice president of American Honda, said the Fit is staying on showroom lots for an average of just eight days. 
 Some dealers, Mr. Colliver said, reported seeing customers follow delivery trucks into their showroom lots in hopes of nabbing a Fit -- something that has not happened since the original Civic went on sale in the 1970's.
 ''My feeling is that it's going to continue as people see what the price of gas is doing to their disposable income,'' Mr. Colliver said.
 In all, industry sales for May dropped 4.6 percent compared with 2005, according to Ward's InfoBank. Car sales rose nearly 2 percent, but sales of S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans fell 10.2 percent.
 Toyota, the company causing the most trouble for Detroit, took a record 15.9 percent of the American market in May, when its sales rose 12.3 percent from 2005. 
 For the second month in a row, it outsold DaimlerChrysler, including Chrysler and Mercedes, to rank as the third-biggest company in the United States. 
 Toyota trailed the No. 2 company, Ford Motor, by just 15,000 cars last month -- equal to the number of Camry sedans it sells in nine days.
 Over all, sales by General Motors fell 16 percent last month, in part, it said, because it has cut back on sales to rental car companies, which have been stronger than usual this year. 
 G.M. reported its first decline in sales of the new version of the Chevrolet Tahoe, which dropped 5.5 percent compared with 2005. G.M. has been banking on sales of its new S.U.V.'s and coming pickup trucks as the ballast for the turnaround plan it hopes will reverse its $10.6 billion 2005 loss.
 S.U.V. sales also plunged at Ford, where overall sales dropped 6 percent. The compact Escape came only 18 vehicles shy of passing the Explorer, long the darling of Ford's sport utility lineup, as its most popular S.U.V.
 Ford said its car sales climbed last month, thanks to vehicles such as the small Ford Focus and the midsize Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr sedans. 
 Like other retailers, G.M. and Ford Motor have begun offering gasoline discount cards as a come-on to customers of their big vehicles.
 But the tactic may not sway many buyers, said Laura Ries, president of Ries & Ries, an Atlanta marketing firm. ''People are looking at a bigger picture than a year's worth of gas,'' Ms. Ries said.
 Detroit companies, she went on, had had only themselves to blame for missing consumers' shift to more economical vehicles.
 ''Hey, they had plenty of time to see this coming,'' she said. ''Cheap fuel wasn't going to last forever, because nothing lasts forever.'' 
 Chrysler's sales dropped 14 percent in May compared with last year. It said it planned to emphasize its vehicles' fuel economy in ads that begin running this weekend. Commercials for Chrysler's minivans, for example, will note that they get 25 miles a gallon, rather than focusing more on promoting features like flexible seating configurations and rear-seat DVD players.
 Even though gasoline prices spiked after Hurricane Katrina last year, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales, Gary Dilts, said buying habits were only now changing.
 ''This shift occurred pretty rapidly,'' Mr. Dilts said. ''In March, this was not on the radar.'' 
 But, he acknowledged, ''the imports reacted a little quicker than we did'' in promoting fuel efficiency.
 G.M.'s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, said G.M. was not getting enough recognition for its vehicles' fuel economy. G.M., he said, makes more vehicles that get 30 miles a gallon than any other carmaker.
 ''By default, Honda and Toyota get credit in the minds of consumers on those attributes,'' he continued.
 As well they should, said Mr. Colliver at Honda. ''We've spent 36 years building our brand around fuel economy,'' he said.
 On Thursday, Ford introduced a deal that offers no-interest financing and $1,000 worth of free gas to buyers of nearly all models. That is different from the G.M. plan, which is available on selected vehicles in California and Florida.
 G.M. and Chrysler officials said they were evaluating Ford's program but would not say how they planned to respond. 
 ''We feel that just jumping into this incentive flurry on a month-to-month basis is not consistent with where we want to go long term,'' said Mr. Ballew of G.M., which introduced the employee discount plan last summer to clear out big inventories of unsold cars.
 Mr. Dilts indicated that Chrysler was considering some new discounts, however. ''It's going to be a competitive summer. It's going to be a great time for a consumer to buy a car,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Economy Slows, Mixed Data on Inflation

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The United States economy appears to be shifting into a lower gear, with residential construction falling sharply and manufacturing activity slowing. The big question is, Will the slowdown come in time to keep inflation from heating up? 
 Investors got mixed signals on inflation in new economic data yesterday, with a gauge of wage inflation posting an improved reading while a barometer of manufacturing prices posted a sharp increase.
Wall Street chose to focus on the benign inflation readings, but private analysts cautioned that lingering inflation pressures may prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates up one or two more times even as the economy slows to a more sustainable pace.
 On the slowdown front, the Commerce Department reported that residential home building dropped by 1.1 percent in April, the biggest decrease since January 2004.
 The drop was large enough to pull overall construction spending down by 0.1 percent after the building industry set a string of record highs in recent months, reflecting a boom period fueled by the lowest mortgage rates in more than four decades.
 Total construction spending for April fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.195 trillion. The drop in residential construction was offset somewhat by a 2.5 percent rise in nonresidential activity, reflecting solid gains in office, hotel and shopping center activity.
 In another sign of slowing, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index dipped to 54.4 in May, from 57.3 in April.
 Analysts said manufacturing momentum had ebbed significantly over the last four months, reflecting weaker orders. But an inflation gauge tied to the manufacturing index increased by the sharpest amount in eight months, reflecting rising costs for raw materials.
 ''The economy is strong but it is throttling back a notch,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.
 He said Fed officials would probably remain undecided about whether to interest raise rates again at their meeting June 28-29 until they see further data, including today's unemployment report, which is expected to show strong employment growth of about 170,000 workers in May.
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, to 336,000. 
 Giving support to the belief that inflation pressures will stay contained was a Labor Department report that revised its estimate of first-quarter productivity up to a solid 3.7 percent, better than an initial reading of 3.2 percent.
 And unit labor costs, the amount employers must pay for each unit of production, rose at a moderate 1.6 percent rate in the first quarter, down from a worrisome initial reading of 2.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Opportunity Knocks in Ireland, and the French Answer

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
This snug Irish capital might seem an unlikely destination for young French men and women. The weather would jar anyone from the Cote d'Azur. And the food is basically what the Michelin restaurant guide might consider a form of boiled stew. 
 Yet thousands of people -- many just out of university -- are deserting France to live and work here, in a European city that sparkles with economic vibrancy despite a more general sense of stagnation in much of the Continent.
Like many others moving across Europe, they are migrating for jobs, which are far more plentiful in Ireland than in France, where the economy is flabbier, work for young people is scarcer and taxes are higher.
 For Europeans, who used to cling to a homebound culture where many people often lived and died within shouting distance of their birthplace, that is a cultural revolution. 
 Like the United States, Europe is wrestling with immigration problems. But European countries have to deal not only with immigration from places like Africa and Southeast Asia, which they strictly limit, but also from their neighbors in the European Union, who are legally entitled, with some restrictions, to work and live anywhere within Europe's single market. 
 In Ireland, so many French migrants have arrived that the person who folds back comforters for hotel guests or serves Guinness with dinner seems as likely to come from Lyon these days as from Limerick. By last year, an estimated 20,000 French migrants were working in Ireland, according to French officials, and the number continues to rise.
 The only larger modern French ''colony'' is in Britain, where an estimated 86,000 have found work. In London restaurants these days, the waiters are very often French.
 For some countries, like Belgium, migration has become a part of the culture. An estimated 600,000 Belgians, or 8 percent of the population, live and work outside Belgium, and many of them will never return. 
 But despite language barriers, even countries like France, where migration was once very rare, are changing. In Germany and Italy, growing numbers of young people employed in the banking or financial services are going abroad, often to London or New York.
 The migration also lays bare class differences in a Europe that has opened in recent years to Central European countries like Poland and Hungary. While the educated French work in financial services and computers, more menial tasks, like bricklaying or plumbing, are often done by Poles, Lithuanians or Latvians. 
 Cases of workplace discrimination against migrant workers from Eastern Europe have caused the Irish government some concern, while little or none is aimed at Western Europeans like the French, the Germans or the Italians.
 When Moore McDowell, an economist at University College Dublin, was strolling recently near St. Stephen's Green, in central Dublin, he saw scaffolding on a construction site, with a sign, in English and Polish, that read, ''No more Poles needed on this building site.'' 
 But as for the French, ''if they have good English, and a good baccalaureate, there's a demand for them,'' he said. 
 ''We are close to fully employed, so the Irish economy is sucking in employees across Europe.''
 Ireland has been one of the great economic success stories of Europe, with real growth, adjusted for inflation, that has been averaging 5 percent to 6 percent annually for many years. Employees for the financial services and computer industries are in great demand. In the building trades, though, the boom is cooling and demand is weaker.
 Indeed, the different speeds at which European economies grow, or fail to, has created splits across Europe, yet they do not always explain migration. In Central Europe, for instance, growth rates are far greater than those of the much richer countries of the west, yet higher wages still lure Central Europeans to countries like Germany, France, Britain and Ireland. 
 So great is the Western migration from the East that Western businessmen doing business in Eastern European countries like Poland complain of an inability to find laborers like carpenters, masons or plumbers. 
 Across Europe, the process has created a hierarchy, with Western Europeans like the French or Germans at the top, Eastern Europeans in the middle, working mainly in construction, and Africans and Asians at the bottom of the labor heap, working in restaurant kitchens, or in garbage removal. 
 Speeding the procession from France are John Murat, 29, of Lyon, and Laurent Girard-Claudon, a 29-year-old Parisian who founded Approach People, an employment firm specializing in finding jobs for French people in Ireland. In 2002, their first year in business together, they placed 10 people; this year, they expect to place 350.
 From four or five employees at the start, the company has grown to 21. Every day, about 500 French men and women visit its Web site, approachpeople.com.
 ''It's a developing game,'' Mr. Girard-Claudon said. 
 Much of the company's growth, he said, is because of the presence in Ireland of big American corporations. American clients of Approach People include Dell, Symantec, I.B.M., Microsoft, Oracle and Apple. 
 Both Mr. Murat and Mr. Girard-Claudon became devotees of Ireland after deserting France in the mid-1990's in search of employment. To figure out why Ireland was producing jobs on an assembly line while France stagnated, they looked around at different businesses in Dublin. 
 By contrast, in France an employee must pay tax, pension, unemployment and social security charges of more than 40 percent; the similar charges in Ireland are no more than 16 percent, they discovered. 
 They also learned about the differences in vacation policy: the French usually receive six or seven weeks of vacation a year; the Irish get four to five weeks.
 Moreover, Irish employers have much more flexibility to hire and fire. 
 ''You can still have a success story in Ireland,'' Mr. Murat said.
 At the Approach People offices in Blackrock, a southern suburb of Dublin, Frederic Nerot, 29, a native of Orleans in the Loire Valley of France, said he had come not so much to flee French unemployment as to gain real work experience and improve his English. 
 ''I'm not running away from France, but looking for experience,'' he said. 
 Earlier he had spent six months traveling through Asia, before deciding to come to Ireland. He recently arrived in Dublin, dropping his bag at a youth hostel before seeking out the Approach People office.
 He was in Thailand last fall, he said, when an article in The Bangkok Post described the riots in France protesting the liberalization of employment laws. ''To have a viewpoint is easy, to have a solution is harder,'' he said. ''The French are great protestors.''
 Over a Guinness in a Dublin pub, Paul-Henry Walter agreed. Mr. Walter, 27, a Parisian who finished a degree in business at Lille and then held some odd jobs before coming to Ireland, said he was angered by the demonstrations. 
 ''We have to be flexible,'' he said, ''whether we're working in Marseille or Dublin.'' 
 The French are struck by the easy collegiality of the Irish, noting that work-related problems are often resolved not in the office but over a pint after work.
 ''In France on Friday afternoon, you say to your colleagues, 'Have a good weekend,' and 'I'll see you on Monday,' '' Mr. Girard-Claudon said. ''Here, it's 'Where are we going to drink one tonight?' ''
 They are also struck by the ease and speed with which business decisions are made in Ireland. ''It wentvery quickly,'' said Mr. Walter, who has been working in Ireland for six months, describing his hiring. ''I applied. I got a call, 'You start in two weeks.' '' 
 He said he was working full time with an open-ended contract. ''I'm basically in sales, computer solutions, selling to customers in France,'' he said. ''All the administrative work is in English.''
 Mr. Walter shares a house with a fellow Frenchman, a man from New Zealand and a Slovenian woman. 
 Would he ever go back to France? ''If I found something,'' he said, ''I would prefer to stay in Paris.'' 
 But he hasn't. And some people from French are starting to settle down here. Mr. Murat, who goes by the name John rather than his native Jean-Christophe, married an Irish woman, and his daughter, with her blue eyes and blond hair, is more Irish than French, he says. 
 So, is the migration a brain drain, or simply postgraduate training for young Europeans who will one day return to their native countries? Probably both, Mr. Girard-Claudon said.
 ''There are those who want one to two years to gain experience and improve their English to find a better job in France,'' he said. ''And then there are people here for four to five years, to develop a career here, maybe go back, maybe not.''
 Robert Hancke, a Belgian economist at the London School of Economics, said France was among the European economies that had benefited most from globalization, opening markets to French products and investment. Yet globalization, and the flexibility and migration of people that accompany it, remains a bugaboo. 
 ''They call it this big horrible thing around the corner,'' he said. 
 But while many native French are worried about the impact of open markets on their local traditions, Francois Peschaire, 25 and an employee of Approach People, is among those who just want to get ahead. 
 ''I can do without French cheese, French bread, other things,'' he said. ''I'm happy to find it, but it's not a difficulty to do without it.''

HEADLINE: Which Bosses Really Care If Shares Rise?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WHY do we want to know all the perks, pensions and privileges of corporate chieftains? That is a question the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considering as it figures out how much additional disclosure to require.
 The answer for many is a hope that somehow the full disclosure will shame corporate boards and bosses into cutting back on excessive pay.
But if that is the goal, history is not promising. The rise in executive pay began after more disclosure was required and bosses could see what others were getting. Their standard of comparison went from what others in the company were getting to what other bosses got. And every boss deemed himself above average. 
 ''The unintended consequence could be that it becomes a shopping list for C.E.O.'s,'' said Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, when asked about pay disclosure. ''Of the seven deadly sins, the one that seems to work more than greed is envy,'' he added. ''If others have it, they want it.''
 The fact that big bosses are fighting some disclosures may indicate they fear a different result. The Business Roundtable, made up of chief executives of the largest companies in the nation, urged the S.E.C. to forget about requiring companies to disclose accrued pension benefits of bosses or what they earn on deferred compensation. And it thinks investors would be confused if golden parachute benefits were detailed.
 The Roundtable may prevail in scaling back disclosures. Christopher Cox, the chairman of the commission, met with a Roundtable representative to discuss the issue last month. The only others he has reported similar meetings with were Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, since named to be Treasury secretary. (Mr. Bush was representing Florida's public pension system, which wants more disclosure. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs quoted Mr. Paulson as saying, ''I am in favor of full and complete disclosure of executive compensation.'')
 Even if more disclosures are not likely to reduce excesses in compensation, there is another reason for action: Shareholders deserve to know just how well aligned the boss's interests are with theirs. But the proposal the S.E.C. is considering may not go far enough for that.
 Investors should know how much the executive's wealth will rise if the stock goes up, and how much it will fall if the stock goes down. That can be hard to determine now, since some executives enter into strange derivative transactions in which they keep ownership of shares but give up much or all of the economic benefits and risks.
 The S.E.C. proposal would require that companies say if an executive's shares are pledged, but that is not enough. A pledge could be as security for a loan, or it could be something very different. And the executive could be in line for a big bonus if the stock price hits a certain level.
 Joseph A. Grundfest, a Stanford law professor and former member of the S.E.C., has suggested a new table that would show such data, both for shares, options and other positions already held and for those that may be obtained if targets are met.
 Such disclosures could show that executives had little to lose if the stock fell, since all they have are options. Or they could show that bosses have given up a big part of the possible upside through swaps and other derivatives -- and thus have far less at stake than might appear to be the case from simple ownership figures.
 The risk is that the S.E.C. will instead whittle down the proposed disclosures to leave more loopholes in what has to be disclosed. That is what a lot of bosses want. It would be a tragedy if they get it.

HEADLINE: A Commodities Bull Can Find No Reason To Pull In His Horns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
James B. Rogers Jr. calls himself the world's worst market timer. It is an air of modesty he cultivates with sometimes folksy anecdotes and an ever-present drawl.
 But market timing aside, as an avowed commodities bull, Mr. Rogers is undeterred even as less committed bulls suspect that the peak is past.
A fund manager, author, traveler and occasional television commentator, Mr. Rogers says he believes that the commodities market is less than a decade through a bull market that could last more than 20 years. 
 ''Someday there will be 10,000 mutual funds that trade commodities,'' he said. ''On Park Avenue, wives won't talk about flipping real estate. They'll be talking about soybeans and pork belly futures.''
 Of those critics who say commodities are only this year's dot-coms, he says, ''Two or three years ago, they couldn't even spell commodities.''
 By contrast, Mr. Rogers says he has been trading commodities since the early 1970's, even before the commodities boom of that decade. 
 He also has a string of unique experiences in the markets. Mr. Rogers co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros in 1969, and retired in 1980 at the age of 37. After a stint at the Columbia Graduate School of Business, Mr. Rogers embarked on two global adventures, one by motorcycle, detailed in ''Investment Biker,'' a book he published in 1995, and one in a custom ''Millennium Mercedes'' the size and color of Big Bird, the Sesame Street character. His adventures earned him the sobriquet ''the Indiana Jones of finance'' from Time magazine. 
 More important, he said, those adventures have given him some insight into the state of various markets around the world, from sweet-toothed Armani-clad youth in China to corruption-laden bureaucracies in Nigeria. 
 His faith in a commodities bull run seems ill-timed given the sharp declines metals have taken after recent spikes. The price of a gold futures contract for delivery in June, for instance, closed yesterday at $629.60 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, down from $728.60 last month. 
 ''We'll always have big consolidations,'' Mr. Rogers conceded.
 But as crude oil stays stubbornly above $70 a barrel, it is hard to dismiss him outright.
 Though he concedes that energy and metals have hit a rough patch, with zinc and copper due for a correction, Mr. Rogers insists that commodities as a whole will continue to go up. 
 Look instead at agricultural products, especially sugar and coffee, he said, which currently trade far below their historical highs. 
 Coffee, which traded for more than $3.37 cents at one point in 1977, was trading at about $1 a pound this week. Sugar, which traded as high as 66 cents a pound in 1974, was trading for about 15 cents a pound this week. 
 Of course, Mr. Rogers has a stake in promoting that idea. He is the author of ''Hot Commodities,'' a book about commodities investing he wrote in 2004.
 And he is the creator of the Diapason Rogers Commodities Index Fund, an investment fund that buys commodities and is based on the Rogers International Commodities Index of 35 futures contracts, which Mr. Rogers also developed. From Jan. 1 through May 31, his commodities index fund rose 9.4 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 1.7 percent over the same period.
 He points to academic studies that show bull markets lasting anywhere from 15 to 23 years; given those figures, the commodities bull run that started in 1999 should last until 2022. 
 And more important, he says, commodities producers have failed to develop new sources of production. 
 Demand for lead has exploded, but the last new smelter built in the United States was opened in 1969. Oil companies have not opened significant new oil fields in more than 25 years. The story is the same with copper.
 ''I was with a couple of copper mining C.E.O.'s recently, and they said they were having a hard time finding labor, saying, 'We can't find engineers, we can't even find miners,' '' Mr. Rogers said. ''And I asked them if they even know the level of their reserves. And no one knew.''
 Couple that with voracious appetites for commodities in China and India, and the prices should continue to climb, he said.
 ''The last time we had a bull market, three billion people in Asia were closed off,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''Now we have China, we have India looking for commodities. They've all seen Western TV.''
 Mr. Rogers has great faith in China as the bull to which the commodities market is yoked. He says he believes that China will fully float its currency, the yuan, in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and that China's growing capitalist class will displace the Communist Party. 
 Mr. Rogers is bearish on the United States. To him, America's time has passed, with its $8.36 trillion in debt, a weak dollar and its dependence on imported oil. He recommends selling United States dollars. 
 He recommends investing in countries with well-managed commodities production, like Canada, Brazil and Argentina, as well as China. 
 Mr. Rogers believes in China so much that he hired a nanny who speaks only Mandarin to his 3-year-old daughter. Signs taped around the Rogers household name objects in English and in Mandarin: a panda statue bears one with the characters for ''xiong mao.'' Hanging above the stainless steel stove is the word ''zhao.''
 His wife, Paige Parker, who was his traveling partner in the Mercedes during the ''Adventure Capitalist'' journey, is learning Mandarin this summer. Mr. Rogers said he might try to pick it up, but he has few illusions about his chances for success. ''I'm tone deaf,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Surge, Undeterred By Mixed Data on Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply yesterday as investors brushed aside mixed signals on inflation a day after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed concern over rising prices.
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 91.97 points, or 0.82 percent, to 11,260.28. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.62 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,285.71. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index surged 40.98 points, or 1.88 percent, to 2,219.86. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gained 15.49 points, or 2.15 percent, to 736.50.
The market's rise, the second in two days, followed a pronounced pullback during the month of May. 
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced decliners by a margin of 7 to 2. Volume was 1.69 billion shares, compared with 1.99 billion shares on Wednesday.
 While manufacturing activity slowed in May, high energy and materials costs fueled fears that the Fed would continue lifting interest rates to contain inflation. But a downward revision in first-quarter wage costs from the Labor Department suggested that prices were more subdued.
 Strong May sales lifted retail stocks, and oil prices fell on reports of increased domestic reserves.
 Crude oil futures declined after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled that it would not reduce current output levels, and Energy Department data showed another weekly increase in inventories. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for July delivery slid 95 cents, to settle at $70.34.
 Gold for delivery next month fell $15.20 an ounce yesterday, or 2.4 percent, to $630.50. 
 Stock markets overseas recouped some of the losses that had been impelled by worries that rising American interest rates might reduce global demand. In Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index gained 0.45 percent. Slightly lesser gains were made on benchmark indexes in France and Germany.
 Asian markets, which have had steep pullbacks in the last few days, were mixed. The Nikkei index of 225 issues edged up 0.24 percent in Tokyo from three-month lows. But stocks in Hong Kong tumbled 1.34 percent, and India's benchmark index plunged 3.15 percent. South Korean shares were also down.
 Investors returned their focus to inflation data after minutes from the Fed's May 10 meeting released on Wednesday showed that inflation expectations had increased. Many on Wall Street are anticipating today's report on monthly hiring, which is considered a primary indicator of economic conditions. But analysts said market volatility might well persist until the Fed makes its next move at the end of June.
 Retail stocks were in focus as consumers spent freely last month despite soaring gasoline prices. Federated Department Stores added 86 cents, to $73.69, on May sales that were sharply better than forecast; J. C. Penney also had strong sales, lifting its share price by $3.95, or 6.5 percent, to $64.79. But Wal-Mart Stores' modest results sent its shares down 6 cents, to $48.39.
 Japanese automakers reported outstanding May sales as domestic car companies had languishing demand. American-traded securities of Toyota Motor jumped $1.26, to $108.64, and Honda Motor added 41 cents, to $33.44. General Motors shares slid 3 cents, to $26.90.
 Technology stocks did well, with Apple Computer up $2.40, to $62.17. Juniper Networks rose $1.54, or 9.67 percent, to $17.47. Its stock is being added to the S.& P. 500 index.
 H. J. Heinz posted a 19 percent drop in quarterly profit and said it planned to eliminate 2,700 jobs and close 15 plants to cut costs. Its stock advanced 3 cents, to $42.38.
 In the bond market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32, to 100 6/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.12 percent.

HEADLINE: The Man That Got Away 

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
WHEN Guillermo Klein brings his band to the Village Vanguard for a week of shows starting June 13, it will be the return of a beloved musician who never got the chance to use the momentum he was building on New York's jazz scene in the late 1990's. Instead he slipped away to Argentina and then to Spain. In New York we usually don't draw the short straw like this. We have heard dispatches from Mr. Klein -- three fascinating records -- but have had to live with the fact that his evolution was taking place somewhere else.
 In early 1994 Mr. Klein, an Argentine pianist and composer, arrived in New York from Boston, where he had attended the Berklee College of Music. He was 24 and soon found himself at Smalls, the Greenwich Village basement club on West 10th Street that opened the same year. Most of the members of a 17-piece band he had been writing for in Boston came down when he got a gig at Smalls in December; in February 1995 he was given every Sunday night at the club and kept that schedule for four years, more or less. 
''He had such trust in the musicians,'' the singer Luciana Souza remembers of those nights. ''He would bring in a sketch, and sometimes the musicians would write their own parts, in the moment. Guillermo had an amazing pool of musicians, all soloists. Everyone was already a bandleader, and some of them already had record deals. But they were still in the spirit of this collective thing. It was like a troupe, a tribe.'' 
 His music resembled nothing else, especially as it moved toward grooves and away from the harmonic exercises he had learned in music school. It was jazz, of a kind, but it included brass choirs, counterpoint, drones, Argentine and Cuban rhythms and a lot of singing. Some of the musicians were given parts to sing, and Mr. Klein sang himself, in a scratchy, smoky, untrained but emotional voice. There could be echoes of Steve Reich and Astor Piazzolla on the surface; deeper inside, there might be clues to other heroes: Duke Ellington, Hermeto Pascoal, Milton Nascimento, Wayne Shorter, Stravinsky and the Argentine pop composer Luis Alberto Spinetta. None of this sounded overthought, because Mr. Klein trusted his sense of song. If it didn't sound natural, he didn't play it. 
 His circle of colleagues and admirers came to include the best of their generation: Ms. Souza, Joshua Redman, Reid Anderson, Ethan Iverson, Mark Turner, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Tony Malaby, Jenny Scheinman, Claudia Acuna. Many of them were in his bands over the years; another six players from those days -- Diego Urcola, Chris Cheek, Jeff Ballard, Ben Monder, Miguel Zenon and Bill McHenry -- will be in his 11-piece group, Los Guachos, this month at the Vanguard. (Los Guachos, or loosely, the Bastards, comes from a common epithet in Argentina that can be used disparagingly or admiringly.) 
 There was an almost magical luck involved in the evolution of Mr. Klein's work, beginning with Smalls itself, which was unusual for its direct connection to the aspirations of young musicians. Mr. Klein's interest in self-promotion was dim at best. (It still is.) During his six years in New York he didn't live on much; for the first two, his parents helped him. He and his musicians earned about $50 a night at Smalls, although the opportunity to perform frequently with a big band -- and to a growing audience -- was lavish recompense. 
 He lived at a number of addresses in Manhattan and Brooklyn, including a Hell's Kitchen squat where he really did have to squat: his bedroom ceiling was less than six feet high. He worked around a little bit: a spell as the pianist in Mr. Rosenwinkel's band at Smalls; some time in a trio at the East Village bistro Jules.
 For four months in 1997 he took a job in Chicago, playing in a Gipsy Kings cover band with an old friend from Argentina. In September 2000, missing home and not making much of a living, he and his American wife, the photographer and teacher Kim Bacon, moved to Buenos Aires.
 I caught up with Mr. Klein, now 36, during an afternoon last November at his small apartment in the Eixample neighborhood of Barcelona, not far from Las Ramblas, the city's central boulevard. He is self-effacing, wary, calm, sentimental, stubborn: a focused artist who just wants to get on with his work. He spoke quietly, so as not to wake his 1-year-old, Veronica.
 His father, also named Guillermo Klein, worked as a fruit vendor during Mr. Klein's childhood in Buenos Aires, then pushed his way to an economics degree; by the late 80's he was president of Argentina's telephone company, then run by the state. 
 He gave his son a piano when the boy turned 11. A year later the young Guillermo began composing, and he started an apprenticeship with a teacher at 15, learning Bach fugues and chorales. His first pieces, he said, were inspired by Mr. Piazzolla, the composer, national hero and prime force of the ''nuevo tango'' movement. 
 ''There are people that love Astor's 50's and 60's and 70's music,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I love his very late work, from the 80's. I always listen as a composer. I need to hear the piece, I want to be inside the work. With this late period, his message was complete. I can hear it from beginning to end without wondering about form.'' 
 We heard ''Contrabajisimo,'' a 10-minute piece from Mr. Piazzolla's record ''Tango: Zero Hour,'' which some consider his peak achievement. It was made with his New Tango Quintet, a band that was unusual for its jazz-trained musicians: the violinist Fernando Suarez Paz and the guitarist Horacio Malvicino. 
 Typically for Mr. Piazzolla, it has a rugged main theme, surging with conviction. Then it grows soft and sentimental. ''If you heard this section by a medium player,'' Mr. Klein pointed out, ''it would be corny. It's flowery.''
 The piece returned to the aggressive main section. ''Time goes by, and I cannot hear the chords,'' Mr. Klein said admiringly. ''He makes you hear what he hears. It's so simple, the way it develops. Very obsessive. For me it's like an image of stepping very strongly along the earth and grabbing things, to go forward, clinging to them. Every step is really hard, taking you to a place that you didn't know you were going to reach.'' 
 The piece skidded to a well-defined stop. ''Astor is like a friend that scolds you,'' Mr. Klein said. ''He knows who you are, that kind of thing. If you write a good song, the first thing you think is, what would Astor think about this? '' 
 When Mr. Klein was 18, his father invited his piano teacher home for dinner, to ask whether it was practical for his son to pursue music. ''The guy said, 'Yeah, definitely,' '' Mr. Klein remembered. '' 'But he needs more than me. He should leave the country.' ''
 Mr. Klein had graduated from high school and was playing guitar in a rock band, covering Stones and Beatles songs. His mother read something in the newspaper about the Berklee College of Music; subsequently, the jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton, then a dean at Berklee, visited Buenos Aires to speak to music students. Mr. Klein attended the lecture and was struck by Mr. Burton's comment that performing with Mr. Piazzolla was a high point in his musical life. Soon Mr. Klein was in Boston.
 He knew very little about jazz, having heard it only by accident in shopping malls. He loved Stravinsky, and his first idea was to study classical music. 
 ''I showed the head of the classical department some fugues I had written, and he couldn't care less,'' he remembered, laughing. ''Then I met some guys, like Diego Urcola'' -- a trumpeter around his age, also from Buenos Aires -- ''who were talking with so much passion about jazz.'' 
 A month later he started listening to the Wayne Shorter record ''Speak No Evil,'' and something opened up. As a composer, Mr. Shorter is considered a genius of harmony in jazz; it is harder to parse his music in the scientific terms that music school can impose. Not very good at sight-reading and most passionate about learning and composing by ear, Mr. Klein likes to find his way to voicings and harmonic motion that sound as organic and freshly discovered as possible; he sensed the same in Mr. Shorter. 
 Later, on holiday, he saw Milton Nascimento in Argentina, which moved him to tears. He made his way to the mid-70's collaboration between Mr. Shorter and Mr. Nascimento, ''Native Dancer,'' and he connected the dots between the two musicians.
 We listened to ''Miracle of the Fishes'' from ''Native Dancer.'' It is a scary piece of music: first a brisk, three-beat figure on guitar, with descending harmonic movement, under Mr. Nascimento's tremulous voice, with a melody that sounds as if it starts from the middle. After 15 seconds, everything begins to explode. An electric piano insinuates itself, and about two minutes in, Mr. Shorter appears, playing a great, gargly tenor-saxophone solo, slicing eccentrically phrased passageways through the chopping rhythm. 
 ''I got very into this record,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Maybe it was the fact of Milton and some grooves, also, which I felt close to, like kind of family.'' He made a few more passes at explaining his attraction to it, then gave up. ''I don't know. The harmonies didn't feel like chords -- they were like an orchestra.'' 
 ''It felt good to be in there,'' he said, motioning toward the speakers. ''It's very different to the tritone thing, I think.'' 
 He was referring to the common substitute chords that are the basics of harmonic progression in jazz. Mr. Klein doesn't want to hear either hackneyed or overly fussy harmony. 
 Does his problem with a kind of official language of jazz harmony go back to bebop, I asked? 
 ''No, no,'' he protested, ''bebop is incredible. Charlie Parker is very clear to me. Bud Powell, too. They shape the harmony through the horn or through the piano, and you can hear exactly what harmony it needs. Bebop is one of the most important things in the 20th century, and Stravinsky, you know.'' 
 He paused. ''Secretly it has to do with the heart,'' he said. ''How you feel in your heart. I bet Milton and everybody in that record was really moved, and they knew they were doing something really clear and honest.''
 He and Reid Anderson, the American jazz bassist who has been living in Barcelona for the last year and a half, had recently talked about style, he said, and decided that it was all a construct. ''You don't look for style,'' he said. ''If something's going to be authentic, it will come out. I say, man, do your thing. What you're doing when you get with your friends: that thing becomes a style of its own.'' 
 ''Like, we are filled with mediocrity, and some spots of inevitability,'' he continued. ''When you hear Bach, you get the sensation that the whole thing was inevitable. It's an attempt to live every note. You feel part of something inevitable.''
 What might have been inevitable in 2000, when Mr. Klein and Ms. Bacon relocated to Buenos Aires with $500 to tide them over, was the country's impending economic collapse. (His father, predicting the crisis, had warned him against moving back home.) He started to teach music, and got a gig at a new club called Thelonious, where his band ended up playing every Wednesday night, eventually filling the club each week. 
 By the middle of 2001, the school where Mr. Klein taught wasn't issuing paychecks. By December, there was a freeze on bank withdrawals. On Dec. 19 the band played a gig to about 40 people at Thelonious, and when they finished, Mr. Klein was told by the owner that not one person had paid. The day after, there were riots in Buenos Aires.
 ''Nobody had any money,'' he said. ''There was trading. People didn't have money to pay for lessons, so they would pay with food or a bicycle. You went walking everywhere. The thing is, there were people really listening at the club where we played, because it was such a crazy time that people needed to go out.''
 What came to Mr. Klein's rescue was a record deal with his American label, Sunnyside. In the middle of the madness, he made a record, ''Una Nave,'' which was finally released last year. It turned out to be a gem, one of the year's best. In 2002 he moved to Barcelona, where he is finally making ends meet with regular local gigs and a teaching position in San Sebastian. Last winter he was finally given the honor of an invitation to play at the Vanguard, where he has never brought his band before. 
 When ''Una Nave'' was finally released in the United States, it was accompanied by an unusual news release. 
 ''Guillermo Klein prefers that his music be judged without emphasis on biographical or historical context,'' it read. ''Therefore, he has requested that a project biography not be written for the release of 'Una Nave.' However, Guillermo did wish to relate that the music, recorded while living in Argentina, was passionately made and well rehearsed.''

The Man From Argentina

Guillermo Klein and Los Guachos will play from June 13 to June 18 at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037.

Recordings that Mr. Klein chose to listen to for this article:

ASTOR PIAZZOLLA ''Contrabajisimo,'' from ''Tango: Zero Hour'' (Nonesuch, $18.98).

WAYNE SHORTER ''Miracle of the Fishes,'' from ''Native Dancer'' (Sony, $9.98).

Recordings by Mr. Klein recommended by Ben Ratliff:

'Los Guachos II' (Sunnyside; $16.98). From 1999, before Mr. Klein left New York; this is the American band at its best, including the singers Luciana Souza and Claudia Acuna; it includes two of Mr. Klein's near-masterpieces, ''Diario de Alina Reyes'' and ''Se Me Va La Voz.''

'Una Nave' (Sunnyside, $16.98). Recorded in Buenos Aires in 2002, with a well-practiced Argentine band; it ranges from moments of near-rock to Indian and Cuban rhythms and the Argentine milonga, powerful contrapuntal writing for brass, and a few of Mr. Klein's own original vocal performances.

HEADLINE: Melancholy Odes to American Vitality

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In light of how large and dominant American art became after World War II, it is always a bit surprising to think about how small and provincial the American art world was before the war. The most interesting and ambitious American artists -- Edward Hopper, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis, for example -- struggled to bridge the yawning chasm between European Modernism and homespun regionalism. Charles Sheeler was another of those interesting prewar American Modernists, and he is now the subject of a small but suggestive exhibition at the National Gallery of Art here. 
 ''Charles Sheeler: Across Media,'' organized by the museum's assistant curator of American and British paintings, Charles Brock, is narrowly designed to highlight Mr. Sheeler's versatility. With just 50 works, it does not try to survey his career or sample his greatest hits. Nor does it focus on Precisionism, the sharp-edged representational style most closely identified with him. It highlights, rather, four phases from his career in which photography, painting and drawing enjoyed particularly intimate and fertile relations. 
For many viewers, the show's most surprising work will be the 10-minute silent film ''Manhatta,'' which Mr. Sheeler made with the photographer Paul Strand in 1920. Shown in the gallery on a wide television screen, ''Manhatta'' is a grainy, scratchy, black-and-white ode to the architecture and industry of New York City. (It was also seen in 2003 at the Met in an exhibition devoted to Mr. Sheeler's photographs.)
 Views from high buildings and across waters plied by tugboats and freighters are interspersed with lines of text from poems by Walt Whitman that extol the spiritual energies of New York. Mr. Sheeler, whose sensibility was far less effusive than Whitman's, objected to those textual insertions, which were probably imposed by the Rialto Theater in New York, where the film was first publicly shown in 1921. But however coolly expressed, Mr. Sheeler's tribute to the city's awesome energy was certainly in the spirit of Whitman. Accompanying the film are a drawing and a painting derived from one of its frames, depicting a building under construction with steel beams and tall cranes heroically silhouetted against the sky. 
 Also from Mr. Sheeler's early years are examples from a celebrated 1917 series of photographs that he shot inside an old house in Doylestown, Pa., that he rented in the teens and 20's. Formally exacting pictures of a backlighted wood stove in an empty white room, and of a rustic wooden door open to reveal a narrow flight of stairs, make it clear that Mr. Sheeler considered himself as much a photographer as a painter when he was starting out. So does the 1927 series of photographs made on assignment for the Ford Company, documenting a huge new car-making factory in River Rouge, Mich.
 But Mr. Sheeler's handmade versions of images from both series also prove that there was something he could achieve in painting and drawing that he could not in photography. These works enlarge and subtly flatten and simplify the photographic images, enhancing their abstract qualities but also making them more luminous, mysterious and even visionary.
 The last part of the exhibition presents paintings, drawings and small studies that are based on double- and triple-exposed photographs of old mills in New England, all from the 1940's and 50's. Mr. Sheeler produced the photographs in the darkroom by layering two or three negatives sandwiched together. Printed without much fuss, these photographs served mainly as studies for his drawings and paintings that elegantly blend Cubist fragmentation, Surrealistic montage and American Scene painting. 
 What emerges from all this is something more than the image of a technically inventive and versatile artist. Mr. Sheeler was a cool pragmatist, but he was also deeply romantic. Throughout his career he tried to match form and technique with subject matter, and he realized his love for the aesthetic and functional economy of American industry in works made with no-nonsense spareness. Yet his paintings are not without feeling, contrary to the criticism in his day that found him cold. His works often exude melancholic, nostalgic moods. Some could be cousins of Hopper's lonesome paintings.
 What, if any, personal sources fed those feelings is hard to say; Mr. Sheeler doesn't tip his hand. One of his most famous pictures, included in the exhibition, is the black-and-white drawing of a telephone on a windowsill with Mr. Sheeler himself reflected from the neck down in the dark window pane: it's a picture of a lonely guy waiting for someone to call, a man too reticent to reach out. 
 Biographical speculations aside, what is remarkable about Mr. Sheeler's art is that images representing the epitome of American vitality should turn out so mournful and even, in some cases, funereal. See, for example, ''Classic Landscape'' (1931), a depiction of gravel piles, railroad tracks and severely geometric industrial buildings under a leaden sky, based on one of the River Rouge photographs. Mr. Sheeler was looking for beauty, but what he found was a De Chirico-like spiritual desolation. It is as if he is saying that beneath the frantic busyness of American capitalism there is a terrible grief over the loss of a more humane way of life.
 In the two decades after Mr. Sheeler made his abandoned mill paintings, the United States enjoyed the greatest economic boom in history, Abstract Expressionism triumphed, and the art of Mr. Sheeler went into long-term partial eclipse. Now, almost 60 years later, after the triumph of Pop Art, the rise of photography and the decline of an unquestioning faith in America, domestically and globally, he looks like a prophet. 
 Think of the paintings of Los Angeles industrial buildings by Ed Ruscha, which represented the United States in last summer's Venice Biennial and were seen more recently at the Whitney Museum. Made with cool wit and mechanical precision, yet exuding feelings of abandonment and sadness, they could be postmodernist homages to Mr. Sheeler's elegiac Modernism.

''Charles Sheeler: Across Media'' remains through Aug. 27 at the National Gallery of Art, National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington; (202) 737-4215.

Children Pitting Friendship Against the Pull of Fate
 Many citizens of Cuba have become runaways, fleeing for more promising shores. But Malu and Jorgito are unlike most of the others who leave home. They are interested in neither political freedom nor economic opportunity. Their goal is more elusive: to stop time. 
 Malu and Jorgito are the appealing young protagonists of ''Viva Cuba!,'' the latest feature in the New York International Children's Film Festival, which this year has expanded its offerings from an annual event to monthly screenings. This bittersweet movie, directed by Juan Carlos Cremata Malberti, explores the friendship between a girl and a boy who differ in class (yes, class appears to be an issue even in Communist Cuba) and family circumstance, but who have forged a deep bond. 
About 10 or 11, Malu (Malu Tarrau Broche) and Jorgito (Jorgito Milo Avila) share an affection that is vaguely romantic but without the erotic charge of adolescence. Their relationship, teasingly undefined, acquires sudden urgency when Malu's beloved grandmother dies, and her divorced mother decides to marry a foreigner and leave Havana. Jorgito proposes that he and Malu find Malu's father in Punta Maisi, a distant city, and persuade him not to sign the exit authorization that will allow her mother to take her away.
 The film, last year's winner of the Cannes Junior Festival and Cuba's entry in the Academy Awards, chronicles the pair's desperate odyssey of stowing away, hitchhiking, filching food and spinning lies. Although their journey has moments of wry poetry and silly humor, even children -- this PG-rated film is recommended for ages 7 to 14 -- will recognize its quixotic nature.
 Malu and Jorgito's experience is all the more poignant because it is ultimately so familiar: something always conspires against the fierce attachments of childhood, whether it's parental relationships, moving away or just growing up.
 ''Viva Cuba!,'' in Spanish with English subtitles, will be shown with ''The Boy, the Slum, and the Pan's Lid,'' a Brazilian short, tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m. at the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 349-0330 or www.gkids.com. Tickets: $10.75; children, $7.

A Pasture Called Brooklyn
 It's been a long time since cows dotted the Brooklyn landscape. But one corner of the borough is still famous for a bovine resident, and I'm not referring to the Brooklyn Museum gallery where the artist Damien Hirst famously displayed parts of cattle in 1999.
 This is the Prospect Park Zoo, home to Aggie, a Dexter cow who is happily all in one piece and the star of Extraordinary Dairy Weekend, tomorrow and Sunday. Visiting city children can get a feel for rural life by learning how to milk. They won't experiment on Aggie but on Daisy milkers, wooden cows that are filled with water and quite cooperative. 
 Real cream, though, will be used to churn butter according to a method any New York kitchen could accommodate. ''You put heavy cream into a Tupperware container and shake it for three verses of 'Old MacDonald,' '' said Corey Finjer, a zoo spokeswoman. (Crackers will be provided for tasting.) 
 Further attractions include a cow wash (Aggie's bath is at 3 p.m., weather permitting), other animal encounters, crafts, wildlife-theme shows and barnyard races, including one approximating a not-so-glamorous rite of farming.
 ''The favorite year after year is Scoop the Poop,'' Ms. Finjer said. ''There's a lot of hay, with fake cow patties in it, and the kids all get rakes and shovels.'' Prizes go to those who fill buckets the fastest. And no one complains that the experience just isn't real enough. 
 Extraordinary Dairy Weekend, tomorrow and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., at the Prospect Park Zoo, 450 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 399-7339. Admission: $6; ages 65+, $2.25; 3 to 12, $2; under 3, free. 

The Grand Central Code
 On any given day, Grand Central Terminal contains thousands of people, hundreds of trains, endless feet of railroad tracks and seven secrets.
 Or at least what tour operators call secrets, though you may have heard of a few. On Sunday, Ed Stanley, author of ''Grand Central Terminal: Gateway to New York City'' (Mondo Publishing), will reveal some of them, and at least one other: Ed Stanley is really Susan Eddy.
 Ms. Eddy (Ed Stanley is her nom de plume) will lead a family tour of the terminal, sponsored by the New York Transit Museum. ''I'm going to give all the children clipboards and a list of things to look out for,'' she said. She will highlight areas mentioned in her book, including the Whispering Gallery, a space at the bottom of the ramp leading to the Oyster Bar.
 ''If two people stand in opposite corners, and one whispers into the corner, the other person will hear perfectly, even though they're about 20 feet apart,'' Ms. Eddy said.
 She will also explain the secret of the terminal's celestial ceiling: all the constellations face the wrong way, except Orion. ''The painter did it from the point of view of looking down from heaven, which was common in medieval times,'' Ms. Eddy said. ''He copied an old manuscript.'' 
 And if you miss the museum's event, you can still explore the mysteries of the train station with the Grand Central Partnership, which offers a 90-minute tour each Friday. Somehow it doesn't seem that those secrets will stay hidden for long.
 Tour of Grand Central, Sunday at 1:30 p.m. Reservations and meeting place: (718) 694-1867. $5; children, $3; strollers not permitted. Grand Central Partnership tours, Fridays at 12:30 p.m., meeting in the Sculpture Court of the Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street. Free. (212) 883-2420.

HEADLINE: Time for Faster Airport Access Has Arrived, City Aide Declares

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The time has come, the deputy mayor for economic development said yesterday, to do more than talk and joke about how annoying the trip to Kennedy International Airport can be. 
 The deputy mayor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, told a group of transportation planners and executives that the snarled access to the region's airports, especially Kennedy, posed ''one of the biggest threats'' to the continued growth and development of the local economy.
He announced that he would be co-chairman of a new task force of government officials and business leaders that would seek solutions to the ''ever-looming possibility of mind-numbing bottlenecks'' around the airports. Kenneth J. Ringler, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will be the other co-chairman, a Port Authority spokesman said. 
 Mr. Doctoroff also said the city would continue pushing for the construction of a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy, and he endorsed the Port Authority's search for a ''fourth airport'' to serve New York City. The Port Authority is studying whether Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., could help relieve the increasing congestion at its three major airports -- Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International.
 ''My personal view is that it ought to go on the West Side rail yards,'' Mr. Doctoroff joked, referring to the site he had unsuccessfully tried to turn into a football stadium. Referring to the neighborhood residents who opposed that plan, he added, ''They thought the Jets were bad, just wait for the real jets.''
 Turning serious, he said the city, state and Port Authority must connect the AirTrain to Lower Manhattan because the present two-hour trip between there and Kennedy is ''unacceptable to business.'' That project, which would require several billion dollars and several years, would not solve all the problems concerning Kennedy, he said.
 ''It will take only a small percentage of the people who arrive at J.F.K. off the roads,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 Other speakers at the symposium at the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University agreed that a more reliable network for flying in and out of the region was needed.
 Christopher Wearing, managing partner of the New York office of Accenture, the big management-consulting firm, said his company's employees had taken to leaving a day early on many trips to ensure that they will not miss meetings. He said Accenture employees spent about ''3,000 man-weeks of time'' each year in airports, clearing security and waiting to board planes.
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at N.Y.U., applauded Mr. Doctoroff for taking on the problem of highway access to the airports. 
 The current mess could have been prevented, Mr. Moss said, ''if we had double-decked the Van Wyck 30 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Harlem, a Test Lab, Splits Over Charter Schools

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The schools sit side by side in a handsome red brick building in Harlem overlooking Morningside Park. But they could not be more different. 
 The fifth and sixth graders at KIPP Star College Prep Charter School earned some of the highest scores in central Harlem on last year's citywide reading exams. At Public School 125, only 36 percent of the third- through sixth-grade students met city and state reading standards last year.
The contrast in the building on West 123rd Street is emblematic of the inequities, opportunity and experimentation that define education across Harlem after decades of stagnation, and as gentrification is increasing pressures for better schools. 
 By the end of next year, Harlem will be home to 17 charter schools, publicly financed but privately run -- more than in Staten Island, Queens and Lower Manhattan combined. The Bronx has a high concentration, too, but only Brooklyn is expected to have more charter schools by the end of next year. 
 Harlem also has dozens of struggling traditional schools and six of the Bloomberg administration's new small themed schools.
 The variety is prompting sharp debate. Some parents in Harlem are delighted with the new choices and are showing up by the hundreds at lotteries for the limited charter school seats. Others charge that the charter schools are unproven and are milking the traditional public schools of the most promising students. 
 ''The public system failed my first grandson,'' said Margarita Maya, a Harlem resident, explaining that he did not earn a diploma. 
 Now, Ms. Maya said, her younger grandchildren attend the Harlem Village Academy charter school. ''I wanted something different for the rest,'' she said, ''and I found everything I could ever want in this new school.''
 But Carmen M. Colon, the president of an association of school district parent councils, says the changes are contributing to resentments between those who are able to grasp the limited new opportunities and those who are not among the chosen. 
 ''You see a lot of interesting and sometimes shocking things in Harlem, mainly the disappearance of the middle ground in terms of schools,'' she said. ''It's a gap that many people think is growing.''
 Chancellor Joel I. Klein has encouraged the educational ferment. ''We're moving on all fronts,'' he said in an interview. ''When I took over the job, what was the lowest performing district? District 5, Harlem. What you do is try to create opportunity.''
 Mr. Klein said: ''I want parents to say, 'Look, we could lose people to charter schools if our school doesn't improve. Competition in this thing works.''
 Eight percent of the 35,000 students in Harlem, which spans three school districts across Upper Manhattan, attend charter schools. In contrast, only 1 percent of the 1.1 million students citywide attend charter schools. 
 City education officials do not track where the students in charter schools come from, but say they most likely live in the schools' immediate area. 
 They also know that the population in Harlem's traditional schools has declined, saying the numbers have dropped by about 1,500 in central Harlem and East Harlem since 2002. 
 Parts of Harlem stretch into District 3 on the West Side and District 4 in East Harlem. But the heart of the neighborhood is covered by District 5. The schools there range the gamut. 
 There is Intermediate School 172, which earned a reputation for violence. There are the KIPP schools, part of a growing national chain (it stands for Knowledge Is Power Program). They enjoy Mr. Klein's blessing along with the Village Academies, a local network of charter schools. 
 The sprawling social service center, the Harlem Children's Zone, is there, too. Its chief executive is Geoffrey Canada, who has opened two charter schools since last year.
 Then there is I.S. 275, which is being closed next month because of persistent poor performance, but also P.S. 154, which turned itself around and is in good standing. 
 Dennis M. Walcott, the deputy mayor for education, said that Harlem would get a new middle school in the fall and that the six new small schools serve almost 1,000 students. 
 To parents, who have seen the redevelopment of the past decade bring safer streets, new stores and higher-income residents, the level of desire for the new reflects the area's swelling ambition, the aspiration to move away from schools that do not work even if it is into the unknown. 
 QuYahni Lewis said that she gave up on elementary schools in Harlem when her 9-year-old daughter came home with bite marks and a pencil stab wound. Next year that daughter will be going to KIPP Star, and two of her other children will be at Harlem Link Charter School, where she works as a secretary. ''Thank God we ended up getting that,'' she said of the charter schools.
 Ms. Lewis added: ''Every day there was another story about this bully or that bully. I found that there were really no good options here outside of paying for school. Where else are we going to go? What else are we going to do?''
 Others are suspicious of the charter schools and ask whether they are drawing the most promising students and only making the older, struggling schools worse -- not improving them through competition.
 Cordell Cleare, an official of the community education council for District 3, said of the new charter schools, ''If they're so rich and golden, why aren't they everywhere?''
 Robert A. Reed, the president of a central Harlem council of parent associations, said, ''They've picked this population as a guinea pig district.'' 
 But he also acknowledged that he entered his young daughter in a charter school lottery and she won a seat for next year that she may take. 
 When Mr. Klein became chancellor in 2002, schools in District 5 still lagged in test scores, as they had for decades, and he said he made improving them a priority. Now, scores there have begun to rise. 
 In Grades 3 through 8 in 1999, 19.3 percent of students in District 5 met city and state reading standards. In 2005, 36 percent did. School safety and leadership stability continue to be nettlesome issues, parents say.
 ''We're seeing progress after decades of nonperformance,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We have a lot of work to do, but the thing to do is to continue creating options while we improve existing schools.''
 Options, however, remain limited, and the harsh feelings about the new schools are particularly strong among longtime residents who see themselves as having already been on the losing end of the recent real estate boom. 
 Race may also be a factor; some parents refer to charter school operators as ''outsiders'' who do not understand the local culture. While the schools' populations are mostly minority, a number of the operators are white. 
 Parents like Mr. Reed also complain that charter school quality varies too wildly, or that their academic results are simply unknown. On many report cards issued by the state, the space for test scores from some charter schools is blank -- either because results have yet to materialize, or the school did not include fourth- and eighth-grade classes, which until this year were the only grades subject to state testing. 
 ''Any new school by definition is new,'' Mr. Klein said, speaking about the lack of data. ''When you see a thousand people on a waiting list, you see that, and what does that mean? That's what parents want.''
 Not so, said former Councilman Bill Perkins, a longtime Harlem representative now running for the State Senate. ''They're not going toward charter because it's proven as good, they're going away from what is proven as bad,'' he said. While some parents said they had thought the gentrification of much of Harlem throughout the 1990's would be accompanied by the improvement of the older public schools, they did not see it happen. Instead the charters started opening. 
 ''Despite this infusion of economic development, the children were failing, and that is exactly the answer to why, in 2001, when we set out to create a model public school, we picked Harlem,'' said Deborah Kenny, the founder and chief officer of Village Academies, a network of charter schools based in Harlem. ''The children were really, really deeply in need.'' 
 For her new school, Harlem Success Academy, former City Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz chose Harlem, too. ''District 5 in central Harlem has had a very long history of significant underperformance,'' she said. ''Something has to break the lock of whatever's going on, and I'm certainly hoping it's charter schools.''
 Ms. Moskowitz ran head-on into the neighborhood skepticism of new charter schools, when parents and the teachers' union successfully fought her plan to put Harlem Success into P.S. 154. Parents complained that Harlem Success would put a strain on space and resources and the city found her a space in a different school, P.S. 162, where she is also encountering opposition.
 ''The chancellor comes in and says they're doing us a service with charter schools,'' said Dawn DeCosta, the teachers' union chapter leader at P.S. 154. ''But if your service is crushing somebody else's program, that's not a service.''
 Parents like Heriberto Ramos, the parent-teacher association president at P.S. 129, remain suspicious that the improvements are not for them, but for the new class of residents whose middle-class backgrounds give their children a head start.
 ''Schools are a service for the public,'' he said. ''And I feel all this is not for all of us.''
 On 123rd Street, at least, there is a spirit of cooperation between P.S. 125 and KIPP Star. Sometimes they share a gym or the pool. Often, they share advice.
 ''Their teachers have asked us for help and I have asked their principal for help,'' said Maggie Runyan-Shefa, the principal at KIPP Star. ''We have stuff to learn from each other.''

HEADLINE: Iranians Dismiss U.S. Terms For Beginning Direct Talks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 1 

 BODY:
Iranian officials on Thursday uniformly dismissed Washington's offer to engage in direct talks on the condition that they first suspend all uranium enrichment, yet they could not hide their satisfaction that the offer had been made at all.
 In interviews, the officials and Iranian analysts said the American proposal indicated that Iran's uncompromising approach in its handling of the nuclear crisis had successfully forced the United States to take it more seriously, even if no progress had been made on solving the conflict. Earning that measure of respect, many said, is its own reward.
''The fact that Ms. Rice has announced the United States willingness to hold talks with Iran is more important than the conditions she set,'' said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst from Tehran who has close relations with people in the government.
 Iran did not respond immediately to the word from Vienna that the United States had succeeded in rallying Russia, China and the European powers behind a comprehensive offer of political and economic incentives in return for its giving up its nuclear activities. But the core of Iran's stance, which it credits for what it considers its recent diplomatic successes, is its refusal to stop enriching uranium, which it says is its right under international treaties. 
 ''We won't negotiate about the Iranian nation's natural nuclear rights, but we are prepared, within a defined, just framework and without any discrimination, to hold dialogue about common concerns,'' Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Thursday in comments broadcast on Iran radio.
 In many ways, reactions to Washington's proposal to break 27 years of silence toward Iran mirrors the American reaction to the letter that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent to President Bush. 
 While the letter, which among other things declared liberal democracy a failure, was summarily dismissed, even mocked, its very existence was perceived by many in Washington and Tehran as an effort to reach out and begin a dialogue.
 In an interview, Javad Vaeidi, the Iranian Supreme Security Council's deputy head for international affairs, agreed that the United States overture was, in itself, a positive step similar to Mr. Ahmadinejad's letter. 
 But he flatly rejected not only the content but also the tone of the proposal. As Mr. Vaeidi defined the conflict, it is as much about earning respect for Iran as about developing nuclear power. It would be humiliating to give up enrichment, he said.
 ''The wording unfortunately shows that still the Bush administration does not want to convince us that they are ready to consider our rights and interests,'' Mr. Vaeidi said during a two-hour interview in the Supreme Security Council offices in central Tehran. ''The content, I think, is based on domestic affairs of the United States.''
 For two years under the previous president, Mohammad Khatami, Iran suspended its nuclear enrichment activities as part of a strategy based on so-called confidence building. But the Iranian leadership eventually concluded that it would never achieve its goal by acceding to the West's demands, Mr. Vaeidi said.
 With Mr. Ahmadinejad's election as president in June, Tehran did not change its goal, Mr. Vaeidi said. 
 But it did change its tactics, adopting an aggressive and uncompromising approach. And while there is a degree of anxiety over the prospect of punitive action by the United Nations Security Council, Iranian officials and analysts here say the new strategy has succeeded by allowing Iran to set the agenda.
 ''We are not after adventure,'' Mr. Vaeidi said. ''We do not want trouble; we do not want confrontation. We just want our rights.''
 Until now, Washington and Tehran have chiefly used surrogates in a battle of wits and recrimination that dates to the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the ensuing hostage crisis in the United States Embassy here. Even on the nuclear issue there has been no direct back and forth between Tehran and Washington. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's letter and Washington's offer seem to have moved the ball. But it is not at all clear what comes next, as each side holds tightly to its basic demands regarding enrichment.
 ''The Bush administration thinks the Iranian people are willing to lose their rights just to create a dialogue with the West,'' Mr. Vaeidi said.
 European diplomats in Iran said that for some time their capitals had been pressing Washington to directly engage Tehran, saying any package of incentives to induce Iran to give up its nuclear program would be meaningless without a security guarantee from the United States.
 But Iranian officials have also set seemingly impossible conditions for face-to-face talks, like an absolute American guarantee of their government's security, even while saying they would welcome such talks. 
 At the same time, conservative Iranian officials are not all that eager to improve relations with the United States, because they fear that doing so might prop up the opposition parties that talk about democracy, said a political scientist who insisted on anonymity because of his close ties to the government.
 Iran's insistence on defining the conflict in broad, historical terms also complicates any effort to find a diplomatic solution. Mr. Vaeidi said that ever since the revolution the United States had pursued a policy toward Iran of ''denial and containment'' -- denying the legitimacy of the government and containing Iran's influence in the region. He said he saw Washington's effort to suppress Iran's nuclear program as an extension of that policy.
 ''In my opinion,'' Mr. Vaeidi said, ''the main issue is not Iran's nuclear activities. The main issue is actually the Iranian people's position in the future of the region and in international affairs.''
 The threshold for substantive talks with the Americans, he said, ''is when they accept our rights, our interests, our security.''
 Mr. Vaeidi took the early lead in negotiating with the Russians and has headed Iran's delegation to meetings of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. To listen to Mr. Vaeidi is to hear a historical overview of Iran's victimization at the hands of foreign powers, including France, Russia, Britain and the United States. It is to hear a worldview set by outside meddling in Iranian affairs and international opposition to what is now hailed as a breakthrough moment for the nation: the nationalization of its oil reserves.
 If there is one element of American foreign policy that seems to baffle Mr. Vaeidi, it is the United States support for Israel. While he did not repeat President Ahmadinejad's call for wiping Israel off the map, he did say he viewed Israel as an illegitimate state. And he said he believed that the United States would one day realize that it was not in its best interests to continue to support Israel.
 But if there was one recurring theme that ran throughout the interview with Mr. Vaeidi, it was respect. Iran, he said, expects to be treated as any other nation that has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and not to be singled out as different and less trustworthy.
 ''We are not an exception,'' he said. ''Why do we have to accept this point?''

HEADLINE: War Protest Intensifies, But Navy Ship Sails on Time

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, June 1 

 BODY:
After nearly a week of protests intended to delay a large Navy cargo ship from sailing to the war in Iraq, the vessel sailed out of Olympia on time Wednesday, port officials said. But the protests, which were raucous at times, could portend a summer of escalating tensions in the port. 
 The police said 20 protesters, most from Evergreen State College here, were arrested earlier in the week on misdemeanor charges of attempted trespass and were then released. Two others were charged with a separate offense stemming from a clash with the police.
About 70 police officers in riot gear were deployed at the port, where the Pomeroy, a 950-foot cargo ship, was being loaded with material from nearby Army units bound for Iraq. 
 In the past week, the ship was greeted by 150 to 200 protesters who shouted at crew members and soldiers, and staged a so-called die-in to protest the war. 
 At one point, the police used pepper spray to move back a group that had breached a gate, sheriff's deputies said. The deputies also said a stone and two plastic bottles were thrown at officers. 
 The protests, based at the college, have been going on for about two years, organizers said. But this week signaled a change in tactics. 
 Dan Kimball, chief criminal deputy for the Thurston County Sheriff's Department, said Thursday, ''The people who've been protesting have been mostly peaceful and quiet, but it definitely changed this week into some more aggressive civil disobedience.'' 
 A protest leader, Larry Mosqueda, said the demonstrations were intended to call attention to the ''illegal and immoral'' war in Iraq and the role of the port, which is publicly owned. 
 ''If you raise the stakes, the costs of the war go higher,'' said Mr. Mosqueda, a professor of political economy at Evergreen State. 
 Port officials said they had ''overwhelming support'' from the public in allowing the Navy to use the harbor. The protests had no effect on port operations, they said.

HEADLINE: $92 Million More Is Sought For Exxon Valdez Cleanup

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1 

 BODY:
When the Justice Department and the State of Alaska reached their $900 million court settlement with the Exxon Corporation over the environmental damages caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, they agreed that, if unforeseeable damages occurred later, federal and state governments had 15 years to ask for $100 million more.
 On Thursday, with the deadline approaching, the governments exercised this clause. They announced in a statement that they would seek $92 million from Exxon Mobil to clean up stubborn patches of oil, whose most toxic components, they say, have not dissipated since the spill in 1989. 
 Federal and state lawyers said in statements that they believed the lingering oil was still interfering with the recovery of animals in the area. The worries, environmentalists say, are focused on species that frequent the intertidal areas of Prince William Sound, like clams, mussels and harlequin ducks.
 With this action, ''we are aggressively seeking to restore natural resource damages unforeseen at the time of the 1991 settlement,'' said Sue Ellen Wooldridge, assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department, in a statement. ''Our goal throughout this process has been to pursue all scientifically and legally appropriate means of restoration.'' 
 While the oil can be found along several miles of beach, tying its effects to the slow recovery of some species may not be easy, one environmentalist said. 
 ''No one doubts there is ongoing damage,'' said Eleanor Huffines, of the Alaska office of the Wilderness Society. ''The challenge is that the ocean is so dynamic that it will be a hard thing to do to make the connection. But since this has been the most well-studied area since the spill, they have been able to document the lack of recovery.''
 Mark Boudreaux, the media relations manager for Exxon Mobil, focused on this uncertainty in a statement responding to the action. A link between the remaining oil and effects on wildlife, Mr. Boudreaux said, ''is no more than a hypothesis.'' He added, ''Nothing we have seen so far, however, indicates that this request for further funding from Exxon is justified.''
 Of the $900 million paid by Exxon, $145 million remains in a trust fund administered by a council representing the federal and state agencies and local groups. ''If there were any matter in Prince William Sound that needed restoration or repair,'' Mr. Boudreaux said, ''it was the trustees' duty to use this money to remedy the problem.''
 Along with the request for the $92 million, which may be decreased or increased to the maximum $100 million after negotiations, the state and federal agencies gave Exxon a blueprint for how the restoration should proceed.
 The request for additional money had the support of Alaska's two senators, Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski, Republicans who had encouraged Exxon to provide the extra $100 million without the formal ''reopener'' process set by the 1991 settlement.
 In March 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker, with an inebriated captain, ran aground on Bligh Reef, ruptured and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound, contaminating about 900 miles of shoreline.
 The damage to the fishing industry and to native subsistence hunting lasted for years. The herring population, a crucial link between the tiny plankton at the bottom of the food chain and the larger predators at the top, crashed four years after the spill. Of the $145 million remaining from Exxon's original payment, a significant part has been set aside to compensate herring fishermen.
 Exxon Mobil continues to appeal a separate punitive damage award of $4.5 billion resulting from the spill.
 The move to push for the extra money comes at a significant moment in the political life of Alaska, a state whose economy has been oil-dependent for three decades, but which is also encountering a steady decline in its share of oil revenues because of declining production of North Slope oil.
 A new natural gas pipeline promises to be a source of income. But how ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and BP, the energy industry's three major players here, will be taxed on overall levels of energy production is the subject of intense debate in a special session of the Legislature. 
 The open question is whether the industry, if it sees those tax discussions in the Legislature going too far against its interests, will abandon the pipeline, leaving the state without these potential new revenues.
 So even though the legal deadline set the timetable for the state and federal governments' actions Thursday, it is an awkward moment to push for more money from Exxon Mobil. The company, in the statement of Mr. Boudreaux, made no allusion to its other major political and legal struggle in Alaska.

HEADLINE: The New Chief Cook and Bottle Washer in Beard's House

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
PALATE alert: What's cooking downstairs in the kitchen at the James Beard House, where world maps serve as whimsical wallpaper? Fried frog legs in Peverada sauce, risotto with snail ragu, and mango s'mores, delicacies never before sampled, at least not voluntarily, by Susan Ungaro, the new president of the Beard Foundation, the gastronomic mecca attempting a souffle-like rise from an embarrassing financial scandal that sent her predecessor to prison, spurring the resignation of its entire board. Indigestion comes in many forms.
 ''I've only been here six weeks, but I've already found out this job is not for the faint of stomach,'' says Ms. Ungaro, whose office at this quaint Greenwich Village town house is still decorated by leftovers from the previous regime, dusty commemorative plates with the Beard bow-tie motif or signature or visage. It seems as if Mr. Beard's photogenic, and bald, pate dominates every wall at 167 West 12th Street, where he lived, cooked, wrote and held court until his death in 1985. 
Ms. Ungaro, an executive at Family Circle magazine for 25 years until a change of ownership left her unemployed in June 2005, has redecorating in mind as part of the sprucing up of the Beard brand. But the kitchen maps, mirrored bathroom and a mirrored bedroom ceiling that now crowns a dining room nook will stay. The quirks and kinks of Mr. Beard's bigger-than-life personality are safe with her. Even if she is a pearl-wearing, opera-loving (Mozart trills on her cellphone ring tone) matron, a Sunday afternoon Mets baseball fan with a husband, three children and a nanny-who-cooks in suburban River Vale, N.J. 
 What is clearly attuned to Ms. Ungaro's own sensibility are the two knickknacks on her tidy desk: a stone paperweight painted with a tongue-in-cheek slogan, ''Diplomacy. The art of letting someone have it your way,'' and a ceramic mug in the same hue as her complexion, strawberry blond. The mug, though, lacks her constellation of County Kerry freckles -- mom, a homemaker with a brood of six, and dad, a transit authority employee, were Irish immigrants. The cup displays a gentle message: ''Rose Colored Glass (always half full).'' That's her. She says her idea of culinary excellence is preparing a standing rib roast and getting it just right. 
 Ms. Ungaro admits to some ''serious Googling'' of the foundation's checkered past before taking over this spring as its first salaried president -- Leonard F. Pickell Jr., its former president, was accused of pilfering more than $1.1 million and pleaded guilty to second-degree grand larceny, hence the exit of the board that failed to notice anything rotten in the larder. 
 HER due diligence also extended to researching the mission of its celebrity chef namesake to make sure she was a sensible fit as purveyor of his all-American legacy. In the food world, she says, the annual Beard Awards pack the punch of Oscars; likewise, chefs invited to cook at Beard House's nightly dinners are gastronomy's version of ''made men.'' And women. ''Hopefully, the Beard brand is bigger than all its troubles.''
 As far as representing Mr. Beard, Ms. Ungaro's comfort level escalated when she came across a quote from him that played down gourmet grandstanding. She gamely recites it: ''I don't like gourmet food or this or that food; I like good food.'' 
 About following a convicted crook as president, Ms. Ungaro, whose fiscal conservatism extends to editing ''The Inflation Fighter Meat Book'' and an ''H&R Block Family Financial Planner,'' is forthright: ''It's a new dawn, it's a new cake, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure it rises well. One of my mandates is to make this a think tank. We need to expand, to make this foundation more national and more relevant. We want to be a place people turn to for education on good nutrition practices as well as fine dining. The James Beard Foundation as the image of what's good about American gastronomy deserves to live on even after one scandal.'' 
 ''When you've lost almost a million dollars, that's a serious drawback to a small foundation,'' she elaborates, sipping the house beverage, Acqua Panna water, from a glass goblet. ''But irreparable damage is when something can't be saved; this is a foundation to which life rafts were thrown out immediately. How could one man's lack of leadership take down the whole brand? I think people saw it as one man's folly.''
 Out of politeness, or maybe out of fear of litigation, Ms. Ungaro is careful not to refer to that man by name.
 Scandals and snails were not in the career or culinary radar of Ms. Ungaro, 52, who was named editor in chief of Family Circle in 1994 and catered to 20 million readers more interested in whipping up a 20-minute meatloaf than in mastering foie gras terrine. Her only prior visit to Beard House was a gingerbread house-making party sponsored by Family Circle where her sous-chef was her daughter, Christina, now 12. 
 Ms. Ungaro grew up in New Milford, N.J., and attended William Paterson University intent on becoming a speech therapist. By accident, she took an audio production course, loved it, and switched to communications. But she had a second career, and it was culinary: through college and grad school, she worked at a McDonald's in Hackensack.
 When Family Circle offered her a job in 1975 for $9,000, McDonald's countered with $15,000 and a semester at its Hamburger University. It was a two-minute quandary: ''I didn't want to smell like burgers and fries for the rest of my life.''
 But fried frogs legs? Not a problem.

HEADLINE: The Wall Street Journal Names a Columnist

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Kimberley A. Strassel, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, has been named the paper's new Washington columnist.
 Ms. Strassel, 33, will be resuming the weekly Potomac Watch column, which has been in hiatus for the last five years. It ceased when Paul A. Gigot, who wrote the column for 14 years, left Washington for New York in August 2001 to become The Journal's editorial page editor. His column won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2000. 
 Ms. Strassel has been an editorial writer since January 2002 and was elevated to the editorial board in November.
 Her signed op-ed pieces indicate that her thinking is in line with the free market philosophy of The Journal's editorial page. She has written extensively about the multibillion-dollar asbestos litigation. And she has questioned the validity of cases brought by Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, who is the New York State attorney general and is running for governor. She is also co-author of ''Leaving Women Behind: Modern Families, Outdated Laws,'' which says outmoded tax and labor laws penalize families in which both spouses are working.
 Ms. Strassel, who grew up in Oregon, graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1994. She began as a news assistant at The Central European Economic Review, a Dow Jones publication, based in Brussels, and later moved to London where she worked as a reporter covering technology for The Wall Street Journal's European edition.
 After moving to New York in 1999, Ms. Strassel worked briefly as a real estate reporter at The Journal before moving to the editorial page. In 2005 she was a finalist for a Gerald Loeb Award for business journalism in the commentary category.
 Asked if he had any advice for a Washington columnist, Mr. Gigot said, ''Treat it like it's a foreign country, like you're a foreign correspondent.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Rejects Output Cuts Requested By Venezuela 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, June 1 

 BODY:
OPEC rejected calls from its host to lower production quotas in its meeting here on Thursday, but that did not prevent President Hugo Chavez from seeking to invigorate the 11-country group by appealing to oil-rich countries in Africa and South America to become members. 
 In a speech lasting one and a half hours, Mr. Chavez also called for OPEC to consider $50 as its floor price for a barrel of oil. Mr. Chavez peppered his talk with references to Venezuela's role in pushing for nationalistic policies within OPEC in the 1960's, and to Frantz Fanon's ''Wretched of the Earth,'' a book about colonial subjugation in North Africa. 
''If we talk of a price band, then the floor should be $50,'' said Mr. Chavez, ''and the roof of the band should be infinite.''
 International energy markets, accustomed to such bold announcements from Mr. Chavez and other Venezuelan officials, reacted calmly. Crude oil for July delivery fell 95 cents, to $70.34 a barrel in New York. 
 The oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cordially absorbed Mr. Chavez's remarks. 
 ''He's the president of Venezuela,'' Chekib Khelil, Algeria's energy minister, said in an interview. ''He has the right to say what he wants.'' 
 And $50 a barrel as a base price for oil? ''Well, that is what he offers,'' Mr. Khelil said. 
 Under Mr. Chavez, Venezuela has emerged as OPEC's most aggressive proponent of higher prices. Now Mr. Chavez is trying to enhance Venezuela's stature in OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of global oil production, by calling for its first additional members in nearly three decades. 
 One potential member is Sudan, whose entry would be politically sensitive but minimally influential given its relatively low production of 360,000 barrels a day. Mr. Chavez also invited Ecuador, which produces 540,000 barrels a day. Ecuador was a member of OPEC but withdrew from the group in 1992. 
 A potential member of more stature would be Angola, Africa's second-largest oil producer behind Nigeria. Output in Angola, which produces 1.24 million barrels a day, is expected to surge in the next few years, providing one-quarter of the growth in supplies outside OPEC and 20 percent of United States imports by 2010, according to Deutsche Bank. 
 While Angola sent a delegation of observers to the Caracas meeting, whether it will join OPEC is not clear. ''There has been speculation about such a move since we achieved independence from Portugal in the 1970's,'' said a member of the delegation who declined to give his name. 
 The pomp and the security preparations for Thursday's meeting, the first here since 2000, seemed to surprise some delegates who were accustomed to OPEC's routine gatherings in Vienna. Bullet-resistant sport utility vehicles whisked the delegates around, accompanied by elite commandos and a military ambulance. Soldiers stood guard on roads and at checkpoints across the city. 
 Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, justified OPEC's decision to keep output quotas at 28 million barrels a day, saying the oil market was overpriced simply because of speculation by hedge funds and an inability to refine much of the crude oil that is heavy in sulfur. 
 While Mr. Naimi usually attracts the most attention at OPEC meetings because Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter, this gathering clearly belonged to Mr. Chavez, even though the push for lower output quotas by Venezuela's energy minister, Rafael Ramirez, ultimately failed. 
 ''That hawkish position is like a salute to the flag,'' said Mazhar al-Shereidah, a professor of petroleum economics at Central University in Caracas. ''It has to be done.'' 
 Mr. Chavez discussed Venezuela's strengthening ties with Iran while also criticizing the foreign policy of the Bush administration. He compared President Bush to former President Bill Clinton, describing Mr. Clinton as ''a gentleman with whom you could talk.'' Mr. Chavez also asked delegates to look upon OPEC in a kinder light, describing it as the ''Organization of Peace Exporting Countries.'' Iran's petroleum minister, Sayed Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh, said he welcomed the views and hospitality of Mr. Chavez.
 When asked about Iran's potential involvement in a venture to produce heavy oil in Venezuela's Orinoco River basin, he said, ''We look forward to cooperating with Venezuela on a variety of levels.''
 ''Venezuela is our friend.''

HEADLINE: A Seamless Major Domo, on Wall St. or in Washington

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
As Henry M. Paulson Jr. pondered whether to leave the job he loves at Goldman Sachs for a new position of uncertain power at the Treasury, he received some crucial advice earlier last month from James A. Baker III, a Treasury secretary in the administration of President Ronald Reagan.
 It is not every day that a Wall Street chief executive gets career counseling from a Washington power broker like Mr. Baker. But for Mr. Paulson, the words of wisdom represented a payoff of sorts from a series of relationships he has forged with Washington insiders through the counsel of his chief of staff and closest adviser at Goldman Sachs, John F. W. Rogers. 
The conversation was brief, but Mr. Baker's argument was blunt and to the point: assuming that Mr. Paulson would be ceded broad control in economic policy, the job could be a highly influential one.
 The role of Mr. Rogers, a member of Mr. Baker's inner circle since 1981, in putting his boss at ease about pursuing a career in government underlines a growing tendency on the part of Wall Street chiefs to seek out executives with deep Washington ties to be their closest advisers. 
 Schooled in the fine arts of managing vast bureaucracies and even vaster egos, men like Mr. Rogers, who has just turned 50, have found that these talents -- always held in high regard in Washington -- are also in demand on Wall Street. That is especially the case at Goldman Sachs, a firm with a long history of sending its finest to Washington. Indeed, before working with Mr. Paulson, Mr. Rogers was chief of staff to Jon S. Corzine, Mr. Paulson's predecessor, who after a term in the United States Senate is now governor of New Jersey.
 Thomas R. Nides, for another, a former top staff member for Thomas S. Foley, a former speaker of the House, and Mickey Kantor, a former United States trade representative, serve in similar capacities to John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. 
 ''These guys are doers, not talkers,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff under President Reagan. ''They understand power whether it is in the corporate board room or in the White House. They are not so much enablers for getting C.E.O.'s to Washington as they are Sherpas for getting things done.''
 To be sure, it was Mr. Paulson's credibility on Wall Street and his success at Goldman that put him atop President Bush's wish list. And Joshua B. Bolten, the president's new chief of staff and a former Goldman executive himself, played a vital part in assuring Mr. Paulson that he would have a clear and defined policy role.
 Nonetheless, the behind-the-scenes influence of Mr. Rogers -- who served under Mr. Baker when he was chief of staff and secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and secretary of state in the administration of Mr. Bush's father -- was such that he is now deliberating a return to Washington to work again for Mr. Paulson, this time, in all likelihood, in the capacity of a senior deputy.
 Friends of Mr. Rogers, who does not welcome public scrutiny and declined to comment for this article, compare him to the George Smiley character in John Le Carre's spy novels. Mr. Rogers, a slight, retiring man with a preference for tan raincoats, brings the kind of technical staff expertise and, his friends say, the ability to gravitate toward the seat of power in bureaucracies that recall Le Carre's spymaster. 
 More than anything, they say, he understands how to make himself indispensable to powerful people.
 His experience in Washington dates to the mid-1970's, when he juggled an internship in the Ford White House with his bachelor's degree program at George Washington University. 
 His first connection was to David R. Gergen, who joined the Ford administration as a counselor to the president and later served presidents from Richard M. Nixon to Bill Clinton. 
 As Mr. Gergen tells the story, on his first day at work, he asked how he could secure some furniture for his empty office in the Old Executive Office Building. He was told he could call the General Services Administration and wait two months or call Mr. Rogers, then a 19-year-old intern, for quicker results. 
 ''The next day I had a desk, a couch, a TV set and artwork,'' Mr. Gergen recalled. ''I can say that I discovered the phenomenon of John Rogers. I was so impressed with his enterprise that I said, 'Will you come work for me?' ''
 Mr. Rogers's career ascended swiftly. He joined Mr. Baker in 1981 when he was named Mr. Reagan's chief of staff and was on the ground, plugging in phones and hanging pictures on the walls as the new administration set up shop.
 Over time, his responsibilities increased. He moved with Mr. Baker to the Treasury, where he was an assistant secretary for management and, after a period in private business, returned with Mr. Baker, becoming under secretary of state for management.
 In 1994, he joined Goldman Sachs, where his ability to make the trains run on time endeared him to superiors. 
 He was made a partner in 2000 and is now a member of the firm's management committee, responsible for external relations as well as the firm's philanthropic activities, in addition to his prime role managing the hectic activities of Mr. Paulson. 
 Mr. Rogers almost always accompanies Mr. Paulson on foreign tours and sits in on his meetings with political and corporate leaders.
 In some ways, the two are a bit of an odd couple. Mr. Paulson is very much of an alpha male: he will challenge colleagues to wrestling matches and once halted a game of paddle tennis to vomit before resuming play and winning the match. Mr. Rogers is less the competitive athlete, and his hobbies, including historic preservation, tend to be more sedate.
 They both have a passion for international affairs, and Mr. Rogers's wife, like Mr. Paulson, has had a deep interest in and involvement with China. Though he has worked at Goldman Sachs for 12 years, Mr. Rogers's family lives in Washington and he commutes home each weekend. And while speculation is rife that he will join Mr. Paulson in Washington, others say that he may find it difficult to make a break from Goldman. 
 ''John loves institutions,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''He loved the White House, the Treasury and the State Department. And now Goldman Sachs.''

HEADLINE: New Treasury Chief, Old Problems

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Bush Nominates Wall Street Chief for Treasury Job'' (front page, May 31): 
 President Bush brought in a new Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., to sell the American people on the wonderful job he has done with the economy. 
 Mr. Bush apparently thinks that Americans don't get it. It is Mr. Bush who doesn't get it. 
 To an economist, the economy is great. The economy is showing strong growth, high productivity and low unemployment. But it has not translated into dollars in an average worker's pockets. 
 All of Mr. Bush's country club friends are getting filthy rich from a combination of lower income taxes, way lower capital gains taxes on income accrued from investment, and higher productivity. 
 But the vast majority is simply left behind in this booming prosperity. 
 And it doesn't matter who the cheerleader is. We get it. And we don't like it one bit.

HEADLINE: Freakoutonomics

BYLINE: By Charles R. Morris. 
Charles R. Morris is the author, most recently, of ''The Tycoons.''

 BODY:
LAST month saw one of the sharpest drops in consumer confidence since the recessions of 1979-1982. But those were truly dreadful times. Oil prices tripled, rates on home mortgages shot into the mid-teens, the stock market was a disaster area and unemployment rates reached double digits. 
 Over the past three years, by contrast, American economic performance has been almost glittering. Inflation is still low, while employment and productivity have all been rising strongly. True, stock markets are clearly nervous, and the sharp upsurge in gas prices is adding to consumer skittishness. But the reaction still seems inconsistent with the economy's underlying strengths. 
There are parallels with another historical period, however, that suggest the deeper currents of uneasiness.
 Pan the camera back to Pittsburgh, July 1877. The Pennsylvania Railroad yard, stretching along the city's riverfront, is a raging inferno, set afire by angry mobs of railroad workers. A contingent of state militiamen, trapped in a burning railroad roundhouse, fight their way through the flames with a Gatling gun.
 Over the next few weeks riots rage throughout the country. In Chicago, newspaper headlines declare that ''howling mobs'' control the city. In New York, The Sun demands a ''diet of lead'' for rioters. Unrest in San Francisco explodes into a vicious anti-Chinese pogrom. The same period marks the glory years of the rural Granger movement and the Roman-candle growth of the Knights of Labor. American Populism puts down permanent roots.
 Historians long attributed the turmoil to a ''great depression of the 1870's.'' But recent detailed reconstructions of 19th-century data by economic historians show that there was no 1870's depression: aside from a short recession in 1873, in fact, the decade saw possibly the fastest sustained growth in American history. 
 Employment grew strongly, faster than the rate of immigration; consumption of food and other goods rose across the board. On a per capita basis, almost all output measures were up spectacularly. By the end of the decade, people were better housed, better clothed and lived on bigger farms. Department stores were popping up even in medium-sized cities. America was transforming into the world's first mass consumer society. 
 But why did people feel so miserable? Partly they were confused by prices, which were dropping sharply. Farmers thought falling grain prices meant they were getting poorer, without noticing that the price of everything else was falling too. Farmers' terms of trade -- the price differences between what they sold and what they bought -- actually racked up solid gains in the 1870's.
 But ordinary people still had good reason to be terrified, just as ordinary people do today. Midwestern 1870's factory farms -- thousand-acre spreads with 70-horse plowing teams -- quickly dominated world markets but also wiped out the much smaller grain farmers of New York. Globalized grain markets were more volatile: good weather on the Russian steppes could ruin an American grower's year. Farmers found themselves caught in the coils of grain futures markets. 
 After the Civil War, artisanal local manufacturers usually enjoyed comfortable mini-monopolies. But with the rapid spread of the railroads and the telegraph, new department stores and mail-order catalogs pressured local producers and middlemen with mass-produced goods, a precursor to the Wal-Mart era. In the mid-1880's, the Bloomingdale's catalog promised that orders would arrive within two weeks in virtually the whole of the United States, including large swathes of territory reachable only by wagon-train a decade before. The productivity shock was comparable to that from the Internet in our own day.
 Before the Civil War, America was perhaps the most egalitarian society in the world. But the unbridled entrepreneurialism of the 1870's gave rise to the robber barons. Even if ordinary people were doing better in the 1870's, the yawning gap between the very rich and everybody else fanned resentments. Interestingly, wealth inequality in today's America is roughly the same as in the Gilded Age. 
 The sharply increased social and geographic mobility of the 1870's set people adrift from traditional sources of security in families and villages. In our own day, the destruction of employer-employee relationships, the erosion of pension protection and employee health insurance may be creating a similar loss of moorings.
 If one counts only the size of houses and cars, and the numbers of electronic gadgets stuffed into rec rooms, Americans are probably better off than ever before. But as the 1870's suggest, economic well-being doesn't come just from piling up toys. An economy has psychological or, if you will, spiritual, dimensions. A conviction of fairness, a feeling of not being totally on one's own, a sense of reasonable stability and predictability are all essential components of good economic performance. When they were missing in the 1870's, in the midst of a boom, the populace was brought to the brink of revolt.

HEADLINE: Bank of China's Offering Soars 15% in First Day 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 1 

 BODY:
Shares of the Bank of China soared 15 percent on Thursday in their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
 It was the world's biggest public share offering in six years. Not since AT&T Wireless went public in 2000 have investors paid so dearly for an initial public stock offering, raising $9.7 billion for one of China's biggest state-owned banks. By contrast, Google, one of the hottest stock offerings in 2004, raised only about $1.7 billion.
The frenzy over the stock is just the latest sign of China's rising economic fortunes, even as global stock markets have shown signs of weakening in recent weeks. 
 The United States, Japan and Europe have long dominated the world market for public stock offerings. But the offering Thursday was the second instance in less than a year of global investors scrambling to purchase shares of a Chinese state-owned bank. Last October, the state-controlled China Construction Bank also went public in Hong Kong, raising about $9.2 billion in the largest stock offering of 2005.
 The huge public offerings come after some of the world's biggest financial institutions, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and American Express, spent billions of dollars to acquire minority stakes in China's biggest state-owned banks ahead of the planned public stock listings.
 While China's large state-owned banks have long been plagued by corruption, bad loans, embezzlement and poor corporate governance, investors seem to be betting heavily that the government's financial sector reforms and the public stock listings will create new banking riches in the world's fastest-growing economy.
 ''The listing of Chinese banks is just one element of the reform,'' said Sherry Lin, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ''There's been a lot of talk about whether they're ready or not. But a lot has already been done to reform them. And a lot more needs to be done. But listing them publicly means putting them under the scrutiny of the public.''
 Ready or not, two of China's banks are already among the world's most valuable financial institutions when ranked by stock market value. Citigroup is at the top of the global list, with a market capitalization of about $240 billion. When the Bank of China's state-owned shares are included, it is valued at over $105 billion.
 Indeed, the underwriters of the Bank of China offering, which included Goldman Sachs and UBS, said the offering was so highly anticipated that they were able to lock up more than $34 billion in orders in recent weeks.
 In all, the bank sold 25.57 billion shares at 2.95 Hong Kong dollars (38 cents) each. And by some estimates about 1 million people -- or almost one of every six Hong Kong residents -- applied to purchase shares of the Bank of China, the country's second-largest bank with assets of about $586 billion.
 The amount of money raised by the bank could swell to more than $11 billion if and when the underwriters release additional preoffering shares.
 UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Temasek Holdings of Singapore were among the earliest investors in the Bank of China, acquiring about 10 percent of the bank in 2005.
 Public scandals at the top banks have not put off investors. A former chief executive of the Bank of China's publicly traded Hong Kong subsidiary was convicted of embezzlement last year. The Bank of China has also disclosed in public filings that more than $150 million was lost or embezzled from the bank last year.
 Some experts said the public listings should improve the governing of the Chinese banks.
 ''The most important thing is for the Bank of China to become a public company after its listing,'' said Wu Xiaoqiu, a professor of finance at People's University in Beijing. ''It needs to follow all the regulations and to be supervised by the public. Maybe after that, the government won't interfere so easily, which is one of the key problems with the Chinese banks today.''
 With its listing, the Bank of China joins two other large Chinese banks that went public in Hong Kong: the Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank, both of whose shares have performed well. Shares of China Construction Bank, for instance, are up more than 40 percent since October.
 The Bank of China offering was one of the world's richest ever, investment bankers said, and already there is talk of a bigger listing that could raise up to $12 billion.
 Sometime later this year or early next year, China's biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, is set for a public listing.
 Among the early investors, putting more than $4 billion in the bank, are Goldman Sachs, American Express and the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.

HEADLINE: TODAY IN BUSINESS

 BODY:

PAULSON'S SUCCESSOR Goldman Sachs's board is expected to meet today to appoint Lloyd C. Blankfein as chief executive to succeed Henry M. Paulson Jr., the nominee for Treasury secretary. People close to the board say it is also expected to debate whether or not to appoint a separate chairman. [Page C4.] 


WALL STREET AND WASHINGTON John F. W. Rogers's role as Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s chief of staff at Goldman Sachs highlights a growing tendency on the part of Wall Street chieftains to seek out executives with deep Washington ties to be their closest advisers. [C1.]

BIG BREAK Because of a little-known provision in the tax code, Henry M. Paulson Jr. could receive a tax break of at least $48 million if confirmed as Treasury secretary. [C4.]

ASIAN AUTOMAKERS GAIN SHARE Toyota, Honda and other Asian auto manufacturers claimed a record 40 percent of the American market in May. [C1.]

FRENCH GO NORTH Thousands of people -- many just out of college -- are deserting France to live and work in Dublin, a city that sparkles with economic vibrancy despite a more general sense of stagnation in much of Europe. [C1.]

OPEC MEETING OPEC rejected calls from its host, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, to lower production quotas at a meeting in Caracas. But that did not prevent Mr. Chavez, left, from seeking to invigorate the 11-country group by appealing to oil-rich countries in Africa and South America to become members. [C2.]

NYSE-EURONEXT DEAL The NYSE Group reached a definitive agreement on a deal to buy Euronext, the pan-European stock and derivatives exchange, for $10.2 billion. [C3.]

CHARGES DROPPED Frank P. Quattrone, the most prominent banker in Silicon Valley during the 1990's technology boom, won a third major legal battle as securities industry regulators dropped all charges against him. [C1.]

STORES POST STRONG SALES Department stores, both high-end and mainstream, said May sales were particularly strong. Target also reported healthy sales, but its main rival in the discount store business, Wal-Mart, said sales growth slowed. [C3.]

WEB RECORDS The Justice Department is asking Internet companies to keep records on the Web-surfing activities of their customers to aid law enforcement and may propose legislation to force them to do so. [A15.]

HEINZ COST-CUTTING H. J.

HEADLINE: New Treasury Chief, Old Problems

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Secretary for Troubling Times'' (editorial, May 31): 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the nominee for Treasury secretary, may be all you say he is. But his personal qualities, reputation and experience won't solve our severe economic problems if President Bush's tax cuts for the rich, and immense and growing national debt -- as a result of our unconscionable deficit spending and the ballooning costs of the Iraq invasion -- are all off the table. 
 I expect that Mr. Bush's economic irresponsibility will trump Mr. Paulson's prudence. Further, I doubt that Mr. Paulson will be permitted to stray far from the party line. 
 Some hard questioning during his confirmation hearing should tell us all we need to know to predict his future as Treasury secretary.

 BODY:
Pulte Homes lowered its full-year earnings outlook yesterday as the housing market continued to cool. Pulte cut its outlook after both Hovnanian Enterprises and Toll Brothers lowered their forecasts within the last month. All three companies cited large declines in new orders and increases in cancellation rates in the second quarter on top of rising interest rates and larger inventories. Pulte Homes fell $1.70, or 5 percent, to $31.33 a share. Pulte, which operates in 27 states, reported that preliminary new orders dropped 29 percent in April and May from last year, to 6,447 units from 9,128 units. Pulte, which is based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., now projects earnings of 85 cents to 5 cents a share for the second quarter and $4.70 to $5 for the full year. In April, Pulte forecast 2006 earnings of $6 to $6.25 a share.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Hospital Locks Out Union Nurses, Then Relents

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., June 2 

 BODY:
The Englewood Hospital and Medical Center here locked out 660 unionized registered nurses early Friday morning after contract talks collapsed, but state and county officials announced hours later that the nurses would be permitted to return to work at 7 a.m. Monday. 
 Hospital officials and local leaders said talks would resume on Wednesday, and the deadline for a new contract was extended to June 21.
 Hundreds of nurses were turned away by security guards when they reported for their shifts at 7 a.m. Friday, and many were shocked by the hospital's decision to hire replacement nurses. 
 ''That they wouldn't even let us in when we were willing to work, I just find it unbelievable,'' said Diane Liccardo, who has worked at the hospital for 20 years.
 The impasse has centered on pensions. The hospital wants to switch pension plans, a move that would reduce the nurses' benefits. Stephanie Orrico, president of Local 5004 of Health Professionals and Allied Employees and a nurse at Englewood Hospital since 1976, said the change would give a nurse with 20 years' service up to $30,000 a year less after retirement. 
 In a statement, hospital officials said they hoped ''to reach an agreement that is economically feasible and fair to all parties.''
 Englewood is one of nine hospitals in New Jersey where the nurses voted last month to authorize a strike if the contract dispute was not settled by June 1, but the other hospitals either reached agreements or are still negotiating. The union represents 11,000 nurses in New Jersey and Philadelphia.
 An hour after the lockout was announced, several hundred nurses walked to downtown Englewood, about a mile away, and delivered a letter to the hospital's chief executive, Douglas A. Duchak. Throughout the morning dozens stood near the hospital entrance chanting, ''We want to work.''

HEADLINE: The Worker Next Door

BYLINE: By Barry R. Chiswick. 
Barry R. Chiswick is head of the economics department at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
IT is often said that the American economy needs low-skilled foreign workers to do the jobs that American workers will not do. These foreign workers might be new immigrants, illegal aliens or, in the current debate, temporary or guest workers. But if low-skilled foreign workers were not here, would lettuce not be picked, groceries not bagged, hotel sheets not changed, and lawns not mowed? Would restaurants use disposable plates and utensils? 
 On the face of it, this assertion seems implausible. Immigrants and low-skilled foreign workers in general are highly concentrated in a few states. The ''big six'' are California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Even within those states, immigrants and low-skilled foreign workers are concentrated in a few metropolitan areas -- while there are many in New York City and Chicago, relatively few are in upstate New York or downstate Illinois. 
Yet even in areas with few immigrants, grass is cut, groceries are bagged and hotel sheets are changed. Indeed, a large majority of low-skilled workers are native to the United States. A look at the 2000 census is instructive: among males age 25 to 64 years employed that year, of those with less than a high school diploma, 64 percent were born in the United States and 36 percent were foreign born. 
 Other Americans nominally graduated from high school but did not learn a trade or acquire the literacy, numeracy or decision-making skills needed for higher earnings. Still others suffer from a physical or emotional ailment that limits their labor productivity. And some low-skilled jobs are performed by high school or college students, housewives or the retired who wish to work part time. Put simply, there are no low-skilled jobs that American workers would not and do not do. 
 Over the past two decades the number of low-skilled workers in the United States has increased because of immigration, both legal and illegal. This increase in low-skilled workers has contributed to the stagnation of wages for all such workers. The proposed ''earned legalization'' (amnesty) and guest worker programs would allow still more low-skilled workers into the country, further lowering their collective wages. 
 True, the prices of the goods and services that these new immigrants produce are reduced for the rich and poor alike. But the net effect of this dynamic is a decline in the purchasing power of low-skilled families and a rise in the purchasing power of high-income families -- a significant factor behind the increase in income inequality that has been of considerable public concern over the past two decades. 
 In short, the continued increase in the flow of unskilled workers into the United States is the economic and moral equivalent of a regressive tax. 
 If the number of low-skilled foreign workers were to fall, wages would increase. Low-skilled American workers and their families would benefit, and society as a whole would gain from a reduction in income inequality. 
 Employers facing higher labor costs for low-skilled workers would raise their prices, and to some extent they would change the way they operate their businesses. A farmer who grows winter iceberg lettuce in Yuma County, Ariz., was asked on the ABC program ''Nightline'' in April what he would do if it were more difficult to find the low-skilled hand harvesters who work on his farm, many of whom are undocumented workers. He replied that he would mechanize the harvest. Such technology exists, but it is not used because of the abundance of low-wage laborers. In their absence, mechanical harvesters -- and the higher skilled (and higher wage) workers to operate them -- would replace low-skilled, low-wage workers.
 But, you might ask, who would mow the lawns in suburbia? The higher wages would attract more lower-skilled American workers (including teenagers) to these jobs. Facing higher costs, some homeowners would switch to grass species that grow more slowly, to alternative ground cover or to flagstones. Others would simply mow every other week, or every 10 days, instead of weekly. And some would combine one or more of these strategies to offset rising labor costs.
 Few of us change our sheets and towels at home every day. Hotels and motels could reduce the frequency of changing sheets and towels from every day to, say, every third day for continuing guests, perhaps offering a price discount to guests who accept this arrangement. 
 Less frequent lawn mowing and washing of hotel sheets and towels would reduce air, noise and water pollution in the bargain. 
 With the higher cost of low-skilled labor, we would import more of some goods, in particular table-quality fruits and vegetables for home consumption (as distinct from industrial use) and lower-priced off-the-rack clothing. But it makes no sense to import people to produce goods in the United States for which we lack a comparative advantage -- that is, goods that other countries can produce more efficiently.
 The point is that with a decline in low-skilled foreign workers, life would go on. The genius of the American people is their ingenuity, and the genius of the American economy is its flexibility. And throughout our nation's history, this flexibility, the finding of alternative ways of doing things, has been a prime engine of economic growth and change.

HEADLINE: The Furor Over Antiterror Spending

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Pork 1, Antiterrorism 0'' (editorial, June 2):
I agree that there is pork in some of the recent Department of Homeland Security urban grants. But you overstate the case. 
 If left to their own devices, New York City officials would try to obtain security grants for all manner of projects that have the flimsiest connection to security. 
 How easy to avoid fiscal responsibility -- issuing bonds or raising taxes -- when one can use security as an excuse.
 The entire Department of Homeland Security is a redundant bureaucracy that distributes pork. These exercises in financing encourage feeding frenzies by states and cities, and the kind of silly disparagement of other cities (like Omaha) that has no place in our national dialogue.
 The Atlantic Avenue subway station in Brooklyn and the 34th Street station in Manhattan, vital transportation hubs, were revealed to be terrorist targets in separate trials. They should be patrolled by United States armed forces.
 Grants, applications and political posturing are a wasteful distraction. We are in a war. Let's act like it.

HEADLINE: U.N. Strengthens Call for a Global Battle Against AIDS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 2 

 BODY:
The General Assembly adopted a strongly worded declaration on Friday aimed at pressing the nations of the world to strengthen their battle against AIDS, a global pandemic that Secretary General Kofi Annan called ''the greatest challenge of our generation.''
 The language of the document surprised even anti-AIDS groups, which said that while it did not satisfy all their objectives, they had feared it would be watered down. In turn, United Nations officials credited the advocacy groups for strengthening the draft in behind-the-scenes struggles during an extraordinary three-day plenary session. 
The nonbinding declaration reaffirms commitments made in 2001, when the United Nations defined AIDS as far more than a medical issue, framing it in terms of politics, human rights and economic survival. 
 At the time, few felt that effective delivery of the antiretroviral therapy now provided to some people in poor countries was possible, and there was little money for the program.
 The new document is a political blueprint, not a plan of action. It calls for a strong commitments to bolster the rights of women and girls so they can protect themselves from infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The document also acknowledges the role of men in spreading the disease and their responsibility to respect women.
 The declaration calls on countries to use scientifically documented prevention strategies, including condoms; to make clean needles accessible to drug users; and to take steps to provide universal access to prevention programs, care and antiretroviral drugs. 
 It includes politically charged terms like ''condoms'' and ''vulnerable groups,'' though those groups are not specified. Many advocates have urged the United Nations to acknowledge frankly that some of today's fastest-growing H.I.V. epidemics are among intravenous drug users, prostitutes and gay men.
 Countries will be expected to measure their progress over the next five years against targets to be determined by the United Nations. 
 To achieve these and other goals, the declaration said, the world will need to spend up to $23 billion a year by 2010, almost triple the $8.3 billion spent last year. The challenge is for governments to follow through after delegates go home, the General Assembly's president, Ian Eliasson of Sweden, said at a news conference.
 In the 25 years since the first case was discovered, AIDS has become one of the worst pandemics in history, infecting 60 million people and leading to 25 million deaths.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Annan delivered a gloomy assessment, saying the world was losing the battle. 
 ''The epidemic continues to outpace us,'' he told a packed session of the General Assembly. ''There are more new infections than ever before; more deaths than ever before; more women and girls infected than ever before.''
 His dark tone diverged markedly from the upbeat speeches by world leaders at the start of the three-day session on Wednesday, and from the positive speech given Friday morning by Laura Bush, the first lady. 
 Mrs. Bush said the United States contributed more money than any other country to fight AIDS, which ''respects no national boundaries; spares no race or religion; and devastates men and women, rich and poor alike.''
 Mrs. Bush noted that her husband had put forth a plan in 2003 that contributes $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS internationally.
 Her speech steered away from many of the criticisms that have been leveled against the administration, notably that it promotes sexual abstinence over scientifically proven strategies, particularly condom use. Indeed, she said, the ''ABC'' model -- the initials stand for abstain, be faithful and use condoms -- had brought sharp declines in infections in Africa.
 Britain's secretary of state for international development, Hilary Benn, noting policy differences between his country and the United States, said in an interview that abstinence alone did not work.
 Mr. Benn, whose country contributes the second-largest amount to fight AIDS, criticized the declaration for not spelling out the ways the virus is transmitted through sex and through contaminated needles used to inject drugs, and from mother to infant through birth and nursing.
 ''Abstinence is fine for those who are able to abstain, but human beings like to have sex and they should not die because they do have sex,'' Mr. Benn told the assembly. 
 Dr. Mark Dybul, the acting United States global AIDS coordinator, said in an interview that the United Nations had passed ''a fine declaration'' in which he had not found any weak points.
 Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition, said the document could be used ''to make significant progress in going forward'' in the fight.
 But some advocacy groups said the document did not satisfy all their objectives.
 The Center for Health and Gender Equity, which says it represents nearly 70 international advocacy groups, denounced the document for failing to show greater political leadership; refusing to make a commitment to more definitive targets on financing, prevention, care and treatment; and rejecting frank acknowledgment that some of today's fastest-growing epidemics are occurring among injecting drug users, prostitutes and gay men.
 Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of the United Nations program, said that while no document could make anyone ''100 percent happy,'' the final version was ''a major advance'' and far stronger than the weaker drafts circulating earlier in the week.

HEADLINE: On Route of Chevrolet Impala, Signposts to Detroit's Decline

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 2 

 BODY:
To understand why Detroit is having so much trouble competing against Asian car companies, look no further than the Chevrolet Impala.
 In the 1960's, the Impala was king of the road. General Motors sold more than a million of them in 1965. Now the Impala is still the best-selling American car, but it is selling less than a third of that total.
 The Impala also lags behind four Japanese offerings -- the Toyota Camry and Corolla, and the Honda Accord and Civic -- in the annual race to be the best-selling car in America. 
 But Chevrolet, by its own admission, has no plans to try to win back the bragging rights anytime soon. 
 The reason is that G.M. prefers to stick with its decades-old approach of breadth over depth, buckshot over a silver bullet. So rather than placing an all-or-nothing bet on a single car at one division, it sells family cars through a variety of brands, including Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac and Saturn. 
 ''We're able to get at more people because we've got locations that sell all these vehicles,'' said Chevrolet's general manager, Edward J. Peper Jr.
 That idea served G.M. well when it sold more than half of all new cars and trucks back in the 1960's. But now G.M. controls less than a quarter of American sales. 
 And in today's ruthlessly competitive market, that strategy means that no single G.M. car will get the same amount of resources -- engineering, design and marketing -- as Toyota and Honda devote to their best sellers. 
 The Impala ''comes across as the best that the American companies can do,'' said Brian Moody, a road test editor at Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers buying advice to consumers. ''In a vacuum, it's hard to find anything wrong with it. And then you drive the Camry and the Accord.''
 The strength of those two cars is a reason Asian auto companies took a record 40 percent of the American market in May, when Detroit's market share fell to its second-lowest level in history, less than 53 percent.
 To be sure, G.M. and Ford vastly outsell their Japanese competitors in pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles: the two markets where they have put most of their resources for the last decade and a half.
 Moreover, G.M. executives say they are thrilled with the newest version of the Impala, which went on sale last year to good reviews and initially high quality ratings. And while sales at G.M. have dropped 8 percent this year, Impala sales are up 6.4 percent this year over 2005.
 Impala can go head to head with Japanese cars in several ways, and price is among them. Like them, Impala sells for about $20,000 to $27,000. The Accord, Camry and Impala are on the list of recommended vehicles of Consumer Reports. And the Impala, like the Camry and Accord, has loyal buyers: some 45 percent of its buyers come back for a second one, according to Chevrolet.
 The similarities largely end there, however, and the differences among the cars are marked. The main one is Impala's place in the G.M. lineup. It is part of a flock of family sedans at the automaker. In fact, it is not even the only family car at Chevrolet, which also sells the Malibu.
 By contrast, Camry is Toyota's brightest star. Camry is ''the center of the target,'' said James Press, who was recently named president of Toyota Motor North America.
 Getting the latest Camry ready for its introduction this April was akin to a space launching for Toyota, which is building Camrys in eight markets around the world, including China, where production began last week. 
 It corralled engineers from the United States and Japan, and manufacturing experts from all the places it builds Camrys. They worked on ways to improve the car up to the time it started rolling off the assembly line.
 The last American company to focus that kind of effort on a family car was Ford, which famously put together a team in the 1980's to develop the Taurus. Even back then, the goal was to beat the Accord and the Camry, and they did so, taking the best-selling title for a number of years until 1997, when Camry captured it. It has ceded the title only once since, to Accord.
 Toyota's win coincided with Ford's shift of resources to focus on pickups and S.U.V.'s. Even though Ford now has its own flock of family cars, including the Ford Fusion, it does not plan to build enough of any one model to fight Camry and Accord.
 Nor does Chevrolet. In 2006, it expects to make about 275,000 Impalas at a plant in Oshawa, Ontario, the only one where the Impala is built.
 That leaves it well shy of Toyota, which sold more than 400,000 Camrys in 2005. For the American market, Toyota builds Camrys in Georgetown, Ky., and it imports more from Japan and soon will be able to build another 100,000 a year when it begins production in 2007 at Subaru's plant in Lafayette, Ind. Toyota holds a stake in Subaru's parent company.
 With more than two million Camrys on the road, the name ''has become almost a household word,'' said Tom Libby, an industry analyst with J. D. Power & Associates.
 Yet, the Impala was an even bigger household name back when Toyota was barely a blip on the radar. Since 1958, the year after Toyota first sold cars here, Chevrolet has sold more than 14 million Impalas, making it one of the most recognizable cars in automotive history.
 But unlike Camry, which has been sold continuously in the United States since 1982, always aimed at the family market, G.M. stopped selling the Impala for two stretches in the 1980's and 1990's. From its roots as a fast, chrome-laden car with six taillights, the Impala grew in size, then shrank and, in the eyes of critics, became generic.
 Like many other G.M. models, it is sold to rental car companies, government agencies and corporations, markets where Toyota generally does much less business. The Impala is also a police car, bought by, among others, the New York Police Department. About 20 percent of the Impalas go to so-called fleet sales, down from almost half last year (about 10 percent of Camrys are sold to fleets).
 Chevrolet is trying to veer away from the bulk sales and sell more to consumers. One goal with the new Impala, said its marketing manager, Mark A. Clawson, is to put features on the car that Toyota does not offer.
 For example, the top-of-the-line SS version can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.7 seconds, thanks to a zippy V-8 engine with 303 horsepower.
 Camry does not offer a V-8, but it has options Impala does not -- namely, a manual transmission and four-cylinder engine, both available on its basic and midlevel cars. With gas prices staying high, both those features increasingly are in demand as buyers switch from bigger vehicles, especially S.U.V.'s, to cars.
 But buyers who like the roominess of an S.U.V. may be pleased with another Impala feature. Inside the Impala SS, there are fold-flat rear seats, like those in minivans and S.U.V.'s, creating a vast storage space that most sedans cannot match. There are other options, too, like a jack for an MP3 player, a Bose stereo system and satellite radio. 
 On the outside, Impala looks conservative -- a criticism that used to be leveled at Camry before its latest redesign, which created a curvy car with a light, nimble feel. 
 Unlike Toyota, which was aiming this time out for a more eye-catching car, Chevrolet deliberately tried not to make a style statement with Impala, Mr. Clawson said.
 ''We weren't looking for a vehicle that would turn heads, but we weren't looking for one that would turn heads away either,'' Mr. Clawson said. ''We were looking for a balance,'' a car that was ''nicely styled but not ostentatious.'' 
 That approach, Mr. Moody of Edmunds.com said, seemed reasonable given the relatively bland appearance of the previous Camry and Accord models. But it now seems unwise given what Toyota has done with the latest Camry, which ''so far exceeds the previous car that it almost seems like it's not a Camry,'' he said, but rather a Lexus luxury car. The Accord, already more eye-catching, gets another face-lift this fall.
 Chevrolet has put more emphasis this year on marketing its new S.U.V.'s, especially the Chevrolet Tahoe, and its new line of pickup trucks. It is only now beginning to promote cars like the Impala that it maintains get better fuel economy than its Japanese rivals.
 ''The American companies spent so much time focusing on trucks and S.U.V.'s that they neglected their cars,'' Mr. Moody said. ''Now they're just playing catch-up.''
 Even so, Chevrolet dealers, for their part, seem happy with the Impala. Sales of the latest version are up 20 percent at Genoa Chevrolet outside Toledo, Ohio, said Mike Pauley, the dealership's executive manager.
 In past years, many of Mr. Pauley's customers chose the Impala largely because of G.M.'s deep discounts, or because they wanted an American-made sedan. But the new version, which carries a modest $500 rebate, has attracted buyers more on its own merits, he said.
 One recent customer was Gary McKeel, a retired salesman from Perrysburg, Ohio, who switched to the Impala after owning Buicks for the last 17 years. ''It's spacious and it rides very nice,'' Mr. McKeel said.
 But down the road, Impala may not be such a great deal. According to Edmunds.com, a typical Impala owner will spend 11.3 percent more, or about $4,300, on the car over five years than the owner of a typical Camry, mainly because the car loses its value faster and has higher repair costs. That figure takes into account the $500 rebate that Chevrolet is offering on Impala versus none on the Camry.
 Mr. Libby of J. D. Power said he did not rule out Detroit's taking the car crown again. This Impala will not be the one, however, he said. Impala ''has not had the strength, it has not had the equity of the Camry,'' he said.
 Getting the title back will require another companywide effort like Ford made 20 years ago -- the kind that Toyota and Honda routinely make when they introduce new versions of their bread-and-butter cars.
 ''To me, it's a step-by-step process,'' Mr. Libby said. ''There are no shortcuts.''

HEADLINE: Snow Did Well on the Economy, but His Boss Did Poorly in the Polls 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IF presiding over a growing economy with low inflation was the measure of a good Treasury secretary, then John W. Snow would be leaving his position with accolades all around, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., his chosen successor, would be said to have a tough act to follow. 
 To assess the tenure of Treasury secretaries, the economy's performance under Mr. Snow was compared with the performance under each of the previous 10 secretaries, going back to William E. Simon, who served Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford from 1974 to 1977. 
 The measurement ranked each tenure on the basis of annual growth in real gross domestic product and payroll employment, as well as on the performance of the dollar, the stock market and the Consumer Price Index. Low inflation rates were considered good, while rises in everything else were viewed as indicative of success. The ratings were combined on a scale of one point for a first-place finish in a category, down to 11 points for a last-place position.
 Measured that way, Mr. Snow's tenure ranks second, behind that of Robert E. Rubin, the secretary for much of President Bill Clinton's time in office, and a man to whom Mr. Snow has often been critically compared. Mr. Snow did well on economic growth, inflation and the stock market. He ranked in the middle on employment growth, and lagged only in the performance of the dollar.
 So why were some Republicans so eager to get rid of Mr. Snow, and why did some on Wall Street ask why Mr. Paulson, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, would want the job? Some think that Mr. Snow played little role in formulating economic policy, instead serving as a not-very-effective salesman for policies that came out of the White House. Others do not like those policies, and point to large budget and trade deficits as reasons to think the good times are in jeopardy.
 The reality, of course, is that neither the Treasury secretary nor his boss, the president, really bear much responsibility for short-term changes in the economy. Mr. Snow entered office after the recovery from the 2001 recession was well under way -- a recovery he never failed to credit to the tax cuts. Giving him credit for the recovery, and blaming his predecessor, Paul H. O'Neill, for the recession and stock market plunge, is not fair to either man.
 The real reason for Mr. Snow's departure may be that the good economic performance has not helped where it really matters -- at least in Washington. He is leaving with the approval rating of his president, as measured by the most recent Gallup poll, at 33 percent. Only one Treasury secretary has left with a lower presidential approval rating.
 That secretary, W. Michael Blumenthal, also had the most economic growth of any secretary before he left, in 1979. He later joked that when a president's approval rating was lower than the prime rate, it was time for a new secretary. In fact, the prime rate did not get that high, but rising interest rates and inflation did help to destroy the popularity of President Jimmy Carter.

Note: Figures show compound annual change during each secretary's term. When two secretaries served during a month or quarter, the secretary with the longest service in the period is given credit for that period's performance. Figures reflect growth of real gross domestic product, rise of Consumer Price Index, growth of total payroll employment, change in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and average move of the dollar against Japanese yen and euro, with German mark figures used before euro was created.

HEADLINE: Job Growth And Wages Were Weak Last Month

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
Job creation slowed to a crawl in May and hourly wages failed to keep up with inflation, the Labor Department said on Friday, in a report suggesting that high energy prices and higher interest rates are starting to crimp economic growth.
 The nation's employers added 75,000 jobs in May, less than half what most forecasters had expected. It was the third consecutive month of slower job growth, even though the unemployment rate edged down to 4.6 percent, nearly a five-year low.
The surprisingly weak jobs report provoked contradictory reactions of relief and anxiety among investors -- a ''Rorschach'' view of the economy, in the words of one analyst -- because it highlighted the ambiguities that confront the Federal Reserve. 
 On the one hand, the job numbers bolstered the Fed's expectation -- and hope -- that economic growth would slow just enough to reduce inflationary pressures. 
 The Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, are hoping for a ''soft landing'' from the torrid growth earlier this year, reducing the upward push on prices and wages and allowing the Fed to end its two-year campaign to raise interest rates.
 On the other, the report was so much weaker than analysts had expected that it prompted new worries about an unexpected downturn.
 In the Treasury market, bonds rose as traders bet that the Fed might pause in June from raising rates. Stock prices initially rose, but fell back on concerns of slowing growth, with the Dow ending the day down 12 points. [Page C6.]
 Employers turned cautious in May across a broad swath of the economy: in retail stores, in factories and at construction sites. Average hourly wages were almost flat and average weekly earnings, which include pay from overtime and second jobs, declined slightly.
 Monthly job numbers are volatile, but analysts said rising oil prices and a cooler housing market were slowing the economy. Consumer confidence dropped sharply last month. Unemployment claims have risen over the last month. Factory orders in April declined 1.8 percent, the government said on Friday. And a closely watched barometer of manufacturing activity, the Institute of Supply Management's monthly survey, declined as well. 
 The rush of downbeat data comes a few weeks after a growing number of analysts and investors were criticizing Mr. Bernanke for being too soft on inflation.
 ''It's a perfect example of the Rorschach economy,'' said Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton Junction, N.J. ''We are at the cusp of a turning point in the economy, and it's usually at these turning points where you get a lot of confusion.'' 
 But the labor report surprised most analysts, including many who had warned that the May increases might come in well below the consensus forecast of 170,000 additional jobs. Except for two months last fall, when job creation stalled as a result of Hurricane Katrina, the addition of 75,000 jobs in May was the lowest since July 2004. 
 Retailers shed 27,000 jobs in May, suggesting that store owners anticipated a slowdown even though retail sales have been fairly strong. Manufacturing companies trimmed their work forces by 14,000, largely in the auto and electronics industries, all but reversing a jump in April. Construction employment, which soared last year, was flat in May.
 The biggest areas of job creation were in professional and business services, health care and education. Wholesalers added jobs as well, and have added 108,000 in the last year even as retail employment has been flat, suggesting that consumers are shifting purchases to the Internet.
 But Ian C. Shepherdson, a forecaster at High Frequency Economics who had been warning about a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2006, said even he was surprised that job creation slumped much earlier than he had expected.
 ''It certainly fits quite firmly with my view that things would slow down sharply in the second half,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''What's accelerated the slowdown, relative to the Fed's expectation and relative to mine, is the spike in oil prices.''
 Higher gasoline prices are expected to pinch consumer spending in areas beyond transportation. The Fed and Mr. Bernanke have been predicting that growth would slow from the annualized pace of 5.3 percent in the first quarter to about 3 percent for the year.
 That would be consistent with hopes for a ''soft landing,'' a return to growth that would be in line with what economists think is the long-run pace of productivity growth.
 Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and chief forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers, predicted that the economy was poised for ''an immediate slowdown'' to an annual rate of 2.5 percent or so in the three months ending June 30. 
 ''As far as slowdowns go, this one is quite benign,'' Mr. Meyer wrote in a note to clients, predicting that unemployment would edge up to about 5 percent by early 2007.
 Mr. Bernanke and the Fed almost certainly remain undecided about whether to pause in raising interest rates at the next policy meeting at the end of June.
 Minutes from the May meeting, when the central bank raised the overnight federal funds rate to 5 percent, its 16th increase in two years, showed that Fed officials were so uncertain that they discussed options ranging from no increase to an increase that would be twice as big as usual.
 Mr. Bernanke has repeatedly insisted that the Fed will base its decisions on incoming economic data. Fed officials are paying close attention to signs that the housing market is cooling, which would reduce the pace of cash-out home refinancings and ultimately consumer spending.
 Mr. Bernanke is under pressure, especially from bond investors, to demonstrate his credibility as an inflation fighter. But as was the case with his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke is unlikely to be persuaded by a single month's worth of data. 
 ''The Fed wants to stop raising rates, but they've got to have enough economic data to justify it,'' said Edward E. Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates in Akron, Ohio. ''It's like painting by numbers.''

CONSUMERS were willing to open their wallets last month, but seem reluctant to do so in the near future. Energy companies, meanwhile, are eager to spend money and are likely to spend a lot more soon. These developments have something in common: energy prices. Gasoline near $3 a gallon and the prospect of high summer air-conditioning bills are spooking many consumers but are exciting energy executives looking to use their cash hoards to buy out rivals.
 Seeking to calm the financial markets, which were rattled by these changes and persistent signs of inflation, President Bush nominated a new Treasury secretary with ample credibility on Wall Street and Capital Hill.

A NEW CAPTAIN -- With the dollar falling and the trade deficit rising, and with tax cuts bumping up against a sizable federal budget deficit, President Bush named Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Wall Street banker, to succeed John W. Snow as Treasury secretary. 
Republicans had long been pushing for a change at Treasury, arguing that Mr. Snow had failed to convince the public that the economy was flourishing. Mr. Paulson, who is chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, is an experienced salesman, and he may be able to use his international experience to persuade China to narrow its trade gap with America.
 Mr. Paulson was a vocal public supporter of the Bush administration's tax cuts, and the president said Mr. Paulson's job would be ''to maintain a pro-growth low-tax environment'' and to work with Congress to restrain spending.
 Mr. Paulson is not expected to face significant opposition at his confirmation hearings.

RINGING REGISTERS -- Retailers posted robust sales in May, led by midmarket chains like J. C. Penney, where sales at stores open at least a year rose 11.1 percent over May 2005. Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's, said sales rose 9.2 percent.
 Some specialty retailers also posted big gains -- Ann Taylor said its sales rose 12 percent -- but others fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Gap, for example, said sales fell 6 percent.
 Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, said sales rose 2.3 percent in the month, less than the 2.9 percent analysts had predicted. Target sales climbed 5.7 percent, beating expectations of a 4.8 percent gain.
 The worst sales news came from domestic carmakers. General Motors was hit particularly hard: its sales tumbled 15.7 percent over last May. The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler said its sales dropped 14 percent. Ford said its sales slipped 1.9 percent.
 To cope with flagging sales, G.M. said it would cut vehicle production in North America by 8.4 percent in the third quarter.

BUT WAIT -- Even as consumers filled stores and malls last month, they were increasingly pessimistic about the economy, which may cause them to scale back buying later in the year, economists said.
 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell in May, after two months of gains. A survey sent to 5,000 homes found shoppers only slightly less optimistic about the economy now, but it noted a sharper decline in expectations about the economy over the next six months.
 Uncertainty about job security and concern about energy prices are the primary reasons for the pessimism, economists said. That analysis was supported by employment numbers, which showed anemic job creation last month. 
 An AP-Ipsos telephone poll of 1,000 adults, meanwhile, found that 70 percent of Americans expect high gasoline prices to cause financial hardship over the next six months. A year ago, only 51 percent of those surveyed said that.
 The Institute for Supply Management released a survey saying that manufacturing output declined in May, extending a four-month slide that reflects weaker orders. At the same time, one survey of factory prices posted its largest rise in eight months, reflecting rising costs for oil and other raw materials. Residential construction also slumped in May.
 Conflicting data is clouding forecasts of whether Federal Reserve policy makers will raise interest rates again at their next two-day meeting, which begins June 28.

ENERGY FRENZY -- Forecasts are clear and upbeat in one area: energy mergers. That was affirmed when a group of investors offered to buy Kinder Morgan, a pipeline company, for $22 billion.
 Kinder Morgan operates about 43,000 miles of pipelines of natural gas, oil, petroleum products and carbon dioxide. It also runs gasoline terminals and distributes natural gas to more than 1.1 million customers. The investors group is led by Richard D. Kinder, who founded the company after leaving Enron in 1996; he already owns 20 percent of its stock. Mr. Kinder said he wanted to take the company private.
 Among all energy-services companies, pipeline operators are particularly attractive because they generate predictable cash flows and are less exposed to unexpected declines in oil or gas prices.
 Kinder Morgan's stock price has already climbed above the buyout offer of $100 a share, suggesting that investors believe a higher bid will come soon.

FRENZY, PART 2 -- The day after investors offered to buy Kinder Morgan, an electrical power company in Georgia started an unsolicited takeover of its own, offering $7.8 billion for a generator based in New Jersey.
 The target company, NRG Energy, rejected the hostile offer from the Mirant Corporation, based in Atlanta, as it had turned aside Mirant's earlier proposal for a friendly merger. Combining the companies would create the country's largest independent power company, with plants mainly in California, Texas, the Middle Atlantic states and the Northeast.
 Mirant's offer follows a string of other utility mergers as companies have been teaming up to offset climbing costs for coal, natural gas and other fuels, and to take advantage of rising electricity prices.
 While NRG dismissed Mirant's offer as inadequate, it did not rule out considering higher offers from Mirant or others.

HEADLINE: High-Profile Investor in Japan Said to Be Under Investigation

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 2 

 BODY:
Yoshiaki Murakami is Japan's answer to Carl C. Icahn, a self-proclaimed corporate raider who struck fear into the heart of corporate boardrooms and became a symbol of the nation's new breed of American-style financial entrepreneurs.
 Now, however, news reports here that Mr. Murakami, 46, is under investigation for suspected insider trading have raised questions about whether these younger upstarts are being punished by Japan's old guard or whether authorities are just cracking down on questionable activities in the resurgent stock market. 
Mr. Murakami would be the second high-profile new investor to come under scrutiny by prosecutors after the arrest in January of the Internet billionaire Takafumi Horie, who has been charged with accounting fraud; his company, Livedoor, was also charged. 
 Speculation has been rife in Tokyo for months about whether Mr. Murakami would be next. Both men had become popular symbols of the more free-wheeling brand of capitalism that has taken root here as market reforms rejuvenated the $4.6 trillion economy and made the Tokyo Stock Exchange one of the world's best-performing markets in recent years. But in the process Mr. Murakami, like Mr. Horie, ran afoul of Japan's insider-run corporate establishment with hard-knuckled American-style tactics like proxy fights and hostile takeover bids.
 Some experts here described Friday's investigation as part of a backlash by Japan's establishment meant to contain recent reforms and discipline upstarts for rocking the boat. They said that the country's recent economic recovery was making the Japanese increasingly reluctant to go farther down the road toward American-style capitalism.
 ''Murakami's focus on shareholders' rights is still hard to accept in Japan,'' said Katsuhiro Miyamoto, an economics professor at Kansai University. ''Japan's just not ready for this yet.''
 Others, however, said that prosecutors were trying to restore order to an unruly stock market that was starting to look like Wall Street in the go-go 1980's. They say that Japan has also been trying to adapt its regulatory system to the more liberalized economy by closing loopholes and tightening oversight.
 They say that since the investigation of Livedoor, admissions by former employees now leave little doubt that the company violated securities laws, though Mr. Horie has insisted he had no knowledge of illegal acts. Prosecutors likely moved against Mr. Murakami only after running across evidence of insider trading during the investigation into Mr. Horie and Livedoor, they say. 
 ''It's still unclear'' what the reported investigation of Mr. Murakami means, said Kenneth Siegel, managing partner in the Tokyo office of the United States law firm of Morrison & Foerster. ''This could be because he was unpopular with regulators or because he just got caught in a tightening of regulation.''
 Japan's national broadcaster and its major newspapers reported that Tokyo prosecutors were questioning employees of Mr. Murakami's company, M&A Consulting, and could soon call in Mr. Murakami himself. The reports said prosecutors were investigating a trade that took place early last year, when Mr. Murakami sold shares of the Nippon Broadcasting System, a radio station, to the Internet portal Livedoor, which was in a takeover battle for control of the broadcaster.
 Prosecutors refused to comment, though the reports appeared to be based on exclusive briefings they give to major domestic news media. No one answered calls to M&A Consulting.
 Unlike the flamboyant Mr. Horie, who drew attention with his spiked hair and T-shirts, Mr. Murakami presented a quieter public image, favoring tailored blue suits and conservative ties.
 But Mr. Murakami also imported the classic tactics of Wall Street's corporate raiders. He bought chunks of companies and then pressed management to reward shareholders by selling off extra assets, buying back stocks and raising dividends. Often, Mr. Murakami sold out for a quick profit before the companies made substantial changes, leading many to regard him as Japan's first homegrown greenmailer.
 ''What I ask investments to do is to make the best use of capital,'' Mr. Murakami said in a 2003 interview published in the daily Nikkei Sangyo. ''This would be common sense in American companies.''
 Like Mr. Icahn in the United States, Mr. Murakami's reputation grew to the point that that he was feared and reviled by Japan's old guard of corporate leadership. On Friday, some chieftains of Japanese industry suggested the reported investigation was giving him his just deserts.
 ''If mergers and acquisitions and investment fund activities don't lift corporate value they will not be well received by society,'' Fujio Mitarai, the president of the camera maker Canon and chairman of the Keidanren business lobby, told reporters on Friday. 
 Mr. Murakami seemed to anticipate legal trouble in May, when he shifted many of the assets from the group of funds that he manages to Singapore. He also appeared to lie low, refusing interview requests.
 Mr. Murakami, who left a prestigious job at the trade ministry in 1999 to start his own investment fund, became a national figure last year when he amassed a $1.2 billion stake in Hanshin Electric Railway, a train and department store operator that also owned one of Japan's most popular professional baseball teams, the Hanshin Tigers. 
 Mr. Murakami then shocked the nation by asking the company to spin off the baseball team as a listed company -- a move widely criticized as bringing Wall Street-style greed to Japan's national pastime.
 ''It is unforgivable,'' a former Tigers coach, Senichi Hoshino, told reporters last month, according to the Yomiuri newspaper. ''There will be hell to pay.''

HEADLINE: Iran Won't Bow to Pressure On Incentives, Leader Says 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran for this article, and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 2 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday defied pressure from foreign leaders to accept a package of incentives in return for ending all nuclear activities, saying Iran will pursue its legal right to develop a peaceful nuclear program. 
 ''Any pressure to deprive our people from their right will not bear any fruit,'' he was quoted as saying on state-run television.
''Their opposition to our program is not because of their concern over the spread of nuclear weapons,'' he said. ''They are worried that Iran would become a model for other independent countries, especially Islamic countries, for access to advanced technology.'' 
 The details of the incentive package -- approved at a meeting of foreign ministers from the United States, Germany, Britain, France, China and Russia in Vienna on Thursday -- have not been made public, but the proposal is expected to be presented to Iran in the coming days. In a statement, the six countries warned that ''further steps'' would be taken by the United Nations Security Council if Iran did not comply, but avoided any mention of sanctions or other specific punitive measures. 
 Diplomats emphasized the unanimity of the major nations in drafting a compromise proposal, and in Vienna on Friday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke of a shared commitment to the offer. ''We also have an alternative path if Iran doesn't negotiate,'' she said.
 But remarks by Russian and British leaders on Friday made it clear that the unanimity extended only to the incentives, not the possible punishments. 
 In an interview with international news agencies at his residence outside Moscow, Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, said his country opposed the use of military force against Iran ''under any circumstances.'' 
 He also ruled out any immediate discussion of sanctions, leaving open the question of whether Russia would ever support punitive action if Iran persists in resisting demands to suspend its uranium enrichment program.
 ''As for sanctions, we think it is a bit too early to put those on the agenda, as well,'' Mr. Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency. ''There needs to be a detailed discussion with the Iranian leadership.''
 In a statement by the Foreign Office, Britain also ruled out the use of military force against Iran. ''All parties are committed to a diplomatic solution,'' the statement said. ''The use of military force was not discussed at all last night. This reflects the fact that military force is not on the agenda.''
 On Friday, the White House dismissed Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks as a ''negotiating position.'' Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the final word over decisions on the country's nuclear program. 
 Highly enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons. Iran has said that it wants to enrich uranium to low levels to use as nuclear fuel at its plants, and that it is entitled to do so under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The United States says it forfeited that right by using its nuclear power program as cover for developing weapons.
 However, Mohammad Saeedi, deputy chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, suggested on Friday that Iran might enrich uranium to higher levels than previously announced.
 Mr. Saeedi said that Iran would not accept a limit on the levels of its uranium enrichment, the ISNA news agency reported.
 ''It is incorrect to put a 3.5, 5 or even a 10 percent cap on Iran's level of uranium enrichment,'' ISNA quoted him as saying. ''Fuel for light water reactors needs uranium enriched to even 19.9 percent.'' 
 ''So, these remarks that Iran should accept a 10 percent cap on its enrichment cannot be correct,'' he added, without elaborating.
 Iran uses a heavy-water program for enriching its uranium and had announced that it would enrich uranium up to 4 percent. Like Russia, China has argued that the best way to win concessions from Iran -- at least at this point -- is with engagement, not sanctions. That shared position effectively shelved any discussion of punitive action by the Security Council, where Russia and China both have veto power.
 Asked if Russia would join in economic sanctions if Iran continued to resist international inspections and demands to suspend its enrichment programs, Mr. Putin said he would not discuss hypothetical questions.
 ''If a grandmother had certain gender characteristics,'' he said, ''she would be a grandfather.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about the official reaction by Iran to incentives offered by foreign leaders to stop all nuclear activities misidentified the nuclear fuel produced by the country's heavy-water program. It is plutonium, not enriched uranium.

HEADLINE: Peru's Voters May Turn to a Tested, and Failed, Leader

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 2 

 BODY:
In his quest for the presidency, Alan Garcia, the front-runner going into the runoff election on Sunday, disparages his opponent's supposed authoritarian streak, his military upbringing and his ties to President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
 But mostly Mr. Garcia is running against the past, namely his own record as president in the 1980's, when his populist policies and inflationary economic program left Peru teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and unchecked terrorist violence.
A shrewd politician and gifted orator, Mr. Garcia, 57, has managed to recast himself as a changed man, a responsible statesman who will guide Peru to prosperity, working with the same multinational lenders and American officials he once excoriated.
 With his lead over Ollanta Humala, 43, a nationalist former army lieutenant colonel, ranging between 6 and 12 points in three opinion polls, Mr. Garcia may be positioned for what would be one of Latin America's most startling political resurrections. 
 ''I don't think there's another political comeback to match this one,'' said Chris Sabatini, who has closely followed Peru's politics in his work as senior director of policy at the Americas Society-Council of the Americas in New York. 
 ''He has engaged in a very carefully crafted comeback strategy,'' Mr. Sabatini added, ''with the mea culpa pitched to his detractors, mainly the business elite, and a real focused coherent strategy to lift up his once dead political career.''
 When elected at 35 in 1985, Mr. Garcia, imposing at 6 feet 3, with a mop of black hair and a message of strident nationalism, instantly became an international darling of the left. He limited foreign debt payments, spoke of uniting Latin America, tried to nationalize the banks and printed money to keep up with inflation. 
 He filled his government with political cronies from his party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, or APRA, which was tightly organized, almost cultlike, around its leader. 
 The results of his five-year term were calamitous: four-digit inflation, food scarcity, a wave of bombings and murders by Shining Path guerrillas and widespread abuses by the army in response.
 In 1992, two years after leaving office, he fled Peru facing corruption charges as President Alberto K. Fujimori's government went after opponents. The charges were later shelved.
 Now, in his second run at the presidency since returning in 2001 from exile in France and Colombia, Mr. Garcia is promising ''responsible change,'' his campaign motto, a renewal that is being closely watched by foreign mining companies worried about their investments and by the Bush administration, which is cautiously optimistic that it would be able to work with a Garcia government.
 ''I admit that I committed errors because I was young, but I have changed,'' Mr. Garcia told reporters recently. ''I am not a fool who would repeat the same things I did before, which did not work. I have learned, and I have matured.''
 He instead pledges to push trade, attract investment and contain inflation. And he promises to offer officials from other parties, even Mr. Humala, a place in his government. ''The APRA has to share power; the APRA has to share government,'' he said Tuesday during a campaign swing in northern Peru.
 Mr. Garcia would not grant an interview. But Jorge del Castillo, a trusted friend and secretary of his party, said Mr. Garcia ''is less dogmatic, less ideological'' than before.
 ''He's more pragmatic, realistic -- he knows the world,'' Mr. del Castillo said in an interview in his office. ''When he was in France he saw how the social democracies worked, and now he's ready for a change.''
 With his powers of persuasion, Mr. Garcia has chipped away at his once dismal reputation. Addressing a rally here on Thursday night, he roamed a stage and enthralled a crowd of thousands for an hour and 15 minutes, without using notes or missing a beat, punctuating the air with an index finger for emphasis. He covered everything from Peru's ancient history to credits for small farmers to the need for rural electrification.
 Today he positions himself closer to the center, less as a leftist and more as the ideological kin of Europe's Social Democrats. But the populist twitch is still perceptible. 
 Mr. Garcia has suggested he would revise contracts with mining companies, while cutting fuel prices and fighting to protect farmers now that Peru has signed a free trade agreement with the United States. He promises cheaper medicine and small-business loans, which analysts say Peru will have difficulty affording. 
 The long food lines of his presidency, he says, are a thing of the past. ''Many people fear Alan Garcia and the APRA for the long lines, but it won't happen,'' he said. ''Our commitment is for a solid and stable economy, without the lines.''
 Mr. Garcia has held steady as the front-runner as Peruvians have remained wary of his opponent, Mr. Humala, who won the first round of voting on April 9 by promising to redistribute the country's wealth. 
 With his vague economic plans and his own close ties to Mr. Chavez, the Venezuelan leftist, Mr. Humala has had trouble gaining support among Lima voters who supported a pro-business candidate, Lourdes Flores, who was eliminated from the race in the first round.
 Though pollsters say there could be a hidden bloc of support for Mr. Humala, particularly in the high Andes, where the people are poorest, many voters there have shifted to Mr. Garcia, even if unhappy about the choice. 
 ''This election is like cancer versus AIDS,'' said Carlos Rios, 47, a business administrator. ''Almost everyone sees it that way. But people think about voting for the lesser evil, the evil you know versus the one you do not.''
 Mr. Rios said he would reluctantly vote for Mr. Garcia, though he remembers all too well how Peruvians needed millions of intis -- the new currency printed by the Garcia administration -- to make simple purchases in the 1980's. 
 Neither do other Peruvians forget the chaos and deprivations of Mr. Garcia's term. 
 David Torres, 24, who was just a boy when Mr. Garcia was in office, recalled constant blackouts and food shortages. Carlos Jose Pereira, 48, an unemployed economist, remembered how the Shining Path detonated bombs regularly. ''You would go out and you did not know if a car bomb would go off, or when terrorism would strike next,'' he said.
 Carlos Reyna, a political analyst who wrote a book about the Garcia presidency, said a new Garcia government would not be belligerent toward Washington, the big multinationals operating in Peru or the International Monetary Fund, all bogeymen of Mr. Garcia's first government. Still, he said, Mr. Garcia retains a semiauthoritarian streak that threatens Peruvian institutions and democratic decorum. 
 To many, though, his opponent, Mr. Humala -- who led a failed coup in 2000 -- is considered even more anti-democratic in his leanings. By comparison, Mr. Garcia has been able to present himself as a moderate. 
 Even so, Mr. Garcia has called for Congress to be dissolved if lawmakers do not take a pay cut, has talked of ''dynamiting'' the Peruvian political system and has called his opponent ''an assassin.'' 
 ''It is the classic populism of a leader who runs over institutions, and in that way Alan has not changed,'' Mr. Reyna said. ''Within the APRA, he is an emperor, not tolerating competitors, not permitting democracy within his own party.''
 But many Peruvians are willing to overlook the past. On a frenzied campaign trail in northern Peru, voters in La Union, after listening to Mr. Garcia give a rousing speech on Tuesday, were ready to forget and forgive.
 ''We all recall the troubles before, but his was a young government, an inexperienced government,'' said Antonio Vaca, 58, a farmer. ''He deserves a second chance, for the reason that he's a man with great experience now, and we think he can give us a very good government.''

HEADLINE: Bond Buyers, Caught in the Narrows of Interest Rates

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
MANY bond investors are feeling besieged. They see inflation on one side of them, a falling dollar on the other, and uncertainty about the Fed's next move directly in front of them. Suddenly, bonds, of all things, are keeping them awake at night.
 It was never supposed to be this way. For many investors, bonds are intended to be boring. After all, financial advisers routinely say that you should hold fixed-income assets to smooth out the rough edges of your stock portfolio -- which is where the real thrills should be.
Of course, some bonds are riskier than others. Historically, the markets have priced in risk, so that bonds from the shakiest creditors have offered much higher yields than Treasury bonds. But that is far from the case now, many bond strategists say, so the more exotic bonds may be no bargain. And if economic storm clouds loomed, such bonds -- which some investors have stocked up on in recent years -- could really tumble. 
 ''The bond markets have suffered from their own irrational exuberance,'' said Tad Rivelle, the chief investment officer at Metropolitan West Asset Management, an investment firm based in Los Angeles that specializes in bonds. Mr. Rivelle said that investors had such a deep hunger for yield a few years ago -- when domestic interest rates were low -- that they bid up high-yield and emerging-markets debt in particular.
 ''Now we find ourselves in an environment where Russian government bonds are only paying 1 percent more than U.S. Treasuries,'' Mr. Rivelle said. ''There is a willingness to embrace some of these markets that borders on recklessness.''
 Even high-grade American corporate bonds are not too compelling now, Mr. Rivelle said. They are yielding about one percentage point more than Treasury bonds of similar duration. In fact, he said, the spreads between the yields on Treasuries and all sorts of bonds are historically narrow.
 By contrast, he said, those dowdy Treasury bonds and their tax-advantaged cousins -- municipal bonds -- may be the best bargains in the fixed-income universe, even if they are not very sexy. ''You don't form a crowd at the cocktail party if you tell people you're buying two-year Treasuries,'' said Mr. Rivelle, who is also a co-manager of Metropolitan West Total Return, an intermediate-term bond fund. In 2005, the fund's return of 3.11 percent topped 95 percent of its peer group, according to Morningstar. The fund has a yield of 5.63 percent and an expense ratio of 0.65 percent. Through Thursday, it has returned an average of 5.03 percent a year over the last five years. 
 Bond yields fall when the underlying bond prices rise. The yields on high-yield corporate bonds, known as junk bonds, and emerging-markets debt have fallen to within an inch of Treasuries as investors have moved money into funds that invest in them. Investors poured $21.4 billion into high-yield bond funds and $5.3 billion into emerging-markets bond funds during the five years through May, according to AMG Data Services.
 Two years of steady rate increases by the Federal Reserve have lifted interest rates on five-year Treasury bonds to more than 5 percent. Many bond strategists say Treasury bonds with expiration dates in the range of two to five years now offer some of the best values in the bond market. 
 John Donohue, chief investment officer in the fixed-income group of J. P. Morgan Asset Management, suggests holding Treasuries in that short-term range. He says that there is a 60 percent chance that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate this month by an additional quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, ''and we think people should still be running short duration until that's more clear.'' But he says he doesn't expect the fed funds rate to go above 5.25 percent this year, as long as the data behaves.
 ''Clearly, if the data surprises on the strong side, particularly the inflation data, then the Fed will raise rates more aggressively in response,'' he said. 
 Most investment strategists recommend holding Treasuries in a tax-deferred account and municipals in a taxable account. In the municipal market, the difference between yields on longer- and shorter-term bonds is greater than for corresponding Treasuries. (In financial jargon, municipal bonds have a steeper yield curve.) So strategists recommend municipal bonds with 5 to 10 years left to maturity.
 But even in the municipal market, investors should not go longer than 5 to 10 years, said Warren D. Pierson, a bond fund manager at Robert W. Baird & Company, which specializes in bond investing. Investors who reach for a little extra yield in munis, Mr. Pierson said, are not being paid enough for the extra risk.
 ''Many investors decide that they want municipal bonds for tax reasons, and then they just look for the highest-yielding muni fund, which tends to be long,'' he said. ''And if you see an uptick in interest rates? Wow, you've lost a lot on the principal.'' 
 Mr. Pierson is a co-manager of the Baird Aggregate Bond fund, which has a yield of 4.47 percent and an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. It has had an average annual return of 5.24 percent over the last five years.
 When it comes to bond investing in a tax-deferred account, Martin J. Mauro, a fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, says he prefers a very diversified portfolio of Treasuries, investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other types of high-grade bonds. If investors want to dabble in high-yield bonds, he recommends limiting them to 5 percent of the bond portfolio within a tax-deferred account.
 Mr. Mauro described high-yield bonds as ''vulnerable'' because the spread on yields between the entire junk bond market and three-month Treasury bills is 3.6 percentage points. ''That's just about the narrowest it's ever been,'' he said.
 But he does not recommend owning any foreign bonds now, not even those from large developed countries like Germany, Japan and Canada. During the dollar's slide this spring, some investment advisers recommended buying short-term foreign bonds from stable countries like those as a way to hedge against the dollar. But Mr. Mauro pointed out that Americans would give up a lot of yield to do so, because most of the government bonds in those countries have lower yields than Treasuries do.
 For instance, he said, an investor who wanted to hedge against further losses in the dollar could buy a one-year German certificate of deposit or a one-year German government bond. But they are yielding about two percentage points less than a one-year Treasury bond. So the dollar would have to decline more than 2 percent from its current level for that investment to begin paying off.
 What's more, many strategists say that while the Federal Reserve is nearly finished raising interest rates, policy makers in Europe and Japan are closer to the beginning of a rate increase cycle. That could benefit those currencies against the dollar but it would also reduce the value of existing European or Japanese bonds.
 SOME investors may wonder whether it is worth wading into the bond markets at all, with the uncertainty over interest rates and inflation. Richard Bernstein, Merrill Lynch's chief domestic strategist, says that too many investors have neglected bonds. He recently reduced his recommendation for bonds to 30 percent from 45 percent of a model portfolio but stressed that this was still among the higher recommended bond allocations on Wall Street. For him, he said, this is a neutral stance on bonds after years of emphasizing them. He advises putting half of one's portfolio into stocks and leaving the other 20 percent in cash. That would shield against some volatility, and leave cash on hand if either stocks or bonds fell, creating a buying opportunity.
 For now, he said, investors should be especially careful. ''There's a huge chance of a whipsaw,'' he said. ''The markets are not trading on fundamentals. They're trading much more on the phraseology of the Fed, and that doesn't give us a lot of confidence in any trend.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Gasoline Prices Got You Down? Do the Hybrid Math'' (The Count, May 20): 
The article included figures that seem to show that hybrid cars are less economical than plain old internal-combustion vehicles at today's gasoline prices, considering the hybrids' initial higher cost. 
 The calculation, however, leaves out the benefit to the planet, community health and the growth of a new economy that includes other sources of energy when more people ''pay more'' to drive hybrids. 
 If you count only the direct economic consequences of driving, you keep getting the same results: more cars, more pollution, more dependence on fossil fuels. It's ''the tragedy of the commons'' -- the overuse of a commonly held resource -- and it has landed us in our current environmental and energy mess. 
 The actions of the individual in society add up to a cumulative impact on the whole. Driving a hybrid isn't just about feeling good. One only has to smell the air near any freeway to know that the commons is real.

DOING NOTHING
 A History of Loafers, Loungers, 
 Slackers, and Bums in America.
 By Tom Lutz.
 363 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
I have often been accused of slacking. When I wrote a weekly humor column, people were always saying to me, ''So . . . you write one column a week?'' They wouldn't come right out and say the rest of what they were thinking, which was: ''And how long does that take you? Two hours a week?'' But I knew.
 What these people failed to understand is that the hard part of writing is not the typing part, but the thinking part. If you were to come into my office, you would most likely see me engaged in some activity that did not appear, to your untrained eye, to be work. You might see me clipping my toenails, or exploring the vast information resources of the Internet, such as the site that tells you what song was No. 1 on the record charts on any given day for the past 60 years. Or you might see me thrashing around with my electric guitar in my futile but ongoing (for nearly four decades) attempt to learn the guitar part to ''Paperback Writer,'' which was No. 1 on my 19th birthday. 
 You'd probably think I was slacking. But you would be wrong. Because while I am engaged in these seemingly pointless activities, I am thinking about a critical writing issue, such as: Which is a funnier-sounding mineral name, feldspar or potash? It takes hours of grueling mental effort to solve that kind of problem, but you, the reader, see only the finished product (feldspar).
 Another example is the Federal Reserve Board. It doesn't appear to do much. Every six months or so, it raises or lowers the prime interest rate by maybe a quarter of a percent. You think: How hard can that be? You could do that without ever leaving the golf course! Yet if you asked the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, I bet they'd tell you it's a lot of work.
 I suspect that most people -- like me and the Federal Reserve Board -- think they work pretty hard. But it isn't always easy to tell the difference between working and slacking, especially in the modern American ''information'' economy, where relatively few people do anything that is inarguably work, such as going down into a coal mine and coming back up with pieces of actual coal. A lot of us would have to admit that if we skipped a day or two of ''work,'' or even a couple of months, or maybe even three or four years, we might miss our paychecks, but the impact on society would be minimal, or in the case of some professions (consultants, editorial writers, Paris Hilton) nonexistent.
 So the question is: What is work? Why do we work? Is it a moral duty, or do we do it only because we have to? Is it O.K. to not work if we can get away with it? Do we resent those who are able to slack? Or do we envy them?
 These are some of the questions that Tom Lutz, a thoughtful and very thorough author, tackles in his book ''Doing Nothing.'' Lutz was inspired to write it by his 18-year-old son, Cody, who decided to take a year off before starting college, and seemed content to spend his time lying on Lutz's couch watching TV. Lutz found that his son's behavior angered him, and this anger troubled him, because in his own youth he had spent a fair number of years engaged in countercultural activities not widely considered productive. (Raise your hands, all you boomer parents who can relate. I myself am typing this one-handed.)
 Lutz's anger spurred him to action: ''I started to write this book at least in part to understand my ire as I watched my son do what I had seen him (and myself) do many times before: he was doing nothing.''
 And so Lutz set out to trace the history of society's attitudes toward working and slacking. He begins with two 18th-century giants who professed opposite views. On one side stands Benjamin Franklin, creator of the archetypal workaholic, Poor Richard, who believes man has a moral duty to waste not a single moment in the relentless effort to accumulate wealth. On the other side stands Samuel Johnson, creator of the ''Idler,'' who believes the only value of work is to enable leisure, and the highest calling is to do as little as possible.
 These two contrasting views of work, Lutz shows, have remained with us across the centuries. In America, Franklin's work ethic has always dominated, but the slacker undercurrent has always been there, and has always resonated with the public. Much of Lutz's book is a survey of the many incarnations of the slacker in popular culture -- from Bartleby the Scrivener to Bart Simpson, with all the bohemians and beatniks, hobos and hippies in between. What Lutz finds, over and over (and over) is that slackers and workaholics aren't always as different as they appear. Ben Franklin, it turns out, was a party animal who was often neither early to bed nor early to rise. Samuel Johnson, for all his praise of idling, was an immensely productive writer -- and writing is hard work, as we have established (feldspar).
 Lutz concludes that most of us are both workaholic and slacker -- ''we all tend to embody a bit of both ends of the spectrum.'' We feel we work too hard, but also that we fritter away much of our time. We scorn the lazy and unproductive, but we long to win the lottery so we can hit the hammock ourselves. We criticize our kids for doing exactly what we did when we were their age.
 In the end, Lutz says, we need slackers, who serve ''as a goad to examining our relation to work, as a role to adopt while finding our relation to work, as a critique of our culture's twisty relation to work and to leisure, and as a celebration of the same.'' Lutz's own son, he informs us, finally got off the sofa and went to work. Lutz himself declares at the end that, after all his hard work producing ''Doing Nothing,'' he plans to take some time off.
 My one complaint, as a reader, is that maybe Lutz worked a little too hard on his book. He includes a 34-page bibliography, which lists many dozens of references, and there are times when you get the impression that Lutz wants to make sure you know he read every one. There are too many passages that are little more than uninformative lists, such as this one, on the literature of sauntering:
 ''Leigh Hunt published 'A Saunter Through the West End' in 1861. Charles Dudley Warner, Samuel Clemens's co-author, published a collection of his 'Saunterings' in 1872. A book on 'sauntering' through the resorts in Nebraska, Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah was published in 1879, and there were many others in the years that followed, including 'Saunterings in New England' (1883), 'South-Coast Saunterings in England' (1870), 'A Saunter in Belgium,' (1885) and 'A Sauntering in Spain' (1906).''
 Such tedious sections aside, there's plenty of interesting reading in ''Doing Nothing,'' which left me with a deeper appreciation for the value of not working. In fact, I wish I could do more of it. Alas, I cannot: these toenails aren't going to clip themselves.

HEADLINE: The Secret Ingredient

BYLINE: By Michael Ruhlman. 
Michael Ruhlman is a freelance writer. His most recent book, ''The Reach of a Chef,'' was published in May by Viking.

 BODY:
Over the past few years, Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine, has been slowly expanding his portfolio, first opening Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro and more recently the retail business Artisanal Premium Cheese. Like many chefs who are thinking big, Brennan has lots of ideas about what to do next but neither the time nor the connections to put them in place, so he hired the one man who he felt could: Adam Block. He said he hoped that Block, the deal maker who helped create the template for the celebrity-chef contract that transformed Las Vegas into a dining oasis and brought Thomas Keller, the chef and owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., to New York, could tell him what to do. Not that Brennan is used to being told what to do. 
The two met earlier this spring in Brennan's office, far from any kitchen. Brennan, dressed in a pinstripe suit, had just returned from Chicago, where he was considering opening more bistros. Block started by conveying the, well, infelicity of this move (with new clients, he said, ''a little bit of an education'' is required) and to impress upon Brennan the importance of establishing a ''core brand'' in New York. Block said he believed that Brennan could open four bistros in the city without ''cannibalizing'' himself, and noted that five was the magic number that could bring buyout money, serious cash. The tricky part, Block said, ''is how to grow something that represents the philosophy and the product, and how to do it without compromising too much.'' He paused for emphasis and warned Brennan: ''It's hard to be all things to all people, as you once were. What you're creating is an iteration of the original. With growth, something is always compromised.''
 Brennan absorbed the information poker-faced. By the end of the meeting, he was swayed, although not convinced. As star chefs proliferate in the $500-billion-a-year restaurant industry, more and more of them need the business acumen of someone like Block to bring their work to the masses. Although not well known even within the food world, Block is influencing the shape of name-brand dining in this country.
 Born in Chicago, Block, 46, began his restaurant career 20 years ago as a consultant -- reviewing operational overviews, finances, concepts and check averages and suggesting ways restaurants could be more profitable -- in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the early 1990's, as chefs rose to new heights, he stepped in to help them leverage their fame into lucrative contracts. Through the word of mouth that followed extraordinary deals for marquee chefs, Block has fashioned a career that resembles star-athlete management. While his job description seems to be continuously evolving, his main role remains that of an agent who can fit talent with golden opportunity, the alchemist who can help chefs make big money.
 Beginning in 1992 with Paul Bertolli, the former Chez Panisse chef, (Block helped negotiate a partnership with the stagnant restaurant Oliveto, to which Bertolli would bring prosperity and national acclaim), he went on to work with such culinary lights as Alice Waters, Jean-Louis Palladin, Laurent Gras, Guenter Seeger and Eric Ripert. He negotiated the first celebrity-chef management contract in 1994, a deal with the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that gave the chef Charlie Trotter a free restaurant, a six-figure signing bonus and a percentage of sales or commensurate salary for the next 10 years (even if the restaurant closed, which it did after 15 months), a financial windfall for Trotter. All of this was unheard of in an industry where a chef who earned $150,000 a year was doing well.
 This was the first deal in Las Vegas in which the chef had no ownership in a restaurant with his brand name on it, perhaps the first one conceived not to turn a profit but rather as an amenity for high rollers. ''I was pulling numbers out of the air,'' Block admits now. Nevertheless, it provided a formula for chefs and hoteliers and the impending Las Vegas chef bonanza.
 In today's restaurant-management contracts, a marquee chef is typically paid 3 to 5 percent of sales in return for opening the restaurant and spending as little as two weeks a year there; in Las Vegas, such a restaurant brings in between $10 million and $18 million annually, netting the chef between $300,000 and $900,000, an enticing secondary income, with the promise of a percentage of the profits if the restaurant succeeds.
 Block's current projects have taken him around the world -- from London (meeting with Terence Conran) to Bora Bora (with Trotter to consider the St. Regis Hotel there) to Singapore (he's marshaling an international group of celebrity chefs for a new hotel project) to his backyard, north of Oakland (where he negotiated Bertolli's exit contract from Oliveto), after which he returned to New York to help open a restaurant at the Carlton Hotel and explore other available real estate for Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef of Town, and the restaurateur Jonathan Morr.
 Block raises the act of taking a meeting to athletic proportions -- crunching numbers, reading contracts as others talk and arguing his points, sometimes it seems all at once -- but with Brennan, Block was subdued, finessing the chef, getting a sense not of his business goals but of how these goals fitted into Brennan's life as a whole.
 Brennan was anxious to get something started. ''I'm most happy when I'm building something,'' he told Block. Noting that bad deals are simple to pull together, Block told Brennan: ''One of my main jobs is to keep my clients from making mistakes. It's really hard to do a good deal.''
 ''Terrance is in the infancy of his brand,'' Block told me later, adding that he liked the intelligence of Brennan's focus: his bistro -- a simple concept that can be efficiently duplicated or, in industry jargon, rolled out -- and a good retail product: hand-made cheese. Brennan ''needs to build his core in New York first,'' he went on to say, ''because of the economies of scale there, and he understands the market and people know him.''
 Block knows the New York market well. He was the prime mover of one of the highest-profile restaurant conglomerations in recent memory, the Time Warner Restaurant Collection, negotiating the deals of four of the original five restaurants with the co-developer, the Related Companies.
 At first, Block dismissed the Time Warner Center out of hand for a client, the New York chef Gray Kunz, because it lacked street access, but when Thomas Keller -- also a client at the time -- asked Block to consider it, Block realized that if he could finesse the right kind of deal for the chef-owner of the French Laundry, it could be worth Keller's while, not to mention make him the linchpin restaurateur for the developer.
 With Keller attached, the project became appealing to other big-draw chefs. Block asked Keller whom he wanted in the center. He said Masa Takayama, the country's best-known sushi chef. Thus Block not only became Takayama's negotiator but also helped raise money, hired a design team and, in the middle of construction, secured a collateral-free bank loan for what would become the four-star restaurant Masa. (The chef pays off the balance of Block's fee shrewdly: in meals.) With Keller and Takayama in the group, as well as Jean-Georges Vongerichten (who was brought in by the Related Companies), Block said he felt it was now feasible to bring in Trotter and Kunz, who'd been in the culinary desert for years after leaving Lespinasse.
 ''He'll customize the needs or desires of the chef with what the circumstances are,'' Trotter said. ''He'll mesh the two together. It's really incredible. He works on everything from making a deal happen to arranging for financing if that's desired. There's no one who does exactly what he does.''
 Professionally, Adam Block is a one-man band. He recently bought a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea but does not have a New York office. He logs more than 200,000 miles a year on airplanes. He's a knot of contradictions: a pugnacious negotiator who wears his heart on his sleeve; a behind-the-scenes operator who heretofore shunned the press yet is starved for acknowledgment of his successes.
 ''Everyone has a gift,'' Block told me. ''And my gift is my ability to be able to read how people think on both sides of the table.'' His clients are sometimes hotel operators who want chefs and sometimes chefs who want restaurant deals. ''I'm not speculating, I'm telling you the way it is,'' he says, adding, ''I know how far I can push each side when I'm negotiating.''
 But it's exactly this advantage that has compromised the confidence of some of his clients -- most important, Keller. (Full disclosure: I worked closely with Keller on his two cookbooks.) In 2005, after six years as a member of Keller's inner circle of advisers and as a personal friend, Block was out. Questions had been raised about how well he represented Keller's interests in Bouchon Las Vegas and in Per Se. Block remains bitter about the divorce.
 The suggestion that he had a conflict of interest -- Block worked for both Keller and the Venetian Hotel, an owner of Keller's Bouchon -- is especially frustrating for Block. ''They can't have it both ways,'' he says. ''They can't get the benefits of my relationships and doing deals for them that they want, through the relationships I have, and then complain that I have these relationships.''
 The break with Keller, friction with other high-profile chefs and the termination of Charlie Trotter's restaurant project in the Time Warner Center due to disagreements between the chef and the developer have left him disenchanted both with his role as middleman between developer and celebrity chef and with his income. This is why he has recently become a partner with a chef in opening a restaurant.
 Initially hired by the Carlton Hotel in New York to lure a big name to its restaurant space, Block has become an investor with Zakarian and Morr in the resulting restaurant, Country. Putting his own expertise to work for him is a way for Block to earn more than his $500-an-hour fee (he does not receive a commission on his deals, and claims to feel often like the uninvited guest after the papers are signed). Echoing his own advice to Brennan, Block is also working with Zakarian and Morr on a simple concept, opening a burger restaurant in the East Village modeled after Morr's Manhattan noodle house, Republic -- the kind of restaurant they could ''reiterate'' in New York, Las Vegas and beyond. Their plans reflect what many successful high-end chefs are doing: simplifying their work in order to sell it to more people, creating their pret-a-porter line.
 Fewer and fewer chefs, it seems, strive to be the single-restaurant artist-monk. ''I don't want to just stay in one kitchen,'' Zakarian said on the opening day of Country, dressed in street clothes while tasting dishes brought to him by a sous-chef. ''I have way more interests than just cooking.'' He continued, ''There are so many ways to enjoy this metier'' -- everything from multiple books to opening a boutique cooking school to developing kitchen products to designing kitchens for other chefs and operators.
 ''What I think is going to change,'' Block predicts, surveying the celebrity chef landscape, ''is that people are going to become less and less caring about who's the chef, and more and more caring about how it is done and what the food is actually like.'' He thus urges his clients to create what he calls an ''esoteric brand,'' a restaurant that is associated with the chef but that doesn't require his name on the shingle or his presence in the shop. Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro, for instance. Brennan, education complete, decided that opening in Chicago was in fact felicitous, and he has also found real estate on Manhattan's Upper West Side for his bistro's second location.
 What's on the horizon for Block may be the ultimate reflection of top chefs' simplifying their work. Robert Goldstein, the president of the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, has put Block in charge of developing an 18,000-square-foot food hall, inspired by markets like San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market, for a new Las Vegas hotel and casino, the Palazzo. Featuring high-quality food at low prices -- in effect, a Slow Food court -- it is scheduled to open in fall 2007.
 ''We're trying to combine art and commerce in a way that's never been done before,'' Goldstein says. ''Great food on a mass scale.'' Goldstein says he is hoping to see, for instance, shops selling Emeril Lagasse's po' boys, Mario Batali's pizza and Thomas Keller's oysters -- a challenge Block is perfectly poised to choreograph.
 If the idea works in Las Vegas, Block says he hopes to replicate it throughout the country, a portentous ambition: star chefs setting up in the food courts of America's malls, with Adam Block quietly leading the way.

 BODY:
AIN'T GOT NO CIGARETTES: Memories of Music Legend Roger Miller. By Lyle E. Style. (Great Plains Publications, paper, $19.95.) When you've got a name like Lyle E. Style, your only career options are playing point guard for the Kentucky Colonels circa 1973 or chronicling country music, and readers should be grateful that Style has chosen the latter path. In this collection of Q. and A.'s with dozens of illustrious country artists and fixtures of the Nashville scene, he ostensibly recounts the life of the musician and raconteur Roger Miller, of ''King of the Road'' and ''Dang Me'' fame, who died of cancer in 1992. But through a quirk of deliberate or accidental genius, what Style has actually assembled is a living document of country music in its hootin', hollerin' outlaw heyday, when the D.J. Captain Midnight ruled the airwaves, Tootsie's Orchid Lounge was the ultimate hangout and everyone, it seems, was on cocaine -- even the mimes. Along the way, Style learns some unprescribed uses for diet pills, discovers that Miller's King of the Road Hotel may have been owned by the mob and reignites an old feud between Tompall Glaser and Waylon Jennings. 
As Mel Tillis says, ''they're all characters or they wouldn't be in the business.'' Dave Itzkoff
HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles. By Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey. (Gotham, $26.) More than four decades after beginning his career as an assistant to the Beatles' producer George Martin, Emerick, an engineer and producer, finally adds his account of the legendary recording sessions in which he participated. He declines to speculate beyond what he did or observed, making the book more a companion volume to Mark Lewisohn's log, ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions,'' than a splashy tell-all. But that works in Emerick's favor, since he was the idea man behind several engineering experiments cooked up in the mid-60's to meet the Beatles' expanding notions of sonic possibility. Because his speculations stop at the studio door, it's fortunate that lots of craziness happened inside those walls -- from the hormonal rush of recording ''She Loves You'' while scores of female fans besieged the building to Yoko Ono reclining in a sickbed as the band recorded ''Maxwell's Silver Hammer,'' a song John Lennon called ''just more of Paul's granny music.'' Emerick recalls recruiting every spare tape machine in the building to overlay loops in ''Tomorrow Never Knows,'' and turning loudspeakers into microphones with reversed currents to approximate a Motown bass sound on ''Paperback Writer.'' The kindred studio geek Paul McCartney gets lots of smooches, but the anecdotes about Lennon's love-hate relationship with technology are the most amusing. Even for non-techie fans, reading about the assembly of the noise-wash finale of ''A Day in the Life'' will send you back to the vinyl for a fresh listen. Laura Sinagra
 THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: The Making of the Pink Floyd Masterpiece. By John Harris. (Da Capo, $24.95.) At last, the 1973 prog-rock epic that spent a mind-boggling 724 weeks on the Billboard album charts, facilitated the sale of countless black-light posters and inspired a few misguided screenings of ''The Wizard of Oz'' gets a biography of its own. Of course, Harris's compact but enlightening volume also recounts the history of the band that made it, with an emphasis on the founding Pink Floyd songwriter, Syd Barrett, the drug casualty who was cut from the roster after the group's first album and whose psychedelic sensibility, the author argues, was the polar opposite of what ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was intended to embody. These kinds of books tend to be unabashed love letters stitched together with recycled quotations. But to his credit, Harris, a British music journalist, has conducted his own interviews with Pink Floyd's available members and writes with healthy skepticism about the band's formative work. Still, it feels as if he's stacking the deck in favor of his conclusion that ''Dark Side'' is a ''masterpiece.'' Couldn't it also be a portrait of a band that was fruitlessly trying to reproduce its earliest successes -- and that condemned rock 'n' roll to a slow death by increasingly bloated concert spectacles? D.I.
 EVERYTHING I'M CRACKED UP TO BE: A Rock & Roll Fairy Tale. By Jen Trynin. (Harcourt, $23.) Back in the mid-1990's, when female-fronted bands like the Breeders, Belly and Hole were still getting play on the radio, Trynin, a Boston musician, was a record-company-bidding-war baby. Her minor 1995 hit, ''Better Than Nothing,'' featuring the memorable opening line ''Maybe we could talk in the shower,'' prefigured the sexual brashness that would soon catapult the more poetic Alanis Morissette to greater fame. In this memoir, Trynin's breathless recollection of whirlwind corporate courtship provides a glimpse into a recording industry desperate for trends and quick fixes. Getting through her prose requires some tolerance for hokeyness; the figures populating Trynin's remembrances are affixed with cutesy pseudonyms like ''Preppy Boy,'' and they do things like ''crack wise.'' But there's something refreshing about the way she embraces the anachronistically uncool. It's not everyone who would admit to talking to her mirror, or answering a Warner Brothers executive's lament that he ''just flew in from L.A.'' with a nervous ''And boy are your arms tired.'' For indie-rock fans, her blushing, eager encounters with label bigwigs will be a turnoff, but this blithe willingness to play the game is what makes her story different from the standard indie-band grousing. And her abrupt abandonment when Morissette arrives on the scene underscores the reality that there are only so many major-label slots available to women. Somebody decided that the pop world wasn't big enough for both of them. L.S.
 QUEENS REIGNS SUPREME: Fat Cat, 50 Cent, and the Rise of the Hip-Hop Hustler. By Ethan Brown. (Anchor, paper, $12.95.) Published shortly before the record executive Irv Gotti (a k a Irv Lorenzo of Hollis, Queens) was acquitted of money-laundering charges, Brown's book opens with a scene in Gotti's office that seems to suggest he will be found guilty. The history lessons that follow, about the Queens neighborhoods that yielded generations of drug kingpins as well as hip-hop stars from Run-DMC to 50 Cent, are thoroughly reported but presented in a bland police-blotter style, and some of the most explosive claims feel tenuous: the author's statement, for example, that the slain rapper Jam Master Jay was selling cocaine in the final years of his life is substantiated by ''a source'' with a drug-dealing history of his own. And sloppiness abounds: in one instance, Brown, a journalist, apparently gives away the identity of the triggerman who shot 50 Cent nine times -- three pages before he is introduced as a character in the book. Like the government's case against Irv Gotti, Brown's story offers many tantalizing possibilities, but it's ultimately unpersuasive. D.I.
 BIGGIE: Voletta Wallace Remembers Her Son. By Voletta Wallace with Tremell McKenzie. (Atria, $29.95.) If you watched the Lil' Kim reality show ''Countdown to Lockdown'' and agree that the rap diva's pre-jail kvetching was perhaps not her at her best, add to her woes the whupping she gets in ''Biggie.'' Wallace, the outspoken mother of the slain rapper Christopher Wallace (a k a Biggie Smalls, a k a Notorious B.I.G.), has some choice words for Kim and a few of her son's other supposed close friends. Printed in that trendy, distracting mishmash of font sizes, ''Biggie'' combines fragmented recollection, insistent motherly praise and sporadic riffs on moral rectitude. Wallace's knowledge of her son's early musical development is limited to the sound of muffled beats issuing from his room as he cobbled early raps, and she admits to knowing little about his life once he started spending more time on Brooklyn street corners than in her apartment. More fascinating here is Wallace's tale of her own emigration from Jamaica and acclimation to life in America. This isn't the place to look for insight into Biggie's art, his fame or the events leading up to his death in 1997. Speculation about the details of his murder is cautious and brief, as the turbulent investigation, made all the more dramatic by Wallace's own lawsuit alleging police involvement, continues in Los Angeles. But there is no such caution on the subject of personal loyalty. When a fit of pique overtakes the author, we get some juicy smack-downs of Sean Combs, Lil' Kim and the rapper Lil' Cease, whose bail Wallace says she once paid, only to hear him on the radio thanking Jay-Z for the favor. This late burst captures Wallace's fierceness, making you wish that this plucky, opinionated woman could have found her public voice through her son's success rather than his untimely death. L.S.
 CHASIN' THE BIRD: The Life and Legacy of Charlie Parker. By Brian Priestley. (Oxford University, $28.) This examination of the career of the revolutionary bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker is hardly the first such work in its field, but what recommends it is its sense of economy: with just 138 pages of Priestley's book dedicated to the life story of its subject (a 60-page discography is also included), ''Chasin' the Bird'' sees the precocious Parker using heroin for the first time on Page 20, recording ''Night in Tunisia'' on Page 53 and dying of a heart attack in 1955 on Page 105. The book is also well served by the breadth of Priestley's musical knowledge and his tenacious desire for accuracy: if you cribbed your main riff for ''Salt Peanuts'' from Louis Armstrong's ''I'm a Ding Dong Daddy,'' or if the only confirmation of your father's true age and birthplace appears on the 1930 census, rest assured that the author won't let you forget it. Though Priestley's discussion of Parker's technique is occasionally impenetrable, he also sometimes writes with flashes of humor (on the saxophonist Lester Young: ''In Charlie's eyes, he was like a god -- a god who sometimes reached over and passed him the marijuana cigarettes''). Easily enjoyed in a single sitting, with your favorite Parker record, in a smoke-free environment, if possible. D.I.
 STARING AT SOUND: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips. By Jim DeRogatis. (Broadway, paper, $14.95.) With some rock band biographies, back story is just something to skim en route to later fame-induced decadence. With Oklahoma's Flaming Lips, it's quite the opposite. DeRogatis, the pop music critic for The Chicago Sun-Times and the author of a biography of Lester Bangs, does a nice job rendering the 60's and 70's cultural dust bowl that produced these alt-rock lifers. Whether you find the Flaming Lips' noisy excursions and psychedelically embellished melodies endearing or a bit grandiose, their leader, Wayne Coyne, emerges in ''Staring at Sound'' as a fascinating character: a mid-American mix of organic capitalist, badgering colloquist and charismatic quester. DeRogatis's account of the band's early road-warrior touring echoes the D.I.Y. pattern of any band crisscrossing the country during the all-ages-club heyday of the late 80's. But his focus on Coyne results in lots of pithy quotations from a guy who had his hometown scene wired from Day 1. With an audience initially made up of Coyne's own working-class family, the Lips moved on to a large and loyal following that still comes to shows assured of big melodies, swirling guitars, bubbles, bear suits and other trip-friendly spectacles. L.S.
 I'LL TAKE YOU THERE: Pop Music and the Urge for Transcendence. By Bill Friskics-Warren. (Continuum, $24.95.) What if the last half-century's worth of rock, hip-hop and R & B songs that urged listeners to move on up, dig me out and let's get it on was not merely an attempt to sell records to teenagers but an expression of a genuine desire to connect with something beyond human experience? As a former lecturer at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Friskics-Warren seems to be the ideal author to tease out this theory from the music, lyrics and personal histories of such perennial critical fetishes as Van Morrison and U2, as well as less obvious candidates like Public Enemy and Joy Division. The problem is that Friskics-Warren sees transcendence everywhere, from Kathleen Hanna's career as a stripper to P.M. Dawn's appropriation of the Harry Nilsson song ''Coconut.'' And despite his passion for the material, his coldly academic prose is as tedious as a term paper. (''Still, there remains a hermeneutic of disruption in Eminem's music, an ill intentionality that, even at his most egregious, is hard to dismiss.'') Even if his hypothesis were true, a roundup of one's favorite musicians is no more an argument than a record collection is a book. D.I.
 ECHO AND REVERB: Fabricating Space in Popular Music Recording, 1900-1960. By Peter Doyle. (Wesleyan University, cloth, $65; paper, $24.95.) Doyle, an Australian crime novelist and musician, brings a voraciously catholic sensibility to this study of ''created'' sonic space. Floating freely through the disciplines of music recording, film sound design and semiotics, as well as lived experience, he takes up the question of what ''space'' has meant to us over time, and how recordings manipulate assumptions about escape, adventure, pleasure, the idealized outside, the comfortably intimate, the dangerous other and the imagined past. His book stops just before the Beatles and others revolutionized pop recording by rejecting the pursuit of ''authentic'' sound and at times willfully courting the ''depthlessness'' that Doyle says characterized the technologically limited recordings of the 1920's. ''Echo and Reverb'' is filled with interesting tidbits, like the guitarist Ry Cooder's claim that Robert Johnson's famously antisocial decision to face a corner while recording was really an attempt to capture the sonic power of sound waves knocking off perpendicular walls. Exploring the interplay between Hollywood film sound and West Coast musical recordings, Doyle traces the lineages of both a fabricated ''Hawaii'' and sonic signposts connoting the American West. Refreshingly, in the midst of linking Sun Records' and Chess Studios' use of reverb to ideas of male mobility and virility, he looks at the ways the technique rendered more subversive the work of Patsy Cline, Wanda Jackson and Big Maybelle. His ideas about artists turning ''fleetingly occupied, briefly deterritorialized affective zones'' into power lend themselves well to thinking about the current era of sonic pastiche, when sampling and superimposition create hybrid places and so deftly mimic the processes of association and memory. L.S.
 CLASSIC AMERICAN POPULAR SONG: The Second Half-Century, 1950-2000. By David Jenness and Don Velsey. (Routledge, $34.95.) Would ''American Idol'' still be a cultural juggernaut if contestants were asked to perform ''mysterious but recognizable amalgams of melody, words, harmony, all moving together in time''? In this unofficial but equally pioneering companion volume to Alec Wilder's 1972 survey, ''American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900-1950,'' Jenness and Velsey grasp how difficultit is to define a popular song, a task that takes up the first two chapters of their book. But once they set their semantic questions aside, these musical historians reveal themselves to be critics of estimable clarity and candor, wit and heart. To their ears, Irving Berlin's ''Falling Out of Love Can Be Fun'' possesses ''a sexual innuendo sort of like your Uncle Charlie's kind of humor,'' and when Cole Porter wrote ''Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking,'' he ''must have been on some great medication or thinking of Beatrice Lillie.'' And their musical worldview is generous enough to include not just Richard Rodgers, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, but also Tom Waits, the ''Sesame Street'' composer Joe Raposo and even Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields. It's a shame the book ends when it does -- who knows what Jenness and Velsey would have had to say about Jack White, Chan Marshall and Jay-Z? D.I.

HEADLINE: THE POPULIST AT THE BORDER

BYLINE: By David Rieff. 
David Rieff, a contributing writer, has reported for the magazine in recent years from Iraq, Bolivia and the West Bank.

 BODY:
In the richer neighborhoods of Mexico City, armored S.U.V.'s and sedans have become almost commonplace. A decade ago, the only people driving around the city in armored passenger cars were members of Mexico's established business oligarchy -- families like the Slims and the Azcarragas, who have long played a leading role in the country's politics as well as its economy. But now the custom has percolated down from the superrich to the merely well heeled. And with good reason: in recent years Mexico's sprawling capital has become one of the most dangerous cities in the world for the poor and the prosperous alike. ''People here lead gated lives'' was the way one acquaintance recently put it to me. 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was the mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 during the great upward spike in crime, is now running in next month's elections as the presidential candidate of the left-wing P.R.D. (Party of the Democratic Revolution). Yet the city's problems -- the increasing dereliction of its physical infrastructure as well as the deterioration of personal security -- seem to have done nothing to dent his enormous popularity among residents of Mexico City and, more widely, among Mexico's poor. To them, he is a hero, the man who as mayor provided desperately needed pensions for the elderly and who tried, at long last, to address Mexico City's traffic gridlock by adding a second level of roadways to the major highways in the capital. When he left office last year, polls showed that more than 80 percent of the city's residents approved of the job that he had done, an unprecedented level of support for a Mexico City mayor. 
 His supporters also seem untroubled by the scandals that punctuated his tenure as mayor. His finance chief, Gustavo Ponce, who was often spotted at the casino at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, was accused of involvement in the disappearance of $3 million of municipal funds, while Lopez Obrador's erstwhile personal secretary and close adviser, Rene Bejarano, was caught on videotape accepting $45,000 from a Mexico City businessman (bribery charges were later dropped). Lopez Obrador suffered no political damage. If anything, his supporters tended to see in these scandals efforts by Lopez Obrador's enemies -- in the business establishment and in the Mexican federal government -- to discredit him.
 Lopez Obrador, who is 53, has often seemed to share his followers' paranoia. When the Ponce and the Bejarano scandals broke -- the latter revealed on the TV program of the Mexican journalist Victor Trujillo, who used to present his spiciest revelations dressed as a clown named Brozo -- Lopez Obrador cried conspiracy. Only later did he backtrack to the position that he had known nothing about what his close aides were up to. He has a point, though, when he says that he has been a target of political adversaries who often use questionable methods. In 2004, for example, he was charged with a misdemeanor for ignoring a court order during a land dispute while he was mayor; under Mexico's convoluted election law, that could have barred him from further involvement in politics. The basis for the charge was flimsy at best, but his enemies hoped it might forestall a presidential run by Lopez Obrador, which even then seemed almost inevitable. The accusation provoked mass citizen rallies in support of Lopez Obrador, which effectively forced the authorities to bring the investigation to a premature and inconclusive close. 
 The devotion that Mexico's poor display for Lopez Obrador, whether merited or not, is one of the principal facts of Mexican politics today. Most of Mexico's underprivileged, who make up nearly half the country's population, believe that Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, has led to hardship rather than to the prosperity they were promised, and these voters view Lopez Obrador almost as a Messianic figure, a savior. 
 There is a populist groundswell in Latin America at the present moment, and it has swept into power a new generation of leaders, including Nestor Kirchner in Argentina, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. For all the differences among these figures, the thread that binds them is a bitter disenchantment with the fruits of globalization and a rising hostility to what, in Latin America, is usually derided as neoliberalism. In some cases, notably that of Hugo Chavez, this discontent has largely found its expression through anti-American vitriol. But there are variants -- Kirchner in Argentina is an obvious example -- in which Washington plays a secondary role and in which the real animus is toward local elites who, according to the populist indictment, are to blame for their countries' poverty. 
 Lopez Obrador is the latest and, because of Mexico's political, strategic and economic position, arguably the most significant of all the new Latin American populists. If he succeeds in his presidential bid -- a very big ''if'' as the July 2 elections draw nearer -- his victory would cap one of the most important global developments of the past five years: the rapid ascension to power of the left in Latin America. Already it is clear that a serious challenge has arisen to the norms of the modern globalized economy. Even if Lopez Obrador loses, the leftist tide is unlikely to begin to recede anytime soon. Both candidates in the second round of Peru's presidential election were left of center, and in Ecuador, populist policies are increasingly taking hold. But whether Mexican voters realize it or not, their decision on July 2 will serve as a kind of referendum on how far this revolt is going to go. Will it turn out, in retrospect, to have been just a few rogue Latin American countries challenging the global system? Or is this a rebellion that will stretch all the way to the Rio Grande?
 Thus the stakes in the Mexican presidential elections are very high, not only for Mexico but for the United States as well. The opening up of the once largely closed Mexican economy has been touted as a great Latin American success story in both Mexico and the United States: the peso is stable, agricultural exports are up and foreign investment is booming. But Lopez Obrador is challenging that story. In fact, he insists, the model has not worked, and he vows that if he is elected, he will pursue a very different set of policies, ones that serve the poor rather than the rich. 
 As the Mexican historian Enrique Krauze has pointed out, Lopez Obrador's emphasis on his loyalty to the poor connects him, in the mind of much of the Mexican general public, to ''the core ideals of the Mexican Revolution.'' It is common at campaign rallies to see people holding placards with slogans like ''Lopez Obrador: For all Mexicans, but first for the humble'' and ''They will not rob us of our dreams.''
 To his supporters, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, or AMLO, as he is popularly known, is simply doing his patriotic duty by running for president, shouldering a necessary burden. To his detractors, he is a politician with a Messiah complex. He wants to push Mexico back 30 years, they say, into the era of President Luis Echeverria, who played upon the left-wing, populist founding traditions of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party). The PRI ruled Mexico unchallenged from the 1920's until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the right-wing PAN (National Action Party) was elected president. Echeverria made extraordinary promises to the poor, just as Lopez Obrador is doing, and in trying to carry them out, he almost bankrupted the country. Those who oppose Lopez Obrador fear that he will do the same.
 Lopez Obrador himself scoffs at these fears. ''Change is possible,'' he told me when we spoke in April on the patio of his home in the gated community of Galaxia in Villahermosa, the capital of his native state of Tabasco. ''Of course I understand that globalization is a fact and that one has to act within its parameters. But this does not mean that we here in Mexico have to continue as we have been doing. This country is immensely rich. Its problems are problems of maladministration -- above all, of corruption.'' And he added, ''The point is that the Washington consensus'' -- as the neoliberal model of development is known -- ''was applied more rigidly here, by successive Mexican governments, than it ever was in the U.S. and Europe, where there are many protected sectors, above all agriculture.''
 In private, Lopez Obrador speaks with a calm self-confidence that seems almost serene. Nothing in his manner suggests the hard-nosed party politician that he, in fact, is. He began his political career in the 1970's in Tabasco, the hardest of hard-line PRI states, where he emerged as the protege of the party's leading lights. But in 1988 he bolted from the PRI, which was increasingly dominated by U.S.-educated technocrats, and later joined the nascent Party of the Democratic Revolution, then establishing itself as a left-wing alternative to the PRI. He rose to become the leader of the P.R.D. in 1996. In our conversation, though, questions of political party rarely came up. Instead, Lopez Obrador spoke, as he often does, of his own personal role, which he sees as pivotal. ''People expect a great deal of me,'' he told me, ''but I am up to this.
 ''People say that I am promising too much. But we're talking about a society where 20 million people -- 20 million! -- live on $2 a day. So when, for example, I talk about giving food aid to the poor, I'm talking about 20 pesos each'' -- the equivalent of about $2. ''And that money -- those $2 -- would double what these 20 million get and radically change their lives. What the people of Mexico need is not that much, you know.''
 As he spoke, his tone was almost lyrical. One of Lopez Obrador's early mentors in Tabasco was Carlos Pellicer, a PRI senator who was also a well-known and admired Mexican poet, and there is often the hint of a poet's diction in even Lopez Obrador's most fiery statements. His rhetorical skill no doubt accounts for some of the extraordinary hold he has on the collective imagination of Mexico's poor. When I spoke recently to Jorge G. Castaneda, who served as foreign minister in the first years of Vicente Fox's government and who supports Lopez Obrador's main rival, the National Action Party candidate, Felipe Calderon, Castaneda said that Lopez Obrador's main advantage is simply that ''people believe him.'' While accusing Lopez Obrador of ''playing to people's ignorance,'' Castaneda added that the reason ''he has done so well so far is that people believe he believes what he says. He has a way of transmitting his own conviction.'' 
 AMLO was the overwhelming front-runner in the first few months of the presidential race. Calderon, who is 43, was a lackluster, uncharismatic campaigner who had not been expected to win even his party's nomination. (The PRI's candidate, Roberto Madrazo, is the scion of a famous Tabasco political dynasty and a former opponent of Lopez Obrador's in Tabasco. Though Madrazo is both experienced and intelligent, he has seemed unable to gain any traction with the Mexican electorate.) In the last two months, however, Calderon has staged an astonishing comeback. He hired new consultants, who, after an internal debate, urged him to ''go negative.'' Ever since, his campaign has been one more demonstration that attack ads work -- particularly when the victim fails to answer the attack, as AMLO did. In March and April, the Calderon campaign ran a series of TV spots comparing AMLO with Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, and warning Mexican voters that a Lopez Obrador victory would represent ''a danger to Mexico.'' The spots were withdrawn after the Lopez Obrador campaign lodged a formal complaint with the Mexican electoral commission, but the damage was done. The polls now show Calderon with a lead of about 3 percent -- a big turnaround for a campaign that trailed by 10 points as recently as late March.
 Lopez Obrador's response to Calderon's attacks has been, on the one hand, to refuse to answer, blandly telling the news media that his only retort to these calumnies will be ''peace and love'' and, on the other, to campaign even more frenetically across Mexico. It is a killing schedule, substantially more intense than Calderon's (let alone Madrazo's). In a caravan of a half-dozen S.U.V.'s (all of them unarmored), Lopez Obrador has now made at least three stops in every Mexican state, from the impoverished south, where he is overwhelmingly popular, to the Calderon-supporting National Action Party strongholds in the prosperous north-central part of the country. 
 To follow Lopez Obrador on the campaign trail is to be swept up in something for which the word ''populist'' seems insufficient. The Lopez Obrador phenomenon seems particularly impressive given how new Mexican democracy is. After all, it was only six years ago that the election of Fox broke the 70-year stranglehold of the PRI. Yes, there were presidential elections during the decades that the PRI ruled Mexico, but the results were always a foregone conclusion. And when a challenger from an opposition party got close, or even received enough votes to win, the results were falsified by the PRI. (Most Mexican observers believe that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, one of Lopez Obrador's main political mentors and the left's standard bearer in the presidential election of 1988, actually won that election, though he was officially declared the loser.) Sitting Mexican presidents, all of them PRI until 2000, were limited by the Mexican constitution to one sexenio, a six-year term. But, in fact, they had virtual carte blanche to anoint a successor.
 Everything changed when Fox, the PAN candidate, won the 2000 elections and the PRI government of Ernesto Zedillo did not try to invalidate the results. But in the minds of many Mexicans, perhaps even a majority, this political transformation was not matched by economic progress. The middle class unquestionably expanded during Fox's term, and along with it grew rates of homeownership and, in certain regions of the country, disposable incomes. But in other parts of the country, the Nafta years were ones of falling incomes and rising joblessness. A result was mass emigration to the United States, enormous even by already-high past standards. ''It's not a migration; it's an exodus'' was the way one of Lopez Obrador's aides described it. Or, as one Mexican writer put it to me, Fox did create 10 million jobs for Mexicans -- unfortunately, they were all in the United States.
 Lopez Obrador emphasizes the emigration issue at virtually every campaign stop. Resentment at the treatment of Mexican migrants in the United States is at a fever pitch in Mexico, with practically every affront against illegal workers, real or imagined, getting huge coverage in the Mexican media; the recent pro-legalization rallies in the U.S. were treated with adulation. But Lopez Obrador speaks of emigration as a tragedy for Mexico and as something Mexico needs to put a stop to out of its own national interest. Unlike many Mexican political figures, AMLO doesn't seem to expect the U.S. to continue to accept the current levels of immigration. Nor does he base his economic calculations on the $20 billion that emigrants to the U.S. send home each year, in the process helping to prop up the Mexican economy. And he says that addressing the question will be a priority for his administration.
 ''If I am elected,'' he told me, ''I will propose a conference on migration with the United States. Building a wall is not a viable solution. The only thing that will work is creating jobs in Mexico. Fox was not able to maintain good relations with Washington. But I can't see any reason why I can't succeed in doing so.''
 This accomodationist language toward the United States might seem surprising coming from the politician the Calderon campaign has tried to associate with Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro's greatest ally and the Latin American politician Washington fears most these days. But, in fact, it is consistent with the position Lopez Obrador has taken throughout the campaign. His aides often point out that he has no quarrel with the United States, and in his campaign he reserves his scorn for the political and business establishment of Mexico. Although some American observers remain fearful of his leftist tendencies -- The Wall Street Journal ran a column in March worrying that AMLO might be ''laying the groundwork for an assault on the private sector'' -- none of the Americans I spoke to in Mexico seemed to believe that Lopez Obrador will nationalize oil and gas resources, as Evo Morales has done and Hugo Chavez has threatened to do. 
 The relatively relaxed mood on Wall Street toward a possible Lopez Obrador victory mirrors the dominant view within the Bush administration. One senior administration official, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak frankly about Mexican politics, put it this way: ''I suppose it's a mistake for any diplomat to be sanguine, but insofar as it's possible, we're sanguine about whoever wins the presidency on July 2.'' This official argued that the system in Mexico has become more powerful than any candidate because the basic structures of a multiparty Mexican democracy governed by the rule of law are now firmly in place and ''cannot be undone.'' Moreover, the official noted that Lopez Obrador had publicly expressed both the desire and the willingness to have a good relationship with the United States and added, ''We take him at his word.''
 The true anxiety over the possibility of a Lopez Obrador victory is to be found in the glass-and-steel towers of Mexico City's business district or in the northern city of Monterrey, where many of Mexico's most successful international corporations are headquartered. There is also clearly anxiety in Los Pinos, the Mexican president's official residence; Vicente Fox has thrown himself into the Calderon campaign in a way that seems less pro-Calderon than anti-Lopez Obrador. AMLO initially responded by calling Fox a ''chachalaca,'' a kind of twittering tropical bird, but as he himself admits, the sally backfired. ''Mexican voters don't like personal attacks,'' he told me ruefully. ''I made that mistake with my remark about Fox.''
 Most Mexican observers will tell you that Lopez Obrador has made other mistakes as well, both in not replying to the attacks the Calderon campaign aimed at him and in refusing to participate in the first televised presidential debate -- an event in which an empty lectern was left for Lopez Obrador, Roberto Madrazo behaved with extraordinary clumsiness and Felipe Calderon won handily. So far, though, Lopez Obrador has persisted in shying away from public debates, and he has continued to complain about the way he is being treated in the Mexican media. As a result, his relations with the press are strained. 
 The recent avalanche of negative stories has only seemed to increase the devotion of Lopez Obrador's followers. Even before he arrives in a town, his supporters are standing along the sides of the roads and down the streets leading to the public square in a state that often seems to verge on the ecstatic. And when Lopez Obrador arrives, it is pandemonium. Usually, he will leap out of his S.U.V. and for a moment will seem to get lost among his supporters before reappearing to lead them, in a noisy procession, toward the jerry-built proscenium from which he will speak.
 When he does speak, the effect is electric. Although Lopez Obrador is a brilliant natural orator, his speaking style is not the principal reason for the enthusiastic reaction he elicits. Rather, it is what he promises: new schools, roads, hospitals, oil refineries; improved electricity and clean water; health subsidies for the poor, pensions for the elderly, scholarships for the young; and, above all, jobs. He tells his audiences over and over again that Mexico is a rich country, not a poor one. And decent jobs, he says, will mean Mexicans will no longer have to migrate by the millions to the United States, destroying family stability and communal life and depriving Mexico of its most energetic citizens.
 To Calderon's campaign team, Lopez Obrador's unwillingness or inability to explain how he can make good on what he calls on the stump his ''commitments'' to the Mexican people is his Achilles' heel. ''Given the fact that he was mayor of Mexico City between 2000 and 2005, which was when crime reached an all-time high, he should be vulnerable on the security issue,'' Arturo Sarukhan, a spokesman for the Calderon campaign, told me. ''But for whatever reason, he's Teflon on this issue. Where we do have the advantage over Lopez Obrador is on the economic issues. Felipe Calderon can explain how he's going to create jobs. Lopez Obrador can't. It's that simple.''
 As Castaneda, the former foreign minister, explained it to me: ''Lopez Obrador is not Chavez. That's not the problem. What he is, in American terms, is Huey Long in 'All the King's Men,' promising everything to everybody without the slightest idea of how to pay for it. He plays to the democratic inexperience of the Mexican people.'' 
 Obviously, that is not the way AMLO's supporters see it. They refuse to entertain the possibility that Mexico may not be able to afford the things Lopez Obrador has committed himself to providing (on the campaign's official Web site they are enumerated, state by state). AMLO bemoans the fact, for example, that Mexico, because of insufficient refining capacity, exports crude oil to the United States that it needs for its own use and then has to buy it back as gasoline. He tells his audiences that he will build three new refineries to lessen Mexico's dependence, reduce prices and boost state revenues. At no point, however, does he explain where the money will come from in the federal budget for the refineries, which cost at least $3 billion each to build, and often much more. 
 Lopez Obrador is a figure of endless fascination in Mexico. Many Calderon supporters talk far more about AMLO than about their own candidate, and polls show that many Calderon voters are, in reality, anti-Lopez Obrador voters. But there is little consensus about why he does what he does or what he will do in the event that he becomes president. In political terms, as Castaneda points out, Lopez Obrador has assembled a broad coalition of supporters, in contrast to Calderon, who has run ''a very PAN campaign, with only PAN candidates and only PAN ideology, reaching out to no one.'' Castaneda said that AMLO has reached out ''to people from the broad swath of Mexican society. He's got people from the old PRI, he's got other people from the P.R.D. -- a broad coalition of whoever you can get hold of.'' He even has some connections in business. His economic team is led by Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a Cambridge-educated economist who is well respected in international business circles. And Carlos Slim, the telecom mogul who is Mexico's richest man and the third-richest man in the world, has let it be known, without formally endorsing AMLO, that he finds nothing alarming about his candidacy.
 But if Lopez Obrador really does view himself as a Messianic figure, as someone who can change Mexico through a combination of his own force of will and the support of the masses, technocrats like Ramirez de la O will be unable to rein him in if he is elected. Those who most fear him often assert that he is quite naive about the world. And it is true that AMLO has traveled very little outside of Mexico. The only major trip he has made -- at least the only one he has mentioned publicly -- was to Cuba. ''He simply doesn't know about the modern world,'' was the way one writer I spoke to in Mexico City put it. ''He thinks he does, but he doesn't.'' There is a persistent rumor that he prevented his wife, who was mortally ill with lupus and died in 2003, from seeking treatment in the United States or Western Europe (this in a country where the bourgeoisie routinely go to the United States for health care). Of course, to those of Lopez Obrador's followers who credit this story at all, it is further proof of AMLO's patriotism and of his sincerity. 
 Some activists in the Party of the Democratic Revolution worry that far from doing too much, Lopez Obrador will not do enough if (or, as they almost always put it, when) he is elected president. Hector Ordonez, a local P.R.D. leader from Ixtapalapa, told me he expected, a year or so after the election, that it would fall to him and his colleagues to explain why Lopez Obrador had not yet fulfilled all of what he had committed himself to. Given the headiness of popular expectations, Ordonez will have his work cut out for him.
 Of course, it is entirely possible that it will be Felipe Calderon who emerges victorious on July 2. He may be dull compared with Lopez Obrador, but he is steady and unlikely to veer very far from the policies pursued by Fox's administration. And while Lopez Obrador's most loyal constituency is made up of people who are worse off now than they were when Fox came into office, the reality is that there are many Mexicans -- mostly in the northern half of the country -- who are better off. The problem is that since Lopez Obrador's supporters believe he has already won, they are unlikely to accept any other outcome with resignation. In Ixtapalapa, several people told me that they had made a mistake in not taking to the streets in 1988 when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the P.R.D.'s founder, was robbed of the presidency by PRI vote-rigging. If they suspect that the election was stolen from Lopez Obrador -- and they may not believe any other explanation for a defeat -- they would not stand for it. And by his own conduct during the campaign, in which he has never wavered from presenting himself as a president in waiting rather than a presidential candidate, Lopez Obrador has already set the stage for a possible post-election confrontation that would be disastrous for Mexico and, quite likely, for the United States as well.
 As Election Day approaches, it is not at all clear whether either Lopez Obrador or Calderon can fulfill the one campaign promise that ordinary Mexicans care most about: massive job creation. Cardenas, for one, does not think so. While he obviously does not support Calderon, Cardenas, whom many P.R.D. supporters still refer to as their moral leader, has also declined to back Lopez Obrador. When I met with Cardenas in April, his gloom about the quality of the campaign was palpable. ''A commitment is different from a promise,'' he told me, a clear allusion to Lopez Obrador's list of ''commitments'' to the Mexican people. ''As far as I'm concerned,'' he added, ''none of the candidates have explained how they are going to do all these things.''
 When I interviewed Calderon in April, during a campaign swing through his home state of Michoacan, he was dismissive of Lopez Obrador's grasp of global economic realities and of his ability to maintain the confidence of the business community either at home or abroad. And he still says that Mexico must do a better job of competing in the global marketplace. But Calderon now chooses to present himself not as the candidate of a more positive business climate but as ''the candidate of jobs,'' repeating over and over again that it is employment that will be his main focus if he is elected president. And like Lopez Obrador, Calderon is now promising to build new refineries, to expand health care and education and to create opportunity for the millions of Mexicans who will otherwise migrate northward. In recent weeks, the campaign has essentially become a bidding war between the two men over who will create more jobs in Mexico. It is an obvious effort by Calderon to beat Lopez Obrador at his own game -- in effect to outbid him on the key issues that most concern Mexican voters.
 As the presidential campaign enters its final and critical phase, there is no longer any question of where this campaign is being fought: on the terrain of populism. The fact that Calderon has chosen to challenge Lopez Obrador there, on what had always been AMLO's home ground, is a testament to how much Lopez Obrador's campaign has changed Mexican politics. Of course, if Lopez Obrador goes on to lose an election that, three months ago, most Mexicans thought he would win, that fact is not likely to be much of a consolation to him.

 BODY:
On Aug. 3, 1987, Kelbessa Negewo debarked from a T.W.A. flight in New York. He cleared customs and entered the United States. A strong, thickset man, just a few weeks shy of his 37th birthday, he was traveling alone. In his suitcase, he carried the remnants of his old life: a few sets of clothes, an Ethiopian passport, a student visa issued at the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa and a reference letter from a former employer, the Mugher Cement Factory. His pockets contained $200. Kelbessa spent that first night in a cheap motel room. The next morning, after a meandering tour of the outer boroughs with an unscrupulous cabdriver, he arrived back at the airport, exasperated and financially drained. America was suffering through a broiling heat wave;
Kelbessa sweated through his shirt as he struggled with his luggage. Living here, he realized, was going to be difficult. But Kelbessa had experienced far worse. The soles of his feet bore scars from a whipping. 
 He boarded a plane bound for his new home, Atlanta. An old friend, Ayalew Berou, met Kelbessa when he landed. (Ethiopians formally address one another by their first names.) Ayalew took Kelbessa home, made him a meal and offered to put him up. He found Kelbessa a night job cleaning grocery stores. Kelbessa gradually settled into an immigrant's existence. He worked hard and went unnoticed, renting tiny apartments in disfavored suburbs, toiling in the dismal reaches of the service economy. He didn't socialize much, not even with other Ethiopians. Kelbessa tried going to one of their Bible study groups for a while, but he got the feeling that people were whispering things behind his back, so he quit.
 Six months after he arrived in America, Kelbessa applied for political asylum, saying he had been persecuted and imprisoned by Ethiopia's military dictatorship. It was the Reagan era, and Ethiopia was Communist; the application was quickly approved. Kelbessa then set about achieving his next goal: saving enough money to send for his three children, who were still stuck in Ethiopia. (He and his wife were divorced.) He worked the graveyard shift at a convenience store and took a second job, washing dishes at the Colony Square Hotel. Later, he was promoted to bellhop.
 One afternoon, Kelbessa was outside the employee locker room, waiting for the service elevator. The elevator doors opened, and another Ethiopian walked out, a young woman in a waitress's uniform. She worked at the restaurant upstairs. Kelbessa hailed her as a compatriot and introduced himself. He let the elevator go, and they had a brief conversation. Then the woman, whose shift was ending, hurried off to clock out. Kelbessa went on with his day.
 Kelbessa started hearing rumors after that. The waitress was asking questions about him. One day, she brought a couple of Ethiopian friends into the hotel. The three women didn't say anything to Kelbessa; they just stood in the lobby and stared.
 Not long afterward, in September 1990, someone else visited Kelbessa at work: a process server. He handed Kelbessa some papers, which informed him that he was being sued in federal court on charges of violating international human rights laws. The lawsuit said he was far from a mere victim of Ethiopia's brutal regime. It claimed Kelbessa had once been its servant, a notorious torturer and killer, during a period known as the Red Terror a dozen years before. His chief accuser was a woman named Edgegayehu Taye -- the waitress. Though neither she nor Kelbessa knew it then, the two immigrants were preparing to embark on a 15-year passage through the formative reaches of human rights law. Justice, and eventually even Kelbessa's freedom, would turn on a single question, decided by American judges, in American courts: What happened so long ago, in the country they both left behind?
 Lately, Kelbessa has had a lot of time to contemplate the vicissitudes of life. For the past 17 months, he has been imprisoned in Atlanta. He sits alone inside a stuffy jail cell for 23 hours of most days, breaking the solitude by teaching himself the basics of immigration law and by writing a jailhouse memoir, scrawled out on several notepads. The book begins with a discussion of peasant agriculture and Marxism and concludes with a description of prison life: the cold food, the constant racket. He vehemently denies the accusations against him and says that before the glancing encounter at the Colony Square, he never met the woman who accused him. ''Every day I wake up in the morning in American prison,'' Kelbessa writes. ''I think for a while, why am I in here?''
 He is there because the federal Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding him in detention while it tries to deport him back to Ethiopia, where he has been accused of committing many atrocities. Kelbessa's case, one of the first of its kind under a new law, is a product of many chance occurrences. If Edgegayehu Taye hadn't taken the waitress job, if their shifts hadn't overlapped that day, if she'd just kept quiet, if she'd never moved to Atlanta in the first place, then maybe Kelbessa could have lived in peace. But that is not the same as saying his story was unlikely. In a nation with a proud heritage as a haven for refugees, no conflict is too far removed. Immigrant communities may seem undifferentiated to native-born Americans, sealed off as they are by their foreign languages and customs. But in this time of impassioned argument over immigration, it is important to remember that the talk of human tides and huddled masses is just rhetorical shorthand. Each immigrant has his own reasons for making the journey; each brings to America his own history, and sometimes, his own secrets.
 United States government officials estimate that as many as 1,000 foreign residents may have once committed serious human rights abuses. Three years ago, a United Nations tribunal convicted a Rwandan pastor of genocide; he had been apprehended in Laredo, Tex. In Phoenix, more recently, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, which now oversees immigration, arrested 24 Bosnian Serbs on suspicion that they committed atrocities during their homeland's civil war. In 1997, angry Haitian emigres unmasked a former leader of a vicious paramilitary unit. He had been working as a real estate agent in Queens. Another Haitian, a key member of an ousted military regime, blew his cover when he won $3.2 million in the Florida lottery. 
 Of course, unsavory exiles have been washing up on foreign shores for as long as there have been wars and tyrants. But where once a czarist general or a Venezuelan caudillo could expect to live out his days without disturbance, the world has changed in the 60 years since the Nuremburg trials. As far-flung societies have drawn closer together, they have gradually developed international standards of human rights and a patchwork legal system to judge crimes against them. The case of Kelbessa Negewo took place at the confluence of these two historic trends. An airplane brought Kelbessa to a place where no one knew his name. In a courtroom, his past was laid bare.
 Kelbessa was born in rural western Ethiopia in 1950, midway through the long reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. His family raised goats and grew onions. ''Through my whole life, I observed and learnt power is very seductive,'' Kelbessa writes in his jailhouse memoir. The corrupt governor of his province, he recalled, collected taxes from his parents but never built a road for his village, as promised. Kelbessa had to trudge to school on foot.
 There was no one to complain to. In those days, you couldn't fight the emperor. They called Selassie ''the King of Kings.'' A slight, crafty political survivor, he held court in Addis Ababa surrounded by fawning, plotting nobles. The aristocrats were often members of Selassie's Amhara ethnic group. They were allotted huge estates in the African hinterland, which the local peasants worked like serfs. 
 This hierarchy was breaking down by the time Kelbessa came of age. Ethiopia was one of the few corners of the continent that had not been colonized in the 19th century. But the forbidding mountains that had repelled invaders could not keep out the convulsive spirit of Africa's independence era. University students were on the streets, calling for land reform, and the country was awash in pamphlets attacking the emperor. Kelbessa, who by this time had earned a diploma in public health and had a government job, would read these missives furtively, in the bathroom. The turning point for him came when he won a government scholarship to attend college in the United States, and a government official, an Amhara like Selassie, pulled a string to send his nephew instead. After that, Kelbessa says, he hated the regime.
 Kelbessa moved to Addis Ababa, where revolution was gaining momentum. In 1973, famine gripped Ethiopia. Selassie sat in his palace, increasingly isolated, tossing scraps of meat to his beloved dogs. In September 1974, army tanks surrounded the palace and the emperor was bundled into the back of a Volkswagen Beetle and taken to prison. 
 Kelbessa, like many Ethiopians, embraced the revolution. The military established a 120-member Derg, or committee, to rule the country. It promised land reform and a prompt transition to representative rule. Kelbessa was thrilled. A month after Selassie's overthrow, the Derg closed down the university and ordered its students to disperse across the countryside and ''educate the people.'' Kelbessa volunteered to teach the basics of farming. Shortly after that, the Derg announced plans to establish a socialist one-party state, began confiscating property from the ''feudalists'' of the old elite and established a system of elected neighborhood councils that were to administer changes on a local level. Kelbessa took up a position on his council.
 These initial moves were popular with many of the country's Marxist intellectuals and young people, even some children of the elite. But disenchantment set in quickly. The military shocked the country by executing a group of 59 royals and other leaders of the imperial regime. Paranoia settled over the capital. Members of the Derg assassinated one another in a struggle for control, and eventually, an obscure army major named Mengistu Haile Mariam emerged. Mengistu secretly ordered Selassie's murder and had him buried in an unmarked grave. The Marxists split: one group supported Mengistu's methods; the other decided to fight him. The opponents joined the clandestine Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.), which began its own campaign of bombings and assassinations.
 In April 1977, at a public rally, Mengistu smashed glass bottles filled with blood, or some red liquid, and vowed to conquer the ''enemies of the revolution.'' All over the city, corpses appeared on the streets, pinned with signs bearing slogans referring to the government's Red Terror campaign. It would prove to be, according to a Human Rights Watch report, ''one of the most systematic uses of mass murder by the state ever witnessed in Africa.'' 
 Kelbessa was never more than a midlevel figure in Ethiopia's government. At the time of the Red Terror, he was chairman of Higher Zone 9, a district of Addis Ababa. In this administrative post, he oversaw several neighborhood councils. Mengistu's proclamation of war, however, strengthened positions like Kelbessa's. The government instructed the local councils to recruit new ''revolutionary defense squads,'' which were armed and given orders to root out any threat. Kelbessa took to strutting around his neighborhood with a machine gun slung across his chest, leading an entourage of militiamen. He cut a distinctive figure with his large afro and his bellicose oratory, and he was often in the newspaper or on television. Others were higher-ranking, but few were louder in proclaiming their ruthless devotion to the struggle. A series of memos, unearthed in the course of Kelbessa's legal travails, reveal that he was tireless in begging his higher-ups for more guns, more ammunition and more press coverage. He told them of great strides in ''the process of weeding out antirevolutionary elements.''
 Late one afternoon in February 1978, according to sworn testimony, a squad of revolutionary guards arrived at the home of Edgegayehu Taye, a 22-year-old civil servant. They told her she was wanted for questioning. She went without protest. The guards pushed her into the back seat of a Volkswagen and drove her some distance, until the car reached a corrugated metal gate marked by a sign that read: ''Higher Zone 9.'' The guards took her into the main office. Edgegayehu was ordered to strip naked and was bound with rope at her wrists and knees. Then the guards ran a pole through the loops in the rope and hung her between two desks, like a pig on a spit. They lashed her with plastic cables.
 Over and over again, the man behind the desk, the one with the afro, asked her, ''Are you a member of the E.P.R.P.?''
 Years later, when she saw the man standing by the elevator at the Colony Square Hotel, Edgegayehu wasn't sure it was Kelbessa at first. He'd gotten older, gained some weight, lost his swagger. He certainly didn't seem to recognize her. Then Kelbessa smiled widely and greeted her, and she knew for sure. ''The voice,'' she told me. ''You don't forget the voice.''
 Edgegayehu is an old Amharic name. Americans find it difficult to pronounce (it is pronounced ed-JIH-GAH-yu), so these days she goes by a nickname, Edge. She is middle-aged now and lives in Ohio, in a home she has decorated with reminders of Ethiopia. Even after so many years, the very mention of Kelbessa's name causes her voice to crack. 
 Edge told me the first thing she felt that day, as Kelbessa stepped into the elevator and she hurried out of the hotel, was a stab of nausea. Then incomprehension set in. ''Seeing him here, I couldn't swallow that,'' she says, still sounding a bit disbelieving. ''Kelbessa, that man, that big man, the person who acts like a god during his time, the person who makes you or breaks you, the person who decided whether you live or you die. That person, to see that person here, wearing that dishwasher's uniform? I don't think so.''
 After that first encounter with Kelbessa, Edge spent several months wondering what to do. She had never been able to talk about her torture, not even to her closest friends and relatives. Finally, she mentioned her run-in to a few friends. Word got around. An acquaintance, an Ethiopian who worked in the office of Andrew Young, then Atlanta's mayor, made some calls and got in contact with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal organization based in New York. Someone from the center contacted Miles Alexander, a partner at the Atlanta law firm Kilpatrick & Cody. He agreed to look into the case pro bono. 
 Edge set up an appointment with her new lawyers. She was led into a wood-paneled corner office, where she met Alexander and Laurel Lucey, the associate assigned to the case. They told Edge there might be something they could do. There was a law, a very old law, called the Alien Tort Claims Act. Passed as part of the first Judiciary Act in 1789, it said American federal courts had jurisdiction in cases in which injuries had occurred ''in violation of the law of nations,'' regardless of where those violations occurred. No one was really sure what the First Congress meant by ''the law of nations'' -- it may have had something to do with pirates -- but in the early 1980's, a group of human rights lawyers had dusted off the dormant phrase, using it to go after the likes of Imelda Marcos. 
 To get started, though, the lawyers needed Edge to give them a detailed description of what happened back in Ethiopia. She really didn't know what to say. She had never put words to her memories before. She opened her mouth and started talking. But the story came out muddled. It was so hard to explain. Finally, flustered, Edge twisted around in her chair and pulled off her shirt. Alexander and Lucey, dumbfounded, stared at her back. It was crisscrossed by long, ridged scars.
 Edge has been required to describe her ordeal on many occasions since then. But it is painful every time, she says. When she told me about it, she adopted a hunched-over posture, and her voice sank to almost a whisper. She says she has never been sure why she was arrested. That first night, between whippings, the guards dragged in a young man she knew. ''He gave my name,'' she says, dabbing her eyes with one of the paper napkins she had left out in a stack on the coffee table. ''Probably he did that out of fear, out of pain. I don't blame him. I saw him. He was tortured very badly.'' 
 There really didn't need to be a reason. In a study of the Mengistu regime, Rene Lefort writes that ''simply knowing how to read and write and being aged about 20'' was enough to get a person branded a counterrevolutionary. But Edge fitted the profile of a rebel in some specific ways. Her father had been a member of the old elite. She worked in a government ministry, as an architectural draftswoman, and she had told some co-workers that she was worried about the course the revolution was taking. Edge told me she was never involved in the clandestine attacks against the government. But she adds, ''I sympathized, of course.'' 
 Kelbessa's men tried to beat a confession out of her for two days, Edge says. When that didn't work, she was transferred to another detention center, where she was tortured further. For 10 months, she lived in a small cell filled with as many as 30 other women. At night, guards would come in and call out names, and those they summoned would be shot. Edge heard more about Kelbessa from her cellmates. One of them, a woman named Sosena, was the daughter of a former supreme court justice. The story went that Kelbessa had ordered her father executed, and his body dumped by the roadside. 
 Eventually Edge was transferred to a regular prison, where she served a three-year sentence. When she was released, in 1981, she made a daring escape from Ethiopia, paying a band of Somali nomads to smuggle her across the desert to Djibouti. From there, via a refugee program, she immigrated to Canada. She married an Ethiopian and moved to Detroit. Shivering through one winter, Edge read the novel ''Gone With the Wind,'' and something in it captured her imagination. She decided to move to Atlanta. She loved it there: loved the big Ethiopian community, loved the warm weather, loved the red clay, which reminded her of the soil in Sidamo, the province where she was born. 
 Then she saw Kelbessa. ''He made my life so miserable,'' Edge says. ''He's the person who snatched away my happiness, my youth, my laugh at that age. I didn't want to leave him alone. I didn't want to let it go. Knowing that he is living here, after he did so many crimes.'' She added: ''I had to do something, even if it was a small thing. I hadn't any idea about the magnitude of this case. For me it is a simple case.''
 Her lawyers knew better. At the time, using the Alien Tort statute to pursue human rights violators was a fringe idea, the project of a small group of left-leaning legal activists. No one was even certain whether the approach was constitutional. A judge in Atlanta might easily decide that the sorrows of Ethiopia were not of his court's concern. At the very least, the lawyers told Edge, it would help to have some additional plaintiffs, a few more victims to corroborate her story. 
 Edge went home and started working the Ethiopian immigrant network. She remembered that her old cellmate, Sosena, had a sister in Los Angeles named Elizabeth, who had been in prison. (For reasons of privacy Elizabeth has asked that her last name not be used.) She agreed to participate in the lawsuit and called a close friend in Ottawa, Hirut Abebe-Jiri. The two women flew down to Atlanta. Edge took them to the Colony Square, and from a distance they watched Kelbessa, standing in the sky-lighted lobby in his gray bellhop's uniform. ''It was unbelievable,'' recalls Hirut, who claims Kelbessa tortured and imprisoned her for three months. ''The guy who was leading all these people with his Uzi on his chest now becoming just a guy who was carrying a suitcase.'' 
 When the trial convened at the Atlanta federal courthouse, in May 1993, the gallery was filled with Ethiopians. Paul Hoffman, a prominent Los Angeles human rights lawyer, led a team of attorneys for the plaintiffs. Kelbessa, who couldn't afford a lawyer, defended himself. He wore a suit and a thick mustache and spoke with a heavy accent. ''I have never tortured,'' Kelbessa said in his opening statement. ''I'm not responsible for what Derg has done. Fifty-two million people are participating in the revolution. I'm an individual. I was working for the people.'' 
 Then the women testified, in gruesome detail, and Kelbessa cross-examined them. He assumed the manner of an interrogator, repeatedly accusing the women of having once been members of the underground resistance.
 ''You don't feel shame when you lie?'' he asked Edge. ''What did you do?''
 ''I didn't do nothing,'' she replied, her anger getting the best of her English. ''I don't have to.'' She added: ''You people are killing people, tortured people, detained people every day. You are the nightmare of Addis Ababa.''
 Three months later, the judge issued his decision, siding with the women and awarding them $1.5 million in damages. Kelbessa filed an appeal, declared bankruptcy and moved on. The verdict hardly troubled his daily existence; if anything, things improved. The Colony Square fired him, but he collected unemployment checks and used the free time to earn a degree in accounting from DeVry University. He later found a new job at the Westin. He married again, an Ethiopian 15 years his junior. When they had a son, in 1996, Kelbessa insisted on naming him Justice. The boy was born with a rare vitamin deficiency, however, and after nine months he died. They tried again and had a daughter, who is now a healthy and rambunctious 6-year-old. The year after the verdict, as he was pursuing his ultimately unsuccessful appeal, Kelbessa filed a naturalization application with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. On July 28, 1995, Kelbessa took an oath of allegiance and became a citizen of the United States.
 The women who accused Kelbessa never thought their lawsuit would bring them financial gain. (Over the years, they have managed to collect $798 in damages, which they have donated to charity.) They had, however, expected that all the trial publicity would prod the United States government to deport Kelbessa back to Ethiopia, where he would have to face real consequences. Mengistu's dictatorship had fallen, and Ethiopia's new government had appointed a special prosecutor to try those responsible for the Red Terror. Days after the verdict in Kelbessa's civil trial, the Ethiopian prosecutor formally asked the United States to turn him over. But the government never acted, and once Kelbessa became an American citizen, deportation was out of the question. Around the time Kelbessa won his citizenship, Edge moved back to Detroit. If he was going to be staying in Atlanta, she had to leave.
 For the women, it was a wrenching turn of events. But the hard truth was, Kelbessa couldn't be kicked out of America simply on the basis of charges -- however substantiated -- that he had tortured and killed people back home. American law, for complex reasons of history and politics, made it extraordinarily difficult to convey Kelbessa from his apartment in Atlanta to a courtroom in Ethiopia, however much he belonged there.
 The immigration law on the books, like the modern human rights movement itself, was a product of the Holocaust. In the 1950's and 60's, there were a number of cases in which fugitive war criminals were found to be living comfortable lives in America. Once they were discovered, it proved almost impossible to deport these people without evidence of recent crimes or fraud in the application process. So in the mid-70's, Elizabeth Holtzman, a New York congresswoman, proposed a law to bar Nazi criminals from the United States and a new Office of Special Investigations within the Justice Department to track them down. Yet the law was written narrowly, so that it would essentially apply only to Nazis. It was the cold war era; some of America's best friends were dictators. 
 With the end of the cold war, international human rights law evolved, coming to focus increasingly on conflicts in the developing world. The United Nations set up special courts to try those responsible for the carnage in the Balkans, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The International Criminal Court, established in 1998, began investigating crimes committed in Congo, Uganda and the Darfur region of Sudan. In the United States, the use of the Alien Tort statute to pursue violators of human rights became an accepted legal practice, upheld (though somewhat narrowed) by a 2004 Supreme Court decision. But this international legal system -- if you could even call it that yet -- was still a jerry-built creation, with many hitches and flaws. For all the talk of universal rights, the world was still made up of sovereign nations with borders and rules. Kelbessa Negewo managed to find a haven in the wide gap between the aspirations of global justice and the reality of these earthbound things called laws. But only for a time.
 When the women who accused Kelbessa heard that the government had awarded him citizenship, they were astonished and furious. Two of them flew down to Atlanta to tape a CNN segment, which was shown while President Bill Clinton was touring Africa. ''This is a huge mistake they made,'' one of the women told the network. In 1999, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, inspired by many similar stories -- including a Boston Globe account of a Bosnian baker in his home state who had been identified as a former paramilitary gunman -- sponsored a bill to make past acts of torture or extrajudicial killing grounds for deportation, and to expand the mission of the Office of Special Investigations beyond Nazi-hunting.
 Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who apparently knew about the torture charges against Kelbessa when they awarded him citizenship, ordered a new investigation, the first step in the arduous process necessary to revoke it. The agency sent investigators to Ethiopia twice to gather evidence and interview witnesses. ''It was offensive that he was here as a citizen,'' says Kimberly Schroeder, the investigator who handled the case, ''and that bothered me terribly after meeting the women.'' Schroeder collaborated with the Ethiopian special prosecutor, who was preparing a case against Kelbessa. Under Mengistu the secret police had Soviet and East German advisers, and they had encouraged meticulous record-keeping. The prosecutors unearthed many archival documents that incriminated Kelbessa, like signed memos in which he described taking ''revolutionary actions'' -- the favored euphemism for extrajudicial murder -- on suspected resistance fighters.
 ''He is one of the most savage of all our cases,'' Yoseph Kiros, the prosecutor who handled Kelbessa's case, said in a telephone interview from Addis Ababa. Eventually, tired of waiting for Kelbessa's return, the Ethiopian prosecutors decided to try him in absentia before a three-judge tribunal, along with dozens of co-defendants from the neighborhood. Because Kelbessa wasn't there, no defense attorney represented him. More than 100 witnesses came to testify. They accused Kelbessa of ordering many executions. One man was killed, according to testimony and written evidence, simply so Kelbessa could confiscate his Peugeot. In May 2002, the tribunal convicted Kelbessa of several murders and sentenced him to life in prison.
 Meanwhile, back in the United States, the legal barriers to Kelbessa's return home were finally falling. In 2004, after years of delays, Leahy's bill finally became law as part of the Intelligence Reform Act. The same autumn, as Kelbessa prepared to face a federal judge, he abruptly, and perhaps unwisely, decided to give up his citizenship without a fight. Kelbessa had just bought a three-bedroom house in a subdivision south of Atlanta. He did not have the money for years of appeals, and his wife as well as an attorney he consulted were urging him to get his legal battles finished. He signed a settlement agreement reluctantly, hoping his gesture of submission might persuade the government to leave him alone.
 Three months later, on the morning of Jan. 4, 2005, armed federal agents knocked at the door of Kelbessa's new suburban home. He was sound asleep; the night before, he worked a late shift at his hotel job. Kelbessa came downstairs in his nightclothes, groggy, asking what was going on. The agents cuffed Kelbessa's hands behind his back. Then they put him in a car and drove him to a detention center. 
 I first met Kelbessa last December, a few days before Christmas, in a fluorescent-lighted room inside the Atlanta City Detention Center, a 14-story municipal jail where the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement leases space. He shuffled in, led by a beefy prison guard, his legs shackled, his arms cuffed before him and affixed to a chain around his waist. He was wearing a bright orange prison uniform. His hair was thin, and his mustache was flecked with gray. Though only 55, he looked very frail. Kelbessa contorted his wrists within the cuffs in order to offer a handshake. Then he sat down on a hard wooden bench.
 ''I didn't expect from America this kind of stuff, because this is a very highly civilized country,'' he told me. ''I was trying to improve myself. I bought a house. I was working hard. And all of a sudden, they accused me, the government accused me.'' Kelbessa lowered his voice for emphasis and said, ''I am not a torturer.''
 Kelbessa will be kept in detention for as long as his deportation case is pending, which is mandated by law, because his 2002 conviction in Ethiopia means that he is classified as a violent felon. ''Because he's facing life when he returns to Ethiopia, he's also considered a very high flight risk,'' Schroeder says. Kelbessa says that that sentence was a product of a ''sham trial.'' The damning memos that prosecutors uncovered have been taken out of context, he claims. When I asked him what he meant when he wrote his superiors about ''weeding out'' resistance fighters, he laughed. ''That is revolutionary language,'' he said.
 Kelbessa is terrified of what will happen to him if he is deported. He has seen the inside of an Ethiopian prison before. In 1979, as the Red Terror was winding down, the forces of the revolution turned against him, and he was purged. Kelbessa was jailed, and only released when the military regime pardoned him several years later. Eventually it granted Kelbessa permission to emigrate to the United States, where he claimed asylum, saying, truthfully, that he had been a prisoner. ''I was tortured for five years,'' Kelbessa said. He claimed he had never lied to immigration officials and said he believed that the United States had merely been duped by his home country's present government, which is led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a former anti-Mengistu rebel. ''I am just a victim,'' Kelbessa said. ''I am a victim of the Ethiopian government. Before, I was a victim of the Derg military government. I can't tolerate torture now. I am old now for torture.''
 Kelbessa's fears may not be entirely unfounded. Prime Minister Meles's regime has gone to great pains to give the perpetrators of the Red Terror fair trials. It's a poor country, however, and the special tribunals have had to deal with more than 2,000 defendants. Human rights groups have documented numerous irregularities. ''Ethiopia has violated the rights of the defendants in its pursuit of justice,'' concluded a law review article by one American lawyer who consulted the tribunal. Prison conditions are uniformly awful. In the last year, Kelbessa is quick to note, Ethiopia's political situation has taken a drastic turn for the worse, as Meles has jailed journalists and opposition politicians. Human Rights Watch says political prisoners are sometimes abused.
 Since the United States enacted its new, tough law aimed at immigrants with a history of committing atrocities, some have questioned it, wondering whether the United States should be sending anyone, however loathsome, to places where their own rights might in turn be violated. ''There has been a great deal of debate within the human rights community about the immigration option,'' says William Aceves, a law professor and the principal author of a 2002 Amnesty International report titled ''United States of America: A Safe Haven for Torturers,'' which highlighted Kelbessa's case. ''It's frustrating, because the human rights community is in favor of accountability, but we want to make sure that it's legitimate accountability.'' Aceves and others point out that the United States has a federal torture statute, passed in 1994, which applies to acts committed anywhere in the world. But no one has ever been charged under the law. For now, the United States government is putting its energies into deportation cases instead. In less than two years, the immigration bureau has prosecuted or investigated more than 1,000 cases related to human rights abuses. Legal advocates for immigrants, however, caution that many of those caught thus far appear to be marginal figures, not masterminds.
 Deportation cases are handled in a special nationwide system of immigration courts. As a result of the federal government's new vigilance about human rights abusers, these courts are increasingly playing a new role, as a way station between exile and, presumably, a trial back home. Even the best-run court system, however, would struggle with such distant events as the crimes of the Red Terror, with their complex political and ethnic overtones, and human rights advocates question whether the immigration court system, which is overburdened, underfinanced and opaque, is up to the task. ''It's a really shocking system,'' says Carolyn Patty Blum, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in asylum and human rights cases. The standard of proof for deportation is lower than it is for criminal trials. There are usually few witnesses called. The proceedings are often closed to the public. There is no public defender.
 Normally, an Ethiopian facing deportation and certain life imprisonment at home could hope to find free legal representation within the network of lawyers affiliated with immigrant rights organizations. As a general principle, human rights groups like Amnesty International oppose trials in absentia like Kelbessa's. But after Kelbessa was arrested, his wife talked to every immigration lawyer she could find in Atlanta, and none would take his case. A few were sympathetic until they heard the details of his past. So for now, Kelbessa is fighting deportation on his own. In his cell, he keeps a large stack of well-thumbed trial transcripts, plaintive letters to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and legal briefs, which he writes by hand on notebook paper.
 Kelbessa's deportation hearing took place over two days last July. The judge in the case, William Cassidy, has a reputation as one of the nation's toughest. In a reprise of the last trial, 12 years before, Edge, Elizabeth and Hirut told their stories, and Kelbessa, in his orange prison garb, cross-examined them. He threw around a few unfounded accusations. But he just wasn't the same ferocious questioner. Kelbessa called just two character witnesses in his defense. When his wife took the stand, their fidgety daughter sat on her lap, and she swore she had never heard Kelbessa raise his voice in anger. Even the women testifying against him felt a twinge of pity for the family. But then again, none of them had ever had any children. ''I couldn't bring any child in this world,'' Hirut told me. ''It's not safe.''
 Kelbessa has never expressed sympathy for the women who say they endured so much suffering. ''These are the feudal children,'' he told me when I visited him a second time, in March. ''Their fathers used to have big land, and so many tenants.'' Edge's father was a senator. Elizabeth's was a supreme court justice. Hirut's was a lawyer and a confidant of Haile Selassie's son. As children of privilege, he said, ''they didn't accept the change -- they didn't like the change.'' They were in their teens or just barely beyond, but to Kelbessa, fired as he was by fear, ambition and resentment, their parentage was enough to identify them as threats. ''They are not innocent,'' he said. ''There are no innocents. In Ethiopia, you can't say, 'innocent.'''
 When he looks back on the whole saga now, the 17 years since that chance meeting at the Colony Square Hotel, all Kelbessa sees is one large, many-faced conspiracy, orchestrated by his enemies back in Ethiopia. ''I think you know about third world politics,'' he told me. ''They want revenge.'' The idea that there might be motivations other than vengeance, that there might be no dark political force at work, that this might simply be a story of happenstance and justice, seems genuinely never to have occurred to him. He can see the world only as a struggle between two ruthless forces. For him, the Red Terror has never ended.
 Last July, Judge Cassidy ruled that Kelbessa should be deported and dismissed his claims that he would be tortured in Ethiopia. The case is now making its way through a long, lurching appeals process, which could take anywhere from a few more months to a few years. If no court overturns the deportation order, then one day, federal agents will come to Kelbessa's cell. He will be allowed to change into civilian clothes. He will be handcuffed and escorted onto a flight to Addis Ababa. At the airport, the agent will hand Kelbessa over to Ethiopian officials. Then he will most likely be taken to Kaliti Prison, on the outskirts of the capital. There he will begin his new life.

 BODY:
''Elitist'' is just about the nastiest name you can call someone, or something, in America these days, a finely-honed term of derision in the culture wars, and ''elitist'' has stuck to organic food in this country like balsamic vinegar to mache. Thirty years ago the rap on organic was a little different: back then the stuff was derided as hippie food, crunchy granola and bricklike brown bread for the unshaved set (male and female division). So for organic to be tagged as elitist may count as progress. But you knew it was over for John Kerry in the farm belt when his wife, Teresa, helpfully suggested to Missouri farmers that they go organic. Eating organic has been fixed in the collective imagination as an upper-middle-class luxury, a blue-state affectation as easy to mock as Volvos or lattes. On the cultural spectrum, organic stands at the far opposite extreme from Nascar or Wal-Mart. 
But all this is about to change, now that Wal-Mart itself, the nation's largest grocer, has decided to take organic food seriously. (Nascar is not quite there yet.) Beginning later this year, Wal-Mart plans to roll out a complete selection of organic foods -- food certified by the U.S.D.A. to have been grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers -- in its nearly 4,000 stores. Just as significant, the company says it will price all this organic food at an eye-poppingly tiny premium over its already-cheap conventional food: the organic Cocoa Puffs and Oreos will cost only 10 percent more than the conventional kind. Organic food will soon be available to the tens of millions of Americans who now cannot afford it -- indeed, who have little or no idea what the term even means. Organic food, which represents merely 2.5 percent of America's half-trillion-dollar food economy, is about to go mainstream. At a stroke, the argument that it is elitist will crumble. 
 This is good news indeed, for the American consumer and the American land. Or perhaps I should say for some of the American land and a great deal more of the land in places like Mexico and China, for Wal-Mart is bound to hasten the globalization of organic food. (Ten percent of organic food is imported today.) Like every other commodity that global corporations lay their hands on, organic food will henceforth come from wherever in the world it can be produced most cheaply. It is about to go the way of sneakers and MP3 players, becoming yet another rootless commodity circulating in the global economy.
 Oh, but wait. . .I meant to talk about all the good that will come of Wal-Mart's commitment to organic. Sorry about that. When you're talking about global capitalism, it can be hard to separate the good news from the bad. Because of its scale and efficiency and notorious ruthlessness, Wal-Mart will force down the price of organics, and that is a good thing for all the consumers who can't afford to spend more for food than they already do. Wal-Mart will also educate the millions of Americans who don't yet know exactly what organic food is or precisely how it differs from conventionally grown food. 
 The vast expansion of organic farmland it will take to feed Wal-Mart's new appetite is also an unambiguous good for the world's environment, since it will result in substantially less pesticide and chemical fertilizer being applied to the land -- somewhere. Whatever you think about the prospect of organic Coca-Cola, when it comes, and come it surely will, tens of thousands of acres of the world's cornfields -- enough to make all that organic high-fructose corn syrup -- will no longer receive an annual shower of pesticides like Atrazine. O.K., you're probably registering a flicker of cognitive dissonance at the conjunction of the words ''organic'' and ''high-fructose corn syrup,'' but keep your eye for a moment on that Atrazine.
 Atrazine is a powerful herbicide applied to 70 percent of America's cornfields. Traces of the chemical routinely turn up in American streams and wells and even in the rain; the F.D.A. also finds residues of Atrazine in our food.
 So what? Well, the chemical, which was recently banned by the European Union, is a suspected carcinogen and endocrine disruptor that has been linked to low sperm counts among farmers. A couple of years ago, a U.C. Berkeley herpetologist named Tyrone Hayes, while doing research on behalf of Syngenta, Atrazine's manufacturer, found that even at concentrations as low as 0.1 part per billion, the herbicide will chemically emasculate a male frog, causing its gonads to produce eggs -- in effect, turning males into hermaphrodites. Atrazine is often present in American waterways at much higher concentrations than 0.1 part per billion. But American regulators generally won't ban a pesticide until the bodies, or cancer cases, begin to pile up -- until, that is, scientists can prove the link between the suspect molecule and illness in humans or ecological catastrophe. So Atrazine is, at least in the American food system, deemed innocent until proved guilty -- a standard of proof extremely difficult to achieve, since it awaits the results of chemical testing on humans that we, rightly, don't perform. 
 I don't know about you, but as the father of an adolescent boy, I sort of like the idea of keeping such a molecule out of my son's diet, even if the scientists and nutritionists say they still don't have proof that organic food is any safer or healthier. I also like that growing food organically doesn't pollute the rivers and water table with nitrates from synthetic fertilizer or expose farm workers to toxic pesticides. And the fact that animals raised organically don't receive antibiotics or synthetic growth hormones. Sounds like a better agriculture to me -- and Wal-Mart has just put the force of its great many supermarkets behind it. 
 But before you pour yourself a celebratory glass of Wal-Mart organic milk, you might want to ask a few questions about how the company plans to achieve its laudable goals. Assuming that it's possible at all, how exactly would Wal-Mart get the price of organic food down to a level just 10 percent higher than that of its everyday food? To do so would virtually guarantee that Wal-Mart's version of cheap organic food is not sustainable, at least not in any meaningful sense of that word. To index the price of organic to the price of conventional is to give up, right from the start, on the idea, once enshrined in the organic movement, that food should be priced not high or low but responsibly. As the organic movement has long maintained, cheap industrial food is cheap only because the real costs of producing it are not reflected in the price at the checkout. Rather, those costs are charged to the environment, in the form of soil depletion and pollution (industrial agriculture is now our biggest polluter); to the public purse, in the form of subsidies to conventional commodity farmers; to the public health, in the form of an epidemic of diabetes and obesity that is expected to cost the economy more than $100 billion per year; and to the welfare of the farm- and food-factory workers, not to mention the well-being of the animals we eat. As Wendell Berry once wrote, the motto of our conventional food system -- at the center of which stands Wal-Mart, the biggest purveyor of cheap food in America -- should be: Cheap at any price!
 To say you can sell organic food for 10 percent more than you sell irresponsibly priced food suggests that you don't really get it-- that you plan to bring business-as-usual principles of industrial ''efficiency'' and ''economies of scale'' to a system of food production that was supposed to mimic the logic of natural systems rather than that of the factory.
 We have already seen what happens when the logic of the factory is applied to organic food production. The industrialization of organic agriculture, which Wal-Mart's involvement will only deepen, has already given us ''organic feedlots'' -- two words that I never thought would find their way into the same clause. To supply the escalating demand for cheap organic milk, agribusiness companies are setting up 5,000-head dairies, often in the desert. These milking cows never touch a blade of grass, instead spending their days standing around a dry-lot ''loafing area'' munching organic grain -- grain that takes a toll on both the animals' health (these ruminants evolved to eat grass, after all) and the nutritional value of their milk. But this is the sort of milk (deficient in beta-carotene and the ''good fats'' -- like omega 3's and C.L.A. -- that come from grazing cows on grass) we're going to see a lot more of in the supermarket as long as Wal-Mart determines to keep organic milk cheap. 
 We're also going to see more organic milk -- and organic foods of all kinds -- coming from places like New Zealand. The globalization of organic food is already well under way: at Whole Foods you can buy organic asparagus flown in from Argentina, raspberries from Mexico, grass-fed meat from New Zealand. In an era of energy scarcity, the purchase of such products does little to advance the ideal of sustainability that once upon a time animated the organic movement. These foods may contain no pesticides, but they are drenched in petroleum even so.
 Whether produced domestically or not, organic meat will increasingly come not from mixed, polyculture farms growing a variety of species (a practice that makes it possible to recycle nutrients between plants and animals) but from ever-bigger Confined Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFO's, which, apart from using organic feed and abjuring antibiotics, are little different from their conventional counterparts. Yes, the federal organic rules say the animals should have ''access to the outdoors,'' but in practice this often means providing them with a tiny exercise yard or, in the case of one organic egg producer in New England, a screened-in concrete ''porch'' -- a view of the outdoors. Herein lies one of the deeper paradoxes of practicing organic agriculture on an industrial scale: big, single-species CAFO's are even more precarious than their conventional cousins, since they can't use antibiotics to keep the thousands of animals living in close confinement indoors from becoming sick. So organic CAFO-hands (to call them farmhands seems overly generous) keep the free ranging to a minimum and then keep their fingers crossed.
 Wal-Mart will buy its organic food from whichever producers can produce it most cheaply, and these will not be the sort of farmers you picture when you hear the word ''organic.'' Big supermarkets want to do business only with big farmers growing lots of the same thing, not because big monoculture farms are any more efficient (they aren't) but because it's easier to buy all your carrots from a single megafarm than to contract with hundreds of smaller growers. The ''transaction costs'' are lower, even when the price and the quality are the same. This is just one of the many ways in which the logic of industrial capitalism and the logic of biology on a farm come into conflict. At least in the short run, the logic of capitalism usually prevails. 
 Wal-Mart's push into the organic market won't do much for small organic farmers, that seems plain enough. But it may also spell trouble for the big growers it will favor. Wal-Mart has a reputation for driving down prices by squeezing its suppliers, especially after those suppliers have invested heavily to boost production to feed the Wal-Mart maw. Having done that, the supplier will find itself at Wal-Mart's mercy when the company decides it no longer wants to pay a price that enables the farmer to make a living. When that happens, the notion of responsibly priced food will be sacrificed to the imperatives of survival, and the pressure to cut corners will become irresistible.
 Up to now, the federal organic standards have provided a bulwark against that pressure. Yet with the industrialization of organic, these rules are themselves coming under mounting pressure, and forgive my skepticism, but it's hard to believe that the lobbyists from Wal-Mart are going to play a constructive role in defending those standards from efforts to weaken them. Just this past year the Organic Trade Association used lobbyists who do work for Kraft Foods to move a bill through Congress that will make it easier to include synthetic ingredients in products labeled organic.
 Organic is just a word, after all, and its definition now lies in the hands of the federal government, which means it is subject to all the usual political and economic forces at play in Washington. Inevitably, the drive to produce organic food cheaply will bring pressure to further weaken the regulations, and some of K Street's finest talent will soon be on the case. A few years ago a chicken producer in Georgia named Fieldale Farms persuaded its congressman to slip a helpful provision into an appropriations bill that would allow growers of organic chicken to substitute conventional chicken feed if the price of organic feed exceeded a certain level. That certainly makes life easier for a chicken producer when the price of organic corn is north of $5 a bushel, as it is today, and conventional corn south of $2. But in what sense is a chicken fed on conventional feed still organic? In no sense but the Orwellian one: because the government says it is. 
 After an outcry from consumers and some wiser heads in the organic industry, this new rule was repealed. The moral of the Fieldale story is that unless consumers and well-meaning organic producers remain vigilant and steadfast, the drive to make the price of organic foods competitive with that of conventional foods will hollow out the word and kill the organic goose, just when her golden eggs are luring so many big players into the water. Let's hope Wal-Mart recognizes that the extraordinary marketing magic of the word ''organic'' -- a power that flows directly from our dissatisfaction with the very-cheap-food economy Wal-Mart has done so much to create -- is a lot like the health of an organic chicken living in close confinement with thousands of other chickens in an organic CAFO, munching organic corn: fragile.

 Where do you buy organic food? The percentage change from 2,000 to 2,005.
 Grocery store 63% 58%
 Natural-food store (e.g., Whole Foods) 29% 49%
 Farmer's market 33% 15%
 Superstore (e.g., Wal-Mart, Kmart) 9% 15%
 Club store (e.g., Costco) 4% 7%
 Other 7% 13%

HEADLINE: Rentals Are Strong, And the Rich Keep Buying

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
THE smoke may have cleared from the last of the Memorial Day barbecues, but two months into the second quarter, many New Yorkers are still hazy about the state of the local real estate market. 
 Real estate professionals say that many people have the money and desire to buy, but they are waiting on the sidelines, feeling skittish about the economy and confused by housing reports that take the temperature of the nation rather than of individual markets.
Some concerns may be well-founded. Inventory -- the number of properties on the market -- in Manhattan is up 67 percent for May 2006 over May 2005, according to Jonathan J. Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm. Co-op inventory is up 53 percent and condominium inventory is up 87 percent, he said, adding that the condo figure is mainly attributable to new development. 
 Also, apartments are staying on the market longer. In the first quarter, the average was 138 days, according to Miller Samuel. It is now approaching 150 days, Mr. Miller estimated, adding that he thinks that a lot of the inventory is overpriced. 
 On the other hand, high-end multimillion-dollar properties are selling well. Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, predicted there will be records this year on the number of sales above $20 million. Mr. Miller said he was struck by the number of transactions so far this year that are above $5 million, which he attributes mainly to residual Wall Street bonus money. 
 Additionally, sales have been stronger since the end of 2005. 
 ''We took a real shellacking through January,'' said Neil Binder, a principal at Bellmarc Realty. ''Now things are moving along O.K. From January on, there's been a considerable degree of constancy.''
 So far this quarter, which began on April 1, those most affected by the market are the people who are first-time home buyers or those just barely able to afford to buy. Because of rising mortgage rates, these would-be buyers (the kind who made up a good part of buyers in the real estate frenzy of the past few years) are often now renting instead. 
 ''There's been a tremendous surge in people signing leases,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Landlords, especially in new buildings, are ratcheting up rates and reducing enticements almost as fast.'' 
 The upturn in the rental market makes sense, he said, because mortgage rates and rental demand correlate almost directly. 
 Unlike other markets, New York has always been somewhat insulated because of the range of buyers it attracts, from foreigners looking for pieds-a-terre to the superrich to artists and dancers with songs in their hearts and little cash in their pockets. Of course, if too many people become so fearful of a slowdown that they stop buying, they could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
 ''The biggest unknown is what's going to happen with inflation,'' said Gregory Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, adding that when it comes to interest rates, it is not so much the amount that they go up, but what an increase symbolizes. ''As they creep toward 7 percent, it has an effect on the psyche of both buyers and sellers,'' he said. 
 Mr. Binder of Bellmarc Realty pointed out that interest rates have not increased precipitously. ''You can still get an excellent rate,'' he said. ''I remember when interest rates were 16 percent and we were doing a hell of a business.'' 
 The wild card right now, he said, is new construction, which developers seek to sell at a premium. (Mr. Binder estimates that premium to be 15 to 25 percent over resales.) ''A lot of this new construction stuff is going to have a daunting time,'' he said, adding that new condominiums can make resales look comparatively affordable. 
 Several new luxury condominiums are selling well, though as Ms. Liebman said, some ''have taken off like crazy'' while others ''are floundering.'' Basically, sales are inconsistent and properties that lack the essential combination of location, amenities and attractive price will not sell. 
 Signs of scaling back seem to be manifesting themselves more in second homes and vacation rentals than in primary residences, according to Mr. Binder. ''That's were the line is being drawn,'' he said. 
 At a 48-unit development in the Berkshires, in Massachusetts, where he owns a condo, he said there has not been a sale all year. ''I'm trying to sell a place,'' he said. ''I've owned it for 20 years and I'm going to own it for another 10, whether I want to or not.''
 Marketers are spending more money now than in years past in an attempt to capture the attention of buyers who continue to exhibit zero tolerance for overpriced properties. Some sellers, however, have yet to come to terms with that. 
 ''We're starting to see a little more realistic pricing, but it still has a long way to go,'' Mr. Miller said, adding that sellers were buoyed by the spring market and are more likely to adjust prices this summer. ''I think that's where you're going to see more accurate pricing,'' he said.
 Like some other real estate companies, Corcoran enjoyed a strong spring, and it also reported the most gross sales volume in its history during March. But the number of transactions dropped 6 percent from April 2005 to April 2006. 
 While some people do not think the economy is as healthy as others have painted it, Mr. Heym is optimistic that New York's economy will grow, that schools will continue to improve and that the crime rate will further decline. 
 ''There's still such a strong desire for homeownership in this country,'' he said. ''People want to own something tangible that doesn't disappear overnight. Like Enron stock.''

HEADLINE: For Entrepreneurs From Russia, A Short Course in Capitalism 

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Len Bersh, though born in the former Soviet Union, knows a lot about American capitalism. Since immigrating to New York 13 years ago, he has earned M.B.A. and law degrees, joined a practice specializing in patent law and earlier this year started a Web-based business that sells lighting products. 
 And on Monday nights at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College in Manhattan, he imparts his knowledge to former countrymen, in Russian.
 ''They already have their mind set in the right direction by being in America,'' Mr. Bersh said of the participants in the business basics workshop for Russian entrepreneurs, a kind of crash course in American capitalism that meets two and a half hours a week for six weeks. 
 The series is the latest offering for would-be entrepreneurs at the school's Lawrence N. Field Center for Entrepreneurship, which provides business training and financial advice through seminars, workshops and one-on-one counseling, helping some 1,200 aspiring and existing business owners start or expand small businesses each year.
 The center's offerings -- 45 different workshops were scheduled last year -- cover basics like e-commerce, franchising and how to develop a business plan, and also specialty topics, like doing business in China and running a home-based business. A recent pilot program focused on business resources for people with disabilities. A workshop for technology entrepreneurs, aimed at scientists interested in commercializing their work, is planned for the fall.
 ''Entrepreneurs need a very broad array of services and information, and they need it on their own unique terms,'' said Edward G. Rogoff, the center's academic director, who is also a management professor at the school of business and co-author of ''The Entrepreneurial Conversation'' (Pinnacle Books). ''We try to create programs and services that are highly customized.''
 While classes have been taught in Spanish and Korean in the past, ''most people who come to the center are familiar with how the American system works,'' Professor Rogoff said. Koreans, for example, ''are highly entrepreneurial.'' But the Russian class was particularly challenging, he said.
 Mr. Bersh, the Russian workshop instructor, addressed the differences. Marketing, for example, got a lot of attention. Because of the scarcity of products in Russia, marketing is not as critical there as it is in America. And many participants, used to bribery and corruption, were skeptical of the American system. Mr. Bersh gave the example of affixing a neon sign to the exterior of a business in New York City, which would probably require a permit. Obtaining permissions in Russia, he said, involves ''more under-the-table type of deals.'' 
 Yuliya Mazur, who came to the United States almost nine years ago, was in Mr. Bersh's first session in February. She had dreamed of opening a restaurant in Russia, but it was ''relatively dangerous to have a business,'' because the unstable economic climate sometimes led to violence.
 But five months after she arrived in America, her husband died. With two children to support, she postponed her plans. ''I was struggling to make a living,'' she said.
 Mrs. Mazur recently approached the Hebrew Free Loan Society, an organization that grants interest-free loans to emigres from the former Soviet Union. 
 Natasha Srulowitz, a program coordinator for the society, said that ''Russians tend to dive in'' though it is hard for them to get the education they need. ''They try to keep their heads above water. They are not learning how to do a business plan on Excel.'' 
 So the society worked with the center to set up the Russian workshop. 
 ''It's a way to hedge the risk,'' Ms. Srulowitz said, ''because we think it is that critical.'' 
 In March, after completing the six-week course at the center, and assisted by a society loan, Mrs. Mazur bought Grille de Paris, a kosher French restaurant in Brooklyn. 
 Established in 1993, the Field Center houses one of 23 regional small-business development centers in New York State, financed in part by the federal Small Business Administration. The center receives additional support from a variety of public and private sources. Its services are available, free, to anyone in New York State interested in a for-profit business.
 Many who come to the center, like Mrs. Mazur, have no previous experience in owning a business. Others, like Gwen Whiting and Lindsey Wieber, who two years ago opened the Laundress, a collection of specialty fabric care products, detergents and accessories, were fairly far along by the time they arrived at the center.
 ''We had everything researched to a T,'' Ms. Whiting said. Both had been involved in small-business ventures before and had worked in the fashion industry. 
 But even with the experience, working with a business adviser ''added layers, it forced us to think out three or four years,'' Ms. Wieber said. The adviser also helped revise their business plan, originally tailored to investors, to conform to what a bank would want for additional financing. And the two owners, who sell their products wholesale and online, were advised that they could not afford a storefront, part of their original business plan. 
 The center does not lend money, said Monica Dean, the administrative director, but the counselors ''have personal relationships with bankers so that clients will not go blind.''
 ''Some banks don't do restaurants or start-ups,'' she said. ''Some are O.K. funding start-ups.'' 
 E. London, co-owner of Xtra Diva, a by-appointment boutique in Manhattan for discount clothing for women, was counseled by a business adviser to forgo a $150,000 loan that had been approved, and to focus on building the business more slowly.
 The counselor also advised on researching demographics and ''how to find a mailing list at a good price,'' Ms. London said. 
 The center does not track how many participants start businesses or how successful each business is, Ms. Dean said. 
 But in the last five years, the center estimates, clients of the center created or saved more than 2,300 jobs, and accounted for more than $44 million in economic impact in the greater New York area. 
 Not all clients start businesses, of course. Some come once and never return, said Ulas Neftci, one of four business advisers who provide one-on-one counseling, often in conjuction with business school faculty members and M.B.A. student interns.
 He said the most successful clients were those with a ''healthy combination'' of money sense and a touch of the ''romantic entrepreneur'' -- an emotional love of the business they plan to go into. 
 ''It is not going to be as fun as you think'' is how Mr. Neftci puts it to clients. ''Many want to be their own bosses,'' he said. ''But it is not like the boss goes away. The client is the new boss.''

HEADLINE: Written In Stone

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
ONE spring morning in 1998, a building conservator named Raymond Pepi and two colleagues drove north from Manhattan to Tuckahoe, a former quarry town in Westchester, in search of stone. Mr. Pepi's company, Building Conservation Associates, had been hired to restore the 89-year-old Met Life tower in the Flatiron district. Some of the white Tuckahoe marble that sheathed the 700-foot-tall building was badly worn, but the stone had not been mined since the Great Depression shuttered Tuckahoe's quarries in 1930. 
 In a story often told among building conservators, the trio drove around the town in Mr. Pepi's brand-new Jeep, past old quarry pits filled with rainwater, searching for hummocks or outcroppings of marble that they could ransack for the Met Life tower. Finally, they found themselves in an industrial neighborhood between some housing projects and the railroad tracks.
''We parked the car and started snooping around these tracks,'' recalled Stacy Albanese, who had accompanied Mr. Pepi on the expedition, ''and we ended up in the back of this service station.'' 
 There, amid garbage and junked cars, they found it: a Tuckahoe boulder the size of a minivan. Met Life bought the boulder from the gas station owner, and it ultimately yielded 250 of the custom-fitted repair pieces that stone restorers call ''dutchmen.'' 
 New York has always had its share of marble and limestone civic buildings. But when the construction of wood-frame houses was limited after the Great Fire of 1835, stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice. During the so-called brown decades after the Civil War, as the city's wealth and population rapidly increased, block after block of brownstone townhouses sprang up, transforming the city's face.
 Many of those buildings are still standing. But this is an age of glass and steel, a time when structures like the Urban Glass House, an apartment building nearing completion at Spring and Washington Streets, are commonplace. Stone has not been the city's dominant building material for decades, a shift reflected in the sharply declining number of people who work with the material. In 1900, Census Bureau figures show, 13,000 New Yorkers listed their occupation as stonemasons or bricklayers; an additional 5,000 were stonecutters. In a federal survey last year, only 1,030 people in the New York metropolitan area identified themselves as stonemasons. 
 Today, the science and lore of New York's stone is the province of people like Mr. Pepi and the relatively small number of scientists, architects, builders and artisans who restore the city's stone buildings. Their skill and resourcefulness grow increasingly valuable as the city's stone buildings age and deteriorate. 
 That is largely because stone, unlike many building materials, cannot be manufactured. It must be quarried or cannibalized from other buildings, then patched and preserved. Those who watch over the city's stone patrimony face an endless and increasingly difficult task fighting the damage done by pollution, weather and, above all, time. 
 Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a far-flung network of quarries. In the days before rail, stones were floated down the Hudson River or along the Atlantic Seaboard from pits in New England. Later, trains brought marble from Vermont and granite from Minnesota. The United States Custom House, built in the early 20th century at Bowling Green, contains at least 20 varieties of stone.
 Today, the stone used in Manhattan skyscrapers may come from almost anywhere: Norway, Uruguay, Belgium. The so-called Pahlavi office tower on Fifth Avenue, built by officials from the government of the deposed Shah of Iran, has stone from Finland. 
 To an expert eye, many of these stones instantly announce themselves. ''That's a Nova Scotia or New Brunswick sandstone,'' Mr. Pepi said, pointing to the Dakota apartment building during a recent stroll down Central Park West. ''It weathers to a creamy tan color. Sometimes it has a greenish tinge to it.'' 
 Of course, no one can identify every stone. That is why conservators like Mr. Pepi often send samples for identification to places like Pasvalco, a stone yard in the northern New Jersey town of Closter. Pasvalco maintains a stone ''library'': in a small room in the company's offices stand eight metal shelving units lined with brick-size samples of hundreds of kinds of stone -- peach-colored granite, dusky bluestone.
 ''This is French limestone,'' said Dave Andersen, Pasvalco's president, as he ran a finger along one shelf holding an array of creamy stones with names like Fontenay Claire, Beaumaniere and Villebois. ''Once in a while, we run into a baron who installed some.'' 
 On another shelf were samples of Alabama limestones, broken down by evocatively named subvariety: Shadow Vein, Gray Vein, Southern Pearl. ''Sometimes it has a gray vein, and sometimes it has a gold vein,'' Mr. Andersen said. ''Sometimes it clouds, and sometimes it stripes. You've got to get the right one.''

Living, Breathing
 Conservators who work in the city know that the stones in New York buildings are, in a sense, alive. They inhale and exhale moisture, and their chemical structure interacts with whatever is in the environment. Sometimes, stone changes in ways that puzzle even the most seasoned experts, people like Sidney Horenstein, a geologist who worked for 43 years at the American Museum of Natural History.
 On a recent walk down Fifth Avenue, Mr. Horenstein, looking professorial with his bifocals and disheveled gray hair, pointed to the granite sidewalk outside Bergdorf Goodman, a patch streaked with brownish-red stains. He bent closer to the ground, oblivious to the streams of tourists parting around him. ''This is Mount Airy granite,'' he said. ''There's always an enigma for me, as to these brown iron stains -- whether the clamps beneath the stone are rusting.'' 
 Some varieties of stone, like the Tuckahoe marble in the Met Life tower, weather so drastically that, after a few decades, they barely resemble their fresh-cut selves. That is especially true in New York, where air pollution sometimes reacts with the chemicals in stone to produce bizarre results. 
 ''Very often an architect wants to use a stone because he likes the color, the texture or the price,'' Mr. Horenstein said. ''But is it going to stand up to the climate of New York City? You may not want to have something that's white but turns brown.''
 Buildings faced with stone often look more solid than they really are, and most conservators have found serious ailments in apparently healthy structures. 
 One famous New York building that proved deeply troubled was the Whitney Museum of American Art on Madison Avenue. Mohamed Elkordy, the president of A. Ottavino Corporation, a stone yard in Ozone Park, Queens, keeps a reminder of the Whitney's brush with disaster in his desk: a four-inch-long length of steel slightly thicker than a nail. The piece is one of several thousand metal dowels that held in place the granite panels of the museum's overhanging facade. 
 In 1997, after David A. Ross, then the museum's director, noticed that the panels had shifted slightly, Mr. Elkordy's workers removed them and discovered that the dowels, which kept tons of stone from crashing to the street, had been slowly weakening. They ended up laying out the entire facade of the Whitney on the floor of the Ottavino stoneworks, a giant half-roofed structure shadowed by the gantries of two traveling cranes.
 Much of the company's equipment dates to the 1930's, when its founder, Adamo Ottavino, bought a stone yard across from the Bayside and Acacia cemeteries. The previous owner had manufactured tombstones. ''This was here when Pop bought the yard,'' said Kate Ottavino, 47, Mr. Ottavino's granddaughter and the company's director of preservation, as she pointed to a dusty electric wire saw from the 1920's. Nearby was a pneumatic chisel that dated back to the same era. ''It's a turn-of-the-century quarrying operation,'' said Ms. Ottavino, who was dressed this day in very 21st-century black, as she surveyed her domain. ''Minus the pit.''

When Buildings Die, and Are Reborn
 New York's buildings are constantly under repair or undergoing demolition, so much so that hardly any grand old building does not contain a piece or two from another edifice. For example, the chocolate-colored, neo-Gothic Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, on West 55th Street, contains blocks of Longmeadow brownstone from the First Presbyterian Church in Greenwich Village, which Mr. Andersen, of Pasvalco, removed in the 1980's. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian also contains stone he salvaged from a burned-out church in Newark in the 1970's. 
 Similarly, a foot-thick wedge of bluestone from the main branch of the New York Public Library, removed during restoration in 1997, now patches a weathered corner of the David Stewart Mausoleum, in Green-Wood Cemetery. 
 The 1960's, a period when the city's businesses and its middle class were fleeing to the suburbs, and whole neighborhoods were tumbling into dereliction, proved to be a golden age for those who needed old building stone. Mr. Andersen, who worked summers during those years for his father's company, remembers the rattletrap dump trucks that used to pull up, top-heavy with the remains of inner-city brownstones.
 ''They were tearing down these burned-out tenements all over the city,'' he said. ''They would rip the face off it, and my father would buy the face, and he'd send me out there with a sledgehammer to split it up early in the morning, until it got too hot. And then he'd put me out on the saw to make it into veneer.'' 
 New York's social and economic resurgence since those days has meant that stoneworkers no longer have a ready supply of brownstone. These days, Mr. Andersen is lucky to acquire any salvaged brownstone at all; he recently waited more than a year to obtain the abutment of a railroad bridge near Newark, which now sits in a corner of his yard, metal spikes still protruding from the weathered Belleville brownstone.
 When good stone has left one building but not yet found a new home in another, it sometimes makes its way to an overgrown yard in the back of the Ottavino stone works. There, Ms. Ottavino, trailed by a cat named Midnight, recently pointed out piles of pedigreed stone that teetered alarmingly among the high grass and the daffodils.
 Among the pieces was a speckled limestone cube that had been rescued from the old Westbury Hotel on East 69th Street when the building was turned into luxury condominiums in 1999. The block still bore a brass plaque reading, ''Member of the Leading Hotels of the World.'' 
 In a corner were stacked some immense blocks of gray-green Rockport granite, a stone that has not been quarried since the 1930's. The stones had come from deep inside the massive platform supporting the Statue of Liberty's base; workers had removed them in 1986, during the statue's restoration. And leaning against a pillar was a precious length of Tuckahoe marble, slightly larger than a human arm, dwarfed by the coffin-size blocks that surrounded it. 
 Among Ms. Ottavino's favorite old stones is one that speaks to an episode involving the engineering building at Columbia University, a building whose library she used when she earned master's degrees in architecture and historic preservation at the university.
 ''Let's go see Mr. Mudd,'' she suggested, leading a visitor to a five-foot-square slice of reddish-brown granite no thicker than a slice of bread. 
 The Mudd in question was Seeley W. Mudd, a wealthy mining engineer. After his death in 1926, his wife formed a foundation in his name, which underwrote much of the cost of constructing the engineering building in 1961. For years, Mr. Mudd's name was engraved above the doorway of the building, which was -- and still is -- named for him. But in 1997, after a businessman named Z. Y. Fu donated $26 million to Columbia's school of engineering, the university named the school after him. 
 The Ottavino company was hired to remove the part of the building's facade on which Mr. Mudd's name was inscribed, slice off the inscription and then re-incise the stone. Today, it is Mr. Fu's name above the doorway. Mr. Mudd's name, in smaller letters, remains on an exterior wall, between a planter and a ''no trespassing'' sign. 
 Ms. Ottavino treats the stone with the mock courtliness sometimes shown stuffed and mounted animals. ''Dear Mr. Mudd,'' she said solemnly as she brushed some dust off the granite. ''He's living here now. He's a stone stencil.''

The Secrets of Stones
 The city's old stone buildings are filled with secrets, some long hidden. The more the stoneworkers explore them, the more mysteries are revealed.
 Mr. Pepi, the conservation expert, once removed a stone wall, roughly 90 years old, inside the New Amsterdam Theater on West 42nd Street, an Art Nouveau building that his company helped restore in the mid-90's.
 In a bricked-up cavity within the wall, he discovered an unused sconce: a life-size terra-cotta bust of a young women with half-closed eyes and flowing, flower-strewn hair. Hand-blown light bulbs were screwed into sockets in the terra-cotta flowers; when Mr. Pepi plugged the old cord into an outlet, the bulbs lit up. No one seemed to know what the sconce was doing inside the wall.
 And old New York stones don't just hide mysteries. Sometimes they are the mystery.
 On his walk along Central Park West, Mr. Pepi paused in front of the Langham, a 13-story apartment building. Leaning in for a closer look at the veneer of pale limestone, he pointed out that each block had been chisel-finished, or ''dressed,'' as stoneworkers put it, and separated from its neighbors by a deep indentation. ''They dressed the grooves between the blocks,'' he said. ''It's like, 'Oh, we couldn't even leave that surface untouched.' '' The Langham was built in 1907. The level of artisanship devoted to even its homeliest stones speaks of an age when materials were expensive and skilled labor was cheap, but proud of what it could do. 
 Mr. Pepi calls such revelations ''Aha'' moments. ''You're a hundred feet in the air,'' he said, ''and you're looking at a face, or a carved eagle that's ready to soar into flight. It's practically invisible to someone standing on the ground. What were they thinking about, putting all that stuff up there where no one else can see it?
 ''It's an expression of tremendous faith in the value of artisanry to the integrity of the building,'' he said, ''even if it's something that not everybody can rub elbows with. It's kind of like the Greeks or the Romans. Their furniture makers always finished the undersides of things, because they knew the gods would be checking.''

HEADLINE: It Takes a Village To Cause a (Rent) War

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
A battle has broken out in Rochdale Village, a sprawling complex in Jamaica, Queens, of drab co-op towers with mostly middle-class residents. In a new front in the city's skirmishes over housing costs, the co-op's roughly 23,000 occupants are protesting a 12 percent increase in their monthly maintenance charges and a fuel surcharge that went into effect in the past year.
 The struggle has escalated in recent months. A group of Rochdale residents who have complained about the increases say the management has kept them from taking part in board meetings and from reviewing the board's accounting practices. The complaints were first reported in The Queens Chronicle, a local newspaper. 
The tenants' group, the Rochdale Village House Congress, was founded in the 1960's to serve as a liaison between residents of Rochdale Village, which is part of the state's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, and the board of directors of the complex. Members of the tenants' group say that since March their organization has been banned from meeting on the Rochdale premises. They now meet in the auditorium of a nearby elementary school. 
 Marion Scott, president of Marion Scott Real Estate Inc., the company that manages the co-op, said the House Congress meetings had been banned because the group was an unofficial association with a reputation of being disruptive. ''They are trying to take over the board of Rochdale Village,'' he said. ''They are doing so with scare tactics.''
 In response, some tenants say that it is the rising cost of living at Rochdale that is frightening them.
 A year ago, Ronald Forte, 68, a retired postal worker who is a member of the House Congress, was paying $525 for a one-bedroom apartment, he said. Now, because of increases approved by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, he pays $615.
 ''I'm on a fixed income, I'm retired and on Social Security,'' Mr. Forte said. ''So right now that's infringing on some of the things I used to do.'' He said the increase meant that he could no longer enjoy life's little amenities, like buying a nice shirt. 
 According to Ronald Hollie, chairman of the co-op board, both the rent increase and the fuel surcharge resulted from surging fuel prices. Board meetings were closed, he added, because certain members were ''playing to the audience'' instead of focusing on pressing business.
 ''We were simply not getting work done,'' he said. In place of open meetings, he said, the board began holding a series of public information sessions in April.
 On a recent evening, residents of Rochdale Village chatted on benches scattered throughout an expanse of lush grass in the middle of the complex, while children bounced basketballs along asphalt pathways. The serene scene gave no hint of the turmoil roiling the complex. 
 But the sparring continues. On Tuesday, the House Congress submitted to the board a petition demanding that 11 of the 16 board members be removed and that the management firm be fired, according to Jean Hall, president of the tenants' group. The petition also demanded that the finances of the development be audited. 
 Ms. Hall said that the more than 2,000 signatures on the petition represent over a quarter of the Rochdale Village units, enough to require a special meeting where residents could express their concerns.
 One 25-year resident, who identified himself as Brother Malik, said he looked forward to such a meeting. ''I don't want anything to do with the board of directors,'' he said. ''I want to have some say about where I live.'' SAKI KNAFO

HEADLINE: Alison Field, Eric Senunas

 BODY:
Alison Ellen Field and Eric Kazys Senunas were married last evening at the Legion of Honor Museum in San Franciso by I. Michael Heyman, a former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, who was designated a San Francisco deputy commissioner for the occasion. 
 The bride, 39, will continue to use her name professionally. She is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, specializing in childhood obesity and eating disorders. She graduated from Berkeley and received a doctorate from the Harvard School of Public Health.
She is the daughter of Carol and John Field of San Francisco. Her mother, a novelist, wrote ''Mangoes and Quince'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), as well as books on Italian culture and food. Her father retired as a partner in Field Paoli Architects, a San Francisco firm he helped found.

HEADLINE: New York's Catholic Century

BYLINE: By PETER QUINN. 
Peter Quinn's novels include ''Banished Children of Eve,'' about Irish-Americans in New York at the time of the Civil War, and ''Hour of the Cat,'' a World War II thriller.

 BODY:
THE recent decision by Cardinal Edward Egan to close 9 Catholic schools and 31 parishes put me in mind of the early 1950's, when I first enrolled in parochial school. For our parish, St. Raymond's in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, and for the Archdiocese of New York, which both were flush with parishioners, piety and political power, it was the best of times. 
 At the opening of St. Raymond's new school building in 1951, my father, Peter A. Quinn, was the main speaker, sharing the stage with Cardinal Francis Spellman. My father, a former Democratic congressman and newly minted Municipal Court judge who was privately critical of what he saw as Spellman's Republican leanings, steered clear of controversy. Instead, he spoke about the church's role in providing spiritual sustenance and material support to generations of immigrants who had struggled to make a place for themselves in a city that regarded them as incurably poor, ignorant and foreign. 
At that moment, the power and influence of the Catholic church in New York were at their apex. Before long, however, many inhabitants of the city's parishes, made prosperous by the postwar economic boom, left for the suburbs. Almost simultaneously, in the wake of changes instituted by the Second Vatican Council, the ranks of the nuns and brothers who staffed schools like St. Raymond's thinned drastically. The number of priests plummeted.
 Today, the Archdiocese of New York, which stretches from Staten Island to Orange County (Brooklyn and Queens form a separate diocese) and includes 2.5 million Catholics, faces financial strains as well as a critical shortage of priests. But its troubles are an indirect reminder of the significant influence the church wielded for more than a century, a period bookended by two legendary bishops. 
 Although the archdiocese is almost 200 years old, it was shaped by the huge influx of Irish immigrants in the mid-19th century. In the single decade from 1845 to 1855, one million Irish immigrants entered the Port of New York. By 1865, according to the estimate of Jay P. Dolan, a church historian, New York's Catholics were ''almost one half of the city's population.''
 The Irish weren't the only immigrants pouring in. Germans, many of them poor and Catholic, also arrived in large numbers. But it was the ragtag Irish who alarmed city residents. Unskilled, often illiterate, reeling from the devastating effects of the Great Potato Famine and the diseases that followed, the Irish in New York were, as Bishop John Hughes wrote in 1849, ''the poorest and most wretched population that can be found -- the scattered debris of the Irish nation.''
 Hughes, an immigrant from County Tyrone, arrived in New York as an auxiliary bishop in 1839 and was made bishop in 1842. From the start, he set out to prevent the disintegration of his flock by equipping it with the discipline and organization needed to survive in a hostile and brutally competitive environment. The most immediate challenge was erecting places for Catholic worship, and during his 22-year tenure, churches were built at the rate of about one a year.
 In Hughes's eyes, every bit as important as building churches was the creation of a system of Catholic education. The religion of Irish famine immigrants was a lightly practiced pastiche of Celtic folk belief and Catholic ritual. In the city's public schools, Catholic children not only lacked the opportunity to learn about their faith but also heard it mocked as papist superstition. In the end, unable to achieve his goal of public financing for Catholic education, he established a separate system of parish-run schools. 
 When Hughes died in 1864, his work, like the half-built St. Patrick's Cathedral at 50th Street and Madison Avenue, was unfinished. But he had set the foundations for his successors to build upon, a task helped in no small measure by the mutually beneficial relationship between the city's large bloc of Catholic voters and the Democratic organization based in Tammany Hall. 
 Personal relationships were at the heart of the arrangement. Political figures, from precinct captains up to the top boss, were often loyal parishioners. A visit by the parish priest to the local district leader was part of a de facto affirmative action program that could yield a job or promotion, or keep a son or brother out of jail. Tammany, in turn, could be relied on to support the use of public funds for Catholic charitable institutions and to oppose legislation harmful to church interests. 
 The structure Bishop Hughes put in place proved highly viable. A distinct community, observant and loyal, drew strength and identity from local parishes. The tidal wave of Italian immigrants that followed the German and Irish enriched the city's Catholic culture but did little to alter the operation of the institutional church, which remained firmly in the hands of an Irish-dominated clergy.
 Hughes was followed almost exactly a century later, in 1939, by Cardinal Spellman, who enjoyed the status of establishment insider -- a perfect bookend to his predecessor's reputation as firebrand outsider. A manager and a C.E.O. by temperament, a man who preferred pulling strings to indulging in public donnybrooks, Spellman wielded his considerable clout in private meetings with political and financial power brokers -- although he did get into a nasty public squabble with Eleanor Roosevelt over the issue of public funds for Catholic schools. 
 SPELLMAN had inherited an archdiocese with a debt of $28 million, staggering for the time. But aided by his formidable managerial skills and the increasing economic success of urban Catholics, he returned the archdiocese to fiscal health and then some. He built schools and hospitals, and the archdiocese became a major source of financial support for the Vatican. 
 It was under Spellman that the cardinal's residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral became known unofficially as ''the Powerhouse,'' a label that underscored the hugely influential role New York's archbishop supposedly played in matters of church and state. That ranged from having a decisive say in Rome's selection of other American bishops to helping City Hall choose commissioners and high-ranking officials, especially in the heavily Catholic Police and Fire Departments. 
 These days, though politicians stop by the cardinal's residence to pay courtesy calls rather than to consult on appointments, the archdiocese remains in many ways a vibrant community. With the arrival of Catholics from Latin America and other parts of the world, the church is ethnically more diverse than ever. Mass is said in scores of different languages. Though some churches are closing, many others have well-attended liturgies. 
 My old parish at St. Raymond's continues to thrive, with a well-attended high school in addition to the grammar school. But in terms of the temporal clout that existed in the 1950's, the old order has passed.

HEADLINE: Concrete Partners

BYLINE: By Anthony R. Coscia. 
Anthony R. Coscia is the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

 BODY:
NEARLY a century ago, area leaders created the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey because they knew the region's long-term economic survival lay in cooperation, not competition between the states. Recently, we saw regional cooperation again as New Jersey and New York forged a unified agreement to rebuild the World Trade Center site.
 But too often in the last few years this kind of cooperation has been the exception. And that must change. Because divided, New Jersey and New York risk being crushed under the weight of their own growth. Together, however, the two states can make the landmark investments that will determine our economic success over the next century. 
In the first half of the 20th century, the Port Authority -- relying on user fees like tolls, not on state or local tax dollars -- built or expanded the region's transportation network, including the Holland Tunnel, the Lincoln Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge, the three bridges between Staten Island and New Jersey, the major ports and airports, the PATH system and the World Trade Center.
 But the Port Authority hasn't built another iconic project since the trade center was completed 36 years ago. Instead of making major investments for the whole region, cross-border competition has driven the authority into smaller, short-term fixes like maintaining and repairing existing bridge decks and PATH trains and tracks. We have lost the drive to build the major projects for which neither New Jersey nor New York is willing or able to take sole responsibility. 
 Anyone traveling in or out of Manhattan is all too aware of regional congestion problems. The tunnels and bridges are backed up. Bus services using the Port Authority Bus Terminal experience unacceptable delays. The 100-year-old passenger rail tunnel to New York's Pennsylvania Station is at full capacity. Alarmingly, the mob scenes we saw outside of Penn Station during the transit strike late last year could become a daily occurrence, as demand for commuter rail travel will double by 2020.
 More than reducing our quality of life, our failure to meet this growing transportation crisis will force jobs and economic opportunities to other parts of the nation. So what must our generation do to improve the lives of future generations? 
 For a start, the region needs to build a second passenger rail tunnel across the Hudson River and additional tracks along the Northeast Corridor line that would terminate at an expanded Penn Station under 34th Street. A project of this size and extraordinary cost -- estimated at $6 billion -- requires tremendous collaboration. 
 The Port Authority is committed to investing more than $1 billion in this project, but New Jersey, New York and the federal government will also need to make a contribution. So far, Gov. Jon Corzine has committed $500 million to the project, and Gov. George Pataki has publicly supported the project, as have all the United States senators representing New Jersey and New York. 
 As is happening in Lower Manhattan, regional leaders must also prepare emerging business centers like Brooklyn, Hoboken, Newark and Queens to absorb future growth. Commercial and residential development tied to mass transit improvements will create jobs without increasing suburban sprawl. 
 We must also invest in rail transportation at the ports to help replace the lost manufacturing jobs and to cut down on truck traffic. Every container that is taken from the port by rail keeps 1.6 trucks off the region's roads. With almost three million containers moving through our ports every year, that's a lot of trucks. 
 It will cost $600 million to build full rail capacity at our ports, but it's worth the investment. To date, $141 million has been invested in this project and the remaining money has been earmarked in the Port Authority's spending plans. 
 And anyone who uses the region's airports knows that they are bursting at the seams. Our region is the No. 1 origin and destination market in the world and our air space is the world's most congested. Flights to and from Newark Liberty International Airport, La Guardia Airport and Kennedy International Airport frequently rank Nos. 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in delays.
 Quite simply, we need a fourth major airport. Since building another La Guardia in a densely populated metropolitan area with expensive real estate isn't feasible, this new airport will need to be farther out, and with express rail connections. 
 It's vital that New Jersey and New York, with the help of the federal government and the City of New York, focus on moving highly skilled employees into and out of Manhattan and maximizing the region's economic potential. These needs are so basic that they are easily overlooked -- and have been ignored for far too long -- but they are exactly the types of projects that the Port Authority, with regional collaboration, should be undertaking. 
 The historic agreement to rebuild the World Trade Center has proven again that regional cooperation is not an abstract concept but a critical part of the region's economic success. If we can build on that cooperation, then 50 years from now, our children and grandchildren will look back and thank us for having the vision to invest in their prosperity.

HEADLINE: Opportunity and the Unpaid Intern

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 There is an important problem associated with unpaid internships: they are most likely illegal. 
 The national minimum wage in the United States is $5.15 per hour; it is higher in many states. 
Unless an internship falls under one of the exceptions to the minimum wage, an employee, even one designated an ''intern,'' must be paid the legal minimum wage. 
 Such unpaid internships result in lost income taxes and payroll taxes, as well as unpaid unemployment insurance and workers' compensation premiums (what benefits is the intern entitled to if he or she is injured on the internship?). 
 When an intern works for an organization, that intern is legally entitled to be paid the minimum wage and to be covered by all applicable labor standards.

HEADLINE: The Speedy Rise Of Property Taxes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Property taxes in Connecticut affect everything. Local taxes are at the root of the eminent domain struggle plaguing New London and myriad controversies over development in eastern Connecticut. 
Hope lies in the wisdom of our voters. Many towns enjoy home rule and the town meeting form of government with direct democracy and referendums on local taxes. If Connecticut towns get spending under control, everything will improve. 
 With 169 towns and municipalities, our state is really a delineated group of communities, each with its own character and nature, often more homogenous than diverse. So it is not a racial or class issue -- yet. It is an issue about how local community decisions hurt or help the local economies. Elderly, disabled and vulnerable young and middle-aged people risk losing their homes to property tax burdens.
 The real wealth of the three levels of government (local, state and federal) remains in the local level in Connecticut. The 169 local budgets amount to more than state and federal block grants combined. What happens locally really matters.
 Property taxes are rising faster than inflation rates; in fact, they trigger inflation. Colchester initially sought as much as a 12 percent spending increase this year for education despite leveling enrollment. The budget was shot down at referendum May 9 and a 7.9 percent spending increase was nixed again May 30. 
 Even after sound defeat by the people, members of the Board of Finance and the Board of Education agreed only to cut just $500,000 of a $46.5 million budget with $3 million in ''new spending'' over last year. If federal taxes increased at this rate, we would see a national tax revolt.

 BODY:
In the late 1990's, the word went out to Red Sox Nation: Fenway Park was doomed. Yes, it was one of most celebrated temples in all of sports, but it was nearly 90 years old, with fewer than 35,000 seats, and utterly inadequate, its owners said, to meet the demands of a modern sports franchise. All over the country, ballparks were being built that had the kind of modern amenities -- wide concourses, luxury boxes, plenty of places to buy upscale food -- that would generate significant new revenue for the home team.
 The Red Sox needed such a ballpark, its owners insisted. Despite the incredible passion for the Red Sox in New England -- and even though Fenway was often sold out -- the team was barely breaking even. Without a new ballpark, the Red Sox would reach the point where they would no longer be able to field a competitive team. The owners floated possible new sites and made the case for abandoning Fenway before the notoriously tough Boston press corps. They even gained some converts to the cause. 
But of course it never happened. Instead, in 2002, the team was sold to a group led by John Henry, a commodities hedge-fund manager and owner of the Florida Marlins (which he unloaded once he got his hands on the Red Sox); Tom Werner, the television mogul who once owned the San Diego Padres; and Larry Lucchino, a lifelong baseball executive who had run both the Baltimore Orioles and the Padres. (The group's limited partners also include The New York Times Company.) The price -- $660 million and the assumption of $40 million of debt -- was the most money ever paid for a baseball team.
 The Red Sox' new owners then spent more money to upgrade the team, acquiring such high-priced talent as Curt Schilling and Keith Foulke; their player payroll of $120 million is second only to the Yankees', at nearly $200 million. The Red Sox (and their fans) were rewarded, of course, in 2004 with the team's first World Series championship since 1918.
 You might think, given the team's economics under the previous owners, that the new guys would be drowning in red ink -- that their desire to bring joy to Beantown caused them to lose their heads financially. Far from it. As Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College and the author of the recent book ''In the Best Interests of Baseball?,'' puts it, the Red Sox ''are on the cutting edge of a trend that has taken place over the last 15 years: the sport is finally starting to act like a real business.'' When the new owners bought the team, revenue was south of $150 million; today, it's over $250 million. They've turned their cable network from marginally profitable to enormously profitable, with revenue more than quadrupling. Perhaps most impressive of all, even old, outmoded Fenway Park has been turned into a cash machine.
 Which means that Sox fans have a new question to wrestle with, now that they no longer have to wonder why their beloved team never wins the World Series. That is, How do they feel about the Olde Towne Team being run as a serious, profit-making enterprise? Truth is, they'd better get used to it. Given the demands placed on a modern sports franchise -- to pay down debt, field a competitive team and generate a return to its owners -- there's not a whole lot of choice these days. The way the Red Sox used to be run, that's what doesn't make sense anymore.
 It's hardly a secret, of course, that sports -- all sports -- have become very big business. Companies spend tens of millions of dollars for the right to attach their names to stadiums. Leagues work hard to maximize the amount they can extract from television contracts and licensing rights. As a business, though, baseball has always had a peculiar set of problems. A football owner can go corporate and nobody minds very much. But baseball still has an aura of romance and nostalgia attached to it, so fans have a harder time coming to terms with its business underpinnings. High-priced seats and scads of luxury boxes tend to upset baseball fans more than they do football fans, for instance. And whenever there's a bout of labor unrest in baseball, fans are inclined to turn away from the sport, at least temporarily, accusing all involved of greed. Baseball is still the one sport with an antitrust exemption, which was predicated on the notion that it was something other than a typical business. Even now, it's hard to let go of that.
 On the other hand, baseball owners have plenty of need to maximize revenue. For one thing, it's difficult to field a competitive team without some business savvy, mainly because baseball is the one major American sport that lacks a salary cap. So no matter how big or small the market you're in, you're always competing for free agents with the wealthiest team of them all: the Yankees, who effectively set the price for players. There are, to be sure, other ways to build competitive teams (take the Oakland A's, for example, or the Minnesota Twins), but as a rule, the teams with the biggest payrolls tend to be the teams that make the playoffs most often.
 In addition, baseball lacks the billion-dollar revenue stream that football has in its lucrative national television deals. A mediocre football owner is still virtually guaranteed a profit. A mediocre baseball operator, however, being far more dependent on local revenue and without the benefit of a salary cap, can lose millions. Many do.
 Larry Lucchino, who holds the title of chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox, will never be mistaken for a mediocre baseball operator. Although he has plenty of rough edges, the 60-year-old Lucchino is, in fact, the prototype of the smart, modern baseball man.
 Lucchino built his reputation in Baltimore, where he ran the Orioles. In the late 1980's, when most baseball teams were playing in sterile multipurpose stadiums, Lucchino persuaded the owner, the legendary Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, to build a new, baseball-only stadium. Camden Yards, the resulting stadium -- excuse me, ballpark -- in many ways perfectly represents the way Lucchino thinks about the business of baseball. It is, without question, a wonderful nod to a time gone by, an irregularly shaped field that is bound to remind older fans of parks they visited when they were children.
 It is also a fabulous marketing device. Fans have flocked to it; within a few years of the ballpark's opening, the Orioles reached the three-million figure in attendance in a season for the first time. And once the fans were there, they bought things -- something Camden Yards was quite consciously constructed to facilitate. There were aisles wide enough for waitresses to go from seat to seat, taking orders and bringing back food. Restaurants and souvenir stands dotted the park. The concourses were wide because, as Lucchino puts it, ''milling around is important to spending money.''
 What's more, Lucchino took that same principle -- playing up the romance of baseball while never forgetting the commerce -- to every aspect of the Orioles' management. Even as he pushed his staff to generate more money, he stressed the importance of community relations to help the team bond with the city. He was a stickler for having players spend time signing autographs. He believed strongly that if he created the right atmosphere, fans would come to ballgames even when the team wasn't doing well.
 It's a blueprint Lucchino took with him to San Diego (increase attendance, make nice with the community, build a new ballpark). And then on to Boston.
 Not long ago, Dan Shaughnessy, The Boston Globe's premier sports columnist (and also an employee of The New York Times Company, which owns The Globe), lacerated the Red Sox ownership for what he described as its ''ceaseless grab for cash.'' While acknowledging that the team needs new revenue streams ''to keep up with the Yankees,'' he complained that at Fenway now ''everything is for sale.'' He wrote, ''The official theme song of the 2006 Boston Red $ox is 'Ca-ching!'''
 This is something you hear a fair amount of if you live in Massachusetts, as I do. And I suppose it isn't hard to see what he means. Fenway now has some of the most expensive seats in baseball, at $275 a pop. There is a new scoreboard in left-center field that was built as part of a deal with Bank of America, whose logo adorns it. One section of expensive seats is called the EMC Club; EMC, a technology company with its headquarters nearby, bought the naming rights. There's a new seating area on the right-field roof, called the Budweiser Right Field Stands. The Red Sox have even taken advantage of the phrase ''Red Sox Nation'' -- popularized by Shaughnessy himself -- to generate revenue. For $59.95, you can join the ''official'' Red Sox Nation and get certain perks, like the opportunity to buy choice seats at select games.
 None of these things existed before the new owners arrived. There was a purity to Fenway Park that was pleasing to baseball fans, but that was also one reason the team was becoming increasingly uncompetitive financially. The Lucchino group bought the team from a trust set up by Tom Yawkey and his wife, Jean, who had owned the team since 1933. Their way of doing things was old-fashioned in the extreme, and as Lucchino puts it, ''There was a lot of low-hanging fruit.''
 What's striking about the new owners is not their rapaciousness, I'd argue, but just its opposite. Yes, the Red Sox are run far more commercially than they used to be, but under Lucchino they haven't forgotten that the central lure of baseball is its romance. Sure, the Red Sox have $275 seats, but they also still sell $12 bleacher seats, which could go for a far higher price. There is a lot more signage in Fenway now, but not nearly as much as you see in other ballparks. Season tickets are pushed more than before, but everyone else is also getting a fairer shot at a ticket once or twice a season. ''We're not trying to squeeze every drop of blood,'' says Janet Marie Smith, who serves as the Red Sox' in-house architect (a role she also served in Baltimore when Camden Yards was being built).
 The best evidence of this balance is Fenway Park itself. Instead of trying to replace it, the new owners came to town committed to building the franchise around the park. ''Fenway had been one of the inspirations for Camden Yards,'' Lucchino says. ''We wanted to try to preserve it.'' So far, the team has spent about $100 million on improvements.
 One sunny Wednesday morning this spring, while the team was on a road trip, Smith took me through the park. She showed me the new seats near the dugout, which were added the first winter after the new owners took over. They looked exactly like all the other seats in the park -- nothing fancy at all. She took me up to the new rows of seats above the Green Monster in left field, which were added in the second year. When those seats were first proposed, many people thought it was a heretical idea; now fans clamor for a chance to watch a game from there. She took me to the new right-field roof area, where people can have picnics while watching the game. She talked the whole time about the need to blend the old with the new, so that the place didn't lose its character. And while Fenway is never going to have those wide aisles that allow waitresses to take orders, Smith and her colleagues have ingeniously integrated two buildings, one next to left field and the other next to right, into Fenway itself. The result is big, wide concourses and lots more space for restaurants and bars. In other words, plenty of places for people to mill around and buy things.
 Though Smith never mentioned the word ''revenue,'' it wasn't hard to see how the improvements had helped brighten the financial picture for the Red Sox. From where I'm sitting, it looks like the team has hit something like a triple: good team in a great ballpark, smart owners, money rolling in. Red Sox fans can't really ask for more.

HEADLINE: HAPPY JUST TO BE HERE

BYLINE: By Michael Sokolove. 
Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''The Ticket Out: Darryl Strawberry and the Boys of Crenshaw.

 BODY:
Meet your Florida Marlins, the best team that the lowest payroll in baseball can buy, and their first-year manager, the ex-Yankee Joe Girardi, who -- when you analyze it -- has a terrific job. Sure, he has a bad team. But you want to see some happy boys? Girardi's boys are happy. And grateful, too. They may not all be exactly big leaguers yet, and some may never be, but by the grace of baseball's lopsided economic system -- and because nearly every established Marlin was traded away in the off-season -- they are in the big leagues. Inscribed, for all eternity, in the Baseball Encyclopedia. How great is that!
 So they listen to their manager. They bust it down to first base on every hopeless infield groundout and race around the bases on two-out pop-ups, just in case one gets lost in the sun or the lights. The losses pile up, and the players come to the ballpark early each day to try to get better. As often as not, they don't solve their problems but ingrain them deeper. ''Our kids work so hard,'' Girardi says ruefully. ''But half the time they're working hard at the wrong things.'' 
Many, many hours before an April game at Chicago's Wrigley Field -- several hours, in fact, before batting practice -- three Marlins sat on a brick wall beside the visitors' dugout. They were in a state of wonder. Perhaps euphoria. They were already dressed to play, like Little Leaguers who jump out of bed at sunrise and wriggle right into their uniforms.
 The veteran in this trio was Matt Cepicky, 28, a hefty, shaggy-haired, left-handed outfielder who lives in Eureka, Mont., and looks a bit like a poor man's Jason Giambi. Over the course of his seven previous professional seasons, Cepicky had participated, without distinction, in 80 big-league games. Sitting beside him was Dan Uggla, 26, a veteran of five minor-league seasons, none of them above Double A. Last year his baseball salary was $1,500 a month, just for the season, which he supplemented by giving hitting lessons to kids: $30 for 30 minutes of learning to hit the Dan Uggla Way. Now Uggla, as the Marlins' starting second baseman, was making the major-league minimum of $327,000 -- about $54,000 a month.
 Beside Uggla was Reggie Abercrombie, 24, the most heartbreaking of all the Marlins. Abercrombie is ''all tooled up,'' as Girardi puts it. He's 6 feet 3 inches tall and 218 pounds, a carved-in-granite outfielder with a sweet soul, blinding speed, upper-deck power, a bazooka for an arm and a seemingly total inability to hit a breaking ball. He whiffs at good curveballs. And average curveballs. And hanging curveballs that all but hover in the strike zone, begging to be crushed. After watching Abercrombie's ''approach'' at the plate, as baseball folks like to say, I wondered if he could hit my curveball.
 On this evening at Wrigley, Abercrombie would start in center field, and he and his two buddies were gazing out in that direction, trying to ascertain if the 400-foot sign that marks the deepest part of the park is really in dead-center field, as it appeared from their vantage point. Someone had told them it was not, but they couldn't tell for sure. Uggla trotted over to home plate to scout things out, then returned with his report: the marker was definitely not in dead center. Abercrombie nodded, digesting yet another new piece of big-league intelligence.
 The other Marlins began to file out of the clubhouse and onto the field: the scrawny rookie outfielder Eric Reed, who looks as if he needs nothing so much as a square meal, bounded out of the tunnel cradling his glove and pregame snack, a heaping bowl of Lucky Charms. He was followed by Matt Treanor, a catcher who spent 10 seasons in the minors before being called up and is known around baseball (to the extent that he's known at all) mainly for being married to Misty May, the Olympic gold-medal beach volleyballer. Next came Josh Johnson, a massive pitcher with all of 26 days of previous big-league service -- and then another hurler, Dontrelle Willis, an established star at 24, who, Girardi notes, seems (at least for now) happy to be playing with his chronological ''peer group.''
 The Marlins, World Series champs in 1997 and 2003, draw poorly -- 6,017 showed for a recent game -- and play in an utterly charmless facility: a football stadium plunked down beside the Florida Turnpike. Girardi, 41, was hired last October by the owner, Jeffrey Loria, to manage the team. A couple weeks later, yet another attempt to secure public funding for a new ballpark stalled. Loria, who won a World Series in his second year as owner and was tired of absorbing financial losses, decided to ''take the roster down'' and build it back up with prospects. By the start of spring training, the Marlins' entire all-star infield -- Carlos Delgado, Luis Castillo, Alex Gonzalez and Mike Lowell, along with the speedy center fielder Juan Pierre and the pitchers Josh Beckett and A. J. Burnett -- had been shipped out.
 The payroll was slashed to $15 million, a figure that is exceeded by the individual salaries of five Yankees, whose team payroll is $198 million. Even the payroll of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays -- which, at $35 million, is the second lowest in baseball -- is more than twice that of the Marlins. The Marlins received real prospects in return for their established players -- ''Baseball America'' ranks the franchise third among all clubs in farm-system talent -- but the big club was left barren. What remains is an assemblage of talented kids called up too soon, veteran castoffs and career minor leaguers getting their miracle shot.
 As the Marlins began to stretch and play catch before the game at Wrigley, Loria, a Yale-educated Manhattan art dealer, strode out onto the ballpark's lush grass. I told him that I wondered what it was like to be part of this year's Florida Marlins. ''You make it sound like a pejorative,'' he said. Not at all, I answered. From my perspective, it seemed that being a Florida Marlin in 2006 -- as distinct from a Florida Marlin fan -- was a beautiful thing.
 In every new city the team visits, Girardi is asked the same question: Did he know he would have to field a team that looks like a bunch of September call-ups? That he would have to compete without essential pieces -- no left-handed reliever, for example? His diplomatic answer: he was ''prepared'' for it. He knew that it could happen if the stadium talks foundered, but he took the job because he (like many others in baseball) respected the acumen of Loria and his front office.
 ''I was willing to take that chance because they've made great trades in the past and they've gotten good pitching,'' Girardi told me. ''People call me up and say they feel bad for me. I say: 'You feel bad? For what? I spent one year coaching in the big leagues, zero in the minor leagues, and now I'm one of 30 guys managing a big-league team. You'd love to be doing what I'm doing.' ''
 irardi was the classic small-town sports hero. High school quarterback. Star catcher on the baseball team. When he wasn't on the ball fields, he worked as a busboy, mopping floors at his father's restaurant in Washington, Ill., near Peoria. He played baseball at Northwestern University, where he earned a degree in industrial engineering, then spent three years in the Chicago Cubs' minor-league system. In the season that Girardi played ball in Peoria, he lived at home with his widower father, who always made sure to send him off on the long minor-league bus rides with a brown bag lunch.
 Girardi's 15-year major-league career was constructed from decent talent and a lot of hard work and baseball savvy. He was never the most confident of players nor the most thick-skinned, and his failings plagued him. As a Yankee from 1996 to 1999, which included three World Series championships, Girardi was close to Paul O'Neill, the passionate right fielder (and well-known hothead and helmet thrower). Part of what they had in common was their torment -- Girardi was just more private about his.
 ''One night in my second year in the big leagues,'' Girardi recalled, ''I came home after a game -- we were living in a small town house at the time -- and my wife, Kim, came downstairs and said, 'Why aren't you sleeping up here?' And I said to her, 'I'm playing so bad I'm not worthy to sleep in the same bed as you.' I mean, it's just crazy what goes through your mind.''
 After he was traded to the Yankees to replace the popular catcher Mike Stanley, Girardi was booed at the team's annual welcome-home dinner, and he remembers seeing signs that said ''Go Back to Colorado,'' his team after the Cubs. Even in the retelling, it was obvious that the incident still stung. ''When they announced my name, I got booed bad, and these were supposed to be a thousand of the Yankees' most loyal fans,'' he said.
 Girardi finished with a .267 career average, but he never felt like much of a hitter, and if he worked too much on that part of his game, he believed, it would come at the expense of his defense. In more than 4,000 major-league at-bats, he hit just 36 home runs. ''As a hitter, I never really had a load,'' he told me, meaning that he couldn't keep his weight back in his stance -- something that's essential for a power hitter. What kept him on big-league rosters was his soundness as a catcher and his baseball mind -- his knack for putting together pitch sequences that defeated hitters.
 In 2001, Girardi got the most votes in a survey that asked players, managers and front-office personnel to pick the likeliest future manager among active major-league players. In his years with the Yankees, whenever he wasn't playing, he sat in the dugout beside Joe Torre, the manager, and the coaches Don Zimmer and Mel Stottlemyre. ''Just to learn,'' he told me. ''I listened to what they were saying, and if I had something to contribute, I was free to.''
 In February, when the Marlins convened in Jupiter, Fla., for spring training, Girardi was just two years removed from playing. He had spent one year as Torre's bench coach after a season in broadcasting. A workout fanatic, he still looked like an athlete -- or maybe more like a marine, with his graying hair shaved into a buzz cut. He lifted weights with his players. He threw batting practice. When he ran with the pitchers and some of the heavier ones had a hard time keeping up, he dropped back in the pack and urged them on. ''We had a couple of really big guys, like 6-foot-5, 250, and they're running with guys who are, like, 190 pounds, and they're being asked to do the same thing. I would just tell them, 'I'm watching you, and I see how hard you're working, so don't be embarrassed.' '' When I asked Girardi why he played such an active physical role, he replied, ''I'm a believing man, and Jesus always walked through things with people, so I wanted to walk through it with them.''
 But it was more than their drills he was walking through with them. There may be a few players in each generation who find baseball to be an easy game -- does Manny Ramirez, even after going hitless for one night, ever wake up the next morning wondering if he can hit? -- but Girardi was among the vast majority who find it excruciatingly difficult. So he felt his players' struggles and insecurities in a direct, almost personal way. ''I still remember what it was like to be a young man in this game,'' he said. ''You go 0 for 4 and you look over your shoulder and think, Is somebody going to replace me? When you first come up, sometimes you think it's your only opportunity, but usually it's not.''
 Girardi has an engineer's orderly mind. As a catcher, he saw each hitter as a puzzle that needed to be solved. What precise order of pitches would get each batter out? He would spend hours thinking about the solutions to equations like this, and as the Marlins' manager, it is still one of his major preoccupations. But the more time I spent with Girardi in Miami and on the road in Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington, the more I noticed another facet of him -- his deep vein of baseball sentimentality. He wants his players to succeed, even if logic, past history and current evidence argue against it.
 I asked him about Reggie Abercrombie, who was struggling so mightily at the plate. Abercrombie had struck out an immense number of times in the minor leagues -- 164 times in just 448 at-bats one year -- which suggests that his deficiencies with breaking balls are not a new phenomenon. But Girardi was desperately hoping to help him. ''Two organizations gave up on Reggie,'' he said. ''But what I've told him is: 'I will not give up on you if you don't give up on yourself. We'll try different things.' People told me during my life what I couldn't do, and it just made me work harder.''
 The Marlins' owner, Jeffrey Loria, trades in 20th-century masters (Picasso, Matisse, Henry Moore, Roy Lichtenstein). In baseball, his specialty has been distressed properties. Loria owned the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), which he sold back to Major League Baseball in 2002, and now owns the Marlins, a franchise that, from its inception in 1993, has been a critical success and a commercial flop. ''I take on situations nobody else wants to touch,'' he explains succinctly.
 Although he angered many fans, Loria insists, with some justification, that his sell-off was different from what occurred after the Marlins' previous World Series victory, in 1997. Unlike former owner H. Wayne Huizenga, who immediately unloaded most of the team's best players, Loria continued to field competitive teams for two seasons after the 2003 World Series -- this while working to gain support for a new stadium. He is still trying for a deal in South Florida, but he has also talked of moving the team elsewhere. In the meantime, this year's Marlins are a funny kind of team: easy to root for, because they're such an earnest, appealing group of young men, but hard to actually watch. (Shortstop Hanley Ramirez, 22, obtained in the off-season from the Red Sox, has looked to be the most advanced of the Marlins' young players; in mid-May, he was leading the National League in batting average.)
 Good baseball teams win mostly in the same ways, with some combination of good pitching, timely hitting and competent fielding. But losing brings many more variables into play, and like all losing teams, the Marlins are quite inventive in this regard. Their pitchers issue an alarming number of walks. Their hitters strike out a lot. They sabotage potential big innings with recklessness on the base paths -- trying to advance from second to third base, for example, on ground balls hit hard right at the shortstop. In the field, they make spectacular plays and then follow them up, at just the wrong moments, with boneheaded ones.
 One night, I watched as the second baseman Dan Uggla, the Double A reclamation project who looks like a genuine hitter, a real find, just missed making a great diving catch of a line drive in the seventh inning of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies that the Marlins were then winning. Two runners scored. As Uggla retrieved the ball, his head down, and slowly walked it back to the mound before flipping it underhand to pitcher Dontrelle Willis, the runner from first base, a speedy Jimmy Rollins, who had already reached third, scooted home and scored. That's not a play you see much in the big leagues.
 The late-April game against the Cubs, on the day that Abercrombie, Uggla and Cepicky (who was later sent back to the minors) tried to plot the exact point of dead center at Wrigley Field, was another typical Marlins affair. Miguel Cabrera, a power-hitting third baseman -- and the one recognizable player, apart from Willis, to be retained over the winter -- hit a two-run homer in the first inning. Jason Vargas, a second-year starting pitcher, turned in the best outing of his career, allowing just one hit in six and a third innings.
 But in the bottom of the eighth, with the Marlins leading, 3-0, the reliever Matt Herges -- at 36, one of the Marlins' few veterans -- allowed a double and a walk. Girardi replaced him with Johnson, an imposing 6-foot-7, 240-pound 22-year-old. Johnson promptly walked another batter, loading the bases. Then Cabrera fielded a chopper at third base and, trying for a force-out at home, made a low, unfieldable throw, making the score 3-1. After the next hitter struck out, the following batter singled to tie the score -- and then the next Cubs hitter, Jacque Jones, hit a three-run homer.
 In the course of about 10 minutes, a 3-0 lead became a 6-3 deficit, the eventual final score. But that sort of thing happens to the Marlins quite a lot. If games were six innings long, they would have many more wins, but they fold late.
 After the game, in the cramped visitors' clubhouse, it was striking how absolutely devastated the young Marlins were. You want to see some professional athletes who care? Here was a whole room full of them. Nobody was in a hurry to shower and pull on his clothes and jewelry and see what action might be found in the Windy City. Most of the players sat on stools in front of their locker stalls, just staring into space.
 Girardi always took losing hard, but as a manager he has worked on what he calls his demeanor. In the dugout, he tries not to even wince when something goes wrong. His preferred way of correcting mistakes is to approach a player the following day in the clubhouse or on the field and have a quiet conversation. ''That's one of the things I learned from Joe Torre,'' he told me. ''Players know when they screw up. They don't need me ranting and raving.''
 After losing to the Cubs, Girardi sat in an office just around the corner from his dejected players. The great thing about having such a young team, he said, was that they quickly forget the previous game and come back the next day enthused and ready to play. ''Our guys will bounce back,'' he said. ''That's one thing I don't worry about. They compete every day.''
 Girardi figures that his team will stop pressing so much in the late innings and learn to win more of the close games. But the possibility certainly exists that the young Marlins will get worn down by defeat and start getting blown out of games. In May, the team tied a franchise record with 11 consecutive home losses. After the collapse against the Cubs, a beat writer asked Girardi if it would be hard for him to sleep that night. ''No harder than when I was a player,'' he said. ''I didn't sleep too good after losses then, either. I took it personally.''
 Many of the young Marlins have never been to the National League cities the team visits, not even New York or Washington. They walk around during the day and do a little shopping, usually staying pretty close to the team's hotel, but they don't go out much at night. Reggie Abercrombie speculated that maybe they'd venture out more ''after we get those million-dollar contracts.'' And besides, he said, he had a girlfriend back home in Columbus, Ga., and didn't need to be out sampling any night life.
 The Marlins, at that point, were on a pace to lose more than 100 games, and Abercrombie, despite having hit memorable upper-deck home runs in Cincinnati and Washington, was struggling to keep his average above .200. He said that he felt Girardi's support -- ''I couldn't have no better manager'' -- and that his experience with the Marlins, so far, had been ''fun.''
 When I asked what, specifically, had been fun, he looked at me as if I were from outer space. ''Everything,'' he said. ''I'm in the big leagues, you know what I mean?''

HEADLINE: Seeking Ring for Other Hand

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: EDMONTON, Alberta, June 1 

 BODY:
The Edmonton Oilers cannot ignore the massive beer advertisement on the building across Wayne Gretzky Drive from their arena. After practices and games at Rexall Place, it greets them as they pull out of the parking lot. It has for more than a decade.
 Side by side are pictures of the five Stanley Cup rings won by the Oilers, in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990. Each ring is the size of a car. Next to the last one it reads ''And now for the other hand.''
It was surely meant to encourage the team toward more championships. But it has silently mocked the franchise, a proud one that gave birth to an Edmonton motto, City of Champions, and one that almost went extinct, more than once. 
 Now the advertisement again seems topical and the goal manageable. After years of trading championship aspirations for mere survival, the Oilers are entering the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in 16 years. The best-of-seven series with the Carolina Hurricanes begins Monday in Raleigh, N.C. 
 Just the thought of four more victories has brought a happy hysteria to this sprawling prairie city. It has also spawned occasional postgame window-bashing, firemaking and phone-booth toppling on Whyte Avenue, an eclectic strip of bars and boutiques.
 ''I don't think the fans expected us to get this far this fast,'' Oilers right wing Georges Laraque said. ''But now that we have, they are hungry for more. The streets are paying for it.''
 Edmonton is the smallest metropolitan market in the N.H.L., with roughly a million people. Yet all but one regular-season game was sold out at the 16,839-seat Rexall Place, long called Northlands Coliseum, where banners line the rafters and players still walk through the crowd from the locker room to the ice and back again. 
 Edmonton is a place with an economy built on oil and an identity built on the Oilers. 
 ''The team has provided a huge symbolic value, an icon value, to keep Edmonton recognized as a so-called major league city in North America, and even the rest of the world,'' said Cal Nichols, the team's chairman.
 The Oilers also represent a bellwether for the health of the N.H.L. They exuberantly ushered in the high-scoring go-go 1980's, then nearly went bust in the free-spending, money-chasing 1990's. Now they best represent the new, fiscally responsible N.H.L., in which even the Edmontons of the league have a chance at survival and championships.
 The Oilers find themselves simultaneously chasing and trying to outskate their past. The franchise was one of four World Hockey Association teams to join the N.H.L. in 1979, (the Hartford Whalers, now the Carolina Hurricanes, were another), but the Oilers were the ones who brought along an 18-year-old Gretzky. Their first three N.H.L. draft picks were Kevin Lowe, Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson. The next two drafts landed Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri and Grant Fuhr . 
 Those players became the nucleus of one of hockey's most dynamic dynasties, winning five championships in seven years and lifting the cachet of little Edmonton, the northernmost city in a league soon to be headed south, literally and figuratively.
 By 2004, the Oilers had been saved twice, largely through efforts led by Nichols. Average team payrolls in the league quadrupled in the previous decade. The Oilers, in a small market, with one-third the payroll of some competitors and hampered by a weak Canadian dollar, were bleeding money and talent.
 ''Gary Bettman kept telling us, 'Figure out how to survive until 2004,' '' Nichols said, referring to the N.H.L. commissioner. ''We knew that unless something changed, there was no long-term future for the N.H.L. in Edmonton.''
 For Oilers fans, the first sign of trouble came in 1988, when the owner Paul Pocklington sent Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings, mostly for cash. It began a slow sell-off of the franchise's famous assets. After making the playoffs in their first 13 seasons, the Oilers missed the next four, beginning in 1993. 
 Their slide came as the N.H.L. appeared to be growing, moving stagnant franchises south to burgeoning markets and filling in geographic gaps with expansion teams. But the shifts were decoys to decay, and the Oilers were dying.
 Fans in Edmonton knew what was happening. In 1995, the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche. In 1996, the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes. Edmonton appeared to be next, and the season-ticket base fell to a low of 6,200. 
 The league tried to prop up the remaining Canadian teams by offering millions of dollars of assistance if franchises could increase season-ticket sales to 13,000, among other requirements. That is when Nichols, a plain-talking, self-made millionaire from Saskatchewan, who had founded a chain of gas stations called Gasland, threw his business acumen, and part of his fortune, behind the franchise. He steered the successful ticket drive.
 A year later, finances forced Pocklington to sell, and Nichols knew Edmonton had no one with the money or the desire to take on a failing franchise. Using the same strategy that built his mom-and-pop gas-station empire, he created the Edmonton Investors Group, asking for contributions of at least $1 million. Share the risk, he said, and make it the city's team. 
 Still, the Oilers were a tough sell, at least until a Houston businessman made an offer to buy the team and move it to Texas. That provided the necessary urgency; in the end, a group of 38 investors bought the Oilers and kept them in Edmonton. The group now numbers 35.
 ''We're the only team in the league with more owners than players,'' Nichols said. ''We're not ashamed of that. In fact, we're very proud of it.''
 It was still just a stalling tactic for the franchise's long-term viability. Every year, it seemed, they lost another emerging star who outgrew the team's finances. But the Oilers still made the playoffs in six of the eight seasons from 1997 to 2004. Relying on youth and spunk more than talent and experience, they made the second round only twice, and never threatened to go further.
 ''We just wanted to stay competitive until we got a new, more fair and balanced deal that would enable us to compete at a level we hadn't been able to,'' said Coach Craig MacTavish, who, as a player, won three Stanley Cups with the Oilers and another with the Rangers in 1994. ''At the time, we really felt like we were a couple of players away, but we couldn't get those players because we couldn't afford them.''
 And somehow, the city supported them, because, quite simply, they had not lost them. 
 The collective-bargaining agreement expired two summers ago, leading to a lockout by owners -- one that probably saved the Oilers a third time. A canceled season forced a new agreement, with revenue sharing, a cap on payroll and an immediate 24 percent rollback on player salaries.
 Many of the league's perennial contenders had to slash payroll, but the Oilers were finally in a position to spend. They acquired Chris Pronger to anchor their defense, and wing Michael Peca for scoring punch. 
 ''I wanted to believe it was Sean Pronger, not Chris, because I couldn't believe we could get him,'' Laraque said. Sean Pronger was a journeyman N.H.L. forward, not a former league most valuable player. ''Until I saw Chris, I thought it was an April Fool's joke. We knew right then that things were going to be good.''
 When March's trade deadline approached, the Oilers added instead of subtracted, trading for goalie Dwayne Roloson and wing Sergei Samsonov, adding them to a young core that had been built through the draft.
 ''We had waited for that time, and at the same time we developed our young guys, and they were benefiting from that extra amount of ice time,'' MacTavish said. ''So when the deal did get hammered out, it put us in a pretty good position. You land a guy like Chris Pronger, and after that Michael Peca, and you give yourself instant credibility and you give yourself a chance. You can't hope to win the Stanley Cup if you don't have the best players.''
 The team still lost money this past regular season -- about $1.5 million, Nichols said -- but they squeaked into the playoffs, and each home playoff game brings in about $1 million of revenue. Nichols is confident enough in the long-term prospects that he has floated the idea of a new arena.
 Deep inside the old one, in the Oilers' locker room, is a blue metal door. It opens to a video room that used to be the coach's office, and is pocked with three fist-sized dents caused by the butt ends of hockey sticks. It was how players like Messier announced that they were ready to play.
 The door serves as a type of growth chart, like pencil marks on the wall of a child's bedroom. It is covered in small Oilers stickers -- one for each playoff victory, with each season assigned a new row. Some rows have no stickers; five of them, near the top of the door, have the number required to win the championship (now 16), with a shiny Silver Cup sticker taped at the end. 
 After a period of stunted growth, there are 12 stickers next to the 2005-6 label.
 ''That door will go to the Hall of Fame,'' said Lowe, now the team's general manager. 
 Just not yet. The Oilers have some more history to write.

HEADLINE: Risking a Red Card: The Time Has to Be Right

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Anyone who follows basketball or football knows there are certain situations in which it is better to commit a foul rather than give an opponent a chance to score. Soccer is no different. But when, exactly, is the right time to incur the referee's wrath?
 Last month, the Champions League final in Paris between Barcelona and Arsenal presented such a situation. 
 In that game, Samuel Eto'o of Barcelona, the striker from Cameroon, was racing toward goal early in a scoreless match. Eto'o had already beaten Arsenal's defense, and only Jens Lehmann, the German national team's first-string goalkeeper, could stop him.
 Eto'o, one of the top forwards in the world, nipped the ball past Lehmann, and it was then that Lehmann faced a decision -- foul Eto'o and risk expulsion from the match, or let him pass for a certain goal.
 Lehmann grabbed his ankle and sent him reeling. The referee Terje Hauge of Norway whistled the play dead and showed Lehmann a red card -- thus ending his participation in the biggest match of the European season after less than 18 minutes.
 Barcelona's Ronaldinho, the Brazilian wizard and the world player of the year, failed to score on the resulting free kick. But Arsenal had to play the rest of the match with 10 men instead of 11, and lost, 2-1.
 Did Lehmann make the right decision from a statistical perspective? For Geert Ridder of the University of Southern California and his co-authors in research, the answer is yes. They analyzed Dutch professional soccer from 1989 to 1992, using the assumption that the defending player's objective was to minimize the probability of losing the match -- a decent model for the Champions League final, and for the knockout rounds of the World Cup.
 The researchers found that with two evenly matched teams -- a tournament's two finalists often are -- a player should foul to avert a certain goal anytime after the 16th minute. Lehmann acted prudently, with a minute to spare.
 But what about games in the World Cup's group stage? Michael Wright, a senior lecturer in management science at Lancaster University in Britain, and Nobuyoshi Hirotsu, one of his former doctoral students, used data from the 1999-2000 English Premier League to see what would happen if a defender instead tried to maximize the number of points his team took from the match. In the English leagues (and others around the world), as in the World Cup's group stage, teams receive 3 points for a victory, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.
 The Lancaster twosome -- again looking at evenly matched teams -- found that the defender should always foul to avert a certain goal if his team is losing by one or two goals, and should never foul if his team is leading by two goals or more. If his team is winning by one goal or the game is tied, the gains by fouling begin from 7 to 13 minutes through the first 45-minute half, depending on whether the team is playing at home or away.
 Wright and Hirotsu also discovered that committing the foul increased the chances of winning much more for the team that is already leading. The gains for the losing team are not as large. But in a few situations, such as when one team is leading by a goal between minutes 28 and 41, a red card against that team actually improves both clubs' chances of winning -- only the probability of a draw is reduced.
 The question was recently asked in a different way by Marco Caliendo, a senior research associate at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, and Dubravko Radic, an assistant professor of retailing and service management at the University of Wuppertal: How much does it matter that a red-carded player's team is reduced to 10 men for the rest of the match?
 They used records of the World Cup tournaments from 1930 through 2002 to measure the effect of red cards. To hone their results as finely as possible, they considered only red cards awarded when a game was tied and neither team had a home advantage.
 Caliendo and Radic found that a red card did not give either team an advantage in scoring after roughly the 60th minute of a 90-minute match. Absorbing the card and the expulsion was clearly preferable to allowing a goal as the match drew to a close. Earlier in the match, however, red cards actually raised both teams' chances of scoring, but the 11-man team gained a strong advantage.
 So if Germany's Michael Ballack is steaming through the Costa Rican defense on Friday in the World Cup's opening match, will the men at the back glance up at the clock before deciding whether to take him down? There is usually not time to think in such situations. But if it happens late in the second half, they shouldn't think once -- let alone twice.

HEADLINE: A Farm Town Strives for Energy Independence 

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: REYNOLDS, Ind. 

 BODY:
This corn and soybean and hog farming town, which pops up out of nowhere at a crossroads and disappears as fast, has only 533 residents left. As in many withering rural communities, worries here lean toward keeping the school open, persuading sons and daughters to stay and finding a role for small farms in a changed economy. But a different worry has risen here, too.
 With government financing and help from state agriculture officials, Reynolds is wrestling with the nation's dependence on ordinary energy supplies and starting a one-town rebellion. Some say the goal may be too ambitious, too fantastic, for any place, much less little Reynolds.
True, most of the plans are just that, for now. But in the end, the town wants to secede from America's energy grid and power itself entirely with renewable sources, like its corn and pigs. 
 The push might seem less surprising in a counterculture bastion like Berkeley, Calif., or even in an ecologically focused city like St. Paul. But Reynolds is in a conservative patch of a largely conservative state, a place where many cars are actually pickups and the word ''environmentalist'' can draw a groan. 
 Still, frustration, driven in part by the price of gasoline at the only station in town, has boiled over and rendered ideological labels meaningless. 
 King Van Voorst, 85, a longtime resident, blamed Arab nations for the recent spike in gasoline prices. ''We have got to get some kind of energy going over here to show we can do it ourselves,'' Mr. Van Voorst said. ''And why can't we? They need to know that we can do it, and that we don't need them.''
 The State of Indiana first brought the idea to Reynolds last year, calling it BioTown, in an experiment Gov. Mitch Daniels acknowledged could be viewed as a bit of ''a stunt.'' But in the ensuing months and as the price of gasoline soared, Reynolds adopted the notion as its own, and residents began speaking passionately of an end to their reliance on foreign oil and of the potential electricity they could envision in the more than 150,000 pigs that wander nearby.
 Since November, nearly 100 of the community's residents have begun driving cars that can run on ethanol-based fuel, as has the employee who drives one of the town's three vehicles. The other two town cars have been replaced with diesel vehicles, so they can run on bio-diesel fuel like vegetable oil. 
 And this month, officials here began work on a plant that would allow Reynolds to draw its electricity from pig and cow manure, as well as human waste. After that, they say they want to make their own renewable natural gas with the methane from the waste of those same pigs, cows and people.
 Plenty of cities have tackled parts of the same concept, filling city fleets with hybrid cars, installing solar panels on municipal building roofs or building miles of bicycle paths, but Thomas C. Dorr, an under secretary for the federal Department of Agriculture, said he knew of no effort as comprehensive as Reynolds's plan.
 Mr. Van Voorst seems a fitting example of this town's unlikely support for the idea. The booming campaign in town to sell cars that can run on ethanol-based fuel to residents at significant discounts may hurt Mr. Van Voorst's own business -- a used-car lot where he sits at a desk most days waiting for someone to step inside. 
 Still, he said the effort was worth it, whatever the lost business. In fact, he recently bought himself a new Chevrolet Silverado pickup, a flex-fuel vehicle that can run on E-85, which is 85 percent ethanol, or on regular gasoline.
 In a way, the passion that has emerged seems to be as much about helping to save this town as it is about walking away from the reliance on traditional energy sources. 
 The thought that the items so abundant in these fields may create electricity seems to soothe a worry people here have long held about the future of the region's farms. And the common goal of turning this place into BioTown seems to have jump-started the hopes of those who, over the years, have watched two grocery stores close, the Big Boy's garage shut down, the barber move away.
 ''There's only one way for this town to go,'' Mr. Van Voorst said.
 The state's choice of Reynolds was nearly happenstance. In 2005, state agriculture officials wandered the map in search of a small town near big roads and with a large livestock population. It was to be not too far from Purdue University, which could supply needed academic assistance for a ''showcase'' on renewable energy. 
 Even with financial and technical backing from the state and federal grants from the Department of Energy, there are those here who wonder if BioTown will ever be more than a political press release. Will there really be the more than the $7 million in private financing it will take to design the ''technology suite'' that officials announced here in May to turn animal waste, municipal waste, corn stover and other remains into electricity? 
 Jody Snodgrass, a principal at Rose Energy Discovery Inc., the managing investor for the technology, said that the project was already drawing investors, and that construction on the plant would start this fall.
 In an interview, Governor Daniels said that no amount of state encouragement could make the Reynolds plan work; the real test, he said, would lie in private investment in a town that functions solely on renewable fuels. ''Life is risk,'' he said. ''Ultimately, this concept has to be self-sustaining.''
 Already, Reynolds has seen the first snag along the way to self-sufficiency. 
 Despite all the new flex-fuel cars on the streets of Reynolds (20 of them two-year leases given away by General Motors, and about 80 more bought by locals, many of whom adorned them with ''BioTown'' license plates), there is no ethanol-based fuel for sale in town. 
 The nearest E-85 pump is many miles away, so nearly every car here is still powered by ordinary gasoline.
 John Harris, who owns the only local gas station, said he had faced criticism lately from neighbors. He had hoped to remake his station by now into a ''BioIsland'' that would sell E-85 and bio-diesel. But Mr. Harris, who said he endorsed the notion of his town turning only to renewable fuels, said he found that he could not afford to add underground tanks and pumps, even with financial help. 
 As pounding rain fell at the station on a recent afternoon, Mr. Harris, 50, said he was selling the place. His successors, he said, would be able to afford to put in the new tanks, and, with any luck, would be providing ethanol-based fuel by the end of June. Don Good, one of the new owners, said August was more realistic.
 ''I like what they're trying to do here,'' Mr. Harris said of the BioTown idea. ''From a business standpoint, though, it's a little shaky.'' 
 What if he paid hundreds of thousands to install the new tanks, he wondered, and there still were not enough E-85 customers to pay for it? In places like Indiana, home to a small though growing number of the nation's 100 or so ethanol production facilities, the price of E-85 is not much less than ordinary gasoline, Mr. Harris said. What if those with flex-fuel cars went right on buying gasoline?
 ''It's a good thing in the long run,'' he said, ''but BioTown basically made me lose the store.''
 At the USA Family Restaurant, the men who gather each morning and afternoon for coffee said they had become firm believers that the lights here, even the coffeepot, would soon be run on the waste from pigs. Almost all of them have bought flex-fuel cars. 
 ''You get your naysayers, of course, but I'm not one of them,'' said Fred Buschman, a member of the Reynolds Town Council. ''This is as real as it gets.''

HEADLINE: Border Patrol Draws Increased Scrutiny as President Proposes an Expanded Role

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: PHOENIX, June 2 

 BODY:
With a proposed major expansion, the Border Patrol may soon overtake the F.B.I. as the largest federal law enforcement agency. But the stepped-up mission comes as the Border Patrol wrestles with recruitment and training difficulties, and several agents face accusations of misconduct.
 In response to concerns, the inspector general's office of the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the Border Patrol, said it would audit the agency's recruitment, hiring and training practices to determine if it can handle the rapid expansion. A spokeswoman, Tamara Faulkner, said the review could begin this month.
David V. Aguilar, the chief of the Border Patrol, told Congress last week that the extraordinary growth was vital to national security, particularly as the authorities seek to clamp down on illegal crossings along the Mexican border. The agency has swelled to more than 11,000 agents from 4,000 15 years ago, with 6,000 more proposed by President Bush by 2008 as a cornerstone of his immigration overhaul. 
 ''The nexus between our post-Sept. 11 mission and our traditional role is clear,'' Chief Aguilar said. ''Terrorists and violent criminals may exploit smuggling routes used by migrants to enter the United States illegally and do us harm.'' 
 But as the Border Patrol seeks more agents, its training academy in Artesia, N.M., needs expansion, and some watchdog groups question its ability to prepare so many new agents in so little time. As a temporary measure, thousands of National Guard troops will soon be dispatched here in Arizona and elsewhere along the 2,000-mile border to assist with logistics and support work.
 ''This is not something where you can snap your fingers and have thousands go on the job,'' said Deborah W. Meyers, an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ''It is a demanding job, and training is important and intense.''
 Big buildups in border security in the 1990's coincided with a rash of embarrassing disclosures about wayward agents and questions about how well the agency screened recruits. Those concerns have surfaced again as several agents have been accused of misconduct and immigrant smuggling, including one agent from Mexico who was hired in 2002 even though he is not a United States citizen, as is required.
 In January, the Mexican agent, Oscar Antonio Ortiz, who had falsely claimed citizenship on his job application, pleaded guilty to charges of immigrant smuggling and other crimes and is awaiting sentencing. Mr. Ortiz, 28, had told recruiters he had used cocaine in the past, and investigators later discovered that he had previously been arrested, though not prosecuted, on suspicion of smuggling after immigration officers at San Ysidro, Calif., detained him with two illegal immigrants in his car.
 In March, two Border Patrol supervising agents in California, Mario Alvarez, 44, and Scott McClaren, 43, were also charged with smuggling. The agents had helped set up an antismuggling program with the Mexican authorities. They have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial in San Diego.
 In recent years, several agents have also been convicted of assaulting border crossers and other abuses. Advocates for immigrants have long accused the agency of too often stopping people, particularly Latinos, without proper justification and of giving little public accounting of any results of abuse accusations.
 ''It seems like they just hired Border Patrol agents from Ohio and brought them down here and put them in our communities,'' said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights, a group based in El Paso that monitors law enforcement at the border in Texas and New Mexico. 
 Todd Fraser, a spokesman for the Border Patrol, said a relatively few rogue agents had drawn more attention than the vast majority of honorable ones, including several who had won praise inside and outside the agency for efforts to rescue immigrants stranded in the desert.
 Mr. Fraser said much of the concern about agent misconduct was outdated and overblown. Agents, he said, go through increasingly extensive preparation for jobs that often involve great risks, including the threat of confrontation with armed smugglers.
 ''Border Patrol agents go through a long and intensive training program that makes them among the most highly trained and professional officers out there,'' he said. 
 Some critics have also expressed greater confidence in the agency. Representative Xavier Becerra, a California Democrat who in the early 1990's called for a federal commission to oversee the agency because of its many problems, said it had made great strides in raising standards and curtailing questionable tactics.
 ''I certainly think over the years we are seeing border enforcement become more professional,'' Mr. Becerra said. ''They have done a lot to get in line with professional standards.''
 The Border Patrol has over the years had trouble keeping agents and hiring enough to compensate for the losses. The agents' union blames entry-level pay, which is $35,000 to $40,000, depending on experience, generally lower than many local and state law enforcement agencies. 
 The work, too, is demanding and calls for solitary patrols in the dead of night in forbidding terrain, often arresting the same people over and over again. In all, the agents are responsible for 6,000 miles of land border with Mexico and Canada and 2,000 miles of coastline around Florida and Puerto Rico.
 ''It is mind-numbingly boring to sit in one spot 10 hours a day and watch people stream by and be told your job is not to chase them but call the guy behind you,'' said T. J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents' union, referring to a common tactic of stationing agents and vehicles as a deterrent to smugglers. ''The problem is there often is no guy behind you, because we are short-staffed.''
 A large number of agents left shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to take better-paying jobs in the newly expanded air marshal service. Many have since returned to their old posts, however, and the patrol reports attrition has fallen to about 6 percent, after spiking to nearly 20 percent post-9/11.
 To help meet recruitment goals, the agency has begun an advertising campaign that emphasizes the potential excitement of the job; has raised the maximum starting age to 40 from 37, to attract more military veterans fresh from their service; and has shortened the 20-week training course for recruits who have a command of Spanish, which all agents are required to know.
 The large unknown, Mr. Bonner and others said, is whether Congress will provide the money in coming years to hire agents and whether the agency can bring in enough quality recruits to meet Mr. Bush's goals. 
 Although Congressional legislation authorized 2,000 more agents this year, the final budget wrangling left money for only 1,500. ''It's going to be tough, and it's going to be a challenge, but we are confident we will be able to do it,'' said Maria Valencia, an agency spokeswoman. ''But the money is the key part in all of this.''
 The Border Patrol traces its roots to a Texas Ranger named Jeff Milton, one of the last of the Old West gunslingers who gained fame as one of the men who helped hunt down Geronimo and patrolled the relatively newly drawn Mexican border in the 1880's with horse and pistol. A 1948 biography of him is subtitled ''A Good Man With a Gun.''
 Its agents, some still riding horseback among the tumbleweeds, rely on an arsenal of guns and high-power weapons that surely would have awed Milton, as well as tools he could never have imagined: pilotless aerial drones, all-terrain vehicles, infrared night scopes, embedded motion sensors. These days, the job still attracts applicants with a bit of cowboy in them, people who enjoy the outdoors and do not mind the often rough-and-tumble borderlands.
 Devin Harshbarger, 25, is in his first two months on the job at the Casa Grande station 50 miles southeast of here, some 700 miles from his hometown, Cheyenne, Wyo. 
 ''After 9/11, I wanted to do my part to help keep terrorists out,'' Agent Harshbarger said, adding that he was also drawn to working outdoors.
 The job also attracts people motivated by the immigration debate.
 Adolfo Diaz, 30, an Air Force veteran who is another new recruit, said he got tired of illegal immigrants crossing his family ranch near the Arizona-Mexico border.
 ''Individuals have come to the house, and they have threatened neighbors and families,'' Agent Diaz said. He described his first arrest, of some 25 people hiking across the desert, as scary because he and the two other agents were outnumbered.
 But there is debate whether the new agents can significantly ebb the flow of people crossing the Mexican border, a never-ending stream that another new recruit, Christine Trevino, called ''really crazy.''
 Last year, with 11,106 agents, the Border Patrol arrested 1.2 million people on charges of illegally crossing into the United States; in 1995, with 4,876 agents, it arrested 1.3 million. Arrests peaked in 2000, with 1.6 million made by 9,078 agents, and have swung up and down since even as the ranks of agents has swelled. The Border Patrol estimates that 98 percent of the arrests each year are made on the Mexico border and says a majority of the people detained are Mexicans who are returned to their country, usually within hours.
 The data, and the mix of political, economic and social factors that contribute to illegal immigration, make it difficult to explain the erratic nature of apprehensions and undermine ''the widely accepted assumption that border security will be automatically improved by the hiring of more agents,'' found an analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group connected to Syracuse University.

HEADLINE: Surge in Racist Mood Raises Concerns on Eve of World Cup

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany, June 3 

 BODY:
As he left the soccer field after a club match in the eastern German city of Halle on March 25, the Nigerian forward Adebowale Ogungbure was spit upon, jeered with racial remarks and mocked with monkey noises. In rebuke, he placed two fingers under his nose to simulate a Hitler mustache and thrust his arm in a Nazi salute.
 In April, the American defender Oguchi Onyewu, playing for his professional club team in Belgium, dismissively gestured toward fans who were making simian chants at him. Then, as he went to throw the ball inbounds, Onyewu said a fan of the opposing team reached over a barrier and punched him in the face.
International soccer has been plagued for years by violence among fans, including racial incidents. But FIFA, soccer's Zurich-based world governing body, said there has been a recent surge in discriminatory behavior toward blacks by fans and other players, an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing of more players from Africa and Latin America by elite European clubs. 
 This ''deplorable trend,'' as FIFA has called it, now threatens to embarrass the sport on its grandest stage, the World Cup, which opens June 9 for a monthlong run in 12 cities around Germany. More than 30 billion cumulative television viewers are expected to watch part of the competition and Joseph S. Blatter, FIFA's president, has vowed to crack down on racist behavior during the tournament. 
 Underlining FIFA's concerns, the issue has been included on the agenda at its biannual Congress, scheduled to be held this week in Munich. A campaign against bigotry includes ''Say No to Racism'' stadium banners, television commercials, and team captains making pregame speeches during the quarterfinals of the 32-team tournament.
 Players, coaches and officials have been threatened with sanctions. But FIFA has said it would not be practical to use the harshest penalties available to punish misbehaving fans -- halting matches, holding games in empty stadiums and deducting points that teams receive for victories and ties.
 Players and antiracism experts said they expected offensive behavior during the tournament, including monkey-like chanting; derisive singing; the hanging of banners that reflect neofascist and racist beliefs; and perhaps the tossing of bananas or banana peels, all familiar occurrences during matches in Spain, Italy, eastern Germany and eastern Europe.
 ''For us it's quite clear this is a reflection of underlying tensions that exist in European societies,'' said Piara Powar, director of the London-based antiracist soccer organization Kick It Out. He said of Eastern Europe: ''Poverty, unemployment, is a problem. Indigenous people are looking for easy answers to blame. Often newcomers bear the brunt of the blame.''
 Yet experts and players also said they believed the racist behavior would be more constrained at the World Cup than it was during play in various domestic leagues around Europe, because of increased security, the international makeup of the crowds, higher ticket prices and a sense that spectators would be generally well behaved on soccer's grandest stage.
 ''We have to differentiate inside and outside the stadium,'' said Kurt Wachter, project coordinator for the Vienna-based Football Against Racism in Europe, a network of organizations that seeks to fight bigotry and xenophobia in 35 countries. 
 ''Racism is a feature of many football leagues inside and outside Europe,'' said Wachter, who expects most problems to occur outside stadiums where crowds are less controlled. ''We're sure we will see some things we're used to seeing. It won't stop because of the World Cup.''
 Particularly worrisome are the possibilities of attacks by extremist groups on spectators and visitors in train stations, bars, restaurants and open areas near the stadiums, Wachter and other experts said. To promote tolerance, he said his organization would organize street soccer matches outside World Cup stadiums.
 Recent attacks in the eastern Germany city of Potsdam on an Ethiopian-born engineer and in eastern Berlin on a state lawmaker of Turkish descent, along with a government report showing an increase in right-wing violence, have ignited fears that even sporadic hate crimes and other intolerant behavior could mar the World Cup, whose embracing motto is A Time to Make Friends.
 Far-right extremism is isolated on the fringe of German society, and the German government has intended to confront its Nazi past while preaching openness and tolerance. Germany has one of the world's lowest rates of violent crime. Still, an immigrant group called the Africa Council said it would publish a ''No Go'' guide for nonwhites during the World Cup, particularly for some areas of eastern Berlin and for surrounding towns of the state of Brandenburg.
 In mid-May, a former government spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, caused a furor when he tried to assist visitors by advising that anyone ''with a different skin color'' avoid visiting small and midsize towns in Brandenburg and elsewhere in eastern Germany, or they ''may not leave with their lives.''
 These remarks received blunt criticism from high-ranking German officials. Wolfgang Schauble, the minister of the interior, said there were no areas in which World Cup visitors should feel threatened, calling Germany ''one of the safest places in the world.'' 
 Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, has warned that ''anybody who threatens, attacks or, worse, kills anybody because of the color of his skin or because he comes from another country will face the full force of the law.''
 The Bundesliga in Germany is one of the world's top professional soccer leagues, and has not experienced widespread racism. Incidents involving racial abuse of black players are more prevalent in semiprofessional and amateur leagues in eastern Germany. One of the cities playing host to the World Cup, Leipzig, is in the former East Germany. Another, Berlin, was partly in East Germany.
 After making a Nazi salute, which is illegal in Germany, Ogungbure of Nigeria was investigated by the authorities. But a charge of unconstitutional behavior against him was soon dropped because his gesture had been meant to renounce extremist activity.
 ''I regret what I did,'' Ogungbure said in a telephone interview from Leipzig. ''I should have walked away. I'm a professional, but I'm a human, too. They don't spit on dogs. Why should they spit on me? I felt like a nobody.''
 Gerald Asamoah, a forward on Germany's World Cup team and a native of Ghana, has been recounting an incident in the 1990's when he was pelted with bananas before a club match in Cottbus. ''I'll never forget that,'' he said in a television interview. ''It's like we're not people.'' He has expressed anger and sadness over a banner distributed by a right-wing group that admonished, ''No Gerald, You Are Not Germany.''
 Cory Gibbs, an American defender who formerly played professionally in Germany, said there were restaurants and nightclubs in eastern Germany -- and even around Hamburg in the west -- where he was told ''You're not welcome'' because he was black.
 ''I think racism is everywhere,'' said Gibbs, who will miss the World Cup because of a knee injury. ''But I feel in Germany racism is a lot more direct.'' 
 Racist behavior at soccer matches is primarily displayed by men and is fueled by several factors, according to experts: alcohol; the perceived ''us versus them'' threat of multiculturalism in societies that were once more ethnically homogenous; the difficulteconomic transition of eastern European nations since the fall of the Berlin Wall; and crude attempts to unnerve opposing players during bitter, consuming rivalries.
 Other observers say that the soccer stadium in Europe has become a communal soapbox, one of the few remaining public spaces where spectators can be outrageous and where political correctness does not exist and is even discouraged.
 ''Nowhere else other than football do people meet someplace and have a stage for shouting things as an anonymous mass,'' said Gerd Dembowski, director of a Berlin-based antiracist organization called Floodlight. ''You can shout things you would never say in your normal life, let out your frustrations.''
 Not all the misbehavior can be traced to fans or to Europe. Players and coaches have also been transgressors.
 Luis Aragones, Spain's World Cup coach, was fined in 2004 after making racial remarks about the French star Thierry Henry. In March, in the Brazilian league, the defender Antonio Carlos was suspended for 120 days, and 4 additional matches, after an incident in which he shouted ''monkey'' at an opposing player who was black. But it was an incident in Spain on Feb. 25 that galvanized antiracist sentiment and prodded FIFA into taking a tougher stand against bigoted behavior. That match, in Zaragoza, was temporarily halted in the 77th minute by the referee, who threatened to cancel the remaining 13 minutes after Samuel Eto'o, the star forward for Barcelona, was subjected to a chorus of racial taunts. Eto'o threatened to leave the field. His coach and teammates eventually persuaded him to continue, and last month Barcelona won the European Champions Cup.
 Eto'o has become one of the sport's most outspoken players on the subject of racism. ''I'll continue to play,'' Eto'o, whose national team, Cameroon, did not qualify for the World Cup, said this week through his agent. ''I'm not going to give up and hide and put my head down. I'll score goals against the teams whose fans are making rude noises.'' 
 Under pressure to curb what it acknowledged was an increase in racist incidents, FIFA in late March announced a stricter set of penalties that would apply for club and national team matches. The sanctions would include suspensions of five matches for players and officials who make discriminatory gestures, fines of $16,600 to $25,000 for each offense and two-year stadium bans for offending spectators. It also said teams, which receive 3 points in the standings for a victory, would have 3 points deducted on a first offense by misbehaving players, officials or fans.
 Blatter, the FIFA president, told reporters that the 3-point deduction for abhorrent fan behavior would apply during the World Cup, then backed away from his comments in April. Blatter declined to comment for this article. And it remains unclear exactly what penalties will be levied against World Cup teams for offensive behavior by fans, coaches and players.
 Nicolas Maingot, a FIFA spokesman, said World Cup sanctions would be made public later. But in an e-mail response to questions, he said: ''Only racist abuses in the field of play will be punished. For fans, it will be impossible, due to the multinationality of the audience. In other words, it would be impossible to identify from which side would potential racist abusers come.''
 Critics counter that spectators are supposed to have their names on their tickets, so identifying offending fans should be relatively easy. 
 Onyewu, the American defender who was punched by an opposing fan in Belgium, said the man was identified through an anonymous tip and was barred from attending matches for two years. He said he did not retaliate because he believed that racist behavior reflected acts of a minority of fans.
 ''I'm anticipating a more professional environment in Germany because it's the World Cup,'' Onyewu said. Even so, he said, although antiracist efforts could restrict public behavior, ''that's only helping the exterior.'' 
 He added, ''The interior mind thinking, you can't really change that.''

HEADLINE: 17 HELD IN PLOT TO BOMB SITES ACROSS ONTARIO

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN and DAVID JOHNSTON; Ian Austen reported from Ottawa for this article, and David Johnston from Washington. Chris Mason contributed reporting from Ontario and Robert Pear from Washington.

DATELINE: OTTAWA, June 3 

 BODY:
Seventeen Canadian residents were arrested and charged with plotting to attack targets in southern Ontario with crude but powerful fertilizer bombs, the Canadian authorities said Saturday.
 The arrests represented one of the largest counterterrorism sweeps in North America since the attacks of September 2001. American officials said that the plot did not involve any targets in the United States, but added that the full dimension of the plan for attacks was unknown.
 At a news conference in Toronto, police and intelligence officials said they had been monitoring the group for some time and moved in to make the arrests on Friday after the group arranged to take delivery of three tons of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be made into an explosive when combined with fuel oil.
 ''It was their intent to use it for a terrorist attack,'' said Mike McDonell, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police assistant commissioner. He said that by comparison the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, was carried out ''with only one ton of ammonium nitrate.'' 
 The 17 men were mainly of South Asian descent and most were in their teens or early 20's. One of the men was 30 years old and the oldest was 43 years old, police officials said. None of them had any known affiliation with Al Qaeda. 
 ''They represent the broad strata of our society,'' Mr. McDonell said. ''Some are students, some are employed, some are unemployed.''
 The Canadian police declined to identify specific targets, though they did dismiss reports in the news media that Toronto's subway system was on the list. The Toronto Star, citing an unidentified source, said the group had a list that included the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa as well as the Toronto branch office of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. At the news conference, officials emphasized that the targets were all in Canada.
 In the United States, the arrests reignited fears among American counterterrorism officials about the porous northern border even as the Bush administration and lawmakers have focused attention in recent weeks about hardening the southern border in an effort to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants. Since the arrest of Ahmed Ressam in December 1999 as he tried to smuggle explosive chemicals into Washington State in a plot to strike targets that included the Los Angeles international airport, authorities have expressed fears that extremists could use Canada as a platform to make attacks inside the United States.
 The arrests came at the end of a week of furious debate over federal spending for domestic security, with officials in cities like New York and Washington bitterly criticizing Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, for not allocating more money to cities thought likely to remain high on the terrorist target list for Al Qaeda and other extremist groups.
 The men accused in Canada operated what the police called training camps for its members. At their news conference, the police displayed at least one pistol, electronics components, military fatigues, army-style boots and two-way radios they said were used at the camps, although they would not disclose their locations. 
 The Toronto Star reported that in 2004 the intelligence agency began monitoring Internet exchanges, some of which were encrypted. According to the newspaper, the training in camps took place north of Toronto. Members of the group, according to that account, often visited a popular Canadian chain of doughnut shops to wash up following their training sessions.
 Counterterrorism officials said that interviews with suspects would provide greater clarity about the nature of the plot, but they said that the men had taken a significant step, moving beyond the planning stage, toward acquiring a large quantity of potentially explosive fertilizer. 
 It was not clear whether the group ever had possession of the chemicals, or whether authorities may have had a role in arranging for the shipment or transporting the material. 
 A police spokeswoman, Cpl. Michele Paradis, asked whether the group had actually had the three tons of chemicals in their possession, and if the police had ''seized'' it, replied: ''That's difficult to answer. They made arrangements to have it delivered and they took delivery.''
 American officials said that White House officials and counterterrorism agencies had been briefed on the case, and of the coming arrests, in recent days.
 Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said, ''We are coordinating very closely with our Canadian counterparts.'' He said Mr. Chertoff spoke early Saturday with Stockwell Day, the Canadian minister of public safety, but added, ''We have not made any adjustment to our security posture along the northern border.'' 
 The New York City Police Department, which has had a detective assigned as an intelligence liaison with the Toronto police for four years, said it was being kept informed, but had not altered its own security measures. 
 Even as American officials portrayed the case as mainly a Canadian operation, the arrests so close to the United States border jangled the nerves of intelligence officials who have been warning of the continuing danger posed by small ''homegrown'' extremist groups, who appeared to operate without any direct control by known leaders of Al Qaeda. 
 One senior counterterrorism official said there had been extensive contact between American and Canadian authorities in the past several days. Though there appeared to have been no direct threat inside the United States, the proximity of the potential terrorists to the American border ''really got everybody's attention,'' the official said.
 American officials were granted anonymity because they were speaking about a continuing investigation.
 The F.B.I. issued a statement on Saturday saying there was a ''preliminary indication'' that some of the Canadian subjects might have had ''limited contact'' with two people from Georgia who were recently arrested. Those two were Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, 19, an American of Bangladeshi descent, and Syed Haris Ahmed, 21, a Pakistani-born American.
 Law-enforcement officials said the men arrested in Georgia had made ''casing'' videos of various sites in Washington, D.C., and have said that their case was linked to the arrests of several men in Britain last fall, and that the two were believed to have met with ''like-minded Islamic extremists '' in Canada in March 2005.
 A counterterrorism official in the United States said that while there was contact between the Georgia men earlier this year and those arrested in Canada on Friday, there was no evidence that the Georgia suspects were involved in the bombing plot.
 The suspects were arrested in a series of raids that began late on Friday night and continued until early on Saturday morning, in Toronto, Mississauga and Kingston, a college town southwest of Ottawa. 
 All of the men under arrest were taken to a heavily fortified police station in Pickering, Ontario, a city east of Toronto. Five were under the age of 18 and not identified by the authorities. The others were identified as Fahim Ahmad, 21; Zakaria Amara, 20; Asad Ansari, 21; Shareef Abdelhaleen, 30; Qayyum Abdul Jamal, 43; Mohammed Dirie, 22; Yasim Abdi Mohamed, 24; Jahmaal James, 23; Amin Mohamed Durrani, 19; Steven Vikash Chand, alias Abdul Shakur, 25; Ahmad Mustafa Ghany, 21; and Saad Khalid, 19.
 Alvin Chand, the brother of suspect Steven Vikash Chand, dismissed the police allegations outside the courthouse.
 ''He's not a terrorist, come on, he's a Canadian citizen'' Mr. Chand said, The Canadian Press reported. ''The people that were arrested are good people. They go to the mosque. They go to school, go to college.''
 Anser Farooq, a lawyer from Mississauga who is representing five of the defendants, said a lack of information at Saturday's court hearing made it difficult to assess the case brought by the police.
 In court, he said, government lawyers broke with tradition and did not present a synopsis of the reasons for their charges, arguing that they had not had time to prepare it. It will, however, be presented at another hearing on Tuesday. 
 He declined to identify his clients because he was still formalizing his relationship with some of them. But he said none of the five have a criminal record.
 Tarek Fatah, the communications director of the Muslim Canadian Congress, a national group, said that Mr. Jamal, the oldest of the suspects, is a well-known and fiery figure in the Toronto area's South Asian community, and that he was the imam of the Ar-Rahman Quran Learning Center, a mosque in a rented industrial building in Mississauga.
 Immigration from South Asia greatly expanded in Canada beginning in the 1970's, and, like several Canadian cities, Toronto and its suburbs have long had a large and prominent South Asian community. ''He took over an otherwise peaceful mosque and threw out the old management,'' Mr. Fatah said. ''There were reports throughout the community of him making hate speeches.''
 The mosque did not respond to phone messages. ''This is the work of people who believe they are victimized when they are not,'' Mr. Fatah said. ''Many Islamacists are preying on the Islamic community.''
 ''Law enforcement agencies have done a great service to the Muslim community by busting this terrorist cell,'' he added.
 Luc Portelance, the assistant director of operations at the Canadian intelligence agency, said the group's members ''appear to have become adherents of a violent ideology inspired by Al Qaeda.'' The police official, however, said that there was no evidence of links between the two groups.
 Canada has not sent troops to Iraq, and officials at the news conference said they did not believe the group was angry over Canada's deployment of troops to Afghanistan.
 In a November 2002 audiotape claiming to be a message from Osama bin Laden, Bloomberg reported, Al Queda said Canada was ''allying themselves with America in attacking us in Afghanistan,'' and listed five possible targets: Canada, the United States, Britain, Spain and Australia. 
 The arrests were only the second time that Canadian police have brought charges under anti-terrorism laws passed at the end of 2001. Just over two years ago, Mohammad Momin Khawaja, a software developer in Ottawa, was charged in connection with a bomb plot. 
 Both the police and a spokeswoman for the intelligence agency declined to say when they first became aware of the Canadian group. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mayor David Miller of Toronto said he was given a confidential briefing about the group several months ago.
 All but two of the adult suspects appeared at a court north of Toronto in Brampton, Ontario, Saturday afternoon. By late morning, all entrances to the Brampton courthouse were blockaded by steel barriers and police cars. As snipers watched from nearby rooftops, people entering the court were required to remove their shoes and were searched at a series of three command checkpoints.
 At the news conference, Mr. McDonell said, the authorities were successful in shutting down the terrorist group. 
 ''These individuals were allegedly intent on committing acts of terrorism against their own country and their own people,'' Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. ''Today, Canada's security and intelligence measures worked.''

HEADLINE: Wilmington, N.C., Revisits a Bloody 1898 Day

BYLINE: By JOHN DeSANTIS

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, N.C., June 3 

 BODY:
Nobody will ever be certain how many people died the night of Nov. 10, 1898, on the streets, in the marshes where some ran for safety, or in the swift, wide current of the river that has always defined this port city.
 ''The Cape Fear River could be dammed up with black bodies, but we have no way of knowing just how many,'' said Lottie Clinton, a retired state port supervisor and 1 of 13 members of a state-appointed panel that studied the night's events for six years. ''A lot of people, nobody ever heard from them again, so you just couldn't know whether they ran away and never came back or were killed.'' 
The panel, officially called the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission, concluded in a report released this week that what happened was not a riot, but a well-planned insurrection by white businessmen and former Confederate soldiers, mostly Democrats, against a lawfully elected government of fusionists and Republicans, who were mostly black. 
 Now that the story is told, the report says, somebody has to pay, and it offers broad recommendations for reparation by government and businesses. They include incentives for minority business development in areas that were affected and the easing of barriers to minority home ownership.
 Newspapers accused of inflaming tensions at the time will be asked to provide scholarships for minority students, and to help distribute accounts of the story, which for so long was sheathed in awkward silence.
 A local paper once known as The Morning Star is now owned by The New York Times Company and is called The Star-News. The others are The Washington Post, The Raleigh News and Observer and The Charlotte Observer.
 The executive editor of The Star-News, Tim Griggs, said the paper ''will do everything it can to report on both the lessons learned from 1898 and the commission's findings.'' 
 Mr. Griggs continued, ''The paper will also work with other state media to address the commission's recommendations.''
 The rebellion, panelists noted, was the only successful overthrow of a municipal government in American history and laid the foundation for the Jim Crow laws and voter disenfranchisement that followed in North Carolina. It also tore the heart out of a thriving black community of professionals and artisans who disappeared and never returned.
 The commission, which included black and white members, also asked that New Hanover County, which includes the city, be placed under special federal supervision through the Voting Rights Act. The story of the rebellion, panelists said, must be told in various venues and media, and monuments should be erected.
 The investigation was modeled after inquiries concerning racial violence in Rosewood, Fla., and Tulsa, Okla. 
 The final report tells how tensions rose during Reconstruction, then moves forward to the Nov. 8, 1898, elections. 
 The violence began two days later with the destruction of the office of the town's black newspaper. Roving bands fired guns into the homes of blacks, and government officials were forced to resign.
 Once one of the Confederacy's most important ports, Wilmington today is a city of 100,000. Its quiet streets are the backdrop for the television show ''One Tree Hill.'' Transplants from the Northeast are swelling its population and contributing to a construction boom.
 Mayor Spence Broadhurst said the report was a ''powerful thing'' that would unite rather than divide a city already making great strides toward equal economic opportunity.
 ''If the state legislature and the governor's office choose to send us more resources to continue to implement our plans, we would more than welcome it,'' Mr. Broadhurst said.
 The next step in the process is for legislators to decide whether to formally accept the report's findings and any or all of the recommendations.
 Commission members said that until that happens, they were glad the truth was finally being told.
 ''People ask, 'Why do you want to remember the past? This will hurt a lot of people,' '' said one member, Kever Clark, a retired educator, who is black. ''But can it hurt a lot of people more than it hurt families of those people who were killed? How can it hurt any more than that?''

HEADLINE: New Brunswick's Past, Newark's Future

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your May 14 editorial ''A New Day in Newark'' concerned me. I have always lived in Middlesex County, and in New Brunswick for 10 years. Now I live across the river in Highland Park, but work in New Brunswick. The changes have been good for some but not for most. 
Lower income dwellers have been pushed out and the downtown is transforming into an unaffordable destination -- overpriced restaurants and property to cater to international Johnson & Johnson executives. Go up Livingston Avenue, just past the library, as seen from Theater Row, and New Brunswick is a ghetto, with too many absentee landlords and exploited Hispanic immigrants, and a town that caters to Rutgers, Johnson & Johnson and the medical school. 
 New Brunswick is geographically compact, with a much smaller population than Newark. Newark has maintained several generations who have remained, unlike New Brunswick, where they have moved out.
 I consider Newark a destination for the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Ironbound and jazz and would like to see it develop an identity that embodies its people instead of pushing them out.

HEADLINE: A Week That Was Almost a Wash 

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average gave up ground last week, although the broader market managed a small gain. 
 On Thursday, the Labor Department said that wages rose only modestly in the first quarter. On Friday, the department reported that payrolls in May increased by only 75,000 jobs -- much less than the 170,000 expected by Wall Street. Those reports raised the possibility that Federal Reserve policy makers would not increase short-term interest rates at their next meeting this month. 
Kinder Morgan, a natural-gas pipeline operator, rose 19.8 percent for the week, the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. A group headed by Richard D. Kinder, the company's co-founder, offered to take the company private in a deal valued at $22 billion.
 American markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day. For the week, the Dow Jones industrials lost 30.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 11,247.87. The S.& P. 500 index rose 8.06 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,288.22. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 9.04 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,219.41. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 4.99 percent from 5.05 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: That Hedge Fund May Be More Than a Flash in the Pan 

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CAN hedge funds beat the market? 
 Many of them do so for short periods, of course, but a number of academic studies have generally found that such market-beating funds rarely stay at the top of the rankings for long. For the most part, researchers have concluded that the best-performing hedge funds of one period were rarely the best performers over any significant stretch that followed. That's a dead giveaway that a hedge fund that happens to beat the market over a given time owes its performance more to luck than to genuine investment ability.
But a new study has reached the opposite conclusion. It has found that many hedge funds can outperform their benchmarks consistently. The study, issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization based in Cambridge, Mass., has been accepted for presentation this month at the annual meeting of the Western Finance Association, a scholarly organization. It was written by Ravi Jagannathan, a finance professor at Northwestern University; Alexey Malakhov, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Arkansas; and Dmitry Novikov, an associate in the office of equity derivatives strategy at Goldman Sachs in New York. A copy is at nber.org/papers/w12015. 
 The researchers argue that most previous studies of hedge fund performance were flawed because they failed to correct fully for statistical problems in databases of hedge fund returns. Perhaps the most significant problem, according to Professor Jagannathan, is the one caused by the disappearance of hedge funds from those databases -- a problem that he and his co-authors call the ''self-selection bias.''
 Funds vanish from the databases for two primary reasons. Some funds that are particularly poor performers close down and liquidate. And others, particularly good performers, close their doors to new investors and stop reporting their performance to the databases.
 Correcting for this problem, of course, is not easy. But by analyzing such funds' performance until they disappeared from the performance databases, the researchers could make educated guesses about what those funds' returns would have been had they not vanished. In general, they found that the funds that closed to new investors because of good performance were more likely to be above-average performers in the period after they closed.
 This could explain why so many studies have failed to find evidence of performance persistence. By eliminating from consideration those funds that disappear from databases, such studies may have overlooked funds that provided the strongest such evidence.
 The researchers in the new study, after making educated guesses about the returns of disappearing funds, found that many hedge funds were surprisingly persistent in their performance from one period to the next. For every 100 basis points by which a hedge fund beat its benchmark over a given three-year period, the researchers found, it outperformed that benchmark by 57 basis points, on average, over the next three years. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) The researchers estimated a similar degree of underperformance for the worst performers.
 The performance advantage lasts far longer for a hedge fund than it does for a mutual fund, Professor Jagannathan said in an interview. On average, he said, a mutual fund tends to stay a top performer for 12 months or less; often, it then becomes a market laggard. In fact, performance persistence among mutual funds is so modest that some researchers say it can be explained by factors having nothing to do with genuine investment ability.
 Professor Jagannathan says the results of the new study provide compelling evidence, however, that many hedge fund managers have such skill. That stands to reason, he said, because hedge fund managers typically have the freedom to take longer-term risks, while mutual fund managers have incentives to focus primarily on short-term performance. Undoubtedly, the generous management fees paid by hedge funds also lure many highly skilled managers to the hedge fund world. 
 To be sure, hedge funds are not for everyone. For starters, one typically has to invest a large amount, often several hundred thousand dollars, and the money is tied up in the fund for a long period. But the new study offers a clear lesson: when money managers are immune from the risk of investor flight after one poor month or quarter, they can often flourish.

HEADLINE: Arrivals and a Departure May 28-June 3

 BODY:

THE MONEY MAN

The News -- President Bush nominated Henry M. Paulson Jr., chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, to become his next Treasury secretary.

Behind the News -- In some ways, an odd choice. Mr. Paulson is a deficit hawk while the administration has built up historic budget deficits. But many allies of the White House had lobbied for him, convinced he could help convey the strengths in the economy and reassure voters of the president's economic competence. Mr. Paulson had to be carefully courted, a sign of the prestige the job has lost under Mr. Bush. 


THE NONCIVILIAN

The News -- Gen. Michael V. Hayden was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Behind the News -- At the ceremony Wednesday, President Bush felt compelled to give agency employees a pep talk, assuring them that they remained ''vital'' to the White House. The event was for public consumption. (The general officially became director Tuesday.) The administration wanted to lift agency morale and portray a sense of calm after several turbulent years at the C.I.A. Sensitivity lingers over a military officer leading the civilian agency.

THE GOLDEN ARM

The News -- Roger Clemens, the future Hall of Fame pitcher, agreed to come out of retirement and rejoin the Houston Astros.

Behind the News -- A break for the struggling Astros, the defending National League champions. Clemens turns 44 in August but is hardly teetering. He led the major leagues with a 1.87 earned run average last year. His time off could keep him fresh in September. Three other 43-year-old pitchers are still kicking: Terry Mulholland of Arizona, Jaimie Moyer of Seattle and David Wells of Boston. One subplot: Clemens's son Koby, an infielder in Houston's minor league system, could join his father soon.

THE NEW CHILD

The News -- Well, not so new a child. Prince Albert II of Monaco acknowledged that he is the father of a 14-year-old American girl, a lawyer for the prince's family, Thierry Lacoste, told Le Figaro, a French newspaper. Officials in Monaco said they would not comment on the matter.

Behind the News -- Last year, Prince Albert, who is not married, acknowledged that he was the father of a 3-year-old boy. He later told The New York Times that he did not know of any other paternity claims that could be true. Mr. Lacoste told Le Figaro that legal paternity was established several weeks ago.

THE LONG FAREWELL

The News -- Katie Couric spent her final day as anchor of ''Today.'' Now it's on to the ''CBS Evening News'' in September.

Behind the News -- For weeks, NBC built a relentless drumbeat of publicity. Then came Wednesday's lovefest packed with memories and tributes. Was it too much? It could have ''turned unbearably cloying but didn't, mainly because Ms. Couric reined in her emotions and did not exit in a puddle of tears,'' wrote Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times. But David Hinckley of The Daily News said the show was ''more like a long in-house graduation party.''

HEADLINE: Race to Lead Japan May Turn on Asia Ties

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 3 

 BODY:
With Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi set to retire in September, the battle in the governing Liberal Democratic Party over who will succeed him as party leader and prime minister is well under way. So far, the race is turning into a referendum on what to do about Japan's troubled relations with its Asian neighbors, especially China. 
 Japan's relations with China and South Korea have chilled, particularly in the last year, because of several disputes over history, territory and Mr. Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, the memorial where the country's highest-ranking war criminals are enshrined.
Polls here indicate the race is now between politicians with starkly different views: Shinzo Abe, 51, the chief cabinet secretary, who has said that a Japanese prime minister should visit the Yasukuni Shrine and who has become extremely popular by being tough on North Korea and China; and Yasuo Fukuda, 69, a former chief cabinet secretary, who has criticized Mr. Koizumi's visits to the Shinto shrine and talked of rebuilding friendly ties with the rest of East Asia. 
 Although neither has yet declared his candidacy for the September party election, Mr. Abe leads in the polls. Mr. Fukuda has narrowed the gap significantly in recent weeks, however, buttressed by what experts say is the growing public sentiment that fixing ties with China should be one of the next prime minister's top priorities.
 ''I think that's a major factor,'' Takenori Kanzaki, the leader of the New Komeito, the Liberal Democratic Party's junior coalition partner, said in an interview. ''I think that Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, will basically follow the Koizumi line, including foreign policy. By contrast, Fukuda, the former chief cabinet secretary, says clearly that he will revise it. So in that sense, the focus is on Abe versus Fukuda.''
 Mr. Kanzaki -- whose Buddhist-backed party opposes the Yasukuni visits -- said they ''lie at the root'' of Japan's strained ties with China and South Korea.
 Mr. Koizumi has said that his annual visits are to mourn for the war dead and to pray for peace. But to Asian nations invaded by imperial Japan, the shrine is a symbol of Japanese militarism; its museum espouses the rightist view that Japan waged war in Asia to liberate it from European domination and was tricked into war by the United States.
 The Yasukuni visits have punctuated disagreements over history between Japan and its Asian neighbors. Beijing and Seoul have suspended top-level meetings with Tokyo as a result.
 Inside Japan, criticism of the visits has risen along with fears that strained relations with its neighbors will hurt Japan economically, isolate it diplomatically and weaken its alliance with the United States.
 The Japan Association of Corporate Executives, a prominent business association, recently released a 13-page statement opposing the Yasukuni visits and calling for the building of a nonreligious war memorial. The group said the visits had damaged relations with China and Japan's national interests, and its chairman said bluntly in a news conference that Mr. Koizumi's successor should refrain from visiting the shrine.
 Mr. Koizumi has been one of the Bush administration's staunchest supporters in the war in Iraq, and has strengthened Japan's military ties with the United States. Although hawks in Washington have applauded Mr. Koizumi's tough stance against China, concerns about Japan's worsening ties with China have grown among moderate Republicans and Democrats.
 Michael Green, the former director of Asian affairs at the National Security Council who is now at Georgetown University, said the Bush administration believes ''it would not be helpful for the U.S. to broker a resolution to these sensitive historical issues.''
 ''But there is a growing consensus in Japan that the next prime minister needs to take proactive measures to improve relations with China,'' Mr. Green said in an interview during a recent visit here. ''That would be good. If that doesn't happen by 2008 when the next administration in the U.S. takes over, people may start questioning how much we can rely on Japan.''
 In speeches and interviews, Mr. Abe has played down the strained ties with China and South Korea. Instead, he has emphasized the importance of strengthening diplomatic ties with Asian countries, like India and Australia, that have ''common values'' with Japan.
 In a recent interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's major economic daily, Mr. Abe said Japan would continue to do business with China, but called China a destabilizing factor in Asia.
 ''We don't share basic values like freedom and human rights,'' he said. ''If you ask me whether the rule of law is established there, it's not.''
 By contrast, in a recent speech, Mr. Fukuda said Japan needs to revise its policy toward the rest of Asia. Mentioning the Asia policy that was carried out by his father, Takeo Fukuda, a prime minister in the 1970's, he said that Japan must resume ''heart-to-heart'' dialogue with its neighbors and ultimately build an East Asian community.
 Mr. Fukuda said that Mr. Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni had had no positive effect on Japan.
 With the growing criticism against the Yasukuni visits here, Mr. Abe has recently softened his stance. Asked directly whether he would continue the visits as prime minister, he has refused to answer. In the past, he has said that he would want any future prime minister to continue the visits.
 In general, Mr. Abe is regarded as ideologically more conservative than Mr. Koizumi. For instance, Mr. Koizumi has stated that he accepts the validity of the postwar Tokyo Trials, which found Japanese guilty of war crimes, including the 14 Class A war criminals enshrined in Yasukuni. In a recent parliamentary debate, Mr. Abe indicated strongly that he did not believe the trials were valid.
 Also, in Parliament and in television interviews, asked directly whether Japan had led a war of aggression or liberation in Asia, Mr. Abe has said that he would leave the judgment to future generations or historians.
 ''On the issue of how to define the last great war, I think it's not the government's job,'' Mr. Abe said in a parliamentary exchange in February.
 Though Mr. Fukuda is thought to have the support of moderates and businesspeople, Mr. Abe is believed to be more popular among the actual voters in the September election: party members.
 Hiroshi Imazu, a lawmaker who has yet to decide whom to support, said he endorses Mr. Koizumi's tough stance toward China. The leader of a group of lawmakers that supports visits to Yasukuni, Mr. Imazu said that Japan had become diplomatically isolated.
 ''But I don't think the fault is Koizumi's, but China and South Korea's attitude,'' he said.
 Mr. Abe is considered by party members and the public to be more of a charismatic, Koizumi-style politician capable of appealing directly to voters and carrying the party to victory in general elections. Perhaps because of his age, Mr. Fukuda is regarded as belonging to an older generation of politicians more comfortable making deals in smoke-filled rooms.
 ''Abe has made himself clear on various issues to the people, while Fukuda seems like an old-style politician,'' said Jozo Takeda, a legislator in Hyogo Prefecture.
 Mr. Abe is also said to enjoy more support in the regional party branches, where members are concerned less with foreign diplomacy than pocketbook issues, especially the widening inequality gap between urban and rural areas.
 ''We'll make a decision and vote on this issue,'' said Fumito Murakami, secretary general of Akita Prefecture's party branch. ''We don't care about foreign policy.''

HEADLINE: Senator Clinton Criticizes Cut in Antiterror Financing

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: WEST BABYLON, N.Y., June 3 

 BODY:
Intensifying complaints about a cut in antiterrorism money for New York City, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged President Bush on Saturday to take responsibility for the action, saying that ''at some point, the buck stops in the White House.''
 ''We're going to have to go to the White House and just make it very clear: We don't appreciate being used as a prop,'' said Mrs. Clinton, appearing with Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican, at a news conference. ''We don't appreciate people coming here and having conventions and doing photo ops and then sticking us where it hurts with a decision like this.'' 
But in a letter sent to the New York Congressional delegation Friday night, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff noted that New York City has received far more money under the program in question, the Urban Areas Security Initiative, than any other city. The cut between this year and last year, he wrote, was the result of an unusually high appropriation for the program in 2005, itself meant to offset an unusually low appropriation in 2004.
 In response to one particular criticism by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. King and others -- that the department deemed New York to have no national icons or monuments -- the letter said that the Empire State Building had been classified as commercial infrastructure and the Brooklyn Bridge as transportation infrastructure. Both categories, the letter said, gave New York City's application a higher score than if they had been classified as monuments.
 Those categorizations represent a greater potential for loss of life as well as economic damage, a spokesman for the department, Russ Knocke, said Saturday.
 The decision in question was the allocation of $711 million in federal antiterrorism financing across the United States. New York's share of the 2006 grants was reduced by 40 percent, to $124.5 million this year, from $207.6 million in 2005.
 Since the grant allocations were announced last week, members of the New York delegation have directed their ire at Mr. Chertoff. They launched a postcard campaign, urging voters to send postcards to Mr. Chertoff featuring New York icons like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
 Mr. Chertoff's letter said that the city had received about 19 percent of all grants to high-risk metropolitan areas from 2003 to 2005, and received about 18 percent this year. ''New York City received a funding percentage roughly equivalent to the average it received in the preceding three years,'' he wrote.
 The letter did not mention a report by the department that found flaws in the city's grant application, including criticism of overtime costs for police officers assigned to counterterrorism duties.
 Mr. Knocke said that the department's analysis had included roughly 7,000 critical sites in the five boroughs. The actual grant allocation for the city, he added, ''would not have changed at all if these monuments or stadiums had been listed as icons and monuments.''
 The Statue of Liberty, he said is a federal property under New York State jurisdiction, and so it was included on the state's list of critical sites, not the city's.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also has criticized the reduction. During his weekly radio program on Friday, he questioned whether there had been a ''breakdown'' within the agency and said that Mr. Chertoff had pledged to look into the matter over the weekend. Among the outstanding questions was whether New York officials had made mistakes in submitting the grant application, as some Homeland Security officials had suggested. A mayoral spokeswoman said yesterday that the application had been submitted properly.
 Mr. Knocke confirmed that the mayor and Mr. Chertoff had had ''a very productive conversation,'' but said that the department was not yet contemplating an increase in the city's grant money.
 ''We're not going back to review the awards,'' he said. ''If somebody comes to us and says that, in our review, there has been a factual and substantive error, we'll go back and take a look at that.''
 The back-and-forth came after several days of harsh criticism by Senator Clinton of the Bush administration on an array of subjects, including energy policy and the environment, as she toured the state on a campaign swing following her nomination by the state Democratic Party in Buffalo last week. Although Mrs. Clinton is not facing any formidable opposition for her Senate seat, she is considering whether to run for president in 2008, giving her remarks about national policy and the Republican leadership extra resonance.
 In Port Washington, on Long Island, Saturday morning, where she accepted the endorsement by the League of Conservation Voters, Mrs. Clinton skewered the Republican leadership in Washington for ''putting ideology before science'' in addressing global climate change.
 Two days earlier, in an informal gathering of patrons at the Carmel Diner in Putnam County, Mrs. Clinton digressed from answering a question to remark, ''We are now in a time in our history when the leadership is very secretive, very controlling, and very much wanting to do everything without having to answer any questions.''

HEADLINE: When Sweet Statistics Clash With a Sour Mood

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
LAST Tuesday, when President Bush introduced Henry M. Paulson Jr. as his choice to replace John W. Snow as Treasury secretary, Mr. Bush rattled off a string of impressive economic statistics. 
 ''In the first quarter of 2006, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent, the fastest growth in two and a half years,'' he said, as Mr. Paulson, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, looked on. ''We added 5.2 million new jobs since August of 2003. The national unemployment rate is down to 4.7 percent. Productivity is high, and that's leading to higher wages and a higher standard of living for the American people.''
Yet in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, only 28 percent of the respondents said they approved of President Bush's handling of the economy, while 66 percent disapproved -- the worst such ratings of his presidency. Only 6 percent rated the economy as very good, while 46 percent said it was fairly bad or very bad. And consumer confidence plummeted last month, according to the Conference Board. 
 This strange and unlikely combination -- strong and healthy aggregate macroeconomic indicators and a grumpy populace -- has been a source of befuddlement to the administration and its allies. It's not unreasonable to assume that Mr. Snow is being replaced as Treasury secretary in part because he couldn't make Americans appreciate just how well the economy is performing. And it's possible to detect among Bush partisans an element of frustration at the public for what they see as its failure to do so. In Iowa last month, Rudolph W. Giuliani bluntly dismissed concerns about the economy and higher gas prices by saying, ''I don't know what we're all so upset about.''
 Gas prices and the Iraq war have surely contributed to this disconnect. But a lesser-known factor is also at work: the misleading aggregates.
 Aggregates -- big-picture figures like the unemployment rate, productivity and growth in the gross domestic product -- are highly useful to economists. But to most people, they're abstractions. You can't use a low unemployment rate to pay a mortgage. 
 As a result, large aggregates ''are something that people may hear about in the news, but don't have a direct impact on how people feel,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Consumer Research Survey at the Conference Board. 
 Aside from being abstract, many of the most popular aggregates are simply misleading. Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington,puts the Consumer Price Index -- the main gauge of inflation -- at the top of the list. 
 ''It has no direct relationship to what people perceive as inflation,'' he said. Mr. Baker notes that the index doesn't take account of rapidly rising co-payments and higher insurance deductibles when it calculates health and medical costs. And to gauge inflation in housing, the index approximates a measure of rent instead of looking at home purchase prices. 
 ''We've had a huge run-up in the price of housing, and that doesn't show up in the C.P.I.,'' he said. So while the index shows that inflation is elevated but still under control -- up 3.5 percent from April 2005 to April 2006 -- many Americans find themselves paying sharply higher prices for essential goods and services.
 In addition, aggregates generally are averages, which are of declining utility in an economy characterized by greater inequality of income and assets. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March, Mr. Snow took pains to point out that there had been substantial gains in per-capita income (8.2 percent, after inflation) and net worth (24 percent, before inflation) from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2005. 
 The data he cited were averages, or means, and that can be misleading. ''The average wage is a useful indicator if you want to know what's happening to the tax base, but it might not tell you what's going on for the individual worker,'' said Alan B. Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton and a former chief economist at the Labor Department. Consider a hypothetical country with 300 million workers. Say the chief executive of an investment bank gets a $300 million raise this year, while the other 299,999,999 workers don't get a raise. In the aggregate, the average per-capita salary has risen by $1, but only one person has more money in his pocket.
 To see how typical workers are doing, it's better to look at median wages and incomes -- the midpoint that separates the top 50 percent from the lower 50 percent. And median income, which was stagnant during President Bush's first term, is struggling to keep pace with inflation. ''Median household income has gone nowhere since the turn of the decade,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. 
 Mr. Zandi puts the problem with averages another way. ''If you put one foot in a tub of hot water and the other in a tub of cold water and take the average, everything is fine.'' 
 THIS dichotomy accurately describes the economy. From 2001 to 2004, the average net worth of an American family rose 6.3 percent, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. But not everybody grew richer. For the bottom 40 percent of families by income, the median net worth fell. ''It just doesn't resonate with people when the Treasury secretary says everything is fine,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''It's fine for half the population, and it's clearly not for the other half.''
 There's a final reason that the aggregates may not accurately capture the public mood. Aggregates shed light on the performance of the economy in the last month, or in the last quarter. By contrast, measures of sentiments and polls gauge feelings about the present and expectations for the future. 
 ''Consumers tend to view current conditions as quite favorable, but their expectations for six months down the road are rather pessimistic,'' said Ms. Franco of the Conference Board. ''It could be that we're nearing a peak, and this is as good as it gets.''

HEADLINE: With a Talk Over Lunch, a Shift In Bush's Iran Policy Took Root 

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and DAVID E. SANGER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3 

 BODY:
On a Tuesday afternoon two months ago, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down to a small lunch in President Bush's private dining room behind the Oval Office and delivered grim news to her boss: Their coalition against Iran was at risk of falling apart.
 A meeting she had attended in Berlin days earlier with European foreign ministers had been a disaster, she reported, according to participants in the discussion. Iran was neatly exploiting divisions among the Europeans and Russia, and speeding ahead with its enrichment of uranium. The president grimaced, one aide recalled, interpreting the look as one of exasperation ''that said, 'O.K., team, what's the answer?' ''
 That body language touched off a closely held two-month effort to reach a drastically different strategy, one articulated two weeks later in a single sentence that Ms. Rice wrote in a private memorandum. It broached the idea that the United States end its nearly three-decade policy against direct talks with Iran. 
 Mr. Bush's aides rarely describe policy debates in the Oval Office in much detail. But in recounting his decisions in this case, they appeared eager to portray him as determined to rebuild a fractured coalition still bearing scars from Iraq and find a way out of a negotiating dynamic that, as one aide said recently, ''the Iranians were winning.''
 Mr. Bush gradually grew more comfortable with offering talks to a country that he considers the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, and whose president has advocated wiping Israel off the map. Mr. Bush's own early misgivings about the path he was considering came in a flurry of phone calls to Ms. Rice and to Stephen J. Hadley, his national security adviser, that often began with questions like ''What if the Iranians do this,'' gaming out loud a number of possible situations. 
 Mr. Bush left open the option of scuttling the entire idea until early Wednesday morning, three senior officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were describing internal debates in the White House. He made the final decision only after telephone calls with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany led him to conclude that if Tehran refused to suspend its enrichment of uranium, or later dragged its feet, they would support an escalating series of sanctions against Iran at the United Nations that could lead to a confrontation.
 Even after Mr. Bush edited the statement that Ms. Rice was scheduled to read Wednesday before she flew to Vienna to encourage Europe and Russia to sign on to a final package of incentives for Iran -- and sanctions if it turns the offer down -- Ms. Rice wanted to check in one more time. She called Mr. Bush. Was he sure he was O.K. with his decision?
 ''Go do it,'' he was said to have responded.
 She did, but the results remain unclear. Iran has given no indication it will agree to Mr. Bush's threshold condition, suspending nuclear fuel production. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Friday that he would oppose ''any pressure to deprive our people from their right'' to pursue a peaceful nuclear program.
 The official news agency IRNA reported that Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Saturday that Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, was expected to arrive in Tehran in the next few days with the new package of incentives.
 ''Iran will examine the proposal and announce its opinion after that,'' Mr. Mottaki said. Mr. Bush's aides now acknowledge that the approach they had once publicly described as successfully ''isolating'' Iran was in fact viewed internally as going nowhere. Mr. Bush's search for a new option was driven, they say, by concern that the path he was on two months ago would inevitably force one of two potentially disastrous outcomes: an Iranian bomb, or an American attack on Iran's facilities. 
 Conservatives, even some inside the administration, are worried that Mr. Bush may be forced into other concessions, including allowing Iran to continue some low level of nuclear fuel production. Others fear that the commitments Mr. Bush believes he extracted from Mr. Putin, Ms. Merkel and President Jacques Chirac of France may erode.
 But the story of how a president who rarely changes his mind did so in this case -- after refusing similar proposals on Iran four years ago -- illustrates the changed dynamic between the State Department and the White House in Mr. Bush's second term. When Colin L. Powell was secretary of state, the two buildings often seemed at war. But 18 months after Ms. Rice took over, her relationship with Mr. Bush has led to policies that one former adviser to Ms. Rice and Mr. Bush said ''he never would have allowed Colin to pursue.''
 It is unclear how much dissent, if any, surrounded the decision, which appears to have been driven largely by the president, Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley, with other senior national security officials playing a more remote role. Both White House and State Department officials say Vice President Dick Cheney, long an opponent of proposals to engage Iran, agreed to this experiment. But it is unclear whether he is an enthusiast, or simply expects Iran to reject suspending enrichment -- clearing the way to sanctions that could test the Iranian government's ability to survive.
 After the surprise election of Mr. Ahmadinejad last summer, Iran ended its suspension of uranium enrichment, and the United States and Europe won resolutions at the International Atomic Energy Agency to move the issue to the United Nations Security Council. But it took weeks over the winter to get the weakest of Security Council actions -- a ''presidential statement.'' Russia, which has huge financial interests in Iran and is supplying it with nuclear reactors, was particularly reluctant to push the Iranians too hard.
 At a private dinner on March 6 at the Watergate with Ms. Rice, Mr. Hadley and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov warned that Iran could do what North Korea did in 2003 -- throw out inspectors and abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would close the biggest window into Iran's program, making it hard to assess its bomb capability -- the same issue that had led to huge errors in Iraq. 
 On March 30, Ms. Rice traveled to Berlin for what turned into a fractious meeting with representatives of the other four permanent members of the Security Council and Germany. She questioned what kind of sanctions would be effective. The conversation went nowhere.
 That led to Ms. Rice's warning to Mr. Bush over lunch, on April 4, that the momentum to confront Iran was disintegrating. Mr. Bush, one aide noted, was receiving special intelligence assessments every morning, some on Iran's intentions, others examining Mr. Ahmadinejad's personality, still others exploring how long it would take Iran to produce a bomb. 
 On Easter weekend, Ms. Rice sat in her apartment and drafted a two-page proposal for a new strategy that pursued three tracks: the threat of ''coercive measures'' through the United Nations, negotiations with Iran that included what Ms. Rice has called ''bold'' incentives for Iran to give up the production of all nuclear fuel and a separate set of strategies for economic sanctions if the Security Council failed to act.
 They were accompanied by a calendar Ms. Rice had marked in three colors tracking the schedule for each of the three tracks, which Mr. Hadley told her was ''brilliant, colorful, and completely impenetrable.''
 For the first time, her proposal also raised a question the administration had long avoided: Had the time arrived for the United States to play what she and Mr. Bush, both bridge players, called their biggest card -- offering to talk with Iran? She shared the proposal with Mr. Hadley, and then raised it with Mr. Bush in private on May 5 
 The idea intrigued Mr. Bush, White House officials say, and on May 8, Ms. Rice met with him just hours before flying to New York for a meeting with her European counterparts.
 She asked him what kind of body language to display at the United Nations meeting. Should she signal that the United States was considering negotiations with Iran? ''Be careful,'' he said, according to officials familiar with the conversation. ''I haven't made up my mind.'' 
 That same day, an 18-page letter from Mr. Ahmadinejad arrived. It declared liberal democracy a failure, although it also was perceived by many as an effort to reach out and start a dialogue.
 Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley read the letter on the flight to New York, but dismissed it. ''It isn't addressing the issues we're dealing with in a concrete way,'' Ms. Rice said that day.
 Her meeting in New York with her European counterparts turned testy, particularly an exchange with Mr. Lavrov, who was still smarting from a speech by Mr. Cheney denouncing Russia for its increasingly authoritarian behavior. But the discussion, while fractious, convinced her that the only way to break the stalemate was to offer to join the negotiations.
 While Mr. Bush was intrigued, he was intent on secrecy, and so when the National Security Council met on the subject on May 17, he warned against leaks. The session was notable because Mr. Cheney, who had fought in the first term against engagement with Iran, said the offer might work, largely because it would force the choices back on Iran. And while the council had dismissed the letter, it used the meeting to discuss whether to respond. 
 While Mr. Bush initially told Ms. Rice that others could work out the final negotiations, Ms. Rice told the president that ''only you can nail this down,'' apparently a reference to keeping Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin on board. Mr. Bush made the calls and got them to agree that if Iran resists, they will move ahead with a range of sanctions. 
 But Mr. Bush, led by Ms. Rice, is taking a significant risk. He must hold together countries that bitterly broke with the United States three years ago on Iraq. And now, he seems acutely aware that part of his legacy may depend on his ability to prevent Iran from emerging as a nuclear power in the Middle East, without again resorting to military force.

HEADLINE: New Music in Setting to Match

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
There is something about hearing new music amid new paintings in a bright, airy and spacious contemporary-art museum that fosters receptivity to both music and art. This is one of the attractions of Second Helpings, the contemporary-music series presented by the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble at the Chelsea Museum of Art on West 22nd Street. 
 A small but eager audience attended the final program in this season's series, a program on Saturday afternoon offering four chamber works, including two premieres. With three of the four composers on hand to introduce their pieces and with Joan Tower, the ensemble's composer in residence, serving as an enthusiastic host, the atmosphere could not have been more conducive to hearing new music.
The composer Gabriela Lena Frank was ill, so the cellist Myron Lutzke introduced ''Four Pre-Inca Sketches,'' a 10-minute duo for cello and flute, in its premiere. Ms. Frank, based in San Francisco, has long been fascinated with pre-Columbian art. In one captivating section of this ruminative yet organic work, murky modal oscillating cello riffs and spiraling melodic flights on the flute evoke an image the composer saw on an ancient textile in a museum in Peru, showing birdlike human figures suspended weightlessly. Mr. Lutzke and the flutist Elizabeth Mann gave an engrossing performance. 
 The other premiere was ''The Instant Gathers,'' a piano trio by the composer and pianist Joan Panetti, who has been on the Yale faculty for 30 years. Ms. Panetti said that the title was taken from a Theodore Roethke poem in which the poet warns us that time, the instant, is passing so we had best make the most of it. 
 She has put the poet's advice to good use in this eventful, intense yet impressively economical 13-minute, three-movement work. Its harmonic language deftly blends tonally grounded and atonal elements. If you detect dashes of Impressionism or, in the surging toccatalike finale, flourishes that have the brooding sensibility of modern-day Janacek, the notes are so acutely chosen that Ms. Panetti's language seems fresh, personal and full of surprises. The composer played the elaborate piano part, joined by Daire FitzGerald and Mayuki Fukuhara.
 Though Barbara White's ''Five Elements'' for piano quintet (2003) was inspired by her study of Chinese philosophy, what grabs you is her alert ear for colors and her inventive writing for the instruments, notably her use of a rectangular wood block to depress clusters of piano keys, releasing the dampers and allowing the strings to resonate when other notes are struck.
 I even enjoyed ''The High and the Mighty'' (2000), a duo for piccolo and piano (played by Ms. Mann and the pianist Margaret Kampmeier), Michael Daugherty's gimmicky impish homage to the glamor days of airplane travel. Wistfully melodic passages that could be music for a soothing fly-the-skies commercial segue into bursts of bossa nova. That the piece has been performed extensively makes sense: it was jointly commissioned by 25 piccolo players.

HEADLINE: Untapped Talent

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
At a time when the American dream has moved all but completely out of the reach of low-paid and poorly educated individuals comes a modest but promising joint effort by business, government, union and nonprofit leaders in the greater Boston area to open new doors to good jobs and higher standards of living.
 We waste human potential in this country the way some people waste toilet tissue. For example, a person who is a part-time janitor is generally thought to be going nowhere. There's no upside to the job, and it certainly won't pay for the basic needs of a family. But what if that janitor could be trained and guided into work as a painter, an electrician, a groundskeeper or a custodial supervisor? 
Why shouldn't someone who changes sheets in a hospital, or delivers meals to patients, be offered the education and training necessary to become a surgical technician, or radiologic technologist, or registered nurse?
 In Boston and other parts of New England where the population is not growing, employers are increasingly being confronted with a shortage of skilled workers. The jobs are there, but the workers able to do them are not.
 Example: Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching affiliate, sits just across the border from affluent Brookline, Mass. The hospital is thriving, and the demand for its services is great.
 On the other side of Brigham and Women's is a Boston neighborhood with myriad challenges, including unemployment, violence and what Dr. Gary Gottlieb, the hospital's president, described as ''extreme risk for adverse health outcomes.''
 There are good jobs with good benefits at Brigham and Women's. If a substantial number of those jobs could go to residents in the struggling Boston neighborhood, the benefits would spread throughout the area, like a cool front on a muggy summer afternoon. All parties would benefit.
 ''Our mission is to bring the best and the brightest people to the sickest and neediest,'' said Dr. Gottlieb, and that means deriving ''a substantial component of our labor base from all the communities around us.''
 To that end, Dr. Gottlieb has made his hospital an enthusiastic participant in a program that has been given the jargonish name SkillWorks. It's a collaborative effort, organized by the Boston Foundation, to improve the skills and career opportunities of the low-wage work force in a number of industries.
 History has shown that this is much easier said than done. The historical landscape is littered with the rusted, rotting shells of job training programs and full-employment initiatives that never succeeded.
 But SkillWorks may be on to something. For one thing, the demographic changes in Boston and much of New England (perhaps coming to a neighborhood near you, as baby boomers begin retiring) are making employers more interested in developing the skills of a new generation of workers.
 ''The baby boom folks are beginning to leave the work force,'' said Paul Grogan, president of the Boston Foundation. ''And we won't get any net increase in workers from women entering the work force, because that revolution has happened and now as many women are going to be leaving the work force as entering it.''
 What SkillWorks is attempting to do is merge investment commitments from foundations and the government (Mayor Thomas Menino is solidly onboard) with a willingness of business leaders to actually provide meaningful employment and promotion opportunities to the kind of men and women whose talents have long been overlooked, and thus wasted.
 ''This is the way to go,'' said Mayor Menino. He mentioned the housekeeping jobs at hospitals, which might pay $10 an hour. ''In the past that was a dead-end job,'' he said. ''But because of our involvement with Brigham and Women's Hospital, we were able to put a program together, with some of our funds, to train these individuals to become radiologists. They're making $40,000 to $45,000 a year.''
 The employment situation in the United States is complicated and extremely dynamic. In many parts of the country, highly skilled workers are watching in dismay as their jobs, for a variety of reasons, disappear. In some areas, employers are struggling to find workers qualified for the jobs that are available.
 SkillWorks is a serious attempt to address at least one aspect of this complex picture in a way that is beneficial to employers while keeping the best interests of the workers in mind.

HEADLINE: Afghan Front Line: Schools Under Fire

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Afghanistan, Unraveling'' (editorial, June 1) rightly highlights the country's rapidly deteriorating security situation. 
Education is on the front line. I have charted reports of more than 100 incidents of schools being set on fire, mined, rocketed or otherwise attacked in this year alone. 
 In Afghanistan last December, school officials showed me threatening letters received for educating children, especially girls. Some letters were signed by the Taliban; other attacks are likely the work of local strongmen opposed to girls' education. As a result, schools have closed and education providers have been forced to flee some districts entirely. 
 A majority of primary-school-age girls remain unhappily out of school. It's time to reprioritize American economic, political and military support, to secure basic rights for ordinary Afghans. 
 Whether children, especially girls, can go to school is a key measurement of Washington's success or failure in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Hearst's New Home: Xanadu in Manhattan 

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
Frank A. Bennack Jr., the former chief executive of the Hearst Corporation, was recently touring the resplendent new headquarters the company has erected at Eighth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan. 
 What would William Randolph Hearst, the company's legendary founder, have thought of this glass and steel monolith? he was asked. ''He only wanted to own his own land and all the land that joined it,'' Mr. Bennack replied. Gazing around the lobby, he added: ''He would have loved it.''
Chances are that the Chief, as Mr. Hearst was known to his minions, would be as pleased with the seemingly flush condition of the empire he left behind on his death 55 years ago. Indeed, the company paid for the gleaming headquarters with $500 million in cash.
 Among the media giants, the privately held Hearst has been a famously buttoned-up organization. It is gaining a higher profile at a time when publicly traded companies like Time Warner and the Tribune Company are under mounting pressure from disappointed investors. Now, Hearst's ability to move in any direction it chooses without having to explain itself to Wall Street is looking more like a strategic advantage. 
 The company has been able to go stealthily about its business of running media assets that include newspapers like The San Francisco Chronicle and The Houston Chronicle; scores of magazines, including Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Esquire; television stations; investments in cable channels; digital start-ups; and much else. It even publishes Floor Covering Weekly and sells ketchup and grass-fed beef under the Hearst brand from ranches it owns in California. 
 ''Since I became C.E.O. of Hearst, people have said: 'Do you like running a private company?' and I've said 'Yes,' '' said Victor F. Ganzi, who succeeded Mr. Bennack in 2002. ''Now I say, 'No. I love running a private company.' ''
 Mr. Hearst might also be surprised by the unexpected and ambitious directions Mr. Ganzi has lately taken the business. In March, for instance, Hearst signaled a move away from traditional media by buying a 20 percent interest in the Fitch Group, which operates the Fitch bond rating service, from its French owner, for $592 million. 
 A month after the Fitch deal -- as if to show the company had not given up on its ink-stained roots -- it announced a complex deal with the newspaper publisher William Dean Singleton, which would effectively result in Hearst owning a 20 percent to 30 percent stake in Mr. Singleton's company, the MediaNews Group, at a cost of $263 million. 
 Typical of the inscrutable Hearst style, both of these recent deals make the company appear to be a passive, patient investor in a larger entity. But Mr. Ganzi revealed in an interview that both arrangements carry rights of refusal and other provisions that would allow Hearst to increase its stake in Fitch and MediaNews (excluding a group of California newspapers it owns) and potentially acquire control of both businesses down the road. 
 ''We are comfortable with our minority stake in all these cases and if it never changes we are comfortable with that,'' Mr. Ganzi said. In the case of MediaNews, Mr. Singleton, 54, and another investor, Richard Scudder, who is 93, each currently own 45 percent of the group of 55 daily newspapers. ''Ultimately, I think there will be opportunities,'' Mr. Ganzi said. Mr. Singleton did not return calls seeking comment.
 It is probably no accident that the new 46-story headquarters, with its geometric form, latest technology and green design elements, stands atop the medieval-style cast-stone husk of a six-story Hearst Magazines office built in the 1920's. The profile-raising new tower, like its occupant, is a melding of newfangled and nostalgic -- a throwback to the future. 
 ''As a business, it's a bit of an amalgam,'' said Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner and a friend of Mr. Ganzi. ''They're able to think beyond quarter-to-quarter and my sense is they've been very deliberate and thoughtful about building a business that will be around for a long, long time.'' 
 Indeed, only one of the company's main business units, Hearst-Argyle Television, is publicly traded -- and, as it happens, it has not been much of an investment in recent years. While acknowledging that his company is not immune to the challenges of the Internet or slowing growth at some businesses, such as newspapers, Mr. Ganzi said the company was loath to sell assets.

Private but Tough
 And while the company is assiduously private in nearly every sense of the word, it is not shy. Mr. Ganzi, 59, is known as a tough negotiator who recently took a personal role in tackling disputes with strong-minded media figures like Charles W. Ergen chief executive of EchoStar, which briefly took the Hearst-affiliated Lifetime Television channel off its satellite service, and Frank A. Blethen, a Seattle publisher trying to disentangle a partnership with The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, a Hearst newspaper.
 Mr. Ganzi, a civic-minded accountant and Harvard-trained lawyer, joined the company as its general counsel in 1990. He was brought up in Queens, and his family has owned half of The Palm chain of steakhouses for close to 80 years. Colleagues say Mr. Ganzi is possessed of a photographic memory, and he speaks in precise rapid-fire bursts. 
 He agreed to a rare interview, given all the curiosity about the company's new tower, yet he declined to meet in person or to pose for a photo. When asked why, he quickly replied into the telephone: ''It's quite simple. Don't take this the wrong way: I've enjoyed talking to you but it doesn't make the Hearst Corporation another dollar.'' 
 Mr. Ganzi said Hearst executives did not take their private status for granted, and regularly benchmarked their performance against other publicly traded companies. Despite the company's heritage -- dating back to 1887, when young William took over The San Francisco Examiner -- Mr. Ganzi said that 85 percent of the company's profits came from businesses that were built, started or acquired in the past 30 years. 
 Through acquisitions, new publications and the nearly obsessive pursuit of brand extensions, the company says it has increased profits in 13 of the last 14 years, and last year raised net income by 10 percent, to about $850 million on revenue of more than $7 billion. (Hearst declined to share more detailed financial information.) By comparison, in 1951, the year Mr. Hearst died, the company had earnings of around $2.6 million, or $20 million in 2005 dollars.
 Hearst has been known mostly for its magazines but, while the company generates nearly 60 percent of its revenue from advertising, magazines are expected to represent only 16 percent of its after-tax cash flow this year. Its 12 newspapers and 28 television stations contribute similar cash-flow numbers. According to the company, Hearst generates nearly half of its cash flow from having invested wisely in cable TV channels alongside the Walt Disney Company. 
 In fact, much of its business is conducted in a maze of partnerships and investments more typical of European family media dynasties than American media conglomerates. For instance, Hearst publishes Smart Money with Dow Jones, runs a magazine distribution business with its publishing rival Conde Nast, and in cable channels holds 50 percent of Lifetime, one-third of A&E and 20 percent of ESPN. 
 All three of those cable holdings are close partnerships with Disney, which also uses Hearst to distribute its ESPN Magazine. Hearst-Argyle Television, meanwhile, is the largest operator of affiliates for Disney's ABC network. 
 In a similar vein, NBC Universal owns another third of the cable channel A&E, and Hearst-Argyle is the second-largest operator of NBC affiliates. NBC Universal also recently acquired the Web site iVillage.com, in which Hearst was a 25 percent shareholder. 
 The ESPN stake, acquired for around $170 million in 1990, has been especially lucrative. Hearst's investment is now worth as much as $3.5 billion, estimates Laura Martin at Soleil Securities. And Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, says: ''In many respects we're joined at the hip. We don't really intersect with any other company in the world the way we do with Hearst.''
 Hearst's marquee magazine business has long bumped up against the fancier Conde Nast Publications and the Time Inc. juggernaut -- both of which outstrip Hearst's stable of 20 magazines in terms of ad pages and revenue in the United States. But Hearst has fought for a place in the top rank of publishers under the direction of Cathleen Black, its magazine president for the last decade.

Print and Online
 Most notably, Hearst Magazines has pursued an aggressive international expansion of its titles (Cosmopolitan alone has 56 separate editions) and enjoyed breakout success with O, The Oprah Magazine, a partnership with Oprah Winfrey, started in 2000. But a Lifetime magazine fizzled and other recent lifestyle ventures such as Shop Etc., Quick & Simple and Weekend appear, at first blush, more cautious than revolutionary. 
 But Ms. Black -- a champion of print for whom, it seems, the glass is not half-full but overflowing -- said the company was constantly looking at ways to introduce and extend brands. ''It's got to be something that parts the waters,'' she said.
 Her current focus is online. IVillage, before being sold, was the exclusive Web home for women's publications at Hearst. Now, the company is hustling to create its own digital sales division and pursuing new Web distribution deals like one Ms. Black announced last month with MSN.
 Elsewhere, Hearst's approach to the Internet has been typically idiosyncratic. Rather than running Web businesses, it has made some 35 investments in interactive start-ups that have included Netscape and XM Satellite Radio. Some of the company's recent bets -- including the companies Sling Media, Brightcove, USDTV and Current Communications -- reflect Mr. Ganzi's interest in capitalizing on new forms of distribution for Hearst's video businesses. 
 Since a vast majority of Hearst's 20,000 employees are outside New York, magazine staff members will fill most of the new tower's floors. Corporate executives and some other divisions will take what is left. The original magazine building, completed in 1928, was part of a plan the Chief hatched in his heyday -- when he owned three New York dailies -- for a gigantic media plaza. Indeed, its structure was built to support additional floors. Realizing Mr. Hearst's dream of a Midtown skyscraper has been under study for decades. 
 In his will, Mr. Hearst left an estate in trust valued at roughly $51 million to his wife, five sons and two charities (around $400 million in today's dollars). One provision of the will was that nonfamily members occupy 8 of the 13 slots on the board of trustees. Another was that the trust would dissolve on the death of the last grandchild living on the day Mr. Hearst died. Mr. Ganzi said actuaries estimated that to be some time around 2045 -- too far into the future to affect the company's strategic planning.

The Hearst Heirs
 Despite their codified independence, several people close to Hearst said Mr. Ganzi and other executives take pains not to be seen as getting in front of the Hearst heirs who are its shareholders. Today, some 60 descendants of Mr. Hearst's sons are among the owners and ''remaindermen'' (those who will inherit an interest) of the trust. Many of them meet once a year for a picnic in Northern California where, among other activities, bocce is inexplicably a favorite, said George R. Hearst III, a great-grandson of the founder. 
 George Hearst III is associate publisher of The Albany Times Union, a Hearst paper, and one of several family members who work in the business. His father, George R. Hearst Jr., the oldest surviving heir, is Hearst's chairman. The February issue of the company's Town & Country magazine was uncharacteristically familial: it featured the model Amanda Hearst posing at San Simeon, her great-grandfather's storied castle, in a cover spread.
 While there have been tremors of unrest among family members over the years -- not uncommon in wealthy dynasties--George Hearst III said in an interview that the family had been uniformly supportive of the new tower. 
 While it is not exactly Xanadu, Hearst Tower is certainly a major upgrade for many of the company's rank and file. With its soaring entry and French Balzac limestone lobby floor, the building sets a Four Seasons tone for a magazine business that rivals have viewed as more of a Sheraton. 
 ''I've always felt that that is not fair,'' Ms. Black said. ''What I do believe is fair is we've been a very profit-driven company forever. But there's a big difference between being profit-driven and being cheap.'' 
 Regardless, the company's image seems certain to change. The complex, designed by Norman Foster, features a 168-seat theater with top-end acoustics, a shimmering crystal waterfall, and Cafe 57, a staff commissary clearly intended to vie with Conde Nast's renowned cafeteria. (In a nod to the past, the company has also rebuilt the Good Housekeeping dining room from the former building.) 
 The building has a gymnasium with fancy Italian equipment, which both supplies and launders workout clothes for employees. ''I have to say that it's a lot more luxe than I expected,'' said David Granger, the editor of Esquire, whose staff is among 700 employees who have moved in as of last week. 
 Helen Gurley Brown, the longtime editor of Cosmopolitan and now head of its international editions, said she was delighted to be moving to a corner office with sweeping views on the 37th floor, leaving the fourth-floor space she occupies in Cosmo's current Midtown Manhattan offices. ''I exercise after lunch every day on the floor of my office and I don't want to go clear down to the gym,'' Ms. Gurley Brown said. ''But I think, on the 37th floor, if I stay down on the floor, no one is going to see me.''
 Hearst's executives say the best part is the culture that will emerge from gathering so many of their employees under one roof for the first time. Thus, for Mr. Ganzi, there is no contradiction in a media company whose bosses eschew public attention erecting a gleaming, translucent landmark.
 ''I'm less concerned about a statement to the world,'' he said. ''I'm more concerned about a statement to my colleagues. It's a statement about our future as well as, I think, a statement and commitment to our past.''

HEADLINE: Race Is On for Right to Operate New York Tracks

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
In a field without the Kentucky Derby-winning Barbaro or the Preakness champion, Bernardini, the 138th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday is anyone's to win. The same can be said about who will ultimately operate New York's three thoroughbred racetracks when the New York Racing Association's franchise expires next year.
 This week, a nine-member committee appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to ask for bids on Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga Race Course. It is the starting point for what is expected to be a complicated and highly politicized grab for a troubled entity. 
The prize is potentially huge: The three tracks handle more than $2.7 billion combined in horse-racing bets each year, and 4,500 video lottery terminals have been approved for Aqueduct, with a projected value of $650 million a year. 
 Legislators in Albany have said for several years that they are tired of scandals and mismanagement in NYRA , which has held the franchise since 1955 and is expected to try to keep it. Last December, the racing association received a $30 million bailout from the state.
 ''This thing has been a cash drain, while tracks in other states are cash cows,'' said Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate. ''Whoever is awarded the franchise must make sure New York remains the best racing in the world. It must be operated professionally by business and marketing people who can find ways to bring in additional revenue streams that pay dividends to the people of New York.''
 How that will be accomplished is not clear. Lawmakers may decide to sell the franchise or keep a stake in the racetracks through some type of public-private partnership. A potentially lucrative bid may prompt them to add more video lottery terminals at Belmont Park or fold the off-track betting parlors that are run by the six regional corporations into the deal.
 Lawmakers and bidders expect anywhere from six to eight proposals from some combination of racetrack operators, casino companies, private-equity firms and technology companies. The immediate point of curiosity is who partners with whom, but that will soon give way to each group's presumably bold plan to remake New York's racing and gambling landscape.
 The proposals are supposed to be returned by the fall, and the commission is to recommend a buyer before the year is out, but politics may make that timetable unrealistic. State elections in November will mean a new governor, and could affect the power centers of the State Senate and the Assembly.
 ''It always gets political,'' said Bruno, who has long been interested in racing issues and whose district includes Saratoga Springs. ''The good news is that we have major players bidding with good ideas about what needs to be done.''
 Despite its stagnant growth, horse racing generates $1.3 billion in annual economic activity in New York, provides 16,900 jobs and encompasses more than 152,000 people, including owners, service providers, employees and volunteers, according to Friends of New York Racing, an independent advocacy group formed in 2004. The group includes many of the companies and individuals expected to bid on the franchise.
 Although the nation's two largest racetrack operators -- Magna Entertainment and Churchill Downs -- have expressed interest in the franchise, two New York-based groups have been the most active in positioning themselves as candidates: Empire Racing Associates and NYRA.
 Empire Racing was created and is endorsed by the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, which represents more than 5,000 owners and trainers.
 ''It is important that the decision makers do everything possible to ensure that racing does not become a branch office for some out-of-state operation, where the energy, talent and money goes out of New York,'' said Jeff Perlee, the president and chief executive of Empire Racing Associates. ''It would not be good for the state or racing in New York.''
 Perlee and his members have courted New York-based companies with business interests in racing and gambling, including Buffalo-based Delaware North Companies, which owns and operates the racing and video lottery operations at Finger Lakes racetrack and operates the video lottery operations at Buffalo Raceway and at Saratoga Raceway.
 But Empire Racing is not the only bidder pursuing companies with roots in racing and gambling like Delaware North and Scientific Games, which owns Autotote, the company that processes horse bets.
 NYRA, in its pitch to retain its franchise, has emphasized the reforms it has put in place as well as its experience in conducting world-class racing. Its chairman, C. Steven Duncker, said the association proposed to use a nonprofit model to run the racing, and to find a partner to operate the gambling and help satisfy state revenue needs.
 Duncker said the association had responded to state investigations by Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic state attorney general who is now running for governor, as well as to a 2003 tax-evasion scandal involving several mutuel clerks. The tax scandal resulted in NYRA's being put under a federal monitor for 18 months in a plea agreement.
 ''We have changed our board, our structure and improved our business practices,'' Duncker said. ''We have been recognized as a national leader on issues of integrity like drug testing. We're not what we were.''
 Still, the association owes at least $70 million to the state and is counting on revenue that will come from video lottery terminals. Its financial problems and the uncertain status of its franchise have left Aqueduct a dusty construction site and have delayed its current gambling partner, MGM Mirage, from renovating the grandstand and installing the video lottery terminals.
 The association has also threatened to enter into what could be a long and costly legal battle over who owns the land on which the three tracks stand. It claims that it possesses the deeds to the properties and has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in state property taxes.
 There is little consensus on how much the franchise will fetch from bidders. In Pataki's 2005 budget proposal, he indicated that he expected a starting bid of at least $250 million, with annual payments of perhaps tens of millions more.
 Legislators and bidders, however, agree that the web of competing jurisdictions in New York racing needs to be untangled if the state or operators are to make money.
 ''It's going to take public awareness and pressure to get things done on this,'' Bruno said of the legislative effort. ''It's going to be like moving mountains, but I believe there is a willingness to do so because the industry is too important for this state.''

 BODY:

MONEY MEN -- The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke; the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet; and the deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, Toshiro Muto, are scheduled to speak at an international monetary conference in Washington. (Monday.) 


MULLING OFFERS -- Bids for the consumer products unit of Pfizer, which makes Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed nasal decongestant are due. Among the expected suitors is GlaxoSmithKline. Sale of the Pfizer unit could bring in $14 billion to $16 billion, analysts estimate. (Tuesday.)

HE'S BACK -- Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, is expected to testify at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on oil dependence and economic risk. (Wednesday.)

LOOKING ABROAD -- BMC Software, a maker of management software, is expected to report earnings of 29 cents a share on revenue of $400 million for its fourth quarter. In May, the company bought Identify Software, the Israeli transaction management company, for $150 million, further extending its investment in that country. (Wednesday.)

DOWN, BUT UP -- The video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, the maker of the popular Grand Theft Auto series, will report its second-quarter earnings. Analysts expect the company to say that it had a loss of a penny a share. That is decidedly better than the 12 cents a share it lost in the same period a year ago. (Thursday.)

ON SOLID FOOTING -- Analysts expect National Semiconductor, which makes components for hand-held devices for companies like Motorola, Nokia and Samsung, to report a quarterly profit of 38 cents a share on revenue of $563 million. Since National has turned around its profitability and operating results over the last three years, continued above-average growth could prove challenging. (Thursday.)

AT A LOSS -- The Commerce Department will release the trade deficit figures for April. Economists expect the report, the most important economic data of the week, to show a deficit of $65 billion. The trade deficit was $62 billion in March. (Friday.)

HEADLINE: In State Races, Tougher Questions About Abortion

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Gretchen Ruethling contributed reporting from Chicago for this article.

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, June 2 

 BODY:
Even in a room of sixth graders sitting cross-legged on the floor, usually the safest of venues for political candidates, the question emerged from one sweet face: What is your position on abortion?
 Mike Blouin, who is running for governor, has been asked that a lot lately, though abortion bans are more typically the purview of presidents who might pick United States Supreme Court nominees or senators who might confirm them. The Supreme Court declared a constitutional right to abortion 33 years ago in Roe v. Wade.
 But with South Dakota this year having passed the country's most restrictive state abortion law in decades and a sense among some advocates on both sides of the abortion debate that a changed Supreme Court could one day leave the abortion question in the hands of the states, tough questions about abortion rights are being raised in local races across the country. 
 Questions about how to regulate or restrict abortion have long been issues in state races. But in campaigns for governor and the Legislature here in Iowa and in numerous other states, many candidates are being asked not only about limits on abortion, but also a far broader, starker question: to outlaw or not to outlaw? 
 ''The State of South Dakota made it an issue,'' Mr. Blouin said in an interview in the teachers' lounge at Robert Lucas Elementary School after he had met the sixth graders. He is one of four candidates seeking the Democratic nomination on Tuesday to succeed Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat who has decided not to seek re-election after two terms.
 A former congressman who in the 1970's pushed for a federal ban on abortion, Mr. Blouin would have a simpler path if the questions went away. He said that he had ''transitioned on this issue'' over the years -- that although he remained ''very strongly anchored as a person who believes in life,'' he would oppose a ban if one was passed by lawmakers. ''I'd veto it in a heartbeat,'' he said.
 One of Mr. Blouin's chief rivals, Chet Culver, the secretary of state, has made his own support for abortion rights a central issue of his campaign, raising doubts about Mr. Blouin's stance. 
 After shaking hands at the Hamburg Inn restaurant here this week, Mr. Culver trumpeted his endorsement by Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa's Political Action Committee, the organization's first endorsement in a governor's race.
 ''A woman's right to choose is under assault, and people in this state are absolutely worried,'' Mr. Culver said. ''This has become a very important issue in this state and in state races around the country -- and it should be.''
 In Florida, the Democratic and Republican hopefuls for governor have staked out sides over a state ban. On the Republican side, Charlie Crist has taken criticism from some for seeming to shift on just how many exceptions he thinks a ban should include -- solely to save a woman's life or also when rape or incest is involved. 
 In Arkansas, candidates in one Republican State Senate primary disagreed only about when a state ban should come: before or after Roe v. Wade might be overturned. In Ohio, both Republican hopefuls for governor -- including J. Kenneth Blackwell, the secretary of state and now the party's nominee -- told newspapers they would sign an abortion ban like South Dakota's if the State Legislature were to pass such a bill.
 In many state races, it remains uncertain who will benefit from the sudden focus on abortion bans -- candidates who oppose abortion rights or those who favor them. Sometimes the political calculation gets complicated. While support for bans has grown, especially in some Southern states, even those who oppose abortion rights do not agree that direct challenges to Roe v. Wade are the best approach. Some argue that gradual efforts to limit abortion are more likely to win support. 
 ''I think that, in the short term, this issue can be less helpful to pro-life candidates,'' said Daniel McConchie, vice president of Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights. ''The questions that are being asked are hypothetical, things governors mostly won't control. My concern is that the average person on the ground will misinterpret the questions to be something more real than they really are right now.''
 Jill June, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, said that worry about the possibility of additional state bans was real and that supporters of abortion rights had been stirred to action. ''It now becomes much more generally understood that a state really could outlaw it,'' Ms. June said. ''We know this is contagious, and we're fear-struck.''
 In South Dakota, Gov. Michael Rounds in March signed into law the nation's most sweeping state abortion ban, a move intended to set up a direct court challenge to Roe v. Wade. But opponents of the ban, which outlaws abortion except when the mother's life is in jeopardy, have moved to challenge the law at the ballot box instead. They filed petitions last month, hoping to send the question to voters in November. On all sides of the issue, it is clear that some candidates might have preferred for it not to grab quite so much notice. 
 Another Democratic hopeful for governor in Iowa, Ed Fallon, state representative from Des Moines who has long supported abortion rights, said he would veto any abortion ban.
 But Mr. Fallon, who is viewed by some as the most liberal candidate (a label he rejects), said he would rather spend his campaign talking about less ''politically polarizing issues,'' like campaign finance reform, health care, education and the environment.
 Sal Mohamed, a little-known candidate who is an engineer, said that he would most likely veto a broad abortion ban, but he, too, suggested that the issue might not warrant so much concern in the race here.
 ''I just don't think that we're going to get to that point in Iowa anyway,'' Mr. Mohamed said. 
 But the terrain is most complicated for Mr. Blouin, who says he considers himself ''pro-life'' but has, as he says, recognized that issues he considered black and white in his 20's turned ''fairly gray'' later in life. 
 ''Now you have a pro-life pro-choicer,'' said David Yepsen, the political columnist for The Des Moines Register. ''I don't think either side is happy with him.''
 A Register poll, published in Sunday's editions, showed Mr. Culver winning among 36 percent of those surveyed, followed by Mr. Blouin with 28 percent, Mr. Fallon with 21 percent and Mr. Mohamed with 1 percent. The survey of 600 likely voters in the Democratic primary found 14 percent undecided. The poll had an error margin of 4 percentage points.
 Mr. Blouin, the state's former economic development director, has worked to hold on to the support of those who may favor abortion rights. He picked as his running mate Andrea McGuire, a physician who favors such rights. 
 But it is the abortion rights opponents who seem most irked at Mr. Blouin, once a champion for their efforts. ''He's a hypocrite,'' said Kim Lehman, executive director of the Iowa Right to Life Committee. ''He says he's pro-life, and yet what he's really saying is that he is personally pro-life but would take no action that's pro-life. He's the worst kind of so-called pro-life. I don't think he has a right to call himself pro-life.''
 Whatever Democratic candidate emerges from the election on Tuesday (if none garners 35 percent of the vote, the winner will be chosen at a state convention), the questions about abortion are not going away; nor is the awkward political terrain.
 Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, will face the Democratic nominee in November. Asked repeatedly for an interview with Mr. Nussle about his views on abortion, his spokeswoman, Maria A. Comella, said the candidate was too busy. 
 Ms. Comella provided Mr. Nussle's comments from a Radio Iowa interview on March 7, when he was asked about the possibility of an abortion ban here. ''I'm 100 percent pro-life, and that's my voting record,'' he said, adding that he had promoted a bill that would require parental consent for minors getting abortions. 
 In the radio interview, Mr. Nussle said he did not believe the Iowa Legislature would consider restrictions as ''far reaching'' as South Dakota's. He added, ''I will work with the Legislature if I have the opportunity to be governor to try and ensure that parents have more of a direct impact on their kids' choices as far as abortions are concerned.''
 But Mr. Nussle, his spokeswoman acknowledged, has yet to publicly answer this season's question: to outlaw or not.

HEADLINE: Canadian Border Proves Difficult to Secure

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
Tighter border controls between the United States and Canada are likely to be less useful than better domestic intelligence and information-sharing in detecting homegrown terrorist plots in North America, terrorism experts said yesterday.
 According to Canadian authorities, the suspected fertilizer bomb plot that led to the arrest Saturday in Ontario of 17 men, most of them Canadian citizens of South Asian origin, appeared to follow the pattern of successful terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004 and in London last year. As in those instances, officials said, those accused in the Canadian case are Muslims with no evident ties to Al Qaeda leaders overseas except a shared ideology.
 ''These are the metastases of the cancer of international Islamic extremism,'' said John O. Brennan, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and a former career Central Intelligence Agency officer. ''It shows the terrorist threat may be within our midst and not coming from off our shores.'' 
 Mr. Brennan said that while improved border technology and a planned requirement that Canadian visitors carry passports might help, there was no chance of stopping all potential terrorists from crossing a 4,000-mile border that includes huge swaths of forest and the Great Lakes.
 ''You don't want to paralyze the cross-border traffic and trade that's so important to both countries,'' Mr. Brennan said in an interview. Rather, he said, the lesson for the United States is the value of careful, patient intelligence collection to detect possible threats.
 Speaking in similar terms yesterday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised what she called Canada's ''very great success in their counterterrorism efforts.''
 ''We have excellent counterterrorism cooperation with Canada and we're very glad to see this operation being a success,'' Ms. Rice said on the CNN program ''Late Edition.'' ''We don't know of any indication that there is a U.S. part to this, but by all means, we have the best possible cooperation.''
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Saturday that there were contacts between two of the suspects arrested in Canada and two men living in Georgia who were recently arrested, Syed Haris Ahmed, 21, and Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, 19. But the bureau reiterated in a statement yesterday that ''there is no current outstanding threat to any targets on U.S. soil emanating from this case.''
 Richard Kolko, an F.B.I. spokesman, said the bureau and its Canadian counterpart had ''worked closely on this investigation'' as they had on previous counterterrorism matters. He declined to give details.
 The Canadian arrests were made in the midst of an intense political debate over illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico. The news focused new attention on the Canadian border, which is twice as long and much less patrolled than the Mexican border. Proponents of tighter immigration controls asserted that the Canadian arrests underscored the threat they said lurked just beyond American borders.
 Michael W. Cutler, a former veteran immigration agent now at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said relatively liberal political asylum rules in Canada for immigrants, combined with the relatively open border, were ''a nightmare for the U.S.'' 
 But Mr. Cutler acknowledged the impossibility of sealing the border with Canada and said better enforcement of immigration laws inside the United States might be more important than tighter entrance controls. ''The bottom line is we can't just focus on the border,'' he said.
 Michael Wilson, Canada's ambassador to the United States, yesterday denied that his country had weak asylum rules or was home to large numbers of Al Qaeda sympathizers.
 ''I think that our immigration laws as they are implemented are very close in the outcomes as the United States immigration laws,'' Mr. Wilson said on ''Late Edition.'' ''We take very seriously these issues of terrorism, as demonstrated by this very successful exercise that was completed on Friday night, Saturday morning.''
 As part of the intelligence reorganization of 2004, Congress required that starting in 2008 Canadians must show a passport or a similarly secure document to enter the United States. But under legislation recently passed by the Senate and pending in the House, the requirement would be postponed until at least June 2009.
 Senator Norm Coleman, Republican from Minnesota and the main proponent of delaying the passport requirement, said in a statement yesterday that it in no way reflected a lack of ''vigilance against terrorism.'' Instead, Mr. Coleman said, his amendment was intended to make sure new border-crossing procedures are tested to see if they can work without ''strangling the economies of our border communities.''
 The arrest in December 1999 of Ahmed Ressam as he tried to carry explosives from Canada into Washington State helped unravel the so-called Millennium terrorist plot, and Canadian authorities have kept suspected radicals in the large South Asian populations in big Canadian cities under surveillance.
 But Stephen E. Flynn, a counterterrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said any notion that Canada posed a security threat ''needs a sanity check.''
 Mr. Flynn said that from local law enforcement to national intelligence agencies, the two countries cooperated intensely on counterterrorism.
 Mr. Flynn and Mr. Brennan said the arrests in Canada demonstrated the need for better domestic intelligence against terrorist threats, a touchy area in which aggressive efforts by the Bush administration have already prompted an outcry from civil libertarians.

HEADLINE: Biotech Food Tears Rifts In Europe 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
In this famously fractious country, there is one thing on which almost all Greeks agree: They do not want genetically modified crops grown, sold or eaten here.
 ''All political parties are opposed,'' said Theodore Koliopanos, a legislator and former deputy environment minister, ''which is odd because we disagree on everything else.''
 Greece and a few other countries in the European Union that have banned genetically modified organisms are on the front lines of a war over the future of modified food in Europe, the only large swath of the world that does not already grow or buy the crops. Facing international pressure and a lawsuit brought by the United States, Canada and Argentina at the World Trade Organization, the union said this year that all member states must open their doors to genetically engineered crops and prepare practical and legal regulations to ensure safety for health and the environment.
 But five countries have imposed eight different types of bans. Many others use their votes in Europe's Council of Ministers to block the crops from entering. 
 The battle does more than pit the World Trade Organization against the European Union. It also creates a divide across the Atlantic, between European allies on the one hand, and the United States and Canada, which produce the vast majority of such seeds and crops, on the other. The United States is not shy about enlisting its diplomats to push European countries to admit the modified crops, European politicians say. 
 But European consumers and farmers generally do not want them, leaving the European Union to try to steer a Solomonic course between conflicting interests. The basic problem is that Europeans, whose food culture has developed over centuries, balk at putting biotech crops in their fields or their mouths.
 ''We think we have a good policy but we have discovered extreme reluctance among consumers and many member states to move forward with G.M.O.'s, who again and again block the approvals,'' said Barbara Helferrich, a spokeswoman for the union's Environment Directorate.
 Since the union is a common market, lawmakers in Brussels demand a unified solution. So a seed that is sold in Britain has to be sold in Poland and Greece as well. But critics say that countries should be permitted to decide if they will accept a risk, however small, noting, for example, that unpasteurized milk is legal in France but not in Britain.
 But while there is little, if any, scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are harmful, in much of Europe they are so unpopular that mainstream supermarket giants like Migros will not stock them. In surveys, consumers say they are unconvinced that genetically modified crops are safe, particularly for the environment.
 ''The environment minister who gives in and allows G.M.O.'s into this country will never be minister again,'' said Nikos Lappas, head of Greece's largest farmers' union. ''For farmers, forcing G.M.O.'s would be economic suicide, since our market doesn't want them.''
 But producers of genetically modified products (and the countries they represent) are aggressively pursuing their case at the W.T.O. and with individual governments, spurred by an untapped European market. 
 ''The first visit any new minister in Greece gets is from the U.S. ambassador saying, 'You need to have G.M.O.'s,' '' said Mr. Koliopanos. ''The pressure is incredible.''
 Biotech companies like Monsanto and Syngenta insist that the crops should be immediately admitted to Europe, because genetically engineered foods have been consumed in much of the world for a decade without obvious ill effects. Their safety, said Christopher Horner, a Monsanto spokesman, has been ''ratified by numerous credible regulatory and scientific authorities.'' 
 Simon Barber, of EuropaBio, an industry group in Brussels, said: ''The E.U. has put systems in place to deal with G.M.O.'s, and now the market has to be allowed to operate. If member states are breaking E.U. law, we expect the commission to take action.''
 The office of the United States trade representative maintains that ''the E.U. is imposing undue delays on biotech approvals, resulting in delays and preventing the marketing of many crops grown in the U.S.'' The United States grows 220 million acres of genetically modified crops -- by far the world's leader -- and almost none of it is sold to the European Union. From 1998 to 2004, the European Union imposed a de facto moratorium on farming of genetically modified crops while its officials studied the issue and mulled ways to keep biotech crops and other crops distinct.
 Genetically engineered seeds and plants contain genes that were inserted in a laboratory that give them special advantages, like resisting common pests. But pollen from those crops can spread in the air from field to field, intermixing with pollen from conventional crops.
 Once genetically modified crops enter a country's food production, it can be difficult and costly to keep the food chain free of them because there is mixing of plants from farms in milling and in production.
 Greece and other European Union members say such issues make any cultivation of biotech plants impossible because they would quickly infiltrate both agriculture and the food supply. In much of Europe, where small farms are the norm, it is hard to create ''buffer zones'' between fields on adjacent farms.
 ''I would guess we may be able to keep them apart in U.K., but it would be difficult in Greece because of the issue of size,'' said Julian Kinderlerer of the Institute of Biotechnical Law and Ethics at the University of Sheffield in England.
 Europe's agricultural insurers will not cover farmers for liability should their genetically modified crops contaminate adjacent fields.
 ''I started with an open mind on this but now I think the answers are clear,'' said Mr. Lappas, of the Greek farmers' union. ''If our market doesn't buy it, and insurers won't insure us, how can we grow it?'' Indeed, in many areas that have blocked genetically engineered crops, small farmers survive by producing niche food, like unique, high-quality vegetables and grain; there is a premium for food that is not genetically modified. 
 ''This is a cutthroat global market, and if all we do is cultivate mass-produced G.M. corn, we're finished, since other nations will be able to provide that cheaper,'' Mr. Lappas said.
 In Poland, 1.5 million farms are still mostly farmed without pesticides, giving that nation the opportunity to become an important producer of natural foods, according to the International Coalition to Protect the Polish Countryside, which has lobbied for a national ban.
 To the biotech industry and major producers, the issue is simple: genetically modified corn is just corn, genetically modified wheat is just wheat and there is no scientific reason to differentiate.
 Industry groups argue that products should not even be labeled modified or free of modification because the labels are unfair trade barriers.
 ''Labeling has turned out to be a stigma because the public is so frightened, and retailers have become easy targets,'' said Mr. Barber, of EuropaBio. ''Look at the Greenpeace Web site with its list of brands that use G.M.'s. We're O.K. with consumers making a choice, but we're leery because they're scared, and we're labeling identical products.''
 Genetically modified seeds are approved case by case, and once the European Commission has approved a seed for planting, the only legal reason that a country can enforce a ban is if ''new scientific evidence'' shows it would be harmful.
 But recently, each time the commission has approved a new product, the Council of Ministers (representing the member states) has voted against it, creating an impasse. 
 In addition, some countries still say modified seeds are unsafe, invoking the so-called scientific exception.
 ''They haven't provided any new evidence,'' said Michael J. Phillips, a vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington.
 The European Food Safety Authority of the European Union provides scientific judgments on matters like new evidence. The European Commission and the Council of Ministers have also referred their impasses to the safety agency.
 But this agency's core mandate concerns food safety, and even the union's environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas, said recently that it had not looked adequately at the long-term effects of biotech crops on issues like biodiversity.
 At a recent meeting with disgruntled member states in Brussels, Harry A. Kuiper, chairman of the agency's panel on genetically modified crops, defended its work, noting that its experts had just six months to review each submission.
 The European Union still hopes to win over reluctant members, and so far has taken none to court. But environmental groups vow to resist any pressure from Brussels. 
 ''The E.U. policy of just pushing forward with the technology is utter blindness,'' said Helen Holder, a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth in Europe. ''Genetic contamination is unavoidable and irreversible and will only increase over time.''

HEADLINE: For Law Firm, Serial Plaintiff Had Golden Touch

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
When it came to investing, Howard J. Vogel seemed to possess a perverse kind of Midas touch. 
 In early October 1997, he bought 50 shares of Oxford Health Plans. Three weeks later, the stock nose-dived, and Mr. Vogel lost about $3,000 of his investment. Still, Mr. Vogel reaped $1.1 million.
 How was that possible?
 Mr. Vogel was a plaintiff in a shareholder lawsuit filed by the New York securities litigation powerhouse Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach against Oxford Health. In 2003, the company, along with other parties that were sued, paid $300 million to settle. 
 Most of the investors received pennies on the dollar for their losses. But Mr. Vogel, then a real estate mortgage broker in Englewood, N.J., was not just a hapless investor who bought the wrong stock at the wrong time. 
 Mr. Vogel now says, according to a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, that he and members of his family were actually linchpins in a long-running arrangement that helped Milberg Weiss snare the lucrative lead counsel position in the Oxford Health and many other securities lawsuits, reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. 
 Mr. Vogel, who has since moved to Florida, is a central figure in the government's case against Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, as the law firm is now called. Last month, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the firm and two of its name partners on several criminal charges, including racketeering conspiracy and money laundering. The firm is accused of making $11.3 million in illegal secret payments to Mr. Vogel and two others who served as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits. 
 The firm contends it has done nothing improper and has vowed to fight the charges against it. But Milberg Weiss is struggling to keep its lawyers and clients from walking away. Several lawyers have left the firm and a number of institutional investors, including the New York state employee pension fund, have removed it as counsel in high-profile lawsuits.
 The Oxford Health lawsuit was widely watched at the time, and it takes on new significance in light of Mr. Vogel's admissions and prosecutors' charges. 
 It provides a window into how, even after Congress passed legislation in 1995 aimed at undermining Milberg Weiss's dominance, the firm worked feverishly to find ways to maneuver around the new landscape.
 Yesterday, William W. Taylor, a lawyer at Zuckerman Spaeder who represents Milberg Weiss, said in response to questions: "On behalf of the firm, the Oxford case was handled in the highest traditions of Milberg's practice. The result obtained was exemplary and the firm is proud of the result in that case as it is in all of its cases." 
 The 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, or P.S.L.R.A., was intended to make it harder for plaintiffs' lawyers to file lawsuits after merely finding a single investor who held the stock of the company to be sued. Under the law, courts were required to select the investor with the largest loss as lead plaintiff, whose lawyer then coordinated the lawsuit.
 The law was meant to rein in lawyers who simply eyeballed companies that were in trouble and ran to the courthouse with a plaintiff in tow at the first hiccup in the share price.
 In many ways, the law seems to have had the intended effect. Since the legislation was enacted, institutional investors like big state pension funds have led the charge in numerous shareholder lawsuits, like those involving Enron and WorldCom. 
 Still, the majority of federal securities lawsuits settled last year -- 62 percent -- had individuals as lead plaintiffs, according to NERA Economic Consulting in White Plains.
 Indeed, in the cases cited by federal prosecutors in the indictment of Milberg Weiss, the law firm's frequent clients were individual investors, including Mr. Vogel; his wife, Eugenia Gladstone Vogel; and his stepson, Emile Gladstone. Mr. Vogel's lawyer would not comment for this article.
 Yet while Mr. Vogel and his family were frequently named as plaintiffs, they were not always successful in winning lead-plaintiff status. That would not mean that the case was a total loss for Milberg Weiss, but its share of any settlement would almost certainly be smaller.
 That is because the lead counsel in a lawsuit typically has considerable influence over how the fees will be awarded to other law firms after a settlement is reached, according to plaintiffs' lawyers. 
 ''What typically happens in a securities litigation is you have one case filed and then you have three or four copycat'' complaints, said John H. Henn, a defense lawyer at Foley Hoag in Boston. ''Then they agree among themselves about on who would make the best lead plaintiff.''
 Or they have knock-down-drag-out courtroom brawls.
 The decision over lead plaintiff in the Oxford Health case dragged on for nearly four years, took many bizarre twists along the way and featured a revolving cast of plaintiffs.
 In the fall of 1997, malfunctions in Oxford Health's computer system led to unexpected losses and a steep drop in its stock price, which wiped out nearly $3 billion of the company's market value. In the days after the announcement, more than 50 class-action lawsuits were filed against the company, claiming that Oxford officials had known of the computer problems and their effects, but had misled investors by failing to disclose what they knew.
 ''The advantage to having a client and being on file with a class action is that you could then send out mailings or press releases, trying to find other plaintiffs who had bigger losses,'' said a plaintiffs' lawyer who did not want to be identified because he works in the field. ''Even if you had a small client, it was at least a foot in the door that allowed you to get the process rolling.''
 Oxford Health was a big, juicy target for plaintiffs' lawyers.
 A lawyer who tried to get his clients named lead plaintiffs in the Oxford case, Lee Squitieri, said: ''It looked like a good case right out of the box. This was not what we called a 'prediction case' where the wrongdoing consisted of a prediction that turned out to be untrue. This was a better case. It involved concealing material information. That's a good case.'' 
 Milberg Weiss's biggest rival for lead plaintiff was the Colorado Public Employees' Retirement Association, which claimed it had lost more than $20 million when Oxford Health's stock fell. The mutual fund company PBHG, managed by Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, also wanted to be the lead plaintiff, contending that six of its funds had lost $4.3 million. It later dropped all but one of the funds from its claim, saying that the remaining one lost $65,000.
 Undaunted by groups that, arguably, better met the requirements under the new law, Milberg Weiss aggregated a group of 35 individuals who it said had lost a total of $10 million.
 Milberg Weiss's initial plaintiff in the case was Mr. Vogel. What was unknown at the time was that Mr. Vogel had acquired shares of the stock on the belief that it was on the verge of a collapse. 
 In late April, Mr. Vogel pleaded guilty to a single count of perjury -- falsely stating in a court filing that he had not received payment other than his share of the settlement proceeds. In exchange for his cooperation, Mr. Vogel was not charged with being part of the conspiracy that Milberg Weiss is accused of. In addition, prosecutors agreed to recommend leniency in sentencing.
 According to Mr. Vogel's plea agreement, he contacted ''Partner E'' -- identified by lawyers involved in the case as Robert Sugarman, a former Milberg Weiss lawyer -- and ''discussed a potential securities fraud class-action lawsuit''against Oxford Health. Mr. Sugarman is said to be cooperating with federal prosecutors. Mr. Sugarman's lawyer declined to comment.
 Dating back to 1991, Mr. Vogel had been a lead plaintiff in numerous lawsuits filed by Milberg Weiss for which he illegally received a cut of the law firm's fees -- as much as 14 percent, according to court filings. 
 But in the case of Oxford, Mr. Vogel was told by Mr. Sugarman that his payment would be less than his usual percentage because the lawsuit was so large and ''Milberg Weiss would have other payment obligations in the case,'' the indictment said. 
 In 1998, the lawyer representing the Colorado pension fund, Jay W. Eisenhofer, challenged whether Mr. Vogel's losses were substantial enough to meet the law's new requirements.
 Patricia M. Hynes, a Milberg Weiss lawyer who was not named in the indictment and has not been accused of any wrongdoing, responded in a June 1998 hearing that among the 35 plaintiffs representing the ''Vogel group'' were three individuals who had lost $2 million to $3.4 million each. 
 Swayed by Ms. Hynes's argument, the judge overseeing the case, Charles L. Brieant of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, decided to proceed with three co-lead plaintiffs -- the Colorado retirement fund, the PBHG mutual funds and the ''Vogel Plaintiff Group,'' which now did not include Mr. Vogel because his losses were too small. Instead, it consisted of Gary Weber, Daniel Hurley and Michael Sabbia. Milberg Weiss was named co-lead counsel, along with Grant & Eisenhofer, which represented the Colorado fund, and Chitwood & Harley, which represented PBHG.
 The size of the losses by the individual investors became a focal point after lawyers with Sullivan & Cromwell, which represented Oxford Health, began to dig into the trading records of the Milberg Weiss plaintiffs.
 Milberg Weiss had already revised Mr. Hurley's losses, dropping them from $3.4 million to less than $1 million after realizing an error had been made in going through his trading records.
 But the lawyers for Oxford argued that more than 4,000 transactions in Oxford options that they had each engaged in during the 13 months of the time period of the lawsuit had been omitted. 
 By their accounting, Mr. Hurley had actually made $700,747 in profits from his combined trading in stock and options, while Mr. Sabbia's loss totaled $315,000. That was a far cry from the $2 million loss that Ms. Hynes told the court in 1998 Mr. Sabbia had suffered. 
 Ms. Hynes claimed the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers had used ''discredited experts, flawed methodologies and erroneous 'alternative' calculations of plaintiffs' losses.'' By her firm's calculations, even taking the options trading activity into account, Mr. Sabbia still lost more than $1 million and Mr. Hurley more than $500,000. Those were ''substantial losses by any measure,'' she stated in a 2000 memo to the court. 
 When contacted, Mr. Sabbia and Mr. Hurley said this was the first time they had been plaintiffs in lawsuits and both men said they did not receive any money from Milberg Weiss for their roles in the lawsuit. Mr. Sabbia added that he had no idea there was even any dispute surrounding the size of his loss in Oxford Health. ''I lost tons,'' he said. 
 Judge Brieant rejected the defense lawyers' objections, ruling that the two Milberg Weiss clients had indeed suffered losses and could continue as lead plaintiffs.
 There were problems with another Milberg Weiss plaintiff, Mr. Weber, who withdrew from the case in late 1999, weeks after he was deposed by lawyers for Oxford. A court document in the case that was recently unsealed is a letter to the judge from a Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer who said Mr. Weber ''chose to lie'' about his education, criminal record, history as a defendant in a civil case and his trading in Oxford securities. The National Law Journal reported on the letter in early 2000. A call to Mr. Weber's office was not returned.
 Despite these setbacks, Milberg Weiss and the other lead plaintiffs' law firms reached the $300 million settlement in June 2003. Milberg Weiss's share of the legal fees totaled about $40 million, according to the Justice Department's indictment.
 A few months later, Mr. Vogel contacted another Milberg Weiss lawyer, Steven G. Schulman, about his payments for Oxford and other cases, the indictment said. Mr. Schulman and another Milberg Weiss partner, David J. Bershad, were also indicted by the federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month and have taken leaves of absences from the firm. Mr. Bershad's lawyer said his client ''vigorously'' denied the charges. A call to Mr. Schulman's lawyer was not returned.

HEADLINE: So Tourists Can Come to Spend, Refugees Are Paid to Go

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: BATUMI, Georgia 

 BODY:
Marina Gahukidze checked into the Meskheti, a hotel in this faded resort town, in 1993, and never left. She and her husband have raised three children in a 10th-floor room with a balcony and a view of the beach. 
 ''We didn't expect to live here so long,'' she said of the hotel room, the only home her children have known. 
There are reasons to stay. The hotel overlooks a gray pebble beach on the Black Sea and rolling green hills, a picturesque scene that resembles Northern California. It is a subtropical town with velvety springs and mild winters. It's just that the hotel is occupied by refugees, not tourists. 
 But the summer of 2006 will be the Gahukidze family's last in the region of Ajaria, a ribbon of coastal land that includes Batumi and was wrenched two years ago from a renegade, separatist leader, Aslan Abashidze. The family is finally moving out, as this former resort town and oil port built by French architects in the 19th century embarks on a crash development program to bring back the tourists. 
 Mr. Abashidze, a Soviet apparatchik, seized control as the Soviet Union crumbled in the early 1990's, and then shut Batumi off from the world while conducting what Interpol said was a lucrative underground trade in guns and alcohol. 
 He was ousted on May 5, 2004, by Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president who assumed power in 2003, vowing to assert control over the country's three separatist regions -- two in former beach resort areas. 
 The refugees in Batumi come from a still-unresolved conflict in Abkhazia, the other resort district -- and therein lies the secret of the money now pouring into Batumi, and the effort to move Ms. Gahukidze from her room. 
 Georgian officials hope to use Batumi to demonstrate to the other breakaway regions the potential rewards that follow when a separatist region becomes part of a recognized state. 
 The city, they say, is becoming a showcase of how quickly one of the so-called ''frozen conflicts'' of the former Soviet Union -- Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been fought over by Armenia and Azerbaijan; Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia; and Transnistria in Moldova -- can thaw out. 
 ''We should communicate to them that they have a future,'' Mr. Saakashvili said of residents of nearby Abkhazia, in an interview in May over meat dumplings at a seaside cafe. ''It will take two or three years, but they will notice. When we have yachts in the harbor, they will see.'' 
 Like Beirut on the Mediterranean Sea, a cosmopolitan seafront town that dropped off the map because of war, Batumi on the Black Sea is slowly shaking off its stupor. 
 The transformation is moving rapidly. 
 Two years after Mr. Abashidze, the separatist leader, fled to Moscow, Novotel, the French hotel chain, has signed a contract to open a hotel. A golf course is planned in place of a former Russian tank base, which sat on an open bluff over the sea that suggests the rolling green fairways of the Pebble Beach golf course in California. An amusement park is going up this summer.
 Batumi officials expect 300,000 tourists this season, up from almost none through the 1990's. In the past two years workers have paved about 79 miles of streets and roads, compared to 10 in the previous 13 years. 
 In the largest investment to date, the TuranAlem bank of Kazakhstan bought 21 hotels -- including the Meskheti, where Ms. Gahukidze lives. As part of the investment, the bank will pay each family $7,000 to move out, enough for a modest apartment in an outlying district. 
 When the refugees are gone, the Kazakh investors will raze and rebuild some hotels and refurbish others. The hotels are now home to 1,912 families, or about 6,000 people. So far, 1,400 people have moved out. 
 Ten miles south of town is a Byzantine castle with a crenelated wall, now guarding a courtyard of citrus trees, also making a debut to the modern world as a tourist attraction; during Soviet times, it was in a closed border zone and off limits.
 The detritus of stone Roman waterworks is scattered under a magnolia tree; the pleasing aroma of mandarin orange trees in bloom wafts over the old rocks. 
 The now abandoned castle is emblematic of the tourist potential in Georgia, where the landscape resembles the south of France. 
 ''It will be a key part of economic growth,'' Irakli Chogovadze, Georgia's economic minister, said in an interview in May, while attending a ribbon-cutting at the Intourist Palace hotel in Batumi. ''Wherever you put your finger on the Georgian map, you have potential.''
 Beside a bubbling fountain in the hotel foyer, waitresses in pressed white shirts wove through a crowd of dignitaries with trays of Champagne flutes and caviar canapes.
 The Georgian economy grew 9 percent last year. Foreign visits were up by 14 percent. 
 For now, most of the visitors are coming from the former Soviet Union, Turkey and Iran. The Iranians began slipping over last summer for a few days of freedom, drinking and girl-watching, none of which is allowed in their strictly Islamic country. 
 Ryan V. Hale, 25, a Bible study teacher from Salem, Ore., who is taking a vacation through Georgia after a religious exchange program, padded recently through the lobby of another hotel, the L-Bakuri, in shorts and tennis shoes, a true tourist pioneer. ''I came because I wanted to see the Black Sea,'' he said. ''The architecture is also pretty.''
 Georgia has ambitions of joining NATO one day. Still, the new governor here, 34-year-old Levan Varshalmoidze, brushes aside questions about NATO, saying that it is not within his local mandate, and that it is unlikely a military base will be built in his region. 
 Besides, he said, ''I'll use all the flat land for hotels before they get here.''

HEADLINE: The Estate Tax, Back on the Agenda

 BODY:
Still giddy over the passage last month of a $70 billion income tax cut for affluent Americans, Senate Republicans are hoping this week to go further, and gut the federal estate tax. And they'll probably try to accomplish this gift to the super-rich under the guise of compromise. 
 Their fondest wish would be to permanently repeal the tax. But planning, during a time of war, to give away nearly $1 trillion over 10 years may look too radical even for this crowd. So the senators are also considering a so-called middle-of-the-road approach. Sponsored by Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, the ''compromise'' would drastically raise the thresholds at which the estate tax kicks in, while slashing the estate tax rate. Together, those changes would cut taxes for the wealthiest families by $652 billion between 2012 and 2021, the first full decade of the proposed cut. Because the government would need to borrow to make up for that lost revenue, the tax cut would also cost all taxpayers some $175 billion in higher interest payments.
And for what? Fully 71 percent of the additional benefits would go to people who stand to inherit more than $10 million. Almost all of the rest would apply to estates worth more than $5 million. 
 There is no economic justification for doing this, any more than any tax cut can be justified when the economy is growing and the government is running a big deficit, as is now the case. The notion that small businesses and family farms are unfairly targeted by the estate tax is nonsense.
 There is no moral justification for cutting estate taxes. Much of the wealth taxed after death has never been taxed because profits on stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork -- you name it -- are not taxed until an asset is sold. Obviously, people with big estates never got around to selling their assets. 
 And yet, some multimillionaires, and their Congressional supporters, have the gall to say that the wealthy should not be ''penalized.'' Estate taxes imposed after one's death are no more of a penalty than income taxes withheld from paychecks.
 Any senator who votes for this bill -- or to end an expected filibuster -- does not care about the budget deficit or tax fairness, no matter what he or she may say to the contrary.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Offering Deals on Trade To Entice Iran 

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
The European Union's foreign policy director, Javier Solana, arrived in Tehran on Monday night with incentives intended to resolve the nuclear crisis with Iran, including a proposal to allow Iran to upgrade its aging civilian air fleet through the purchase of aircraft parts from an American company, Boeing. 
 The package, to be presented Tuesday to Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, is to include waiving trade sanctions against Iran to allow the purchase of American agricultural technology, said European diplomats and a senior Bush administration official. 
The five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany, agreed on the package last week in Vienna, but declined to make the proposal public. 
 Officials first wanted to present the package to Iranian authorities. But with Mr. Solana's arrival in Tehran, several European and American diplomats described parts of the proposal, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to comment publicly. 
 The offer includes a commitment from the six nations to support Iran's plan for a nuclear energy program for civilian use, including building light-water reactors through joint projects with other countries, the diplomats said. 
 The United States and Europe also agreed to back Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization. 
 The package is aimed at encouraging Iran to return to a freeze of its nuclear activities, including turning off the fast-spinning centrifuges that enrich uranium. 
 The most compelling item, though, may be the American offer to end its nearly three-decade policy against direct talks with Iran and to join in the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. 
 That proposal is the centerpiece of the administration's recent shift in strategy toward Iran, which President Bush views as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. 
 The decision to include the sale of Boeing aircraft parts, along with aircraft and parts from Airbus, is a huge step, particularly for the United States. 
 Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has been subject to American sanctions that hinder the purchase of spare parts for nearly all the planes in its air force, the civilian carrier Iran Air and domestic airlines. The sanctions cover not only American-made airplanes and parts, but also European planes like Airbus, when they use parts made in the United States.
 Because Iran can shop only for used Airbus or Boeing planes, its civilian fleet is notorious for the age of planes and parts. Iranian officials regularly blame the sanctions for plane crashes.
 The offers that Mr. Solana is to make are contingent on an agreement by Iran to suspend its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, which the United States contends are a cover for developing nuclear arms. 
 If Iran does not agree to suspend those activities, the package includes possible ''disincentives,'' as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has described them in the past.
 They include a travel ban against Iran's ruling religious leaders and government officials involved in the nuclear program, and a freeze of Iranian financial assets abroad.
 The package does not include any specific threat of military action should Iran refuse to suspend its uranium activities. If Iran rejects the offer, differences are likely to re-emerge among the six nations as they consider more specific punishments. 
 It was unclear whether the package includes a guarantee that the United States will not attack Iran if it agrees to suspend uranium enrichment. 
 An earlier version of the proposal contained three sentences to that effect, but they were a matter of intense debate in Vienna, and the diplomats would not say whether the wording remained in the final package. The United States has resisted giving those guarantees, while France and Russia have pushed for them. 
 A resolution is currently before the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which invokes the Council's power to demand compliance of member countries and threaten punishment if they refuse. 
 But the emphasis of the package brought to Tehran by Mr. Solana is less on how to punish Iran than on how to reward it for agreeing to freeze its enrichment-related activities.
 Before traveling to Tehran, Mr. Solana stopped in Israel, where he discussed the package with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Western diplomats say Israel backs the package.
 ''The proposal we bring along, the one that we carry, we think that will allow us to get engaged in that negotiation, based on trust and respect and confidence,'' Mr. Solana said at the airport in Tehran. 
 Shortly after his arrival, Mr. Mottaki, the foreign minister, told reporters, ''If their aim is not politicizing the issue, and if they consider our demand, we can reach a logical agreement with them.'' 
 Iran has said it considers its nuclear program, which it insists is for peaceful purposes, a national right.

HEADLINE: A Kaleidoscopic View of Eastern Europe Via Video

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
As you walk through ''New Video, New Europe,'' an engrossing exhibition at the Kitchen, you may begin to feel that you are seeing bits and pieces of another world, one that few Americans know well, if at all. It is the world of Eastern Europe, recovering from the tumultuous aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, when economies unraveled, ancient hatreds resurfaced, and some nations broke apart. 
 There is a thin, saintly-looking grandmother who supports her family by working on a mine-clearing crew, and women who eke out a living selling flowers at market. An Albanian 3-year-old invents fairy tales that involve ''international forces'' and happy endings in Italy. During extreme close-ups of a man calmly carrying out his morning toilette (shaving, clipping, brushing), we hear radio announcers begging citizens first to remain calm and then to throng the streets to protect the radio station, which is under attack. 
Eastern Europe is a place where many still struggle with the mindset instilled by totalitarianism, the physical and psychological effects of war, the hardship of making ends meet. Material goods are not necessarily plentiful. Modernization is often something in the future, not the past, and its new name is globalization. Yet more and more artists have video cameras at their disposal. 
 The 48 videos in this exhibition, organized by Hamza Walker, curator at the Renaissance Society in Chicago, represent the efforts of 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries. Mostly recent and under five minutes long, they cover a stylistic range that includes documentary, Surrealist narrative, performance art and rather too much formalism and generic experimentation. Not all are intrinsically interesting, but taken together, they add up to something considerably greater than their sum: an inadvertent collaborative portrait or Exquisite Corpse documentary that mixes history, art, everyday life, folklore and the landscape. A result is a kaleidoscopic view that goes quite a bit beyond the evening news. 
 Some of the works are so rudimentary and D.I.Y. that they might hark from the 1970's, when American artists treated the video camera as a new toy, pointing it at whatever crossed their paths. In the case of the Polish artist Piotr Wryzykowski, that means a burning motorcycle; for Jelena Radic, it's her cousin, a young Serbian girl in a glittery gymnast leotard, dancing her heart out in a cramped living room. In ''Domestic Violence,'' Kai Kaljo, an Estonian with a quietly comic knack (a short video titled ''The Loser'' is also hers), ties her ex-husband to a bed and questions him about his infidelities. 
 Inevitably, a few of the works that Mr. Walker has selected evince the up-to-date professionalism and economy you might witness at an international biennale. In his 68-second ''Birds,'' the Czech artist Jesper Alvaer records what ensues if you place a video camera amid a pile of bird seed in the Piazza San Marco in Venice: something like Uccello's ''Battle of San Romano'' enacted by pigeons. The Polish artist Azorro achieves similarly universal physical comedy when he and several friends try to lip sync to an old English recording of ''Hamlet.'' 
 The videos that give this show its staying power involve highly specific mixtures of documentary and art, like Alma Becirovic's understated ''Survived 'n' Lived Another Day,'' the compressed, jewel-like day-in-the-life of the mine-hunting Bosnian grandmother, or Dan Mihaltianu's ''Revolution dans le Boudoir,'' which recalls the turbulent days leading up to the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu by infusing one man's bathroom rituals with the anguish of years of repression and the shock of freedom. 
 In ''Brezhnev Likes Mamaliga, and Mamaliga Likes Brezhnev,'' Stefan Rusu, a Moldovan, intersperses clips of Leonid Brezhnev (also a Moldovan) with the preparation on an outdoor fire of a peasant chicken-and-maize soup that the Soviet leader said he loved, beginning with the summary execution of a live chicken. 
 Adrian Paci, father of the storytelling 3-year-old, excavates another peasant tradition in ''The Weeper,'' hiring a professional mourner to keen a haunting song that celebrates his life while he stretches before her, imitating a corpse. In Pavle Vuckovic's ''Run Rabbit Run,'' someone in a rabbit costume is chased across a beautifully snowy Serbian landscape by someone in a fox costume, a sequence that is by turns amusing, sinister and in the end, real. 
 Several longer pieces are especially impressive. Pavel Braila's ''Shoes for Europe,'' made for Documenta XI in 2002, is an ode to inefficiency; it documents the time-consuming process performed each time a train crosses the Moldovan-Romanian border, all because Moldovia still uses outmoded Russian wheel gages. Mircea Cantor's ''Double-Headed Matches'' contrasts machine production of single-headed matches with the artisanal methods for making double-headed ones. 
 Old and new attitudes about art collide in ''The Girl Is Innocent,'' in which Arturas Raila records his colleagues as they give year-end critiques at an art school in Vilnius, Lithuania, and rail against the corrupting influence of ''Americanism'' and kitsch. The heated discussion among faculty members, who are almost entirely older and male, is sexist, rigid and blinkered, but one teacher touches on the truth.
 Gesturing sarcastically toward the camera, he clearly refers to the artist when he says, ''He thinks it's a stroke of genius, filming this and then exhibiting it somewhere.'' 

''New Video, New Europe'' continues through June 30 at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793.

HEADLINE: Fueling the Food Wars

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Food Police'': Would Harriet Brown like ketchup or mustard with her lunch tray? Commenting on the decision to limit elementary school students to one slice of pizza, she writes, ''If equity is the issue, I'll eat my lunch tray.'' 
 At our school, the decision, made at a parent-teacher meeting, was 100 percent an equity issue. It came months before the school district made its announcement.
Why did we do this? Are we the dreaded food police? Not at all. We did this because over 60 percent of our students receive reduced-price lunches; they need help buying that first slice of pizza. 
 A big reason we send our daughter to a public school is to give her an opportunity to learn with children of all economic and ethnic backgrounds. She is also learning about the need to be compassionate and think about how one's actions affect friends and classmates.

HEADLINE: Growth Slows in Services 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The service sector of the United States economy expanded in May, but at a slower pace than in April, a private survey of supply managers said yesterday. 
 The report offered a possible indication that fuel prices were starting to crimp growth in service industries. The survey by the Institute for Supply Management indicated concern about the prices of raw materials and fuel.
The group's index of nonmanufacturing activity was 60.1 in May, down from 63 in April, matching analysts' expectations. A reading of 50 and above indicates growth, while a figure below 50 signals contraction.
 Managers in industries including transportation, banking and retailing reported that energy costs were having an effect. 
 Increases in general business activity, new orders and backlogs slowed in May compared with April, while increases in prices paid, hiring and foreign trade accelerated.
 Last week, the group reported that the expansion of activity in manufacturing industries also slowed. Its manufacturing index dipped to 54.4 in May from 57.3 in April.

HEADLINE: Questions on Biotech Crops With No Clear Answers 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: AUBINS, Spain 

 BODY:
Enric Navarro was dumbfounded when the letter arrived from the testing lab of the Spanish organic farmers association in late February, telling him his organic crop actually contained 12 percent genetically modified corn. 
 For Mr. Navarro, finding plants modified by biotechnology was almost as traumatic as finding nuclear waste would have been. For four years, he had lovingly planted hundreds of varieties of trees, shrubs, flowers and herbs to attract just the right mix of insects so he would not need fertilizers or weed killers on his precious seven hectares (17.3 acres).
''If I could not farm organic, I would not farm,'' said Mr. Navarro, dressed in sweatpants and a stained T-shirt as he sipped coffee in his shed. ''I could not sleep at night if I sold that crop.'' 
 He decided to burn the corn still in the field, to rid his farm of what he called a ''contaminant.'' But he is still not certain how the unwanted seed got onto his property. There is no way to claim compensation for his economic losses. And he is not sure when it will be safe to use the field for his form of organic farming.
 As the European Union begins opening its doors wider to genetically modified crops, Mr. Navarro's byzantine experience serves as a cautionary tale about the uncertainties surrounding the lack of policies to deal with the problems that will almost certainly arise. 
 ''There is a lot that hasn't been worked out,'' said Julian Kinderlerer, of the Institute of Biotechnical Law and Ethics at the University of Sheffield in England, who has advised the European Union on the issue.
 For eight years, Spain was the only country in the union to permit commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops. But in the last 18 months, the European Commission has approved 11 genetically modified seeds for planting in the union, and in 2005, France, Germany, Portugal and the Czech Republic began planting small commercial plots.
 In the United States, the vast majority of large commercial farms plant genetically modified crops, like corn or soy, and there is no general effort to distinguish those from nonbiotech crops and foods in farming or food processing.
 But the cornerstone of the European Union's new open-door policy is the political conviction that it is possible for genetically altered crops and conventional crops to coexist separately within Europe with proper safeguards, like keeping a distance between fields and imposing a liability system for accidents. 
 Scientifically, there are strong disagreements about whether ''coexistence'' is possible, at what cost and even how it should be defined. 
 ''Coexistence is feasible in the vast majority of places, so long as farmers talk to each other and cooperate,'' said Simon Barber of EuropaBio, an industry group in Brussels. He said that experiences like Mr. Navarro's should be rare. 
 But many scientists, and not just those with green credentials, think coexistence is not feasible in many European countries, where small, closely spaced farms are the norm. 
 ''My experts all agreed that coexistence often just doesn't work,'' said Chantal Line Carpentier, an agricultural economist who led a panel of experts that studied the issue under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 The study was requested by Mexico in 2002, after genetically modified corn was found in fields in Oaxaca, hundreds of miles from the United States. Mexico feared that the heartier modified variants would edge out its unique native strains.
 That report, ''Maize and Biodiversity,'' released in 2004 by the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation, concluded that the genetically engineered corn might well have a long-term effect on Mexico's ecology and biodiversity and that it should be better studied and monitored. 
 The United States and Canada attacked its conclusions. But some farmers said the report did not go far enough. ''Saying that G.M. and non-G.M. farming can coexist is nonsensical,'' said Julian Rose, an organic farmer from England. ''It's like saying that noise and silence can coexist in a room.''
 The scientific disagreement over coexistence is also partly a question of definition: the biotech industry and new regulations proposed by the European Union would permit some degree of inadvertent intermixing. 
 The biotech industry considers ''coexistence'' achieved if mixing is below 0.9 percent and, under proposed regulations, foods in the European Union could be labeled free of genetic modification if they contained less than this amount. 
 Such labeling is not required in the United States, where the two types of product are regarded as essentially equivalent.
 ''I think that it's great we are able to commingle all types of corn,'' said Michael J. Phillips, a vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. ''That allows us to sell it at low cost and feed the world.''
 The concept of coexistence is problematic because there are simply too many ways that mixing occurs, experts said. Wind blows seeds, mills grind crops from different farms, a cookie contains oil made from imported genetically modified soy. The genetically engineered corn in Oaxaca was probably the progeny of corn ears that had been legally imported for animal feed but whose kernels had been illegally used for planting. 
 With so many routes, environmental groups say, the 0.9 percent limit will inevitably be breached. 
 Mr. Phillips acknowledged that keeping modified and nonmodified crops apart in fields or in the market was expensive and he ruled out industry compensation. ''If you're a small farmer trying to differentiate your product,'' he said, ''the onus is on you to pay for the needed separation.''
 Last year, Greenpeace tested 40 organic farms in Catalonia. Nearly 20 percent had contamination, from 0.7 percent to 12 percent. 
 Spain decided to admit cultivation of genetically modified crops in 1998. Twelve percent of corn is now biotech -- about half of it in Catalonia. 
 Mr. Navarro's two fields are 70 and 100 meters from neighbors' farms, a distance often deemed adequate to prevent mixing. But it was windy last winter, and perhaps some seed blew in, he speculated. 
 There is no log of who plants genetically modified seeds and nowhere to turn for compensation for his economic losses. Neither the Agriculture Ministry nor the organic farmers association could provide guidance on how to clean up a contaminated field.
 Mr. Navarro recently prepared a field in the center of his property for planting corn, hoping that distance and the rows of shrubs will protect it. If not, he says, he will quit.

HEADLINE: Paper Maker to Sell Unit

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The International Paper Company said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its coated paper unit to a private equity firm, Apollo Management, for $1.4 billion. 
 The division employs 3,000 workers at four paper mills in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota and generated $1.6 billion in sales last year, International Paper said.
The transaction is the third major sale by International Paper since July, raising $9.1 billion. 
 International Paper has sold forestlands in New Zealand and the United States and plans to sell chemicals and wood-products units, bringing the total proceeds to $11 billion. 
 Since the end of the second quarter of 2005, International Paper has trimmed total debt by $2 billion, to $11.5 billion, through asset sales and the repatriation of overseas earnings, said Dennis Ruggles, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Older Paternal Age Seen as Factor in Some Birth Defects

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
As men get older, their sperm deteriorates, a new study has found, and it is likely that the damaged sperm of older men is a significant factor in certain specific birth defects and in increasing the risk of abnormal pregnancies. 
 Birth rates since 1980 have increased by 40 percent in men 35 to 40 and decreased by 20 percent in men under 30, according to background information about the findings, published yesterday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The rising age of fathers has been associated with reproductive problems including spontaneous abortion and with genetic diseases like achondroplasia, a type of dwarfism, and Apert syndrome, which involves severe bone malformations. Evidence from other studies also suggests that aging sperm plays a role in disorders like schizophrenia, in which genetic contributions to the illness are more complex and not as well understood. But little is known about which sperm abnormalities rise with age. 
 Using techniques that can detect DNA and chromosomal defects directly in sperm cells, the researchers examined the sperm of 97 healthy nonsmokers, ages 22 to 80. Compared with men in their 20's, those who were 40 to 49 had almost twice as much sperm DNA fragmentation, which is associated with failures of fertility, conception and sustained pregnancy. 
 ''Our research suggests that men, too, have a biological time clock,'' said Brenda Eskenazi, one of two lead authors of the study and a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. ''But men seem to have a gradual rather than an abrupt change in the potential to produce healthy offspring.'' 
 For the gene that causes dwarfism, researchers found a 2 percent increase in the frequency of the mutation for each year of increasing age. Those in their 40's were almost twice as likely as those in their 20's to produce sperm carrying the mutation. From age 60 to 80, the rate was more than three times as great as that of men in their 20's.
 Other kinds of genetic defects did not increase with age. Aneuploidy, the abnormal number of chromosomes that causes Down syndrome and various other genetic disorders, was no more common in the sperm of older men. Age made no difference in sex chromosome abnormalities, which can cause sterility and other physical or mental problems.
 In contrast with findings in a previous study that used similar techniques, the researchers found no evidence that the mutation that causes Apert syndrome was any more common in older men's sperm than in that of younger men. Andrew J. Wyrobek, the study's other lead author, said that these varying findings from different groups of men raised the possibility that something more than age was involved.
 Economic status, ethnic background and diet may cause differing responses to aging, and those differences may then be reflected in sperm characteristics.
 Factors like quantity of semen, sperm concentrations and total sperm count were not associated with any genomic defects, but sperm motility was associated with increased DNA fragmentation. 
 No association was found between age and sperm sex ratio, so older men are no more or less likely to have girl or boy babies than their younger counterparts.
 Dr. Wyrobek, a senior staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said that an immense amount of work remained to be done. 
 ''There are more than 30,000 genes and we've only measured the effects on age of two of them in sperm,'' he said. ''Many gene mutations in sperm can cause genetic diseases in children, and these still need to be measured in older men, but we don't have the tools yet.''

HEADLINE: Old Halls of Justice Yield To Halls Full of Children

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
For more than 30 years, the old Bronx Borough Courthouse in the South Bronx, with its statue of Justice overlooking Third Avenue, has sat empty, another abandoned building in a neighborhood filled with them.
 But in yet another sign of the South Bronx's robust economic rebound, officials said yesterday that the 91-year-old Beaux-Arts courthouse would finally be getting a tenant.
Imagine Schools, a nonprofit charter school organization based in Arlington, Va., has reached a tentative agreement on a 25-year lease with the courthouse's owner, and plans to open an 800-student charter school inside the landmark building in the Melrose section by September 2007. 
 The owner, Henry Weinstein, who bought the 82,000-square-foot building for $300,000 at a city auction in 1999, said he had been trying for years to find a group interested in renting it, no easy task in a neighborhood short on housing, stores and basic services like banks and dry cleaners.
 ''We're very happy, because we think we've found a worthy user,'' said Mr. Weinstein. ''This is a sign of the overall South Bronx revitalization. One by one, each vacant site is being spoken for.''
 Mr. Weinstein said he expected to spend $20 million to $30 million renovating the building, replacing elevators and bathrooms, installing a ''green'' roof that will serve as a playground, refurbishing the courthouse's twin marble staircases and dismantling 70 jail cells. The school, which will run from kindergarten to eighth grade, will have 36 classrooms, a cafeteria, a gymnasium and an auditorium.
 ''It's a grand old building with a lot of interior space,'' said Philip Parr, a regional school developer for Imagine Schools. ''It's a very, very classic and dignified space.''
 The charter school, whose application still needs to be approved by the Department of Education and the State Board of Regents, will emphasize career development and conflict resolution. 
 The Rev. Timothy Birkett, the pastor of a congregation called Church Alive, in the South Bronx, who has been an adviser to Mr. Weinstein, said that in addition to academics, the school would seek to instill leadership qualities in children, an emphasis that he said was lacking in the area's public schools.
 ''That's what the basic education system is not doing,'' said Mr. Birkett, who will serve on the school's advisory board.
 The charter school will most likely be called ''the Gray Lady,'' the courthouse's nickname in its neighborhood, Melrose.
 The neighborhood, one of the hardest hit by arson and abandonment in the South Bronx during the 1970's and 80's, has slowly recovered in recent years, and there are plans for more new housing and shopping centers in the area, which is about a mile east of Yankee Stadium.
 The borough courthouse, completed in 1915, had once been the center of civic life in the Bronx. It had been part of a complex of government buildings in the area that have long since been torn down, with the exception of another old courthouse across the street that is slated for demolition.
 The borough courthouse has been vacant since the 1970's -- though the exact year is unclear. Mr. Weinstein and the building's neighbors say it has been empty since 1972, though the city puts the year at 1978. 
 The building's chandeliers, its bronze window frames and almost everything else of value were carried off by scavengers years ago. But the courthouse, declared a city landmark in 1981, still has its Tennessee marble statue of Justice -- without her traditional blindfold -- perched on a central bay on the exterior of the building's second floor.
 The building's unusual design made it hard to find a tenant, Mr. Weinstein said.
 ''It's an architectural antique, inside and out,'' he said. ''It was meant for public use, so it has grand rotundas. It doesn't necessarily lend itself to an economical use.''
 The courthouse has a checkered history -- even before it was completed, people complained that it was too grand for the Bronx. The building's designer, Oscar Bluemner, filed a lawsuit after a Tammany official claimed the credit -- and the commission -- for the design.
 By the time it was finished -- a decade late and at a cost of $2 million, more than twice the projected amount -- the courthouse's white granite exterior had started to yellow.
 When it opened for business, judges and prosecutors realized they could not be heard above the screech of elevated trains along the tracks that passed within a few feet of the building. 
 By the time the elevated line was torn down in the early 1970's, the courthouse had become obsolete -- the current courthouse, near Yankee Stadium, opened in the 1930's.
 Mr. Weinstein bought the building after another buyer defaulted. And though Imagine Schools tried to buy the building from Mr. Weinstein, rather than leasing it, he declined, partly for sentimental reasons. 
 ''It's a very special building,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld, Visiting Vietnam, Seals Accord to Deepen Military Cooperation

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, June 5 

 BODY:
The United States and Vietnam agreed Monday to increase their military contacts and to discuss additional ways to broaden their defense cooperation, American officials said.
 The understanding was sealed in talks between senior Vietnamese officials and Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was making his first visit to Vietnam as defense secretary.
The two nations, he declared Monday evening with evident satisfaction, had decided to step up ''exchanges at all levels of the military.'' 
 Vietnam was an important stop on an Asian swing that has already taken Mr. Rumsfeld to a meeting of defense experts in Singapore. During the Singapore sessions, Mr. Rumsfeld denounced Iran as a ''terrorist'' nation, complained that Russia was bullying its neighbors and criticized China for being secretive about its level of military spending.
 In contrast, here in Vietnam's capital he heaped praise on his hosts. He lauded Vietnam's economic development, which he inspected Sunday night with a walk through the city's streets.
 ''I was and remain struck by the economic success that you can see and the activity and the change in this city,'' said Mr. Rumsfeld, who noted that he had previously visited the country as a congressman and as a private citizen.
 During a visit to the Temple of Literature, which was established in 1070 as Vietnam's first university, Mr. Rumsfeld enthusiastically struck a ritual gong. When the university was founded, Mr. Rumsfeld told Vietnam's defense minister, Pham Van Tra, American Indians were still living in ''mud huts.''
 ''That's impressive,'' Mr. Rumsfeld added.
 The Vietnamese greeted their guest with a resplendent military honor guard, which played ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' before the talks began at the Defense Ministry.
 The Vietnam War still casts a long shadow. There are 1,805 American troops unaccounted for from the war, including 1,376 in Vietnam, according to United States military officials. A small team is based in Vietnam to carry out the accounting and excavating in the search for the lost Americans, efforts that have been complicated by Vietnam's building boom and the dwindling ranks of witnesses from the war era. Vietnam has generally been cooperative, and Mr. Rumsfeld encouraged the government to provide additional support.
 But it is China, a subject that Mr. Rumsfeld said went unmentioned Monday during his talks with Mr. Tra and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, that has added impetus for the new courtship.
 The Pentagon has been increasingly concerned over China's growing military strength. Vietnam has its own reasons for trying to establish more balance with its neighbor to the north.
 Still, the Vietnamese have moved deliberately. ''They have China next door to them and they're careful to keep good relations with China and they want a balance in relations with us and relations with China,'' said a senior Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to comment publicly on the talks.
 One step in the still evolving relationship is to be taken later this month when two Vietnamese officers are scheduled to begin English language classes at a military language school in San Antonio. The instruction, which was previously agreed upon, is being financed by the Pentagon's program for International Military Education and Training.
 A likely next step is the expansion of that effort to include medical training for Vietnamese officers, a Pentagon official suggested. 
 American officials also said Monday that there had been discussion of expanded cooperation in clearing mines left over from the war. One American official said Vietnamese officials expressed interest in acquiring American mine-clearing equipment and military spare parts. A request for military equipment is likely to stir debate in Congress, where Vietnam's record on human rights has undergone close scrutiny.
 During his discussions with Mr. Tra, Mr. Rumsfeld suggested that Vietnam might play a role in international peacekeeping. But Mr. Tra noted that the Vietnamese military could not take part in any operation that was not specifically approved by the United Nations, according to an American official who said he did not want to be identified because he was explaining what had occurred in private talks.
 Access to Vietnamese ports and bases for American military forces was not on the agenda, Mr. Rumsfeld indicated before his visit.
 Mr. Rumsfeld was not the first American defense secretary to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War -- William S. Cohen, President Bill Clinton's defense secretary, made the trip, as did Mr. Clinton.
 Mr. Khai visited the United States last June, the first such visit since the end of the Vietnam War. Vietnam, which signed an important trade agreement with the United States in 2000, has been pushing for membership in the World Trade Organization. President Bush is expected to visit Vietnam when it will be the host of an Asian economic summit meeting in November.
 Still, the visit of the hard-line Mr. Rumsfeld was noteworthy, as was his enthusiasm. He noted that during the prime minister's meeting last year with President Bush, the two leaders talked about their desire to raise the relationship between the countries to a new level.
 ''And certainly that has happened,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.

HEADLINE: Debate Over Wind Power Creates Environmental Rift

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Md. 

 BODY:
Dan Boone has no doubt that his crusade against wind energy is the right way to protect the Allegheny highlands he loves. Let other environmentalists call him deluded at best, traitorous at worst. He remains undeterred.
 For four years or more, Mr. Boone has traveled across the mid-Atlantic to make every argument he can muster against local wind-power projects: they kill birds and bats; they are too noisy; they are inefficient, making no more than a symbolic contribution to energy needs.
Wind farms on the empty prairies of North Dakota? Fine. But not, Mr. Boone insists, in the mountainous terrain of southwestern Pennsylvania, western Maryland or West Virginia, areas where 15 new projects have been proposed. If all were built, 750 to 1,000 giant turbines would line the hilltops, most producing, on average, enough electricity to power 600 homes.
 Wind projects are in the midst of a huge growth spurt in many parts of the country, driven by government incentives to promote alternatives to fossil fuels. But Mr. Boone, who wields a botanist's trowel and a debater's knife with equal ease, wants to slow them down with community activism, regulatory action and legal challenges. 
 His crusade harks back to the campaigns against nuclear power plants, toxic-waste dumps and dams on scenic rivers that were building blocks of the modern environmental movement. But the times, and the climate, are changing. With fears of global warming growing more acute, Mr. Boone and many other local activists are finding themselves increasingly out of step with the priorities of the broader movement. 
 National groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club used to uniting against specific projects are now united for renewable energy in general. And they are particularly high on wind power -- with the caveat that a few, but only a few, special places should be turbine-free.
 ''The broader environmental movement knows we have this urgent need for renewable energy to avert global warming,'' said John Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace U.S.A. ''But we're still dealing with groups that can't get their heads around global warming yet.''
 Indeed, the best winds, especially in the East, tend to blow in places that are also ideal for hiking, sailing, second homes and spirit-soothing views. These include the Green Mountains, the Adirondacks, the Chesapeake Bay, Cape Cod and the ridges of northern Appalachia. Local opposition to unwanted development remains a potent force.
 So when it comes to wind, the environmental movement is riven with dissonance and accusations of elitism. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s very public opposition to the 130-turbine Cape Wind energy facility proposed off Nantucket Sound has driven a wedge between activists. Dan Boone's circuit riding against wind projects, while not attracting the same celebrity notice, has exasperated many Sierra Club compatriots even more. 
 Like Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Boone says the areas he wants to protect are uniquely vulnerable. His family owns property near the proposed projects, just as Mr. Kennedy's does near the Cape Wind site.
 But Mr. Boone says that wind supporters are the ones pursuing their own agenda at the expense of the public interest. 
 ''I'm not sure that wind turbines in this region will significantly reduce the outcome of global climate change or actually have any role,'' Mr. Boone said. ''The very limited benefit doesn't justify the risk of wiping out a lot of interior forest habitat.''
 National environmental leaders reject this argument.
 ''There's no free lunch,'' said Paul Hansen, executive director of the Izaak Walton League of America, a venerable sportsmen's group. '' 'Not in my backyard' is not environmentalism.''
 The Alleghenies are a big backyard, with views that are both spectacular and problematic. Flowering shrubs like shadbush and preening flowers like trillium are framed by oaks, maples and longleaf pines. But intermittent industrial tree farming has repeatedly denuded some mountainsides. On both sides of the border near here in far western Maryland, second-home development is booming. The air has often been fouled by the Mount Storm coal-fired power plant.
 If Ned Power, a wind-energy development company, puts up 100 or so turbines along 14 miles of ridgeline near Mount Storm, wind-energy supporters say, how much does that further spoil the landscape?
 Kevin Rackstraw, a regional manager of Clipper Windpower whose proposed 40-turbine project in western Maryland has drawn Mr. Boone's fire, said opponents lacked perspective. 
 ''Dan looks at all the impacts of a given wind project,'' Mr. Rackstraw said, ''but doesn't say: 'If we didn't have wind, what would we have?' Coal. Think of the impact of acid rain and mountaintop removal.''
 The Ned Power project is just one target of Mr. Boone, 49, a former state wildlife biologist who now works as a consultant. In interviews, he said he first focused on the issue when working as a botanist on a study related to an early wind power project. The environmental-impact statements, he said, were grossly inadequate.
 Now he drives from Highland County in western Virginia (where 38 turbines are proposed on Tamarack Ridge) to Bedford, Pa. (where early discussions of an unnamed project are under way) to talk to local groups or crystallize their objections for them. In Annapolis, Md., and Charleston, W.Va., he uses state utility regulators' licensing hearings to throw up roadblocks before wind projects. He is eager to argue with industry officials in any venue, questioning their facts, assumptions and motives.
 ''The rush is on now because a lot of the places they've targeted have no zoning, and it's easy to get in that kind of large-scale development,'' he said. ''This part of the country has really good energy prices. Developers are keying in on that.'' 
 Mr. Boone's quiver of anti-wind arguments includes economic analyses, but his first line of attack is biological: he contends that they are a threat to bats and potentially to migratory birds and that they break up forest habitat. 
 Scores of raptors and other birds were killed by the first generation of wind turbines set up at Altamont Pass in Northern California. Since the Altamont Pass turbines were erected in the early 1980's, turbine design has been altered, and most subsequent studies have shown that birds tend to fly above the height of most turbines though some experts say more studies are needed.
 But the turbines south of here in Thomas, W.Va., have been lethal to bats. More than 2,000 were killed in 2003 at the Mountaineer project, whose 44 turbines are owned by FPL Energy, a big power company that is the wind industry's dominant player. 
 Industry officials agree that the bat mortality measured at the Mountaineer site is unacceptable, and they are studying the benefits of deterrent devices and the best ways to modify turbine operations in bat-rich areas.
 To Mr. Boone, wind energy will never make a big enough difference to justify its impact in the region. ''You have to remember that these tax advantages are so huge,'' he said, ''that these developers are keen to latch onto all the mythology -- whether it's global warming or something else.'' 
 Asked if he thought global warming was a myth, he said: ''No, I'm not calling it mythology.'' But industry officials, he contended, will ''take things out of context.''
 Mike Tidwell, the director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network and one of Mr. Boone's adversaries, bristles at the attack. ''Wind industry guys are the straightest-shooting people,'' Mr. Tidwell said. ''Most got into it because they had an environmental ethic.''
 But Mr. Boone has plenty of allies, too. ''He's the greatest naturalist I've even known,'' said Betsy Johnson, chairwoman of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. ''Dan has been very helpful in educating us with what problems there can be with an energy source like wind.''
 The industry Mr. Boone regards so suspiciously is on a roll. The total share of energy that wind farms generated nationwide in 2004 was tiny -- about one-third of 1 percent, according to the Energy Department. But by 2020, according to industry estimates, wind's share of the county's energy portfolio could grow ten- or twentyfold.
 For the environmental movement, wind supporters say, the transition from the protection of place to the protection of planet is bound to be wrenching.
 ''Wilderness conversations are spiritual,'' said David Hamilton, the Sierra Club's national director of global warming and energy programs. ''We've always been a place-based organization, protecting places,'' but ''protecting our climate'' is ''just looking at it from a different angle and a different elevation.''

HEADLINE: Ford Foundation To Announce Africa Initiative

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The Ford Foundation will announce today the creation of a new philanthropic venture, led by Africans and based in Dakar, Senegal. The project, Trust Africa, aims to strengthen an expanding network of nonprofit groups across the continent that seek to hold governments accountable, whether elected or dictatorships.
 Ford has committed $30 million to this new foundation. Half the money will finance a permanent endowment, and the other half will be used to provide grants to many groups over the next five years. 
Trust Africa's executive director, Akwasi Aidoo, a Ghanaian who formerly headed Ford's offices in Senegal and Nigeria, said it would strive to build links among civil society groups that could tackle regional problems of violent conflict, economic development and social justice. 
 The new foundation will bolster such groups, often vocal critics of those in power, in a period when Africa has been becoming more democratic. At the same time, some elected leaders -- Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, for example -- have become intolerant of dissent. 
 ''Left to themselves, many of these countries fall back into old habits,'' Mr. Aidoo said in an interview. He added later, ''The best antidote is to amplify the voices of those for peaceful change.''
 Thomas O. Melia, deputy director of Freedom House, a research group that monitors political liberty, said efforts like those of Trust Africa represent the next frontier in deepening democracy in Africa and elsewhere. 
 ''What has been missing, even in places establishing electoral democracy, is independent voices -- think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, university centers -- able to monitor government performance,'' he said. ''It is the next step.''
 Mr. Aidoo said credible local groups capable of attracting international attention are needed to check repression, corruption and other ills. 
 Groups in one country also should be connected to like-minded outfits in other countries.
 If dissenters are intimidated in one place, those in neighboring nations can speak up.
 In addition to providing grants, Trust Africa plans to hold a series of workshops in Africa in the coming year to bring together scholars, business people, artists, government officials and rights advocates.
 Over the past five years, as this new, Africa-focused foundation was developed, it financed a variety of groups to test its approach. It provided small grants to dozens of groups to strengthen them institutionally. It also gave $200,000 to Urgent Action Fund, Africa, which supported women agitating for peace talks in Liberia, as well as an investigation into accusations that women were being detained at a prison in Cameroon without justification.
 Trust Africa hopes to build a base of support that goes well beyond the Ford Foundation. It plans to raise donations from the African diaspora. Millions of African migrants live and work in Europe, the United States and Canada, sending home billions of dollars annually in remittances, Ford says.
 The United States has sizable communities of African-born immigrants in New York, Washington, Boston, Houston, Chicago and Los Angeles.
 ''Typically, they're helping their families and hometowns, but they're interested in what's happening in the rest of the continent,'' Mr. Aidoo said. ''They want an effective vehicle that's African.'' Asked how the new foundation would avoid being seen as an arm of the Ford Foundation, with its deep American roots, Mr. Aidoo and Ford's president, Susan V. Berresford, said in the interview that Trust Africa would be an independent foundation governed solely by Africans.
 Mr. Aidoo said the new foundation would establish ''the connections among actors who can carry the work forward on their own feet.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Hires Help To Write A Memoir

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
After weeks of speculation, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, has chosen a collaborator for his memoir, to be published by Penguin Press in fall 2007. Peter Petre, a senior editor at large at Fortune magazine and co-author of best sellers by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and by Thomas J. Watson Jr., former chairman of I.B.M., will help Mr. Greenspan write his book. 
 Mr. Greenspan, who sold the book for an $8.5 million advance in March, has been interviewing ghostwriting candidates since then.
Robert B. Barnett, the lawyer who represented Mr. Greenspan in the negotiations, declined to comment on how much Mr. Petre would be paid. ''We reached an agreement that was acceptable and equitable to both sides,'' he said. Mr. Barnett said that the issue of credit for Mr. Petre had not been resolved. (Mr. Petre received a reported $500,000 for his work on General Schwarzkopf's book.)
 Mr. Petre, who joined Fortune as a writer in 1979, now oversees coverage of information technology, biotechnology, medicine and science. He is on leave and did not return calls for comment. 
 Ann Godoff, the president and publisher of Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Group USA, said that Mr. Greenspan would be writing the first and last drafts. ''Peter will be the expert helper on those and what comes in between them,'' she said.
 Settling on a candidate to help translate Mr. Greenspan, known for his cryptic testimony, into plain English has not been easy. This spring, David Wessel, the deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal who helped Mr. Greenspan with his 10-page book proposal and was a candidate to collaborate on the book, withdrew from discussions because they could not agree on terms.
 Mr. Petre's past work includes ''It Doesn't Take a Hero'' with General Schwarzkopf, which spent 25 weeks on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list in 1992 and 1993. He also worked with Mr. Watson on ''Father, Son & Co: My Life at I.B.M. and Beyond,'' which spent 14 weeks on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction list in 1990.
 When Mr. Greenspan signed his deal, publishing industry veterans wondered whether he could justify the large advance.
 Mr. Barnett, Mr. Greenspan's lawyer, said that Penguin has ''recaptured a substantial portion of the advance already'' with sales of rights to publish in more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Germany and Britain.

HEADLINE: Ahead of World Cup, U.S. Warns Germany About Sex Trafficking

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
On the eve of the World Cup in Germany, the State Department's big concern is not over whether the American soccer team has a prayer of getting past the Czech Republic and Italy, but rather over the flood of prostitutes expected into Germany from Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. 
 The United States, in its annual report on forced labor and trafficking in persons, called Germany, which has legalized prostitution, ''a source, transit and destination country'' for sex workers, the more so during the soccer tournament. 
 ''Due to the sheer size of the event, the potential for human trafficking surrounding the games remains a concern,'' the State Department said in its report. It called on the German government to increase police enforcement during the games.
 The warning to Germany was a rare slap at a close American ally.
 The report did not include Germany in a list of 14 more serious offenders that the State Department says make little effort to control serious problems with trafficking in persons.
 Some groups criticized the report, noting that most of the countries cited as the worst offenders -- which can lead to economic sanctions -- are not American allies. They include Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, Sudan, Venezuela, Syria, Cuba and Zimbabwe. The only countries on the list that are close American allies are Saudi Arabia and Belize.
 India, Mexico and China were on a separate ''watch list'' for the second year, prompting complaints that the State Department was trying not to alienate them. 
 ''What we want is for the United States to implement this law without any political considerations at play,'' said Jessica Neuwirth, president of Equality Now, an international women's rights organization. 
 In 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, which set out new penalties for slave traffickers and required the State Department to publish an annual report on slave trafficking worldwide. The sanctions are subject to the president's discretion. 
 Germany legalized prostitution in 2002, and German brothels have been gearing up for the confluence of legal sex and the World Cup, which is expected to bring 3.5 million tourists to the country for the monthlong tournament, which begins Friday. Berlin, Cologne and Hamburg have all expanded their red light districts for the tournament, and sex-trade entrepreneurs have opened mobile brothels. 
 The American World Cup team is staying in walking distance from Hamburg's red light district, known in Germany as the Sinful Mile. 
 German officials, while defending the country's policy of legalized prostitution, say they nonetheless do not condone human trafficking, and have intensified efforts to rein in the flow of prostitutes into their country in advance of the World Cup. But Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey, the chairman of the House subcommittee on global human rights, said that Chancellor Angela Merkel needed to do more. 
 ''It's within her power to initiate some moves to protect these women,'' he said. 
 The fight against human trafficking is ''a great moral calling of our time,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday.
 The report says that between 600,000 and 800,000 people, most of them women and children, are trafficked across international borders every year. It cited Saudi Arabia, which it said ''does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.'' In Uzbekistan, the report said, ''the majority of convicted traffickers received prison sentences of less than 10 years, were granted amnesty, and thus served no time in prison.'' 
 Countries that fail to crack down can be subject to a variety of economic and security sanctions. Since 2003, when the sanctions provision took effect, only two countries -- Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea -- have been cited.

It is three, not two. (Besides Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea, Cambodia has been cited.)

HEADLINE: Bernanke Talks Tough on Inflation 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Monday that recent inflation trends were ''unwelcome developments,'' indicating that he was far less worried about signs of weaker economic growth than about the danger of higher prices. 
 In his toughest comments yet about the risks of inflation, Mr. Bernanke said consumer prices were rising faster than he would like. He gave short shrift to evidence of a slowdown in hiring, and he conspicuously avoided repeating his earlier suggestion that the Fed might consider a ''pause'' in its two-year program of steady interest rate increases.
Investors, increasingly convinced that the central bank will raise rates at its two-day policy meeting at the end of this month, immediately began selling stocks.
 The Dow industrials and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each fell about 1.75 percent, and the Nasdaq index tumbled more than 2 percent. Bond prices also fell and interest yields edged up, particularly for two-year Treasury securities. 
 The dollar rose slightly as traders in the Fed funds futures market sharply increased their bets that the central bank would lift its benchmark short-term interest rate another 0.25 percentage point from its current 5 percent. 
 Speaking to a conference here on international monetary issues with other central bankers, Mr. Bernanke said inflation had climbed to the upper limits of his acceptability.
 ''Core inflation, measured over the past three to six months, has reached a level that, if sustained, would be at or above the upper range that many economists, including myself, would consider consistent with price stability,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 Core inflation refers to the increase in prices for consumer goods and services other than food and energy, whose prices are more volatile and are considered not as important as others in determining whether inflation becomes embedded in the economy.
 Mr. Bernanke has previously said that core inflation should ideally remain between 1 and 2 percent a year. In his speech, he noted that it had been running at 3 percent over the last six months and 2.3 percent over the last 12 months.
 ''These are unwelcome developments,'' the Fed chairman said. 
 Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said Mr. Bernanke was signaling that the Fed was likely to raise interest rates for a 17th time in two years when its policy-making committee meets on June 28-29.
 ''He's trying to send a pretty fair message that he's going to err on the side of doing more rather than doing less,'' Mr. Hatzius said. But Mr. Hatzius, who had been predicting that the Fed would not raise rates in June, said the decision was not yet signed, sealed and delivered. 
 Fed officials will take a close look at the coming report on consumer price increases in May, which is scheduled to be released on June 14, he said. And they will be watching for additional evidence that the economy is slowing more abruptly than previously thought.
 But with Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials sounding increasingly hawkish on inflation, many analysts contend that the Fed faces less risk of slowing the economy too much by ''overshooting'' in its rate increases than it would if it let inflationary expectations take hold among consumers and businesses.
 ''They know that if they are perceived to have gone too far, they can change things fairly quickly by reducing rates,'' said Nigel Gault, a forecaster at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''They probably also know that credibility on inflation, once lost, may be difficult to get back.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke made clear that he thought the economy was now in a ''transition'' to slower economic growth, but he took little solace from data showing that wages had climbed only modestly, that the housing market appeared to be cooling and that job creation appeared to have slowed markedly.
 On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the nation added an estimated 75,000 nonfarm jobs in May, only about half as many as most economists consider necessary to absorb the normal increase in the labor force.
 Instead of highlighting signs of a cooling economy, which would ease inflationary pressures, Mr. Bernanke placed top emphasis on the need for vigilance against rising prices.
 ''Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''There is a strong consensus among the members of the Federal Open Market Committee that maintaining low and stable inflation is essential'' for achieving the central bank's dual goals of price stability and full employment.
 The Fed, he continued, ''will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained.'' 
 Despite the sharp sell-off in stock markets after Mr. Bernanke spoke, some analysts cautioned that the Fed had not necessarily closed the door to a pause.
 ''Mr. Bernanke's speech is more nuanced than the headlines at first suggest,'' wrote Ian C. Shepherdson, who tracks the American economy for High Frequency Economics, noting that the Fed chairman had been his most emphatic yet in stating that the economy was indeed starting to cool off.
 But Mr. Bernanke's tough tone on Monday contrasted starkly with his testimony in late April before the Senate Banking Committee. In those remarks, Mr. Bernanke explicitly broached the idea of refraining from a rate increase at a Fed meeting to take more time to evaluate incoming economic information, and he said that the Fed might pause even if data pointed to lingering inflation pressure.
 In the days that followed, bond investors began selling off Treasury bonds and pushing up yields amid rising suspicions that Mr. Bernanke was soft on inflation.
 Those concerns have since abated. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which are closely tied to rates on home mortgages, peaked at about 5.19 percent in mid-May but have since declined to about 5 percent.
 On Monday, Mr. Bernanke also avoided any recitation of the Fed's statement after its last rate increase on May 10, when it said that the ''extent and timing'' of additional increases would depend on how incoming information affects the economic outlook.
 He also continued to leave his options open but characterized low and stable inflation as a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth.
 And while he noted that the recent surge in energy prices was likely to abate, he warned that oil prices might have contributed to the rise in core inflation and that volatile prices for oil and other commodities ''remain a risk'' to the inflation outlook.
 ''The best way to prevent increases in energy and commodity prices from leading to persistently higher rates of inflation,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''is by anchoring the public's long-term inflation expectations.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a new warning on inflation from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, misstated the time periods for his estimates of ''core'' inflation. The annualized rate was 3 percent over the last three months, not the last six months, and 2.3 percent over the last six months, not 12 months. The article also misidentified the Congressional committee at which Mr. Bernanke testified in late April. It was the Joint Economic Committee, not the Senate Banking Committee.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Speaks, and Shares Tumble 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Share prices had their biggest loss since January yesterday after remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, were interpreted to suggest that interest rates might keep climbing as the economy slows.
 Shares of companies whose earnings are most sensitive to a weakening economy, like Alcoa and Caterpillar, led the retreat.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped to a three-month low after Mr. Bernanke, in a speech at an event sponsored by the American Bankers Association, said the Fed ''will be vigilant'' to ensure that a pickup in inflation would not be sustained. 
 His remarks accelerated a decline yesterday that started as oil rose to a three-week high and a report by the Institute for Supply Management showed slower expansion in service industries, causing concern that consumer spending would taper off.
 ''You've got the worst of all possible worlds,'' said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. There is ''a slowing economy, and just to ensure that it slows down, you're going to have rates hiked.''
 The Dow average retreated 199.15 points, or 1.8 percent, to 11,048.72. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 22.93 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,265.29. The Nasdaq composite index lost 49.79 points, or 2.2 percent, to 2,169.62.
 More than eight stocks fell for every one that advanced on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.62 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 Mr. Bernanke's comments sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield, which moves inversely to the price, up about 0.03 percentage point, to 5.02 percent. The price fell7/32, to 100 26/32.
 Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, lost $1.19 to $31.38.
 United States Steel, the top American steel maker, fell $4.49, to $65.02. Allegheny Technologies, a stainless steel producer, slid $4.82, or 7.2 percent, to $62.20 for the second-steepest decline in the S.& P. 500.
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold lost $4.83, or 8.5 percent, to $51.91 for the worst performance in the S.& P. 500. The owner of the world's largest gold mine and second-biggest copper mine cut its forecast of second-quarter copper output in Indonesia by 16 percent.
 Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, dropped $3.48, or 4.8 percent, to $69.33 for the biggest decline in the Dow average.
 Crude oil for July delivery rose 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $72.60 a barrel in New York, the highest close since May 11. Iran said any action by the United States against Iran's nuclear operations might disrupt shipments from the Persian Gulf, which supplies 20 percent of the world's oil.
 An S.& P. index of home building stocks declined 4.6 percent, the most this year, amid concern about interest rate increases. D. R. Horton, the largest United States home builder, fell $1.35, to $24.81. Pulte Homes, the second biggest, fell $1.58, to $29.75.
 Shares of Trizec Properties were among the gainers, jumping $4.08, to $28.68. Trizec, a manager of office properties, agreed to be bought by Brookfield Properties and the buyout firm Blackstone Group for $8.9 billion including debt, or $29.01 a share.
 Equity Office Properties Trust gained $1.41, or 4 percent, to $36.41, for the top gain in the S.& P. 500.

HEADLINE: City's Pension Cut Proposal May Set Negotiating Pattern

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration proposed yesterday that newly hired workers belonging to the largest municipal union accept substantially smaller pensions, a move that the city hopes will set a money-saving pattern for every municipal union.
 In contract talks yesterday, James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, called for increasing the minimum retirement age for future District Council 37 workers to age 62 from the current 57. He also proposed requiring that future workers pay 3 percent of their wages toward their pensions every year until retirement; current workers pay 3 percent for only their first 10 years.
The new proposal included the first concrete details of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's broader strategy of reining in rising pension costs that the mayor says threaten the city's long-term financial stability. 
 Mr. Hanley emphasized that District Council 37, which represents 120,000 city workers, had not agreed to the pension proposal. He reiterated the mayor's position that any changes in the pension system would not hurt current workers. ''We would hope to achieve savings for new employees who have not been hired yet,'' Mr. Hanley said.
 For more than three years, Mr. Bloomberg has voiced a desire to save money by creating a so-called fifth pension tier that would give smaller retirement benefits to new city employees. In May 2003, he said that a new pension tier ''would not hurt any single municipal worker but, over a long period of time, would help us to get our pension costs under control.''
 Dennis Sullivan, District Council 37's chief negotiator, declined to comment on Mr. Hanley's proposal, but he did remark on his union's own proposals. ''One area that we've consistently brought to the table is a desire to improve pension benefits for our members,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 Any pension changes would require approval by the State Legislature. Mr. Hanley argued that the pension changes would not create a new pension tier, saying they were mere modifications. But several union leaders said Mr. Hanley's proposal's were so far-reaching that they could only be defined as a fifth -- and worse -- pension tier.
 Union leaders hinted that they might entertain a less generous pension tier for new workers, but in return they wanted a significant wage increase and improvements in pensions for current workers. 
 Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, said: ''It's great that Mayor Bloomberg is getting serious about doing pension reform. I would call the combination of things he's seeking a significant change.''
 Mr. Hanley proposed changing the benefit formula so that an additional 2 percent of annual earnings would be added to the pension for each year above 25 years on the job, up from the current 20 years. Such a move would cut pensions for many future workers by at least 10 percent.
 Mr. Hanley also proposed a pension formula based on the last five years of earnings rather than the last three years, as is the case now. Such a proposal would save money because municipal salaries are generally highest in the last few years.
 Mr. Hanley also called for new city workers to be vested in the pension plan after 10 years of work, up from the current five years. 
 District Council 37's contract expired last June 30. In an interview, the union's executive director, Lillian Roberts, said, ''We want substantial raises.''
 The city has proposed a three-year contract with raises of 3.15 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent. District Council officials have rejected that, with many rank-and-file workers clamoring for raises of 4 percent a year. The average salary for the union members is $28,000 annually. 
 Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee -- which often coordinates bargaining for the city's unions -- has repeatedly urged District Council 37 to join a larger bargaining coalition to coordinate strategy.
 Many union leaders criticized District Council 37 two years ago when it negotiated a deal that had a one-year wage freeze and lower starting salaries for new workers. Many union presidents accused Ms. Roberts of establishing a bad pattern and selling out future workers.
 ''We asked D.C. 37 if they wanted to be part of a citywide coalition, and they said no,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''What the city will do is they will always try to find someone to bargain with first to set a pattern, but some of the other unions are looking to see if we can have a coalition on economic issues to maximize our strength.''
 Mr. Sullivan said his union decided to negotiate on its own because ''we do what's best for D.C. 37.''

House of War
The Pentagon and the Disastrous Rise of American Power
By James Carroll
Illustrated. 657 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $30.
 For most of the postwar era, the United States and the Soviet Union stared unblinking across the nuclear divide, two superpowers separating the globe. Now, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States strides the world like a new Rome, economically robust and mighty in arms.
 This is a very bad thing, James Carroll argues in ''House of War,'' his impassioned, tendentious, morally incoherent account of how the United States has become, in his words, ''a garrison state,'' in thrall to the machinery of war and the doomsday thinking of paranoid generals and twisted defense intellectuals. 
 It all started in January 1943, when the Pentagon opened for business, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a press briefing after the Casablanca conference, redefined the Allied war aims in two fateful words: ''unconditional surrender.'' As the Pentagon grew, it took over the rest of government, and the American consciousness, like a spreading cancer. Meanwhile, Roosevelt's unconditional-surrender policy empowered the generals to undertake the firebombing of Tokyo and Dresden and then drop nuclear weapons on Japan, both steps completely unjustified, in Mr. Carroll's opinion.
 Although ''House of War'' presents itself as a history of the Pentagon, it is not. Rather, it is a highly detailed, often repetitious recounting of American foreign policy, especially nuclear policy, from the 1940's to the present, with the building looming darkly in the background, like Mordor in ''The Lord of the Rings.'' The Pentagon is a metaphor more than a subject, explored most convincingly when Mr. Carroll describes his personal relationship to it. 
 His father, a former F.B.I. agent, worked for most of the 1950's and 60's as an Air Force intelligence officer and, eventually, the first head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The personal connection makes ''House of War'' a strange hybrid, part history and part autobiographical psychodrama. Mr. Carroll makes much of the coincidence that he and the Pentagon were born in the same week. It would be too much to say that the building embodies the cold, remote, all-powerful parent who never gave him love or approval, but in an imagined conversation he tells his young self that he will go on to write a book and that ''that book will be your long-delayed conversation with your father.''
 Some of the most moving, persuasive pages in ''House of War'' simply recall what it felt like to grow up under the threat of nuclear annihilation. Mr. Carroll describes the duck-and-cover drills that terrified millions of schoolchildren, the days of dead certainty that nuclear fire would rain from the skies. This ''unarticulated nuclear dread'' that, he argues, ''formed the spine of my generation's character'' was no doubt more intense in Mr. Carroll because of his father's job. 
 Mr. Carroll dealt with some of this personal material in his memoir, ''An American Requiem.'' In ''House of War'' he weaves it into an interminable ''J'accuse,'' spanning more than 50 years, with the United States committing an almost unbroken series of tactical and moral errors. 
 Always, the Soviet Union is seen as a willing partner for peace, driven into a corner and forced to react defensively by an American government bent on gaining nuclear superiority. (Eastern Europe was acquired, in Mr. Carroll's view, by accident, not design.) 
 All American apprehensions are either ''paranoid'' or ''hysterical.'' All United States arms control proposals and foreign-policy ventures are duplicitous. And continue to be. Today Iran with nuclear weapons is not a threat. ''When it comes to nuclear danger, Washington is by far the graver problem,'' he writes. 
 Mr. Carroll tries to have it both ways. The Pentagon and the generals are all-powerful, except when they aren't. The Pentagon, in the early 1950's, was quite weak relative to the State Department, as Mr. Carroll points out. Again and again, from Truman to Reagan, American presidents, rejecting the advice of the generals and the foreign-policy hawks, pulled the United States back from the nuclear abyss. 
 Writing of the Reagan years, Mr. Carroll argues that ''the nuclear arsenal was the ground on which the national security system stood, and that system defined the politics, economy and culture of the United States, indeed of the West.'' The United States, in other words, had evolved into a fascist state. Yet as a fervent believer in Gandhian nonviolence, Mr. Carroll credits the antiwar movement with bringing the war machine to a halt (and grossly exaggerates the role of the nuclear freeze movement in ending the cold war). 
 It is hard, really, to understand what Mr. Carroll wants from the United States, since he detests the very notion that it has power and sometimes seems to be suggesting that the wrong side came out on top in the cold war.
 Carefully sifting through the record, Mr. Carroll does offer a lively account of a half-century of nuclear policy and arms-control talks. He is particularly adept at setting decisions in their immediate context and feeling out the pressures and constraints, both external and self-imposed, that shaped them. 
 This leads him to occasional moments of sobriety. From time to time he concedes that both sides, in the grip of mutual misunderstandings, made honest mistakes. His own evidence suggests, more often than not, that nuclear weapons and the redrawn political map made clear thinking extremely difficult, and that leaders on both sides fumbled their way toward a standoff that at least kept the missiles in their silos.
 The cold war was a dreadful time but perhaps not as dreadful as the years 1914 to 1918 or 1939 to 1945. If you don't like it cold, try it hot.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Glue. Hello, Digital. The Once-Humble Hobby of Scrapbooking Has Moved On.

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
DEVOTEES of the hobby known as scrapbooking spent an estimated $3 billion last year on patterned paper, ribbons, stamps, brads and fabrics. They also spent untold hours combining these things with family photographs to make personal albums.
 Claudine Jackson was one such person. But Ms. Jackson, an optometrist and mother of two in Carlisle, Pa., said she found that the hobby was taking too much time. ''When I get a half-hour, I have to move quickly,'' she said, adding, ''It would take that long just to get my materials out.''
 Three years ago, Ms. Jackson started creating layouts of her books on her computer. Now she produces almost all her scrapbooks digitally, printing the pages as photographs that are 8 inches by 8 inches or 12 inches by 12 inches. She also burns the scrapbooks on CD's, for safekeeping or to share. ''It was quicker for me,'' she said. ''I could start and stop at a moment's notice.'' 
 Her fascination with technology is not unusual among digital scrapbookers. But buying electronics is unusual among women, and that has made technology companies fascinated with scrapbooking. Most of these hobbyists are women, a group that makers of computers, electronics and software have labored long and hard -- with minimal success -- to attract. Offering Barbie-pink hardware or creating virtual dollhouses has not worked, but finding ways for women to preserve their families' memories sets the cash register ringing. 
 ''This is one of the few times that women, who traditionally have not been big buyers of electronics, are very interested in the latest and the best,'' said April Anderton, founding editor of Digital Scrapbooking magazine. A result is that big companies, ranging from Adobe, the software maker, to the computer giant Hewlett-Packard, have begun marketing products specifically to these hobbyists. ''In just the last year, it has really exploded,'' Ms. Anderton said.
 Going digital may not make the hobby any less costly, because Ms. Jackson and women like her now spend a lot of money on digital tools, and market analysts have confirmed this. 
 Ms. Jackson uses a six-megapixel Fuji FinePix digital camera, but wants to upgrade to a digital single-lens reflex camera; her software is Adobe Photoshop Elements, but she has her eye on the professional version. On her birthday she got a Wacom digital tablet, which allows her to insert drawings and handwriting into her computer. 
 A scrapbooker seeking the best digital tools can easily spend more than $3,500. A dream setup, Ms. Anderton said, would include a laptop computer ($1,000), Photoshop software ($600), a digital S.L.R. camera like the Canon 20D ($1,000), a Wacom pen tablet ($300), an Epson R1800 wide-format printer ($550) and an external hard drive ($200). ''It is amazing -- imagine homemaking mothers buying external hard drives,'' Ms. Anderton said. 
 Many big companies have noted the trend. Conventional scrapbookers are finding tools and materials, called embellishments, in craft stores, drug stores and camera shops. But the main action is on the digital side of the hobby, which is the fastest-growing segment of scrapbooking, attracting novices as well as the most experienced compilers. 
 Adobe, which makes the Photo-shop software that graphic designers use, promotes its simplified Photo-shop Elements version to scrapbookers. Corel, its rival, sells seven scrapbooking supplements, at $20 each, to its Paint Shop software. 
 Printer manufacturers like Epson and Hewlett-Packard are trying to tap into the market with wide-format printers, while Hewlett markets a $30 software program called Creative Scrapbook Assistant. 
 Several specialty paper companies have created CD's with digital versions of their paper designs to use as backgrounds. And Web sites offer downloads of fonts and digital versions of embellishments for $3 to $12 apiece. ShabbyPrincess.com and twopeasinabucket.com are among the most popular. 
 ''The raw materials of scrapbooking have begun to change,'' said Mark Dahm, senior product manager for Adobe's Photoshop Elements. 
 Most people who buy a digital camera use the computer program that comes with the camera to edit photos. But it can be too simple, and many amateur photographers eventually look for a better program. Photoshop Elements 4.0 costs $90 compared with $650 for Adobe's professional version, Photoshop CS2. 
 What's driving the digital trend and the demand for technology is time, and women want more of it.
 Jeffrey Housenbold, chief executive of the online photo service Shutterfly, said that 83 percent of scrapbookers said they had not finished a scrapbook in the last 12 months. ''It takes too much time,'' he said. ''Novices are intimidated by the language and design they see in the scrapbooking magazines.'' 
 Scrapbookers find that going digital solves several problems. For one, they no longer have to devote a room -- off limits to children -- to store the die cutters, scissors, metal embossers and embellishment materials. 
 Another advantage is that a scrapbook, stuffed with pages decorated with ribbons, eyelets and mementos, can quickly get thicker than a New York deli sandwich. The albums are hard to peruse and the creators are loath to let people handle them too much because of potential damage. A digital version, whether stored online, on a CD or printed, avoids these problems. And copies can be made in various sizes from coffee-table to souvenir booklets. 
 Shutterfly sells a line of photo albums that hold up to 100 acid-free pages with designs to accommodate 600 images. The online software allows someone to lay out the book -- including full-page photos -- and add text. The covers come in a variety of colors and materials.
 Shutterfly just introduced a free downloadable program called Shutterfly Studio, which allows beginners to create digital pages that can be sent to others or be printed out. ''We are trying to remove the time and intimidation,'' Mr. Housenbold said. 
 Scrapbookers are also forcing change in the stores where photos are printed, as the digital camera era has produced a paradox: people are taking better pictures but printing fewer of them. This has hurt the photo finishers who had thrived on the double-print specials that were bundled with a developed roll of silver-halide film.
 Scrapbookers, both traditional and digitally oriented, are avid users of photofinishing because they print in unusual and large formats like 6 inches by 6 inches or 12 inches by 12 inches, which most home printers cannot produce. 
 So the trick for the stores is how to attract them and not lose them to online services. Dan's Camera City in Allentown, Pa., considered one of the most innovative camera stores in the country, has latched on to the digital scrapbooking interest. 
 A year ago, the store set up a ''digiprint lounge'' to encourage people to print more of their digital photos. Shoppers can sip coffee or hot chocolate as they sit in comfortable chairs working on computers. The computers are positioned so that socializing is encouraged. ''Some customers will be there for a couple of hours,'' said Mike Woodland, chief executive of the store. 
 The lounge was such a success that Mr. Woodland created another special section in the store, this time for scrapbookers, called the Memory Suite. ''I hadn't thought much about scrapbooking,'' he said. ''I was shocked by how many of my customers in the original lounge were involved in scrapbooking.'' 
 Mr. Woodland estimated that 35 percent of the customers in the digital lounge were into the hobby. ''They take a lot of pictures and they make a lot of prints,'' he said. 
 The hobby has fueled a compulsion that photo-store owners say they had rarely seen since digital photos pushed aside silver-halide film. ''Scrapbook customers have to make a print,'' Mr. Woodland said. ''Our print volumes have been holding steady or growing some.'' Few cameras shops or photofinishers can make that claim.
 But appealing to scrapbookers posed a problem. Mr. Woodland said he figured that supplies would take up a lot of space and he would need to train people on the staff to be familiar with all the materials and tools. ''I didn't want to have my buyer go through thick catalogs to look for special brads,'' he said.
 Instead, he bought three kiosks from Lucidiom, which makes photo kiosks for retailers. These machines, called Luci, were specially designed for scrapbookers. The shopper inserts the memory card or CD disc containing the photos she wants to put in the album. Then the kiosk guides the shopper through several layouts -- a new themed layout is offered each month -- where the photos are chosen and positioned. 
 The scrapbooker can type in text -- what the hobbyists called ''journaling'' -- and either print it or store it to a CD or memory card. ''Usually they make one or two pages,'' Mr. Woodland said, ''but a couple of women have done 20 pages or more.''
 Kesley Anderson, vice president of the scrapbook and craft business at Lucidiom, in Vienna, Va., said, ''We try to keep it superduper easy.'' Ms. Anderson, who used to run a store, added: ''Photo stores tried to get into scrapbooking, but it wasn't successful because they didn't know what products to carry. Part of my frustration as a retailer was that scrapbooking was too hard. My neighbor would say, 'These are really beautiful, but I don't have time for it.' The pages are so embellished that it scares them away.''
 A shop with a Luci kiosk could limit the scrapbooking materials to about 500 products, mostly papers and albums. Dan's in Allentown, Pa., for example, recognizes the limits and does cross-promotions with a local scrapbook store, Kinnon Keepsakes. Dan's offers photography seminars at Kinnon, which presents scrapbooking lessons at Dan's.
 Lucidiom hopes the Luci kiosk will spread to other stores. Stephen Giordano, the company's chief executive, makes a straightforward economic argument to photofinishers. ''You make a nickel on three 4-by-6 prints,'' he said. ''But go up to a scrapbooking machine and you are doing 8-by-8's and 12-by-12's. That's $9.99 of revenue instead of 15 cents.'' He expects to sell the kiosks to camera stores and drugstores, as well as the 4,000 scrapbook retailers. 
 Until then, digital scrapbookers are looking for the newest technology. Some are adding video clips to their albums. Adobe sees the possibility that scrapbookers who are comfortable with digital tools may take another step by animating their creations using Flash software, a technology the company acquired when it recently bought Macromedia. People could create effects like pages turning or stick figures that come to life. 
 All these special effects could prove as daunting as gluing ribbons and stapling brads. And digital formats may not be forever. Passwords may be lost and Web sites forgotten. Whereas a dog-eared paper album may turn up in a chest in the attic.
 ''Digital scrapbooking can get overwhelming,'' said Ms. Jackson, the optometrist. ''There are many more options, but only so many things one can do.'' 

Showing Off Your Handiwork
 THE point of scrapbooking, besides preserving memorable objects, is to share the results with others. 
 But that does not necessarily mean that the people viewing a digital scrapbook are friends or relatives. One quirk of the hobby is showing off the design to other scrapbookers. Another is selling scrapbooking materials and advice to less experienced enthusiasts. 
 A number of Web sites encourage hobbyists to submit work. Anyone can post on these sites, so graphic designs that can hold their own against fashion magazine layouts are right next to projects that look like second graders' Mother's Day cards. 
 With a little patience, you can page through the galleries at sites like twopeasinabucket.com, scrapbookgraphics.com, thedigichick.com and scrapbook-bytes.com to find ideas. Some of these sharing sites also have forums and chat rooms to post questions or to provide advice.
 If you want to see higher-quality scrapbooks, scrapbooking magazines are the best bet. Digital Scrapbooking is devoted to those who practice the art with technology, but magazines catering to the mainstream, like Memory Makers, Simple Scrapbooks and Creating Keepsakes, give more space to books made with software rather than with scissors. 
 All the magazines have Web sites, for which they solicit submissions. Few, however, post the results online. One that does, creatingkeepsakes.com, has an online Scrapbook Hall of Fame. You can find these magazines at larger newsstands or at scrapbooking supplies stores. 
 For the digital scrapbooker, the Internet is also a source for materials. Hobbyists can download fonts, ''digital paper'' for backgrounds and even entire layouts that can be used with Photoshop software. There are even downloadable ''embellishments,'' digitized counterparts of the buttons, brads, ribbons and other doodads that scrapbookers in the three-dimensional world fasten to their books. 
 Other downloads offer the kind of thing that would never be seen in a traditional scrapbook -- like flashing emoticons, similar to the little faces you see in e-mail and instant messages. Many of the downloads are free or cost only a few dollars. 
 Beginners can start with digital kits that tie tools and materials together under a theme, like a baby's birthday or a Western vacation. 
 Among the most popular sources for digital materials are scrapbook-elements.com, theshabbyshoppe.com, digitalscrapbookplace.com and escrappers.com. Hundreds of these sites exist, which suggests that one thing that scrapbookers like most, next to scrapbooking, is selling stuff to other scrapbookers. DAMON DARLIN

HEADLINE: Historic Auto Plant Returns From Ruin

BYLINE: By JOHN McCLOUD

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Calif. 

 BODY:
A landmark former Ford assembly plant here that was designed by the renowned architect Albert Kahn is welcoming its first tenant since the late 1980's. The project is expected to give a boost to the beleaguered economy of this city of about 100,000 people at the north end of San Francisco Bay. 
 The 517,000-square-foot building, which is on the waterfront, is being renovated by the Orton Development Company of Emeryville, Calif. The first phase of the project, covering almost half the facility, is offering warehouse and assembly space. Later phases will be divided among office, retail, restaurant, conference and residential uses. The final configuration will be determined by demand as time passes.
 The initial tenant of the building, which has been rechristened Ford Point, will be the online wine seller Wine.com, which is moving this week from Oakland to 53,280 square feet of warehouse space. In coming weeks, a second online retailer, Title 9 Sports, will relocate from Berkeley to a 40,000-square-foot space. 
 According to the project leasing director, Gary Fracchia, a principal with NAI BT Commercial Real Estate in Oakland, leases for another 80,000 square feet are expected to be signed soon. Orton's president, Eddie Orton, said he expected to have the building's first phase fully leased by August.
 Mr. Orton, whose company owns 10 million square feet of urban mixed-use properties in five states, has had his eye on the handsome brick structure for two decades. Kahn, regarded as one of the foremost industrial architects, used hundreds of windows to bring daylight to the assembly floor; the plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. 
 Mr. Orton made his first attempt to buy the 25-acre property in 1986 and made two more offers before finally acquiring it for $5.4 million in 2004.
 His initial unsolicited offer was rejected out of hand by the Richmond Redevelopment Agency, which bought the property in 1975 from the University of California. Ford built the plant in 1930 and vacated the site in 1955, selling it to the university for use as a book depository. The developer said few repairs had been made while the university owned it, and the building deteriorated.
 The city around it was also in decline. An industrial powerhouse for the first half of the 20th century and one of the nation's largest shipbuilding centers during World War II, the city began to decay in the 1960's as industry fled for new ground.
 Even today, Richmond struggles with high crime and unemployment. Its per capita income of about $20,000 a year is only 60 percent of the state average, and more than 16 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
 If anything, the situation was even worse when the redevelopment agency bought the two-story behemoth. Though the city itself wanted to restore the building as a linchpin for redevelopment of the waterfront as a whole, a shortage of financial resources and a lack of interest among potential tenants blocked action.
 In the meantime, the agency leased 75,000 square feet to a tenant and left the rest empty. Extensive structural damage from the earthquake of 1989 forced the tenant out, and the building has been vacant since.
 Though the city created a renewal plan calling for combined commercial and residential use, it could not attract a developer until the Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to underwrite $15 million in repairs and seismic strengthening.
 When the money finally came through in 1998, the Richmond City Council quickly selected Forest City Enterprises, based in Cleveland, over Mr. Orton's company and several other competitors to tackle the project. The developer initially agreed to build 200,000 square feet of office and retail space and 246 live-work lofts but later sought to convert the entire building to residences. The city refused, and in 2001 Forest City pulled out. 
 In 2002, the city rebid the project. Once again, it passed over Mr. Orton, awarding development rights to a investment group led by two Bay Area artists. They planned to transform the property into an entertainment production center.
 When that venture failed to secure financing, Mr. Orton finally got his chance. Prevailing over four rivals, he proposed his mixed-use project. The proposal, he said, was basically identical to his three previous ones. ''Our idea has always been the same,'' he said. ''It's too big for any one use. We needed a manageable amount of space in each of the different segments so we wouldn't overwhelm the marketplace.''
 Mr. Orton estimated that the development, including acquisition and seismic work, would end up costing about $60 million. Richmond's community and economic development director, Steve Duran, said that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development had provided a $1.5 million grant and $3 million loan and the city had contributed $3.6 million in redevelopment funds for public infrastructure improvement.
 Rents for the project's industrial space are about 50 cents a square foot a month, which Mr. Fracchia called comparable to other new spaces in the Richmond area. In contrast to New York and many other cities, rents per square feet in the San Francisco market are quoted monthly, rather than annually.
 Mr. Fracchia did not disclose the asking rent for the proposed retail and office space, but an NAI BT Commercial market report pegs the average monthly Richmond office rent at $1.77 a square foot. Terranomics, a retail real estate brokerage firm, gives the average retail rent as $1.50 a square foot. Several local brokers said new waterfront space would be likely to command higher rates.
 Mr. Orton said the building's architecture and waterfront setting have drawn interest from a number of high-profile tenants. In addition, the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park, which encompasses the site, is negotiating to open a visitors' center in the project. Though privately owned, Ford Point is included in the park because it was used for Jeep and tank production during the war.
 Mr. Orton said he had a waiting list of at least 50 people for 20 or so live-work units that are planned for the next phase of development. His management company will also lease and operate a 60,000-square-foot events center to be rented out for business meetings, parties and small conventions; it is to be created from a former crane way at the front of the building, where years ago cranes lifted cars as they came off the assembly line.
 Mr. Orton regards Ford Point as a symbol of rebirth for both Richmond and older cities in general. ''We believe the project will kindle a lot of growth and change,'' he said. ''We think it can have a transformative effect on the entire city, bringing new services and jobs to underserved neighborhoods.''
 The Port of Richmond lies immediately west of the project. Mr. Duran, the economic development official, reported that Toll Brothers of Horsham, Pa., the big national home builder, has approval to build a 269-unit residential condominium project immediately east of it. He said at least a dozen new residential and office projects have been built in the neighboring Marina Bay area and more are proposed.
 Mr. Orton is pressing for resumption of ferry service between Richmond and San Francisco and promoting creation of a business-financed shuttle bus between the waterfront and the Bay Area Rapid Transit station in downtown Richmond.
 ''We're trying to return to a cityscape that's people-oriented rather than car-oriented,'' he asserted. ''We're really moving into a different time, the one we had before the main thrust of development was toward the suburbs.''
 On the other hand, he added, ''I do want to say we have a fantastic freeway location.''

HEADLINE: Along a Viaduct, a Restaurant Row Emerges 

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When Pete Skyllas first approached the abandoned freight house at 12th Avenue and 135th Street in West Harlem in search of the owner, all he remembers was the stink. ''It was horrible,'' he said. ''You couldn't come within five feet of the place because you couldn't breathe.''
 Mr. Skyllas said he removed about 30 Dumpsters' worth of trash, much of it drug paraphernalia, from the building before buying it from Clear Channel Communications two years ago. Now the structure, which is at 701 West 135th Street, is being reconstructed, poised to become a fulcrum in a five-block restaurant row developing in the shadow of the Riverside Drive viaduct in West Harlem.
The gritty area, stretching along 12th Avenue between St. Clair Place and 135th Street, runs next to the Hudson River but is dominated by a highway overpass. For years, this stretch of land has intimidated joggers and cyclists who happened into it. 
 The area was once a meatpacking district, but has evolved since the 1970's into auto shops, warehouses and manufacturing businesses. But with the nearest residences up a steep stairway along Riverside Drive, it quickly developed into an area whose dimmer corners were used for drug sales and prostitution. 
 Now the transactions happening in the neighborhood involve commercial real estate.
 ''This neighborhood has always been very remote, and before, this place was maybe a dead zone,'' said Mr. Skyllas, who two years ago planned to move his plumbing business into the 20,900-square-foot building.
 But then he learned about an $18.7 million reconstruction of two Harlem piers nearby at 125th Street -- one intended for recreation and the other for water taxis and excursion boats -- and a new 18-acre campus proposed by Columbia University to extend up to 133rd Street.
 Mr. Skyllas said he quickly realized his building might flourish as a venue for restaurants and clubs. ''Now, this area is going to have a heartbeat,'' he said.
 Two restaurants have leased space in the building; they will be run by established New York City restaurateurs, coaxed to the neighborhood, in part, by its ample parking, Mr. Skyllas said. A lease is under negotiation with a third restaurant for the final space in the building. One of the confirmed tenants is a duplex restaurant-club called Alma Thai Latin Cuisine that will offer a fusion of Thai and Latin cooking. The restaurant will open in early 2007. 
 The owners, who also run the Umbrella Bar and Lounge and Mamajuana Cafe in the Inwood section of Manhattan, say they are paying about $11,000 a month for their 6,000-square-foot space, or about $22 a square foot annually -- considerably less than the going rate for restaurant space in Harlem, which is about $60 to $70 a foot off the main avenues and can rise to $125 a foot.
 Carlos Saint-Hilaire, co-owner of Alma, said the area had incredible potential. ''This area is supposed to be the next meatpacking district,'' said Mr. Saint-Hilaire, referring to a once-gritty area of the West Village that has become a fashionable neighborhood with many upscale restaurants, popular clubs and expensive boutiques. 
 The revival along the five blocks of 12th Avenue has taken years to get rolling. An upscale Fairway Market began attracting people from the Upper West Side to the area when it opened at 132nd Street in 1995. And the first restaurant and bar, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, opened in the neighborhood at 131st Street in late 2004.
 The Hudson River Cafe, a restaurant and bar specializing in wines of the Hudson Valley and meals made from organic produce, will open this summer at 133rd Street.
 Hamlet Peralta, who demolished an auto repair shop to develop the cafe, which will have live jazz, has plans for another restaurant in the area. He has been negotiating with the owner of a wholesale business along 12th Avenue to open a Mexican restaurant in the building, which has a striking river view from its third story, framed by the filigreed arch of the viaduct, he said. 
 Hudson River Cafe is to have a patio, outdoor bar and terrace, which he hopes will lure boaters who use the Harlem piers, scheduled for completion in the summer of 2007. Eventually, that project, financed by state and city agencies and featuring a landscaped bicycle path running along 12th Avenue, may also include ferry service to New Jersey.
 Predictably, real estate agents have created a name for the tiny neighborhood: ViVa, for Viaduct Valley, evoking the ornate arched bridge supporting Riverside Drive, which was built in the late 1800's.
 ''This area is under a gorgeous structure,'' said Marlene Hartstein, a managing director at Warburg Realty Partnership who is representing the commercial space at 701 West 135th Street. ''There's a lot going on there, and there really isn't any more space, because Columbia University has taken almost everything.''
 Andrea Rojas, the second restaurant tenant in the former freight house at 135th Street, is creating a duplex pizzeria and bar centered on an Italian brick oven. He said Columbia's proposed expansion, which would reach as far north as 133rd Street, was a boon to the area.
 Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, the strip's pioneer restaurant, features blues and jazz bands along with smoky brisket sandwiches. Its owner, John Stage, redeveloped the site of an old meat warehouse -- which has since been acquired by Columbia University -- maintaining the thick concrete pillars spaced every 11 feet as a foundation, but carting in antique wood from barns in upstate New York to frame the 7,200 square-foot building.
 A conventional observation about the area is that it is difficult to get to, but Mr. Stage said this was a fallacy. Because the area is tucked under an overpass with ramps, cars can easily enter and exit the Henry Hudson Parkway from both directions.
 The subway is only a block away, and a working bus depot is on 133rd Street. Train tracks run right past the neighborhood. Residents are campaigning to get Amtrak to stop there.
 Residents of West Harlem have lived for decades along the streets perched above the strip, and a restaurant row along the avenue buried below them was part of a community plan developed under the city's charter many decades back but never realized. That plan also envisioned the area as a regional transportation hub. 
 ''The original plan for that area when it was still a meat market was for it to be developed into a restaurant and nightclub row, because of its location,'' said Maritta Dunn, the chairwoman of economic development for Community Board 9. ''There were no homes around there to be bothered.''

HEADLINE: Northwest Flight Attendants Reject Contract Cutting Pay

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 6 

 BODY:
Flight attendants at Northwest Airlines rejected a contract on Tuesday that would have cut their pay by $195 million a year, betting that improving financial conditions for the industry will help persuade a bankruptcy judge that the airline can afford to pay more.
 The rejection -- by about 80 percent of those voting among the nearly 8,700 active flight attendants at Northwest represented by the Professional Flight Attendants Association -- came with a strike threat. 
Northwest's management immediately asked the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing its reorganization, Allan L. Gropper, to enjoin the workers from striking. 
 ''We are taking this action to reassure our customers that they can continue to book Northwest with confidence,'' said Mike Becker, senior vice president for human resources at the airline.
 A strike does not appear imminent, and airlines and unions have repeatedly compromised at the 11th hour to avoid work stoppages that could force a shutdown and widespread job losses.
 Northwest also asked the judge on Tuesday to allow it to reject the flight attendants' current contract and impose new terms.
 The threat of such an imposition, which could not only reduce wages but weaken work rules and job security, had led union negotiators to agree to the $195 million in concessions in March. Since then, industry conditions have improved, though high fuel costs remain a big problem.
 The company and the union presented arguments to the bankruptcy court beginning in January about whether Northwest should be allowed to abrogate the attendants' contract and impose new terms. The company argued that it needed lower labor costs to survive. The union countered that Northwest was asking for too much. The judge set aside the issue after the tentative agreement was reached in March. 
 Roger King, an analyst at CreditSights, said he doubted the judge would side with the flight attendants. ''I think the judge is going to take a look at the economics,'' he said. ''He's got to create a viable company.''
 Whatever the outcome, the escalating dispute could slow what has been a rapid march through bankruptcy proceedings for Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn. Talk within the industry and the company in recent weeks has been that Northwest could exit bankruptcy as early as January, assuming its labor deals fall into place.
 The dispute with the flight attendants could also leave the airline with embittered employees at a time when it and other airlines are seeking to raise productivity and improve service. 
 ''The company went too far,'' the union president, Guy Meek, said. In a statement, Mr. Meek said that Northwest had been profitable for the last two months, ''but in court they continue their relentless pickpocketing of flight attendants.'' 
 Northwest said it needed the concessions. For April, Northwest reported a net loss of $295 million. Before reorganization expenses and interest expense, it had an operating profit of $53 million, a result of rising fares and fuller planes, coupled with an earlier round of substantial wage cuts.
 The latest round of concessions sought by the airline will reduce expenses by $30 million a month when put in place.
 Some concessions accepted by other groups at Northwest are contingent on the flight attendants' reaching a similar agreement. A ratification vote by some members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is expected to wrap up later this week. Pilots ratified an agreement earlier.
 The Northwest situation is complicated by an effort by another union, the Association of Flight Attendants, to replace the Professional Flight Attendant Association as the workers' collective bargaining organization. A vote on which union will represent the workers begins later this week.
 Northwest moved on another front on Monday, warning that unless Congress passes legislation allowing the company to stretch out payments to finance workers' pensions, it would seek to terminate those plans. Northwest and some other airlines want 20 years to catch up to pension funding.
 Other airlines, including United Airlines and US Airways, terminated their plans in bankruptcy, turning the plans over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that guarantees pensions. The terminations will result in far smaller payouts to many workers than had been promised.

HEADLINE: Can Tough Grades Be Fair Grades?

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
OVER the span of his college career, Andrew Lipovsky has taken summer courses at Pace and Columbia in New York, spent three semesters at Northeastern here, and then transferred across town to Boston University last year. While he has majored in business, he has incidentally performed a kind of science experiment, in which he has been the control and those four universities the variables.
 He earned grade-point averages of 3.2 at Columbia, 3.5 at Northeastern and 3.8 at Pace, a range solidly in the A's and B's. Then, in his two years at Boston University, he compiled only a 2.4, the borderline between B minus and C plus. When he had to repeat some of the same business courses at Boston that he already had taken at Northeastern, part of the transfer process, his marks dropped by as much as two full grade points. 
The conclusion Mr. Lipovsky drew, an extremely common one among Boston University students, is that he was the victim of ''grade deflation.'' By that euphemism, the students mean that, bending to unofficial but pervasive pressure from the university administration, professors force marks to conform to a curve.
 ''They want to make it harder,'' said Mr. Lipovsky, a 20-year-old from Manhattan. ''They want a B.U. grade to mean something. But here's the problem. When I apply to grad school, the admissions officers don't know of this policy. It's not written down. The administration denies there is grade deflation.''
 These are not the whines of a grade-grubber. The outgoing president of the Student Union, Jon Marker, said other students considered the grading habits here as ''unfair on principle.'' The student newspaper, The Free Press, has editorialized against the grading. ''The biggest crime against students is not low grades,'' one editorial argued, ''but having their work judged based on how it fits into a rigid curve rather than its true quality.'' 
 Just suppose, though, that the student grievances, however sincere, begin with a faulty premise. Average grades at Boston University have risen slightly for 30 years, and marks at many competing universities have been so inflated over the same period that A's and B's pile up like wheelbarrows full of devalued currency in Weimar Germany.
 So the story of Boston University and its ''grade deflation'' becomes the story of the difficulty, for students and administrators alike, in being the only honest guy in town. Even the university officials who defend the integrity of their grading system admit that students like Mr. Lipovsky have good cause to wish that the university cooked the books the way others do.
 ''These students are competing for admission to graduate school, for post-docs, for study abroad,'' said Jeffrey J. Henderson, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. ''And to the extent G.P.A. is important, they say, we come out of B.U. and we have a lower grade point and no one can tell why. That is a legitimate concern.''
 While neither students nor administrators will acknowledge as much, there is another less defensible explanation for the student criticism and for the university's defensiveness on the grading subject. If a degree from a respected institution is a commodity, as well it might be at a time when annual costs at private universities are in the vicinity of $40,000, then grade inflation is a service being purchased. No elite college, in vigorous competition to enroll the top high school seniors, is going to make its recruiting slogan, ''Home of the Gentleman's C.''
 Maybe it is just too naively idealistic to wish that Boston University would boast about what it has done in holding the line against grade inflation. A study in the university's College of Arts of Sciences found that from 1972-73 to 2003-4, the percentage of A's and B's went up by a few percentage points (to 79 from 75) and the percentage of C's went down slightly (to 18 from 21). Meanwhile, Boston University has managed to attract a student body with far higher grades, class rank and SAT scores than it did a generation ago.
 All this has occurred against a backdrop of rampant grade inflation, some of it just across the Charles River. By the early 2000's, 9 of every 10 Harvard graduates received honors at commencement and nearly half of all undergraduate grades were A or A-minus, according to ''Excellence Without a Soul,'' a new book about Harvard by a former dean, Harry R. Lewis.
 A skeptic could contend that Harvard students are so gifted that the stratospheric grades reflect the collective brain-power, except that in state universities that are far less selective, the same phenomenon holds. At the University of Minnesota's main campus, 40 percent of undergraduate grades are A's. The percentage of A's at the University of Delaware went up by half, to 35 percent, from 1987 to 2002.
 The net result, as a report on grade inflation by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences put it in 2002, is ''a system that fears candor.'' Or, perhaps, a system that delivers the desired product to its consumers. Or, maybe, a system that believes self-esteem is bestowed rather than earned.
 AMID this climate, Boston University officials six years ago began sending deans, chairs and individual instructors data comparing average grades in courses and departments. While some other universities do share such information with faculty members, Boston University's administrators went further in suggesting ideal distributions of grades, C's very much included, and in recommending departmental averages, with par near a B.
 Students sometimes heard about, but rarely saw, such documents. Boston University did not follow the example of Cornell and Dartmouth in including not only individual grades but class averages on a student's transcript, putting each mark in context. Such a move is now under consideration at Boston University.
 More commonly, when students challenged their grades in a class, professors found it expedient to put the blame on the unseen administrative directives. A few instructors, at least in Mr. Lipovsky's experience, pre-emptively announced grade distributions at the outset of a semester, giving a foreboding sense of predestination. Not surprisingly, innuendo thrived about a policy of ''grade deflation.''
 Even William Skocpol, a physics professor who endorses the rigorous grading standards, said he understood undergraduates' anxiety. ''I don't blame the students,'' he said. ''They haven't been given enough information to make any judgments at all.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The On Education column on Wednesday, about complaints by students at Boston University who say the institution treats them unfairly by grading on a curve while other universities inflate grades, misstated the name of the student newspaper that has editorialized against the university's grading practices. It is The Daily Free Press, not The Free Press.

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel Sees Big Problems if Indian Point Reactors Close

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Closing the Indian Point nuclear reactors would make electricity more expensive, leave New York more vulnerable to natural gas shortages and add to pollution that causes global warming, according to a report released on Tuesday by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences. 
 The committee said that there were no insurmountable technical obstacles to closing the plant. But it asserted that electric demand was growing so fast in the region, and building power plants was so difficult, that simply meeting power needs during peak periods would be a challenge even if the reactors stayed in operation. 
Congress provided $1 million for the study, under a bill sponsored by Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat who says the reactors should be closed because of the risk of a release of radiation through accident or terrorist attack. 
 Despite the report's conclusion that closing Indian Point, which is about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, would present major difficulties for the state, Ms. Lowey said in a phone interview that she was ''thrilled'' by its findings. ''To me, the bottom line is, where there's a will there's a way'' to close the plant, she said. 
 She pointed out that the National Academy group said the extra costs from closing Indian Point would be "modest," provided there is time to compensate, by building new plants or improving efficiency.
 In fact, the report emphasized the political problems of meeting the state's energy demands, with or without the reactors. 
 ''While the committee is optimistic that technical solutions do exist for the replacement of Indian Point, it is considerably less confident that the necessary political, regulatory, financial and institutional mechanisms are in place to facilitate the timely implementation of these replacement options,'' the report said. 
 The continuing fight over Indian Point comes as nuclear power is anticipating a renaissance, mainly because of the high price of natural gas. It has been nearly 30 years since the last plant was ordered, but nine companies have said publicly that they are considering building new ones around the country, including one in Scriba, N.Y., adjacent to the Nine Mile Point complex. 
 At the moment building any power plant in New York State is difficult, the report said, because a law that laid out the process for environmental reviews and permits for new plants was allowed to expire in 2003.
 The amount of generating capacity under construction now is inadequate to meet peak demand in 2009, and the shortfall will be far larger if Indian Point closes, the report said. In seven to nine years, the area will need 3,000 megawatts of additional electric capacity if Indian Point is running, and 5,000 megawatts if it is not, the report said. 
 One of the authors, Parker D. Mathusa, said in a telephone interview that there were big opportunities for improving efficiency of electric use and expanding electric production. But Mr. Mathusa, a member of the board of directors of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said that ''to replace 2,000 megawatts of base-load power, very low-cost power, in a critical part of the country that is growing, with air quality that is some of the worst in the country, one would have to pause.''
 Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the reactors, said that it was no surprise that the panel found that Indian Point could be replaced. ''Of course you can do anything if you try hard enough,'' he said. ''You can put a man on the moon, too. Whether that's the right thing to do or not, it doesn't really answer.'' 
 A business group supported by Entergy that favors operation of the plants, the New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance, says that the report showed that shutting down the reactors would cause ''extreme economic and environmental sacrifices on the part of New Yorkers who are already faced with record high energy prices, poor air quality, and concerns over reliable sources of power in the near future,'' said Jerry Kremer, an advisor to the group.
 Mr. Kremer, a former state assemblyman who helped write the law that has expired, said: ''At the moment, there's no private capital being invested in New York for power plants. The communities don't want it and the siting law doesn't exist.'' 
 The report said one alternative to Indian Point was something else that environmentalists do not like: ports for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas. In fact, natural gas, which now sells for more than double its price in the late 1990's, is the only fuel practical for large-scale plants in the New York City area, according to experts, because coal or new reactors are not politically acceptable.
 And closing the reactors would run counter to another environmental effort, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is supposed to start cutting carbon dioxide output in the region in 2008, the study said.
 The two reactors make up only about 5.3 percent of the state's generating capacity but they produce 10.1 percent of its energy, the study said, because they are low-cost producers and are run around the clock nearly all year long. Closing them would push electricity rates up, but it did not say how much.
 Some activists have tried for decades to close the plants, but the campaign drew more momentum after the attacks of Sept.11, 2001; American Airlines 11, the plane that hit the north tower of the World Trade Center, flew down the Hudson River, over Indian Point, on the way. 
 Indian Point's two operating reactors have initial licenses that expire in 2013 and 2015, but Entergy, the owner, has invested heavily in both plants, working to raise their power output, and is expected to seek 20-year extensions of their licenses.
 The company is building a storage pad outside the buildings to house casks of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel, because the waste will soon fill the pools that were designed to hold it.
 The fuel has become a factor in the debate. As the report noted, if the reactors were closed, the vulnerability of the fuel to attack would not initially change. But Ms. Lowey pointed out that the fuel could be moved out of pools and into dry casks, perhaps at some distant location, a few years after the plant is shut; if the plant is never shut, she said, hazardous used fuel will always be on site.

HEADLINE: Hard Choices as Loan Interest Rates Rise

BYLINE: By JOHN O'NEIL

 BODY:
Thousands of students, graduates and parents are facing the same financial problem this month: how to deal with the big rise in interest rates that will soon hit their federal student loans.
 On May 30, the United States Education Department announced its annual adjustment of the interest rates on existing federal student loans; on July 1, those rates will increase. The only way students, and graduates repaying their debt, can avoid the increase is to consolidate -- or refinance -- their loans at a fixed rate. The deadline for consolidation is June 30.
But although many lenders and student advocacy groups say consolidation is smart, some experts say it is not always the best strategy. 
 Rachel Thompson Alexander, 23, and her twin sister, Rebecca Thompson, both recent college graduates from Detroit, set aside last Saturday night to figure out the ins and outs of consolidation. But on Sunday, the sisters had more questions than before.
 ''This whole process is very daunting,'' Rachel Alexander said. ''I'm embarrassed to say that I have no idea exactly what kind of loans I have. You think, here I am, I have a college degree, and I can't even walk myself through the Web sites to figure this out!''
 The jump in interest rates affects Stafford loans, the largest federal student loan program, and PLUS loans, taken out by parents to finance their children's education. Interest on Stafford loans will increase 1.84 percentage points, to 7.14 percent, and interest on PLUS loans will rise by the same amount, to 7.94 percent, the Education Department said. These increases, to the highest levels in six years, are the second large rate increase in a row, coming just two years after the programs' rates hit an all-time low. 
 Luke Swarthout, higher education associate for the State Public Interest Research Groups, a nonprofit network of state consumer organizations, said consolidation could save a typical graduate about $2,000 over the 10-year life of the loan. An example provided by American Education Services of Harrisburg, Pa., a large commercial lender that specializes in student loans, claims a savings of $5,181 for a student with $20,000 in federal debt. 
 But Cindy Bailey, the executive director of education financial services for the College Board, said the $2,000 cited in the example amounted to less than $20 a month, which she called ''not that onerous.''
 And she pointed out that most consolidation loans cover 20 years or more, and so the interest that builds up over that longer term ends up swamping the savings from a lower interest rate. 
 For example, she explained, the savings American Education Services calculated came from comparing a consolidation loan issued now and one issued at the higher rate next month. But Ms. Bailey said that a student who never consolidated would pay several thousand dollars less over the life of the loan even if interest rates remain around the post-July 1 level. Risk is also limited because the programs have a cap of 8.25 percent.
 Lenders say students can avoid that additional interest by repaying the consolidation loan more quickly than required, because federal law prohibits prepayment penalties.
 Ms. Bailey attributed the barrage of consolidation advertisements to the fact that ''this is big business for a lot of lenders.'' 
 ''The marketing push out there isn't bad,'' she added. ''You just can't say it's right for everybody.''
 She said students with a large debt burden who need relief as they start their working lives would benefit most from consolidating. Students should balance their debt against their expected income and their ability to manage money, and should look at other options offered by lenders, like plans with payments pegged to income levels, she said.
 Students who consolidate lose the six-month grace periods on payments after leaving school, a factor that Carmen Berkley, who just finished her junior year at the University of Pittsburgh, said had persuaded her not to take the step. She plans to seek work with an advocacy group, ''and it will take me a while to be able to pay'' her loans, she said. 
 But Patricia Scherschel, vice president for loan consolidation at Sallie Mae, the former government agency that is now the largest private maker of student loans, said that Ms. Berkley could apply for forbearance on the grounds of economic hardship, and that the benefits of the lower rate and monthly payments on a consolidated loan would outweigh the lost grace period. 
 Experts said students should realize that the commercial lender that issued the Stafford loan has the right of first refusal on a consolidation request. It is also important to consult the college financial aid office for advice on which lenders offer discounts for features like electronic payment, and on service.
 ''This is a fairly rapidly changing industry,'' explained Jacqueline King, the director of the center for policy analysis at the American Council on Education.
 None of these questions affect students about to take out their first loans. This year, Congress changed the Stafford and Plus programs so that new loans made after June 30 will have a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. 
 Mr. Swarthout said 66 percent of students took out some kind of loan in 2004, compared with 46 percent in 1993, and that the average debt for students with loans rose to $19,200 from $9,200 over the same period. 
 ''As college costs continue to rise,'' he said, ''interest rates matter more and more.''

HEADLINE: With Loss of Maytag, Town Faces the Loss of Its Identity 

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: NEWTON, Iowa, June 2 

 BODY:
In the cool, echoey halls of the history museum in this company town, the display cases are full of washing machines. 
 Here sits the Maytag Pastime, the 1907 wooden model. Over there, a later model that also served as an ice cream maker, a meat grinder and a butter churn. From 1982, the 25-millionth washer that Maytag made, still gleaming and pristine, and on and on.
In many ways, said Leland Smith, who guided a visitor through the exhibit halls, the story of the Maytag Company is the story of Newton. 
 And so when word came last month from the Whirlpool Corporation, which bought Maytag on March 31, that the company would leave town, Newton, a carefully scrubbed community of about 15,000, was left trying to sort out not just what would be left of its economy, but also what would become of its identity.
 ''Directly or indirectly, everything that has happened here has depended on Maytag,'' said Mr. Smith, 75, who, long before he began showing people around the museum, worked for some 40 years as an industrial engineer -- at Maytag, of course. 
 Since 1893, when F. L. Maytag founded the company here, about 35 miles east of Des Moines, most residents have worked at Maytag at one time or another, married someone who worked at Maytag or, at the very least, had a lot of friends who worked at Maytag. 
 Employed there, too, over the years, were many of the town's political leaders, school leaders and social leaders.
 Nearly everyone along the streets here has a Maytag memory: the Maytag Queen being crowned in the Maytag Bowl amphitheater at Maytag Park; the arrival of the stackable washer and dryer; the way the company's ''suits'' from headquarters once prided themselves on knowing the names of all of their workers at the plant on the other side of town.
 ''That's when it was more of a family business,'' said Craig Miller Sr., who retired as an electrician from the Maytag plant, whose wife still works there in sheet metal and whose father worked there briefly in 1946. ''But as things progressed, like everything else, I guess, they went corporate and you were no more than just a number, period. That's when it started going downhill.''
 Mr. Miller said people in Newton had quietly fretted about what might become of Maytag as times got hard and competition was stiff. Suddenly, the company that had driven the town's stability and spared it from forces, like the farm crisis, that every town nearby wrestled with seemed to have trouble of its own. 
 ''When it comes down to it, this possibility has been on people's minds ever since I've been here,'' said Chaz Allen, the mayor of Newton, who moved here six years ago. 
 Still, that did not diminish the sense of disappointment and worry that Mr. Allen felt when he received a call from company officials on May 9 at 10:23 p.m. -- a time that he says is etched in his memory. 
 The next day, Whirlpool, which is based in Benton Harbor, Mich., announced that it would close Maytag washer and dryer plants in Herrin, Ill.; Searcy, Ark.; and Newton, ultimately eliminating about 3,000 jobs. 
 In Newton, the plant (where 1,000 people now work) will close by the end of 2007, said Jody Lau, a Whirlpool spokeswoman, as will the old Maytag headquarters (with 800 employees). Several hundred salaried workers will be offered other jobs with Whirlpool, Ms. Lau said, if they are willing to move.
 Ms. Lau said the company's decision about the Newton plant had come only after a ''very thoughtful, very deliberative'' analysis. 
 ''At least we know now,'' said Rick Holmes, who worked at Maytag, as did his grandfather.
 Mr. Holmes said he and his family were likely to move away, perhaps to somewhere in the South, depending on where he found work. Plenty of houses in town now have for-sale signs on them, and as Mr. Miller, the Maytag retiree, lamented, ''Who is going to buy any of them?''
 But others are more hopeful. They say real estate sales are doing just fine, and point to a biodiesel plant under construction and Iowa Speedway, an auto racing track, which is expected to open this year. 
 ''It's all part of a strategy to diversify,'' said Kim Didier, executive director of the Newton Development Corporation. ''I think there are a lot of great things that are already starting in Newton.''
 One of the appeals of Newton, Ms. Didier said, may be the very thing that Maytag leaves behind: a steady, available work force. 
 For now, Newton is ''sorting through the rubble and wondering what the aftershocks may be,'' said Peter Hussmann, the editor of The Newton Daily News. 
 The signs are mixed in recent days: a new bank said it would come to town, Mr. Hussmann said, but a local printer, which had long done business with Maytag, announced that it would close. And if new companies do come, in a diversified economy, will any of them mean what Maytag meant?
 ''I think that's what Newton is trying to find out -- what its identity will be,'' Mr. Hussmann said. ''I don't think our identity is formed yet. I think we're looking for one.''

HEADLINE: Indonesian Scolds U.S. on Terrorism Fight 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, June 6 

 BODY:
Indonesia's defense minister warned the Bush administration on Tuesday that its approach to fighting terrorism was perceived as overbearing, and that the United States needed to be sensitive to local concerns.
 ''It's best that you leave the main responsibility of antiterrorist measures to the local government in question, and not be too overly insistent about immediate results arising from your perception about terrorists,'' the minister, Juwono Sudarsono, told reporters as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld stood nearby.
''It's important to us because, as the world's largest Muslim country, we are very aware of the perception, or misperception, that the United States is overbearing and overpresent and overwhelming in every sector of life in many nations and cultures,'' he added. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld arrived here Tuesday to help build the United States' newly restored ties with the Indonesian military. American military aid was gradually phased out after Indonesian security forces fired on civilians who were protesting Indonesian rule in East Timor in 1991.
 In rebuilding ties with the Indonesian military, the Bush administration has said it is not only solidifying relations with an ally in its campaign against terrorist groups, but also reinforcing the importance of respecting human rights. 
 ''The U.S. has established fully normal relations, with military-to-military relations with Indonesia,'' said Mr. Rumsfeld, who met with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; Widodo Adi Sutjipto, a senior minister for security issues; and Mr. Sudarsono.
 Some American lawmakers complain, however, that Indonesian officials who were linked to the abuses in East Timor have not been held accountable. 
 On Tuesday, it was the Indonesians who were free with their advice. One important lesson, Mr. Sudarsono said, was that the United States needed to be attuned to local concerns. Then the minister took the unusual step of repeating the counsel he had given Mr. Rumsfeld in a room packed with Indonesian and Western journalists. 
 ''So I was telling the secretary just recently, just two minutes ago, that your powerful economy and your powerful military does lend to misperception and a sense of threat by many groups right across the world, not just in Indonesia,'' Mr. Sudarsono said.
 Mr. Sudarsono's remarks prompted a quick reply by Mr. Rumsfeld, who insisted he had been sensitive to other nations' concerns from the start. ''I have never indicated to any country that they should do something that they were uncomfortable doing,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. 
 The discussion over political perceptions had affected deliberations over one of the Bush administration's major efforts: the Proliferation Security Initiative, which calls for an international arrangement that would enable the United States and its allies to search cargo ships suspected of transporting biological, chemical and nuclear arms, as well as the missiles to deliver them. 
 The aim of the initiative, announced in 2003, is to keep unconventional weapons and their components out of the hands of terrorist groups and so-called rogue states. But the Indonesian government has been wary, perhaps because it wants to reinforce its claims over nearby waterways, or because it is concerned about public opinion regarding efforts to collaborate with the Bush administration. 
 Indonesia's Foreign Ministry bluntly rejected the initiative as a threat to Indonesian sovereignty when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raised it in a March visit here. 
 Mr. Sudarsono was somewhat more supportive. In his closed-door meeting with Mr. Rumsfeld, he indicated that the proposal would be studied, and suggested that Indonesia would be willing to carry out some of the activities that are called for under the plan. 
 Yet at the news conference, Mr. Sudarsono gave a starker assessment, suggesting that the plan might be carried out only if it was limited in scope. ''Perhaps we can agree on a limited framework of cooperation on an ad hoc basis.,'' he said.
 Those comments caught Mr. Rumsfeld's team by surprise. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Sudarsono was trying to balance domestic political considerations with his efforts to work with the Americans, or if there was a more fundamental difference between the sides. 
 ''Some Indonesian analysts view the United States as focused on the 'search and destroy' aspect of the war against terror, and feel that the United States has not focused sufficient attention to winning the 'hearts and minds' aspect of the struggle,'' according to a study by the Congressional Research Service.
 In resuming American military assistance, the initial emphasis is to improve the Indonesian military's mobility, by providing spare parts for C-130 aircraft and helping to upgrade naval patrol vessels. The Indonesians have also indicated that they are submitting requests for parts for the F-16 warplanes in their arsenal.
 A senior American military official said the Pentagon wanted to improve the ability of the Indonesian military to carry out disaster relief operations, to conduct joint operations with the United States, and to secure the Strait of Malacca and other waterways.

HEADLINE: Upward Mobility, For the Other Half

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As Bob Herbert correctly notes (''Untapped Talent,'' column, June 5), our economy is changing in ways that put low-skilled individuals at permanent risk of financial insecurity. 
 But in New York City as in Boston, the anticipated retirement of tens of thousands of baby boomers will create an unprecedented opportunity to move significant numbers of people into career-track jobs at family-supporting incomes.
I recently wrote a report finding that several major New York City industries, from health care and construction to automotive repair, might soon face deep shortages of skilled workers as a result of projected growth and boomer retirements. Fortunately, many of these jobs have relatively low barriers to entry and could be filled by out-of-work young people if they can master the appropriate skills.
 To achieve this result, the city should convene employers, educators and government to determine how best to create paths of upward mobility in these fields.

HEADLINE: Reports Reveal Hurricanes' Impact on Human Landscape

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

 BODY:
After the twin barrages of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, the City of New Orleans emerged nearly 64 percent smaller, having lost an estimated 278,833 residents, according to the Census Bureau's first study of the area since the storms.
 Those who remained in the city were significantly more likely to be white, slightly older and a bit more well-off, the bureau concluded in two reports that were its first effort to measure the social, financial and demographic impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast.
The bureau found that while New Orleans lost about two-thirds of its population, adjacent St. Bernard Parish dropped a full 95 percent, falling to just 3,361 residents by Jan. 1. The surveys do not include the influx in both areas that has occurred this year as more residents begin to rebuild. 
 While the New Orleans area lost population, the Houston metropolitan area emerged with more than 130,000 new residents, many of them hurricane evacuees. Whites made up a slightly smaller percentage of Houston's population -- 62.8 percent of the city in January compared with 64.8 percent last July, a month before Hurricane Katrina hit. 
 In Harris County, which includes Houston, median household income fell to $43,044 from $44,517, while New Orleans area's actually rose, to $43,447 from $39,793.
 The physical impact of the hurricanes is well documented. Now, with these reports, bureau officials said they hoped to begin drawing into sharper focus the human landscape, showing in stark statistics how the storm's impact was felt most keenly by the poor, members of minorities and renters.
 ''One of the keys for me is that the data we are seeing really supports the anecdotal stories we've been hearing for months,'' said Lisa Blumerman, deputy chief of the bureau's American Community Survey. ''We now have quantitative data that supports the stories from the storm.''
 One of the reports looked solely at population gains and losses, while the second studied demographic shifts before and after the storm.
 The reports' findings had been expected, said William H. Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution. Still, he said, there were some small surprises.
 It was not only New Orleans but also the entire metropolitan region that became whiter, less poor and more mobile, Mr. Frey said. At the same time, he said, assumptions that the evacuees who went to nearby Baton Rouge, where the population grew by nearly 15,000, were disproportionately poor and black were proven incorrect. A more middle-class group settled there, while the poorer and more vulnerable, who had less choice about where they landed, went to more distant cities.
 Demographers in the affected states said yesterday that they were skeptical of some of the methodology in the studies, wary of the results and unsure how helpful the reports would be in measuring the human impact of the storms. Steve Murdock, the state demographer of Texas, said the studies underestimated the number of hurricane evacuees in Houston by limiting their measurements to individual households and failing to count people living in hotels, shelters and other group environments.
 ''I can tell you that I learned nothing new about Texas,'' Mr. Murdock said. ''These are very limited data. The truth is, nobody knows how good this data really is.''
 Caroline Leung, an economic researcher at Louisiana Tech University, said she had been trying to reconcile some conflicting data in the two reports and came away confused. The underlying trends may be valid, Ms. Leung said, ''but I would not rely too much on those population numbers.''
 Census officials emphasized that the special reports used a somewhat different methodology than typical bureau studies, saying some of the numbers might be slightly less concrete than normal.
 ''But we felt the need to do this quickly, because the impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast population is really without precedent,'' said Enrique Lamas, chief of the bureau's population division.
 Of the 117 counties and parishes used in the studies -- those identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as eligible for disaster assistance -- only 40 lost population in the four months after the storm, and 99 percent of the losses came in the top 10 parishes and counties, comprising New Orleans and Lake Charles in Louisiana and Gulfport and Biloxi in Mississippi.
 The black population of the New Orleans metropolitan area fell to 21 percent from 36 percent, the bureau found.

HEADLINE: New York, You're Still No. 1

BYLINE: By Michael Chertoff. 
Michael Chertoff is the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
LAST week, the Department of Homeland Security announced $1.7 billion in new spending for state and local governments, including more than $700 million under our Urban Areas Security Initiative. Few readers may know it based on the news media reaction, but these 2006 grants continue a financing stream that places New York and Washington at the very top of the list in terms of money received.
 The terrorists who struck us on Sept. 11, 2001, and their allies continue to view New York and Washington as among America's prime targets. Therefore we have put our money where the threat is. Since the creation of my department, the New York and Washington areas, along with Los Angeles, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, have received 45 percent of overall financing from the urban areas initiative. 
 New York has received more than $528 million of this money, which is more than Los Angeles and Washington combined. The $124 million that New York will receive this year is 50 percent more than the next-highest area, Los Angeles, and represents almost a threefold increase over the $46 million the city received in 2004. 
 It is true that, in real dollar terms, New York is receiving less this year than in 2005, when it got more than $200 million. Why? In large part because Congress gave us about $600 million less for our grant programs, including approximately $125 million less for the urban areas initiative. Still, this year New York will receive just under 18 percent of the total funds in the urban areas initiative. This falls in line with the city's average over the last three years of receiving 19 percent of the program's funds. 
 There is a more fundamental point about these security grants. The Urban Areas Security Initiative awards are designed as capacity building investments. We are looking to pay for new equipment and projects that increase the nation's overall preparedness. They are not for routine and recurring operating expenses like salaries and overtime.
 Therefore, while New York and Washington will continue to receive the majority of the money because of the heightened threat they face, future grants will also go to other, less populated areas that have not received much help in building even basic security capacities. 
 Besides, when we improve the overall level of security nationwide, it helps New York, too. The 2003 blackout clearly demonstrated that loss of critical infrastructure in parts of the country outside New York can have a direct impact on the safety of city residents. 
 Finally, I would like to clear up two other misunderstandings. First, contrary to news media reports, significant landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Brooklyn Bridge were included in our deliberation over where money would go. It is true that they were not classified as national monuments and icons. Why? To help New York's application. 
 We purposely placed these structures into other categories: the Empire State Building into the large office building category and the Brooklyn Bridge into the bridges category. We did so because those categories generate a higher complete risk grade for New York's financing proposal than icons like Mount Rushmore that, while important symbolically, would have fewer human and economic consequences in case of an attack.
 Second, the Homeland Security Department has made every effort to rely on measurable facts and to take politics out of the process. State and local emergency management agencies -- including those in New York -- selected more than 100 local homeland security directors, fire chiefs, law enforcement officials and other experts to serve as peer reviewers of applicant-proposed solutions. When surveyed, 96 percent of the local and state agencies agreed that the panels that made the spending decisions included balanced representation, and 83 percent agreed that the peer review resulted in objective scores and results. 
 New York, Washington and a few other major urban centers face significant risks and rightly get most of the federal investment. But they are not the only cities at risk. Because the federal government cannot equally protect every single American at every moment in every place against every threat, we must manage the risk in the most effective way possible. And while we have significant resources, they are not unlimited. We have the obligation to ensure that those resources are invested wisely and fairly across the entire nation.

HEADLINE: Estate Tax Showdown Is Splitting The G.O.P.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans, pushing once again to abolish the estate tax on inherited wealth, are split about whether to push for a full repeal that would probably fail, or seek a more cautious compromise with Democrats that could pass.
 Permanently repealing the estate tax, or what Republicans have branded the ''death tax,'' is a priority for President Bush and many Republican lawmakers.
But Senate leaders, vowing to schedule a vote for full repeal on Thursday, have yet to line up the 60 votes they need to prevent a Democratic filibuster. Indeed, with public approval ratings declining for Mr. Bush and the Republicans, party leaders face at least as much opposition from Democrats today as they did last summer.
 In what is either a shrewd game of chicken or an effort to inflame the passions of crucial Republican constituencies, the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, has made little effort to strike a compromise with conservative Democrats that would greatly reduce but not fully abolish the tax. 
 ''Senator Frist is for full repeal, first and foremost,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Frist, Carolyn Weyforth, said. ''Until we've had the cloture vote, any talk of a compromise is premature.''
 The strategy has divided Republicans. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Monday that the Senate could easily pass a bill that eliminated the estate tax for all but a tiny slice of the nation's richest families. 
 Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has been trying for more than a year to woo Democrats from conservative states. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Kyl circulated a proposal that would eliminate the tax for any estate worth less than $5 million and reduce the current rate for bigger estates.
 Proponents said that repeal of the tax would promote savings and investment and eventually create jobs, as Americans would have more incentive to build businesses if they could keep the wealth within their families.
 Critics say the estate tax as it is now reduces some of the nation's economic inequality, and they insist that its repeal would benefit the very wealthiest families at a time when the government is running large budget deficits.
 Most polls show that a slim majority of voters support a repeal of the tax, especially when it is called the ''death tax.'' But the tax affects less than 2 percent of all estates -- most of which belong to very rich families -- and repeal would be expensive.
 Full repeal would cost more than $600 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, although supporters insist the actual cost would be much lower.
 The full cost would start to hit the Treasury in 2011 -- the same year that the nation's oldest baby boomers will turn 65 and start a sharp rise in spending on Social Security and Medicare.
 But opponents of the estate tax, including hundreds of thousands of small-business owners and a well-financed national network of grass-roots advocates, are running television ads in states with Democratic senators like Montana, Louisiana and North Dakota. They have also been campaigning in Maine, whose two moderate Republican senators are reluctant to support full repeal.
 The issue could be crucial to the political career of Mr. Frist, who is weighing the possibility of running for president in 2008. He vowed to force a vote last summer, but retreated after it became clear that he could not prevent a filibuster.
 Mr. Frist now appears to be going for broke: instead of seeking a compromise that might win over a handful of crucial Democrats, he is pushing for a permanent repeal of the estate tax. 
 Though Republican aides say Mr. Frist has not closed off the possibility of a compromise, the senator has pointedly refused to schedule any floor time for debate about alternatives in the event that his own effort fails.
 As part of Mr. Bush's tax cut of 2001, the estate tax is scheduled to gradually phase out and disappear altogether in 2010 but then return in full the very next year.
 Mr. Bush has long called for making his tax cuts permanent, but the estate tax has generated an emotional intensity far greater than most other issues.
 ''The president's position has been clear, and it is that we should eliminate it altogether,'' said Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview on Tuesday. 
 ''Keeping tax rates down on estates is just another way of not impeding the incentives to save and invest,'' Mr. Lazear said. ''We're already consuming at very high rates, and our savings rate is very low. We don't want to bias the system any more than we already are.''
 Business groups are pushing hard to make the repeal permanent, focusing on a handful of Democratic senators from states that lean Republican. 
 The targets are the two Democrats from Arkansas, Senator Blanche L. Lincoln and Senator Mark L. Pryor, as well as Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Senator Max Baucus of Montana.
 Mr. Baucus, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has offered his own proposal for scaling back the inheritance tax. Under one proposal he circulated -- which was rejected by Republicans as too modest -- estates worth less than $3.5 million would be exempt from any tax.
 Mr. Baucus has been quiet in recent days, but aides said he was still open to proposals for a compromise that he could sell to other Democrats.
 A handful of moderate Republican senators are likely to oppose a full and perhaps even a partial repeal of the estate tax. They include John McCain of Arizona, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and the two senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins.
 Ardent opponents of the estate tax, who have campaigned for more than a decade on the issue, say their time is hand.
 ''We're going for full repeal and we're pushing hard,'' said Dick Patten, executive director of the American Family Business Institute. ''I'm very optimistic.''
 Mr. Patten's group, which claims 1,900 members who own family companies, is spending more than $1 million on television ads in 11 states. Some ads try to strike a bipartisan feel, quoting Republicans, Democrats and the economist Milton Friedman on how the estate tax hurts family-owned companies. 
 Another ad aims to pressure Mr. McCain, who voted against a permanent repeal of the estate tax in 2001.
 ''American family business owners and farmers are counting on John McCain, counting on him to keep his promise,'' said one television commercial that was broadcast in Arizona.
 Aides to Senator Snowe of Maine said they had been under heavy pressure from both sides. On Tuesday, even as Mr. Patten's group was still running ads in favor of repeal, a group called the Maine People's Alliance brought a giant replica of a silver spoon and staged a news conference opposing repeal just outside her Senate office.

HEADLINE: Senate Emphasis on Ideology Has Some in G.O.P. Anxious

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Though some Republican candidates may relish the Senate's current concentration on same-sex marriage and other ideologically charged topics, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island is not among them.
 ''It may stir up my primary voters a little bit against me,'' said Mr. Chafee, a centrist Republican up for re-election. He opposes the push for a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage and is under intense pressure to back a proposed amendment that would forbid flag burning. ''I'm collateral damage.''
Other Republicans, including some conservatives, say Mr. Chafee may not be the only potential victim of what they see as a misguided effort to appeal to social conservatives by staging votes intended primarily to make a point about the party's values. They say that voters are more concerned about the economy, health care and immigration, and that replaying the marriage debate in particular could do as much damage as good as Republicans fight to retain control of Congress. 
 ''I don't think the problem is primarily with social conservatives,'' said Pat Toomey, a former Republican House member who now heads the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee. ''The problem I see is with economic conservatives who see out-of-control spending, huge deficits and that Republicans can't make the tax cuts permanent. The problem is on a different field.''
 Those who doubt the strategy are up against a long-held belief among Republican leaders that highlighting issues like same-sex marriage, flag desecration and abortion speaks to the party's convictions and carries concrete political benefits. 
 Proponents of the strategy say bringing up the issues now forces Democrats to cast votes that Republicans can use to demonstrate differences between the parties in an election year. They say the votes are important in re-energizing conservatives who have grown disaffected in the last year or two -- a potentially vital step in a midterm election in which turnout is often low and races typically hinge on which side does better in turning out its base.
 A poll released Tuesday showed a slide in support for President Bush among members of his party. The survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, found Mr. Bush experiencing steep declines among those calling themselves moderate Republicans, with conservatives turning away from him as well, though more slowly.
 The poll, based on a survey of 3,204 adults conducted from April 27 to May 22, found that Mr. Bush's support among moderate and liberal Republicans had declined to 56 percent from 81 percent in December 2004, immediately after his re-election, while conservative approval had fallen to 78 percent from 93 percent.
 There are multiple reasons why Congress is taking up the issues now. The legislative calendar is relatively thin. The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, who controls the Senate's schedule, has been trying to convince social conservatives that he is one of them in advance of a potential presidential bid. And while the leadership wants election-year votes on social issues, they do not want them too close to November in case they backfire.
 Republicans skeptical of the value of pushing volatile social issues onto the agenda say the calculation is different when it comes to contentious economic issues, especially tax cuts. They say that taxes touch everyone's lives directly and that debating them helps to highlight what is at stake for individuals, in dollars-and-cents terms, in the November election.
 As a result, there is much less debate among Republicans about the wisdom of forcing a vote in the Senate this week on the repeal of the federal estate tax, an issue that ranks at or near the top of the wish lists of economic conservatives. 
 The politics are not so clear-cut when it comes to social issues. Even Republicans who see an advantage in the marriage proposal say it is politically risky in some respects and could complicate the re-election chances of endangered Republican incumbents in the Northeast and in other spots like South Florida. 
 Yet they defend the fight as necessary to solidifying the party's base before any effort to expand Republican appeal. And they say the issue could be used against Democratic incumbents in conservative states like Georgia and should help drive voters to the polls.
 But the notion that social issues can influence turnout in a substantial way is a matter of some dispute. 
 Matthew Dowd, who was Mr. Bush's campaign strategist in 2004, said it was a myth that emphasizing same-sex marriage in battleground states like Ohio was critical to Mr. Bush's re-election. He said turnout patterns were comparable in states where same-sex marriage was a chief topic and where it was not.
 ''If you vote on it, vote on it for principle, because it is going to have little or no benefit in an election cycle,'' Mr. Dowd said.
 Even as they pressed their case Tuesday, Republican advocates of the same-sex marriage ban acknowledged that they were unlikely to prevail Wednesday in a vote to limit debate, effectively killing the marriage amendment for the year. The House is still expected to consider its own version. Senate backers said they were slowly building support.
 ''There are very few significant issues around here that just come up and are passed in one year,'' said Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, who noted the increase since 2004 in the number of Senate Republicans who would vote for the proposed amendment. ''It often takes a work in progress over several years to build toward success.''
 Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania and a chief proponent of the marriage ban, conceded that the issue was one many Republicans could do without.
 ''I know in many meetings of our colleagues when the issue of marriage comes up, heads drop,'' Mr. Santorum said in a floor speech. ''It is just an issue that people just feel uncomfortable talking about. It's something that maybe in some respects they feel like, why do we even have to? Why is this even an issue?''
 Dismissing the idea that politics had played a role in the timing, he said Senate Republicans had decided to act because the institution of marriage was under threat, and court decisions were slow in coming. 
 But one Republican strategist, Ed Rollins, said it was a mistake for the president and Senate leaders to focus attention on a marriage ban now, in what could look like a panicked reaction to shrinking public support. 
 ''What the president needs to do is look like a leader, not be somebody who looks like a politician who is overreacting to polls,'' Mr. Rollins said. ''If anything, he is reminding people of what they don't like about the Republican Party.''
 It was clear that others in the Senate were ready to put the matter behind them, and they appeared to be getting their wish as the leadership set the vote for Wednesday.
 ''It is the leader's decision as to what the agenda should be,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who opposes the amendment. ''I just hope we get to the defense authorization bill as soon as possible.''

HEADLINE: Fed Official Says Rate Rises Remain a Work in Progress

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, Susan Schmidt Bies, said yesterday that central bankers were trying to keep inflation from accelerating even as economic growth slowed, and that it was unclear how many more interest rate increases were needed. 
 ''We have high current inflation,'' Ms. Bies said in response to a question at a bankers' conference in Coronado, Calif. ''We think we are going to have some slowdown in some sectors in the months ahead. We are trying to balance that out.''
Later in the session, Ms. Bies told reporters, ''The question is, Have we given enough tightening that it is going to start to put some pressure and pull inflation down with a lag, or do we still need to apply more pressure?'' 
 ''Inflation in the high 2 percent range is above what I am comfortable with,'' she said, using the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy.
 Remarks by Fed officials have led securities traders to increase their bets that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will raise interest rates for the 17th time when it meets on June 28 and 29.
 Ms. Bies is the third official in the last two days to express concern about inflation. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday that recent rises in measures of inflation were ''unwelcome,'' and that he would ensure that the trend was not sustained.
 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole, who participates in Fed meetings but does not vote, told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that it would be ''a lot safer strategy to err on the side of going a little too far'' with interest rates and keep expectations of future price increases low.
 Economists at Goldman Sachs said yesterday that they now expected policy makers to raise the benchmark short-term rate to 5.25 percent. They previously forecast no change.
 In another development, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia named an economics professor, Charles I. Plosser, as its president. The choice further reshapes the Federal Open Market Committee, with more than half of its membership turning over since 2000. 
 Mr. Plosser, 57, has spent 28 years at the University of Rochester. He will take office on Aug. 1, a statement by the Philadelphia Fed said yesterday.
 A former president of the Cleveland Fed, W. Lee Hoskins, said Mr. Plosser was ''someone who's going to focus on ensuring that the inflation rate stays low.'' If Mr. Plosser were on the rate-setting committee this month, Mr. Hoskins said, he would probably favor an interest rate increase.
 Mr. Plosser has been a co-head of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of economists that critiques Fed policy, since 2001.
 In its most recent report last month, the panel said the Fed might not be able to hold its benchmark rate at 5 percent for long because of the risks of accelerating inflation.

HEADLINE: A Boon for the Richest In an Estate Tax Repeal

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Repealing the estate tax, which applies to large fortunes after death, would save a lot of money for a very few people -- about one in 6,000, whose estates would each save an average of more than $800,000.
 The Senate is expected to vote as early as Thursday on whether to repeal the estate tax permanently or to exempt more wealth and apply lower rates. 
Under current law, the estate tax applies to single Americans and the widowed who die this year with a net worth of more than $2 million, a category that is projected to include about 5,200 people. That threshold will rise to $3.5 million in 2009, when about 2,500 estates will be taxed. The tax is repealed for one year, 2010, and then the threshold reverts to $1 million in 2011, resulting in taxes for 50,000 people. No tax is owed when the first spouse dies.
 Over the last decade, 18 of the wealthiest families in the country have spent more than $200 million lobbying to repeal the estate tax, according to lobby disclosure reports analyzed by two groups that favor retaining the estate tax, United for a Fair Economy and Ralph Nader's organization, Public Citizen. The wealthy families include the Mars candy family; the Gallo wine family; the Wegman supermarket family; the Dorrance family, which controls Campbell soup; and the Waltons, who control Wal-Mart.
 With repeal, the estates of the 50,000 richest Americans who die in 2011 would save $40.4 billion in taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with two nonprofit research organizations in Washington, the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.
 If the $3.5 million exemption that takes effect in 2009 were made permanent, the center estimated, the number of taxable estates would fall to 10,400 in 2011. The tax would raise $11.2 billion, 77 percent of that paid by 960 estates valued at $20 million or more. The Tax Policy Center is run by tax experts who have served both parties, but its leaders favor retaining the estate tax, which they describe as the most progressive element in the federal tax system because its costs fall directly on the fortunes of the richest Americans.
 An analysis by the center showed that repealing the tax would offer little or no tax-savings benefit for 80 percent of Americans. The estate tax savings from repeal in 2011 would be significantly more than the total income taxes paid by the poorest half of Americans. The 65 million taxpayers who reported incomes of less than $29,000 in 2003 paid $25.9 billion in income taxes.
 Proponents of repeal say that such short-term estimates miss the long-term benefits from repeal, which they say will spur more investment, create more jobs and thus, over time, generate more taxes from wages.
 The Tax Foundation was among those groups saying that the estate tax costs as much to comply with and administer as it raises. It cited a footnote in a 1992 study about the estate tax by two leading tax economists, Henry Aaron and Alicia H. Munnell.
 Mr. Aaron said yesterday that he did not stand by the footnote. He said that raising the threshold for estate taxes to $1.5 million per person meant a sharp drop in compliance costs ''while keeping almost all the revenue.''
 Mr. Aaron added that both he and Ms. Munnell ''believe in the principle that large transfers of wealth after death should be taxed.''
 He said that not all income was taxed, so the estate tax acts as a backup to prevent tax-free living by the richest Americans. He argued that the tax discouraged dynastic wealth and thus encouraged economic vitality. And he said that ''whatever distortions'' taxes caused, less harm came from those imposed after death than during life.
 He added that the estate tax repeal debate had largely ignored what he thought was the central issue.
 ''The key point is that if you have a problem with a tax, and the estate tax has a lot of problems, there are two sensible reactions,'' Mr. Aaron said. ''One is, 'We have a problem, let's get rid of the tax'; the other is, 'Let's fix the problem.' We should fix the problem.''
 A 1999 study published in the journal Tax Notes examined the costs of dealing with the estate tax and government enforcement, including the incomes of the nation's 16,000 estate lawyers. Total costs were less than 7 cents of each dollar collected, according to the authors, Jay Soled, a Rutgers business school professor, and Charles Davenport, the founding editor of Tax Notes. The Tax Foundation said it did not consider the study reliable.

HEADLINE: Chirac Lukewarm on NYSE Group's Deal for Euronext 

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, June 6 

 BODY:
The struggle for control over stock exchanges took a political turn on Tuesday as President Jacques Chirac of France said that he preferred an all-European deal but backed away from the overt protectionism that has characterized French economic policy. 
 Last week, the NYSE Group, owners of the New York Stock Exchange, reached an agreement to buy Euronext, a four-country exchange with origins in Paris, for about 7.9 billion euros, or about $10.2 billion. The deal would put Euronext under American control but would also serve to exclude a rival suitor, Deutsche Borse of Germany, and turn Paris into the headquarters for NYSE-Euronext share trading in Europe. 
But an all-Europe deal could pose a conundrum for Mr. Chirac: He may favor the creation of a single stock market in Europe, but under the latest offer by Deutsche Borse, Paris would play second fiddle to Frankfurt. Speaking in Germany alongside the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Mr. Chirac said he would regret an all-European market not being the solution that was ''adopted in the end.'' But he made clear that his priority was to keep jobs in Paris, even if it meant tying the knot with the Americans. And he acknowledged that he had only ''very limited ways to intervene'' in the deal. 
 Mrs. Merkel was even more circumspect, explaining that governments like those in France and Germany could not exert influence over merging companies, even if she were ''of the opinion that it is good to build up strong economic units within Europe.'' 
 Deutsche Borse had no immediate comment on Mr. Chirac's remarks. Officials at the German exchange are trying to persuade Euronext shareholders -- who ultimately must vote to approve any deal -- that their offer, spurned by Euronext's management, should nevertheless prevail. 
 Even so, the comments by Mr. Chirac and Mrs. Merkel leave a question mark over whether European politicians, who have displayed an increased tendency toward economic nationalism, will weigh in on the stock exchanges in the same way they have sought to protect their energy and steel industries.
 ''There are sound economic reasons for having an all-European exchanges deal,'' said Stefan Jaecklin, a stock exchanges expert and managing director with the consultancy Mercer Oliver Wyman. 
 But Mr. Jaecklin said senior policy makers were well aware that ''integrating potentially competing managements in Germany and France and their operations would be far from a frictionless affair.''
 Over recent months, the French government helped to block Enel, the Italian utility, from buying the French utility Suez. France has also expressed opposition to a hostile bid for the steel giant Arcelor, which is based in Luxembourg but has its roots in France, by Mittal, based in the Netherlands but with roots in India. 
 Even the German government has flexed some protectionist muscles, preferring to keep Atlas Elektronik, the sonar maker, in German hands rather than allowing the company to be sold to Thales of France. 
 Yet, in another major deal this year, involving the American and French phone equipment makers Lucent and Alcatel, a venture was arranged with minimal political outcry. Under that deal, the merged companies will have an American chief executive but be based in Paris. 
 Under the NYSE offer favored by Euronext's management, Paris would become the headquarters for equity trading in Europe. By contrast, under the most recent Deutsche Borse offer, most top executives would be moved to Frankfurt. 
 In a sign of what Euronext executives say is the preference of other exchanges for its business model, talks got under way in Milan on Tuesday about bringing Italy into the Euronext club. The Euronext chief executive, Jean-Francois Theodore, and a board member, Olivier Lefebvre, attended the meeting with the president of the Borsa Italiana, Angelo Tantazzi. 
 On Tuesday, even Mr. Chirac seemed to say that Euronext's business plan was on the right track, even if it meant power over the company would ultimately rest with executives in New York. 
 ''Euronext isn't France,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''It is four exchanges that all work together and decide together.''

HEADLINE: Iran Open to Incentives on Nuclear Talks, With a Hedge 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and ELAINE SCIOLINO; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran for this article, and Elaine Sciolino from Paris.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 6 

 BODY:
Iran on Tuesday welcomed an array of international incentives aimed at persuading the country to freeze crucial nuclear activities, but stressed that there were issues that needed to be resolved before any agreement could be reached.
 ''We had constructive talks,'' Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, told state television after meeting with Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief. ''The proposals contain positive steps and also some ambiguities which should be removed.''
 He did not elaborate on the ambiguities. But officials with knowledge of the talks in Tehran said they centered on Iran's insistence that it will continue its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make electricity or weapons. 
 The offer made by the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany requires Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment and reprocessing or face an array of possible penalties.
 Mr. Larijani is seeking clarifications over the terms, timing and duration of the suspension, the officials added, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to divulge details.
 Clearly both sides were on their best behavior and determined to nudge each other back to the negotiating table. ''Neither side wanted to push the other to the brink today,'' said one senior Iranian official. ''There was no real change in the position of either side, but both sides stressed their points of commonality and not their points of contention.''
 Mr. Solana, who was accompanied by the political directors of the foreign ministries of France, Britain, Germany and Russia, was also cautiously upbeat after he emerged from the glittery headquarters of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. ''The proposal is on the table now,'' he said before flying to Germany. He added, ''We hope that Iranian officials will examine all the aspects carefully, avoid hasty reaction, and reflect on their opinion afterwards.''
 The package, agreed on in Vienna on Friday, includes specific rewards to Iran like new commercial planes and light-water nuclear reactors if it suspends enrichment and reprocessing activities while talks over the deal are continuing, the officials said. But it does not say just how long the suspension would last, they added.
 The United States gave crucial heft to the package by offering to remove certain economic sanctions against Iran that date from more than two decades ago, and to talk directly with Iran if the country agrees to an enrichment freeze.
 In Laredo, Tex., President Bush was also upbeat, saying that remarks by Iranian officials sound ''like a positive response to me.'' He repeated his new offer for the United States to ''sit down at the table'' with the Iranians, but only if ''they are willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way.''
 Several weeks ago, the administration rejected entreaties by the other powers to give Iran explicit security guarantees that the United States would not intervene politically or militarily in Iran's internal affairs, senior officials involved in the negotiations said. The United States has not ruled out military action against Iran.
 Instead, it has committed itself in the incentives package only to support the creation of a vague regional forum to discuss issues of mutual concern, officials said.
 The Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, also welcomed the initiative and said after a separate meeting with Mr. Solana that the talks had ''ushered in a new prospect,'' according to Iran's official IRNA news agency.
 But he characterized Iran's enrichment program as solely designed for ''research,'' suggesting that it must be allowed. ''What is important in giving the incentives is supporting Iran's rights on research in technology,'' he said. ''This issue should be very clear and without any ambiguity in the negotiations.''
 Iran is still continuing to enrich uranium at its vast site at Natanz, and Mr. Solana told the Iranians they had only ''weeks'' to decide whether to accept the offer, officials said.
 However, he has not ruled out another meeting or even another trip to Iran, the officials added.
 Mr. Larijani indicated that the Iranian side was in no rush to decide, saying, ''We hope, after we study the proposal in detail, we will have another round of talks and negotiations to reach a balanced and logical conclusion.''
 Still, it was striking that both sides characterized the talks in positive terms. And in his brief but temperate public response, Mr. Larijani did not repeat Iran's longstanding position that it would never relinquish what it considers its sovereign right to nuclear energy, nor did he automatically reject any demand for a freeze on its enrichment-related activities.
 The crisis over Iran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes, reached new urgency in April after Iran announced it had enriched uranium to the low levels needed to fuel a nuclear reactor. But Iran has run into technical difficulties and has made little progress since then, which may make it more willing to slow its program.
 France, Germany and Britain announced after the collapse of their 2004 agreement with Iran to freeze its nuclear-related activities that they would be willing to engage in new talks only if Iran returned to a complete freeze of uranium enrichment at Natanz.
 The United States is demanding that all enrichment-related activities be suspended before any negotiations start. 
 So it is unclear what exactly would constitute ''negotiations'' and whether the Iranians will use talks with Mr. Solana as a way to continue their enrichment activities while seeking even more concessions.
 Iran has offered to freeze plans for large-scale enrichment of uranium, which it probably is not technically capable of carrying out. It has tried repeatedly during the negotiations that started in 2003 to continue what it has called ''research'' involving a limited number of fast-spinning centrifuge machines.
 ''The trick is to get into a dialogue,'' said one senior European diplomat involved in the discussions. ''Both sides have preconditions for talks and we have to find a way out. We have been asking for suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a precondition for negotiations and that is exactly what they said they cannot do.''

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Will Triple Investment in India in Next 3 Years

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 6 

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced Tuesday that it would triple its investment in India to $6 billion over the next three years -- underlining the country's growing importance as a market for technology products and a source of high-technology workers.
 Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, made the announcement at an event attended by the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and thousands of I.B.M. employees. 
Investment analysts and local customers also attended the event, an annual global showcase traditionally held in New York. 
 I.B.M. said the investment would be used for establishing service delivery centers, improving automated management of networks, and developing telecommunications services, among other things. The company did not disclose how many jobs would be added as a result. 
 I.B.M.'s planned investment is the largest so far by a multinational in India. Other technology companies, including Microsoft and Cisco, have recently announced individual investments exceeding $1 billion in India.
 Multinational consulting firms like I.B.M., Accenture and Electronic Data Systems are competing with homegrown competitors like Wipro Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services to attract employees from among India's educated, technically qualified and English-speaking pool of workers.
 ''I'm here today to say that I.B.M. is not going to miss this opportunity,'' Mr. Palmisano said. ''If you are not in India making the right investments and finding and developing the best employees and business partners, then you won't be able to combine the skills and expertise here with the skills and expertise from around the world, in ways that can help our clients be successful.''
 I.B.M. began its operations in India in 1951, four years after the country became independent. The company shut its operations there in the 1970's, and returned after the country started liberalizing its economy in 1991. The most growth, has occurred in the last few years, and the company now has a major presence in 14 Indian cities.
 I.B.M. runs a host of operations in India for its global customers, including software services delivery centers, innovation labs and research centers. 
 Among the operations in Bangalore is a command center, the largest of three such centers that the company has worldwide. The other two are in Brazil and China. The centers monitor 16,000 servers and 10,000 applications around the world, said Mats Agervi, I.B.M.'s vice president of Global Delivery Services. 
 I.B.M. does not provide geographical breakdown of its sales figures, but said revenue in India increased 45 percent in 2004, 55 percent in 2005 and 61 percent in the first quarter of this year. 
 I.B.M. India is already the company's second-largest operation worldwide, growing from 9,000 employees in 2004 to 43,000 employees now. Mr. Palmisano said the average age of the Indian employees was 24.
 Mr. Palmisano's young audience clapped and whistled as he told them: ''Your career options within I.B.M. are limitless, whether working in research laboratories or with clients, or working in different geographies.''
 Earlier, as he entered the grounds of the imperial Bangalore Palace, where the event was held, hundreds of workers crowded around Mr. Palmisano. He then walked between the rows of seats to shake hands with many of them. 
 ''In the United States, employees would be respectful, but here they are treating him like a rock star,'' said Michael J. Cannon-Brookes, the Shanghai-based vice president of business development for China and India, who was at the event.

HEADLINE: IRAQ TO RELEASE DETAINEES IN BID TO EASE TENSIONS

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 6 

 BODY:
Iraq's new government said Tuesday that it would release 2,500 detainees, nearly 10 percent of those held in Iraqi and American detention centers, and that it would adopt a ''national reconciliation'' plan to reintegrate former members of Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party into society.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said the first 500 detainees would be released Wednesday, with others following in the next few days. An American military spokesman said the decision to free the detainees, the largest group to be released in the 38 months since the American-led invasion, had been agreed to in a joint review by Iraqi and American officials. He said those freed would not include any deemed ''guilty of serious crimes such as bombings, torture, kidnapping and murder.'' 
Mr. Maliki, in his third week in office, gave few details of the reconciliation program. But he compared it to South Africa's ''truth and reconciliation'' process in the 1990's, which, he said, ''sent some criminals to the courts and reinstated other people in society after promising not to try and rebuild'' the country's apartheid system. The Iraqi leader said his government's plan, like South Africa's, would involve a national commission, and others in Iraq's 18 provinces, that would work to ''an agreed timetable and program.''
 At a news conference here, the 56-year-old prime minister drove home the carrot-and-stick approach he outlined in a visit last week to the southern oil city of Basra. There, he vowed to use ''an iron fist'' to crush Sunni Arab insurgents and sectarian militias terrorizing Basra, but promised that his government would rule in ways that would make a priority of rebuilding Iraq on the basis of justice for the communities of Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds now engaged in a bitter struggle for economic and political power.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Maliki's focus was on the Sunni Arab minority that was the mainstay of Mr. Hussein's rule. ''We are ready to turn a new page with those who so desire it, and we will respond with force to those who want to pursue violence,'' he said. ''Those who want to end the bitterness of the past have the way open through the process of national reconciliation, but those who choose bloodshed will find us ready to deal with them.'' 
 The detainee release, though sweeping, seemed likely to fall far short of the demands of Sunni politicians who have joined in the uneasy partnership with the dominant Shiites in the new government, the first with a full, four-year tenure since Mr. Hussein's overthrow. The Interior Ministry said Tuesday that a total of 27,800 people were being held in Iraqi and American prisons across the country -- a figure that included criminals and former Baathists as well as insurgents and members of their support network. 
 A spokesman for the American military command, Lt. Col. Keir-Kevin Curry, said there were about 14,500 detainees in the detention centers run by the American-led forces, including several thousand at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad.
 Colonel Curry said the terms of the detainees' release included a pledge to renounce violence ''and to be good citizens of Iraq.'' He added, ''All of these detainees selected for release have been found to be relatively low threats.'' 
 Similar pledges have been made by other detainees released since Iraq resumed sovereignty after the formal period of American occupation ended two years ago, including a group of nearly 1,000 men who were freed from Abu Ghraib last August. Some of those have since been killed in clashes with American and Iraqi troops, or rearrested on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. The August release was ordered as a concession to Sunni Arab leaders then engaged in tense negotiations with Shiite and Kurdish leaders over the new Constitution. 
 Mr. Maliki's message on Tuesday offered assurances to Shiites and Kurds who were Mr. Hussein's principal victims, and, implicitly, to American and Iraqi troops, who with Shiites have borne the brunt of the Sunni-led insurgency that has gripped the heartland of Iraq. 
 The detainees being freed, he said, ''are not Saddamists, terrorists or people with the blood of the Iraqi people on their hands, but people who have committed certain mistakes, cooperated in a certain manner or played some kind of role'' in Mr. Hussein's repression and what has followed.
 But the Iraqi leader's emphasis on reconciliation, and the detainee releases, seemed to signal a breakthrough for American officials, who have been pressing hard for new measures to placate the Sunni Arab minority. In effect, Mr. Maliki's announcements signaled to Shiites, whose religious parties secured a dominant role in the government after last December's election, that there needs to be a softening in the ''de-Baathification'' process that has marginalized thousands of Sunni Arabs who worked in Mr. Hussein's government and armed forces.
 Strongly backed by Shiite leaders, the process won eager backing from the American occupation authority after the 2003 invasion. But American officials have all but disavowed the process now, seeing it as one of the prime causes of Sunni discontent that feeds the insurgency.
 ''We know that there are a lot of Baathists who want to put the heavy burden of having joined this ugly party behind them,'' Mr. Maliki said, and the mechanism for their doing so would lie in the reconciliations commissions and the opportunity to pledge ''not to return to the party and rejoin society.''
 In a move that underscored the tide of violence that has many Iraqis saying they preferred life under Mr. Hussein's harsh dictatorship, Iraq's Health Ministry confirmed figures on Tuesday that showed 6,002 bodies, most victims of violence, were delivered to Baghdad's main morgue in the first five months of this year. 
 The figure for May, 1,375, was more than double the figure for May last year. Morgue officials have said that as many as 20 of the daily average of more than 40 bodies that arrive every day, many of them blindfolded, with tied wrists and showing signs of torture, remain unclaimed. 
 On Tuesday, police reported at least 25 new victims, most of them in Baghdad and in Diyala Province, east and north of the capital, which has been the center of some of the most brutal sectarian killings involving Sunnis and Shiites in recent weeks.
 The death toll in one of the most grisly recent attacks, in the village of Hadid, near the Diyala provincial capital of Baquba, rose to 17 on Tuesday when the police delivered nine severed heads to the Baquba morgue in the fruit boxes in which they were found in the village.
 On Saturday, eight other heads were found in the village. Notes found with the bodies indicated that the victims were Sunnis killed in retaliation for the killings of five Shiites, four of them doctors, in a earlier attack. 
 On Sunday, 20 people traveling in two minibuses and a car were stopped on a highway near Baquba, pulled from their vehicles and shot. The victims included seven students on their way to final exams in the city. Mr. Maliki, at his news conference, spoke angrily of the ''flood of blood'' that had been spilled in similar attacks in and around Baghdad since he came to office.
 He said his government had approved a plan for a security crackdown by Iraqi and American troops that would concentrate on Baghdad and Diyala, which he described as ''a launching pad for terrorists and former regime elements,'' meaning Baathists, who use the province as a base for attacks in Baghdad. 
 His comments tallied with those of American military commanders, who have identified Baghdad, Diyala and Anbar Province, to the west of the capital, and particularly the provincial capital of Ramadi, where insurgents have mounted some of their boldest attacks of the war in the past month, as priorities in the next phase of the war.
 Mr. Maliki's first weeks as Iraq's leader have been burdened by his failure to win approval from rival factions in the government for nominees to the cabinet's top security posts. 
 He told reporters that he would try again at a meeting of Parliament on Thursday, and that he would be submitting the same names -- Farouk al-Araji, a Shiite who was an officer in Mr. Hussein's army until 1993, as interior minister, and Gen. Abdel Qader Mohammed Jassim, a Sunni who is a commander in the new army, as defense minister. Their names were to have been put to Parliament on Sunday, but disagreement within the government caused the session to be canceled.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rose 5.9% in April 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers rose the most in 10 months in April as Americans took out more car loans and charged more on their credit cards. 
 Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, rose $10.6 billion in April, or at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, to $2.17 trillion, the Federal Reserve said yesterday.
The increase, which was much higher than expected, may be showing that people who relied on equity from their homes rather than bank debt during the five-year housing boom are returning to more conventional credit as the real estate market cools. Higher interest rates will slow the pace of borrowing and consumer spending in coming months, economists said.
 Nonrevolving debt, including car loans, rose $7.6 billion in April after rising $2.9 billion in March, according to the Fed's report. Revolving debt, including credit cards, rose $3 billion after falling $1.5 billion a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Abruptly, an End Comes For a Garden Shangri-La

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
ON May 30, the Heronswood Nursery gardens in Kingston, Wash., the horticultural paradise that Daniel J. Hinkley and Robert Jones started 19 years ago with a single truckload of rare plants -- which eventually grew into a collection that would change the face of American gardening -- were closed by W. Atlee Burpee & Company, the nursery's corporate owner. 
 Mr. Hinkley said in a telephone interview that George Ball, Burpee's C.E.O., and three of his staff members came that day from Burpee's Pennsylvania properties to dismiss Mr. Hinkley and most of the nursery's 24 employees. He and Mr. Jones, who was retained until the end of June as a consultant, said they spent most of that Tuesday afternoon comforting distraught employees at the home they share in nearby Indianola, Wash. (Although it is perhaps surprising that Mr. Jones should stay on, even for a few days, he said it was in the interest of Heronswood and all concerned that he do so.)
Mr. Hinkley said that there had been early signs of trouble after Burpee bought Heronswood six years ago, but that the nursery had continued to operate pretty much as it had. Still, he said, he and Mr. Jones spent ''six years waiting for the crash you know is coming.'' 
 Mr. Ball said the move is a business matter. ''We are moving the nursery, not closing it, because it was losing money,'' he said by phone on Saturday from Fordhook Farm, the Burpee homestead and testing grounds, in Doylestown, Pa., where 1,000 of Heronswood's 6,000 plants had been moved over the past few years. Thousands of others will be moved to a 50-acre site in Willow Hill, Pa., and a 30-acre site in Selbyville, Del.
 Thomas C. Cooper, the former longtime editor of Horticulture magazine, who has known Mr. Hinkley and Mr. Jones for years, said he sees Burpee's decision as a mistake. ''This is not a brand like Tide, where you can swap out C.E.O.'s and move corporate headquarters and the brand goes on,'' he said. ''There is no Heronswood without Dan and Robert.'' 
 It is an increasingly familiar story, in this industry and others: a small specialty nursery known for unique plants is bought by a larger company hoping to take advantage of its cutting-edge appeal and to get new plants for mass marketing. What ensues is invariably a loss of diversity -- as the new owner narrows the selection of plants, choosing mainly those it thinks will have mass appeal -- and, often, a loss of the vision that made the nursery attractive to begin with. 
 For example, in 1993, Shepherd and Ellen Ogden sold Cook's Garden, a mail-order house in Londonderry, Vt., known for the seeds the couple found in Europe, to the Park Seed Company, a larger mail-order house in Greenwood, S.C., which later sold Cook's Garden to Burpee. Cook's Garden has gradually lost its ahead-of-the-curve reputation. And in 1988, Renee Shepherd sold Shepherd's Garden Seeds, a small mail-order nursery in Felton, Calif., with unusual vegetable and flower seeds, to White Flower Farm, a much larger mail-order nursery in Litchfield, Conn., which eventually abandoned the line as a losing proposition. She later started a new mail-order seed business, reneesgarden.com. 
 Heronswood, with its lushly planted grounds, was a magnet for serious garden people. ''It was like visiting the Holy Grail,'' said Deborah Nevins, a New York garden designer. And it was very influential. 
 Mr. Hinkley and Mr. Jones ''refashioned American horticulture,'' said Wayne Winterrowd, a garden designer in Readsboro, Vt., who, with his partner, Joe Eck, created the famous five-acre North Hill garden in Readsboro. ''There are so many plants here that simply never grew in America, or England either, until Dan collected the seed.''
 The Heronswood catalog, a 250-page list of thousands of plants with cliffhanging reports of Mr. Hinkley's latest plant-collecting adventures in the Himalayas or South America, had a huge cult following. ''His experience was so fascinating and real, like reading Julia Child's,'' Ms. Nevins said.
 The catalog was replaced this year by a glossy 75-page version with a list of about 200 plants and devoid of Mr. Hinkley's voice. (Mr. Ball says that next year's catalog will have about 300 plants, and be supplemented by a listing of an additional 1,500 online.)
 Mr. Ball defends Burpee's plan for Heronswood. The move, he said, will let Burpee test plants outside the balmy Northwest, which is ''too far away'' from Burpee's corporate headquarters. ''Fulfilling orders and shipping from the other side of Puget Sound,'' Mr. Ball said, is inefficient. 
 More important, he added, many of the plants are not well suited to gardens in the Midwest and Northeast. (Not everyone agrees: ''Our garden is full of Heronswood plants,'' Mr. Winterrowd said, ''and so are the gardens of our clients, from Louisville, Ky., to Hanover, N.H.'')
 The bottom line is money. Burpee bought Heronswood for close to $4.5 million in 2000. 
 ''It wasn't a profitable business when we bought it,'' Mr. Ball said. (Mr. Hinkley said he and Mr. Jones made a decent living from Heronswood, but acknowledged that at times they had to subsidize it from their own pockets to make winter payrolls.) 
 ''But I bought it for the plants,'' Mr. Ball continued, ''to get rare and unusual plants into mainstream gardening,'' with the idea that this strategy would eventually pay off. 
 Mr. Cooper said: ''These nurseries create all the buzz and get a popularity out of proportion with their economic size. I suspect George fell in love with that dream, and thought with his marketing department he could ramp it up.'' 
 According to the deal Mr. Ball made with Heronswood's owners -- which allowed them to buy a five-acre property overlooking Puget Sound -- they would continue to manage the nursery, and Mr. Hinkley, the partner who had always sought out new plants around the world, would continue to do so on Burpee's dime. 
 But even the most aggressive marketers would have trouble mainstreaming the kinds of rarities that Heronswood specialized in. Few gardeners want a hydrangea from the Himalayas that blooms for just two weeks; most want Endless Summer, the blowsy pink mophead hybrid that sold off the charts at every big box store last year.
 Within six months of the Heronswood sale in 2000, Mr. Hinkley said, ''the expectations changed.'' Burpee, having expanded quickly, would find itself in bankruptcy court the following year and was scrambling to right itself. The pressure was on to reduce the number of plants offered, Mr. Hinkley said. If the nursery sold only half a dozen of some plant, ''man, it was out of there,'' Mr. Hinkley said. What Burpee did not seem to take into account, he said, was that ''the same person who bought that one plant would buy another $200 to $300 worth of other plants.''
 Mr. Ball was also not a fan of the catalog. The type ''was too tiny'' and it read like ''a textbook,'' and was ''too niched,'' he said.
 Business was so bad, Mr. Ball said, that in 2003, he asked the former owners to buy Heronswood back for $2 million.
 ''They took a day to think about it, and said no'' Mr. Ball said. He added: ''If they wanted to stay a regional nursery, we gave them the chance to do it.''
 At that point, Mr. Hinkley said, he and Mr. Jones could not afford even that price. 
 Now, Mr. Hinkley blames himself for being naive. ''Mea culpa,'' he said. ''This entire set of circumstances comes down to me, and my decision was wrong.''
 Mr. Ball said Heronswood's gardens -- 5 1/2 acres of the garden, as distinct from the business Burpee is moving -- will not be depleted even as the best specimens are taken for propagation and testing. ''I would like to find some kind of buyer who would keep it open to the public,'' Mr. Ball said. He pictures a ''high-end retirement community, with nice condos'' built around the gardens on the 15-acre Heronswood property.
 Mr. Hinkley agreed that the gardens should be preserved, but only if they have a purpose beyond nostalgia, such as serving as an educational resource. Otherwise, he said, ''I would much rather see the garden euthanized immediately than to see it decline over several years.'' 
 The fate of the gardens is up to Mr. Ball now.

HEADLINE: New Urbanism: It's in the Army Now

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

DATELINE: Fort Belvoir, Va. 

 BODY:
ONE of the newer suburban developments in Fairfax County, Va., is the Villages at Belvoir.
 Belvoir is Fort Belvoir, a military post. And the Villages, 15 New Urbanist towns, are on-post housing for soldiers and their families.
The first, Herryford Village, was occupied last year: 171 town houses and houses designed in a local Georgian Colonial style. It has a Main Street with shops and a clock tower, playgrounds, and village greens with open-air pavilions and centralized mailboxes where residents can socialize informally. There is not a tin hut or cinderblock house in sight.
 Since the Department of Defense began privatizing its housing in 1996 (more than 128,000 units to date), replacing and upgrading an antiquated stock through partnerships with the private sector, the armed services have started running in some surprising architectural circles. On June 3 the Army was given a Charter Award from the Congress for the New Urbanism, an international design award from the organization of architects and planners who advocate a return to traditional town design, as an alternative to suburban sprawl. 
 The Pentagon and its housing designers -- which includes an A-list of New Urbanists like Calthorpe Associates in Berkeley, Calif., and Urban Design Associates in Pittsburgh -- are not the odd bedfellows they might appear to be. Though whether military communities, by nature strongly bonded, will benefit from New Urbanism, is still an open question.
 New Urbanists, who insist that the details of traditional design -- porches and alleys and sidewalks -- can help spin the supportive web of society, see a perfect client. ''Military neighborhoods become ghost towns with heavy deployment,'' said Joseph Scanga, a principal at Calthorpe Associates, which is working with the Army and the Navy. ''They struggle more than average to build and maintain community.''
 And the armed services, in particular the Army, are seeing the value of creating attractive neighborhoods rather than a next generation of standard-issue housing -- what has looked, through the years in successive suburban styles, like the architectural equivalent of a uniform.
 In a volunteer army, housing can be an incentive or a deterrent to enlistment. And the military's Base Realignment and Closure program has raised the possibility that any housing built might eventually be sold and will need to be desirable on the open market.
 The military also saw an opportunity to provide homes to soldiers and their families that would be ''as nice as the homes of the people they were defending,'' said Ivan Bolden, assistant for policy and a program manager for the Army's Residential Communities Initiative.
 The Army's privatization policy stresses places with urban amenities and an atmosphere where military families can support each other in difficult times, especially when a service member is deployed. It made that clear in its requests for proposals to do business from developers and their designers, many of whom, like Torti Gallas and Partners, the Maryland architectural firm that created the Villages at Belvoir, are self-described New Urbanists.
 Peter Calthorpe, in Berkeley, called it the ''Department of Defense revolution.''
 What about soldiers and their families? Can a walk to the mailbox, in New Urbanism's picturesque vision, help spouses and children cope with the anxiety of separation during deployment to war zones?
 ''You're an average American suburban family,'' said Samantha Woolley, who has lived in Herryford Village with her husband, Sgt. First Class Christopher Woolley, and their three children since September. ''What do you do, when one member goes away for a year?''
 A visit to Fort Belvoir last week revealed a community with its own strong devices for support -- the military rightly calls itself a family -- and a cautious embrace of some of New Urbanism's intentions.
 ''I've met a lot of people because I have to walk to the mailbox, and that's a great thing,'' said Jenny Lainhart, who has lived at Herryford Village for six months and walks to the village green to pick up her mail. Mrs. Lainhart's husband, Robert, a master sergeant, and son, Jeremy, a second lieutenant, have between them done tours of duty in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan, and are now working in this country, though her husband, Sergeant Lainhart, ''could go back to the desert at any time,'' she said. 
 ''What really hurt me was when my son was deployed,'' Mrs. Lainhart recalled. ''My son and my husband were both over there. They overlapped for five months.'' She organizes family readiness groups ''for any contingency, not just deployment.'' 
 Mrs. Lainhart challenged assumptions that New Urbanist designers had made about her community. Being social and engaging with neighbors, or having the privacy that a small town makes harder than a rural suburb, was part of a delicate balance. 
 ''Deployment's not half as hard as the reunion process,'' she said. ''When soldiers are coming back home, you learn not to push them back into daily activities.'' Too much social opportunity too quickly can be difficult to negotiate.
 The Lainharts live in a 2,200-square-foot three-bedroom duplex above a row of retail spaces on 12th Street, Herryford Village's town center, which opens in July. The mixed-use district at Belvoir, including a large Starbucks, was a new experiment for the Army. The apartments above the shops were available to all ranks, an important part of the New Urbanist philosophy and a severe departure from the Army's policy of ''no fraternization.'' They are fully occupied, with a variety of ranks represented.
 Staff Sgt. Brian Cassidy and his wife, Tracey, live in a town house on a village green, the core of New Urbanist planning. ''The village greens are overwrought with children,'' said Mrs. Cassidy, who has none. ''Unsupervised children.'' 
 Mrs. Cassidy added that the green didn't hold the same attraction for adults.
 ''There is an awful lot of separatism,'' she said, standing on her steps. ''People come home, they're dog tired.''
 ''People just stay in,'' she said. Sergeant Cassidy, who has fought in Haiti, Kosovo, Bosnia and Iraq, where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart, washed his black S.U.V. in the street, his motorcycle parked next to it. In keeping with New Urbanist principles, which encourage pedestrians and discourage the presence of cars, the architects put garages at the backs of the houses. But military families, whose standard tour of duty at a post is three years, and for whom storage is a prevailing issue, tend to use garages for anything but vehicles. And given the number of shiny trucks, cars and motorcycles parked on the streets of Herryford Village, soldiers love to show off their wheels.
 ''We buy 150-foot hoses to run from the spigots all the way through'' to the street, Mrs. Cassidy said, as her husband worked. Though soldiers are not required to live on-post, on-post housing, when requested, is assigned. And though ranks are still largely segregated (the housing above the shops is an exception), Herryford Village is open to enlisted men and their families. The diversity of soldiers' backgrounds can be wide. And the density of New Urbanist designs brings them exceptionally close.
 ''A family from South Dakota, you move them next to a hip-hop family from the Bronx, you know, they may never speak,'' Mr. Bolden of the Residential Communities Initiative said. 
 Staff Sgt. Vincent Harvey and his wife, Sabrina, live in Herryford Village in a housethat overlooks a playground. Sergeant Harvey can watch Vincent, their 8-year-old son, and other children play from a bedroom window. He called himself ''the neighborhood dad.''
 Last Friday, Mrs. Harvey baked a chicken dinner while she described the advantages of new-town living. ''I do feel more connected to neighbors,'' she said of their house, which sits on a corner. ''I'm not looking into backyards. I see people on the streets.'' The Harveys moved to Fort Belvoir in January, leaving Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, where home was a cinderblock four-family duplex.
 Specialist Jose Lebron; his wife, Glendaliz Romero-Lebron; and their sons, Jered and Jayden, live in a three-bedroom town house. Specialist Lebron is incredibly house proud. ''My style is more modern,'' he said of the paper lamps and bent-plywood furniture he bought at Ikea. ''Me and my wife, we clash. She likes more traditional.''
 Though Specialist Lebron and several of his neighbors roll up their garage doors and barbecue together in the alley at the back of their houses, he said he socialized more at his previous posting, which had buildings set in rows on open plots of land, as was typical of the Army's traditional housing.
 ''It was a whole big backyard for everyone,'' he said. ''So you always interacted with them. Here, I only know the neighbors right by my house.''
 Urbanist or not, new housing is new housing. Most families spoken to liked Herryford Village for the fact that the houses were larger than typical military issue and that everything -- appliances, bathrooms, late-model cable and Internet connections -- was brand new.
 Real estate market forces are now at work on-post, too. Under privatization, a soldier is given a housing allowance, or rent money, which ranges from $1,400 a month to more than $2,000 for families, that can be used on or off the post. As one soldier characterized it, the Army adage, ''Home is where they put you,'' no longer applies.
 But adaptability is a value military families share that New Urbanism, with its pattern books, could learn from. 
 Setting up a home, and doing it quickly, as military families move from post to post, is something they learn to do well. ''You become a professional,'' Mrs. Woolley said.
 New Urbanists claim they can create community from the ground up. But soldiers hit the ground, and always take it from there.

HEADLINE: An Emigrant Stopover Is Now a Cultural Hotbed

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico 

 BODY:
In this city of perhaps two million, a junction of the first and third worlds where unequal economies flourish symbiotically, a vibrant new art movement has emerged.
 Of course, the border with the United States has long informed the work of Tijuana's artists. But the city used to be mainly a jumping point to a better life in California. Now a steel wall at the city's northern edge cuts the journey short, and for many migrants, Tijuana has become its own destination.
From painting, conceptual art and photography to video and music, the city's artists now seem riveted not so much on border conflicts or a dream destination as on Tijuana itself: an experimental laboratory for people with hybrid identities and a growing global awareness. 
 ''Artists today are as avidly concerned with the city itself as they are with the fence,'' said Rachel Teagle, curator of a new exhibition just across the border at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Titled ''Strange New World: Art and Design From Tijuana,'' the show documents Tijuana's cultural fervor with 130 works from 41 artists. 
 It's not that these artists ignore the barrier that separates this city from prosperous San Diego. That might be unreasonable, given that many Americans long to extend the wall along the entire length of the border to keep Mexicans out. 
 So Marcos Ramirez's contribution to ''Strange New World'' is an off-site highway billboard for motorists driving south toward the border. It depicts a gray-haired man in camouflage -- a reference to the Minutemen, as some American vigilantes patrolling the frontier call themselves -- looking toward the wall and the cluttered Tijuana hillside beyond. (The model is actually Mike Davis, a Southern Californian urban theorist.) The billboard exhorts: ''Don't be a man for just a minute, be a man your whole life.'' Only the back of his head is visible.
 Mr. Ramirez, known in the art world as Erre, said of his piece: ''The fact is that man migrates. We all have to continue moving, and we will continue moving.''
 Much of this Tijuana-born artist's oeuvre transcends the city. ''My work is about the shock of cultures, not just the United States and Mexico,'' Mr. Ramirez said as he drove an ancient BMW through Colonia Libertad, a neighborhood abutting the border wall. But he seems to relish confronting the border's paradoxes head on: in a less-than-veiled allusion to infiltration of the border by immigrants, he built a giant two-headed wood and metal horse, playfully titled ''Toy an Horse,'' in 1997, directly on the border demarcation.
 Tijuana's shantytowns perch on mountains of old tires; those wishing to leave build temporary shelters from cast-off garage doors and factory pallets, and mechanics construct tin men from discarded mufflers to advertise their talent. So many of the artists explore Tijuana's identity as a recycling point for American discards.
 Jaime Ruiz Otis searches for materials in the Dumpsters outside the maquiladoras, assembly plants for goods exported to the United States. His ''Trademarks'' engravings begin with discarded industrial cutting boards bearing the imprint of mechanized stamping. 
 Inspired by the street mechanics' muffler men, Mely Barragan has produced aquatint engravings of heroic sculptures. After photographing vendors who assemble pushcarts from found objects, Julio Cesar Morales scanned the images into his computer, outlined the forms of the carts and exploded them into their component parts for an installation. 
 Some artists examine Tijuana's class hierarchies: Alida Cervantes, for example, painted portraits of housekeepers who have worked for family members for years. 
 As the artists draw inspiration from the hardscrabble city around them, it is almost inevitable that their work is tinged with social activism. ''There's a sustained eagerness to experiment, to find new forms, to find new ideas to develop utopian solutions to the many ills in the city,'' Ms. Teagle said in an interview.
 The artists' collective Torolab is developing what its founder, Raul Cardenas, calls emergency architecture for Tijuana, where neighborhoods spring up overnight in unexpected places. ''You do your beautiful master plan and you are ready to build your city, but the city is already there,'' Mr. Cardenas said. 
 So he set out to develop a solution for nine women living in a Tijuana shantytown. In the first stage, they described where they would like to live. Their needs were modest, beginning with a safe place for their children to play outside. In response, Mr. Cardenas designed a simple compound, but still has not raised the money he needs to build it. 
 For his documentary film ''Maquilapolis,'' the artist Sergio de la Torre trained maquiladora workers to use digital video cameras so they could record their own lives. In his own photographs of factories, Mr. de la Torre strips the vast sheds of any human element so that they become abstract shapes against desert and sky. 
 In a city with virtually no galleries, collectors or arts financing, there is little of the kind of infrastructure that nurtures an art movement. Mr. de la Torre joined with two other artists, Shannon Spanhake and Camilo Ontiveros, like him graduate students at the University of California, San Diego, to create an artists' space, Lui Velazquez. It takes artists to Tijuana for residencies and is now setting up a film and video archive and a registry of local artists. 
 ''Artists have become part of the dialogue, part of the process of change,'' said Ms. Spanhake, a former New Yorker who has planted tiny gardens in Tijuana's multiple potholes. She once sent two chickens wrapped in Mexican flags walking across the border into Arizona to attend a Minuteman rally. 
 Mr. Cardenas of Torolab outfitted five people who regularly travel back and forth across the border with global-positioning equipment and tracked their location, speed and fuel consumption for five days. The collective compiled the data and then projected it as moving lines and circles onto a map of the region. 
 In the exhibition catalog, Ms. Teagle described the resulting video as ''a poetic drawing,'' one that records ''the intermingled spaces and lives that populate the strange new world that is Tijuana.''

HEADLINE: A Life Between Jobs

BYLINE: By ANNA BAHNEY

 BODY:
TAYLOR AIKIN'S new job is across the street from his current one, but he loves to tell people he'll be taking the long way getting there.
 Next Wednesday, on his last day as a senior designer at a Manhattan architecture firm, he will roll out of work early on his 2006 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 motorcycle and not stop until he reaches the Virginia state line. Before starting his new position three and a half weeks later, he'll cruise through the South, head to the Rocky Mountains and return across the Great Plains.
 Mr. Aikin, 28, who has been with his firm for three years, said this is the first time he is taking a real vacation.
''Talking to the guys who take care of my bike,'' Mr. Aikin said, ''they're jealous, because you can really only do this when you quit your job.'' 
 Many young people in the workplace are finding that quitting their job is becoming the satisfying new alternative to the standard, entry-level benefit for vacation. As they found out, the two weeks allowed to most young employees is barely enough time to visit their parents for Christmas, go to a friend's wedding and take a long weekend.
 ''Normal life,'' Mr. Aikin said, ''maintaining relationships with people who don't live nearby, requires at least two weeks of your life a year.''
 For others like him, the solution is simple: Stop jockeying with senior employees for the prime vacation weeks. Quit and start again -- but first, get away.
 ''The transition between jobs is just about me,'' Mr. Aikin said. ''It is a trip that I've wanted to do, not something that is going to benefit a bunch of people.'' 
 Generations before them, studies have shown, valued tenure and career advancement. But this group sees the chutes in the world as interesting as the ladders.
 There are no recent studies of the employment patterns of Generations X and Y by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it reports that even those born at the tail end of the baby boom held an average of 10.2 jobs between age 18 and 38, from 1978 to 2002. A 2004 study by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group, polled Generation Y employees and found they were significantly more likely to leave their job than employees who were their comparable ages in 1977 -- 70 percent, compared with 52 percent.
 Some use quitting as an opportunity for a good, long visit back home, or to spend time with a dying grandparent. Others want the time to embark on real vacations or adventures.
 And what's wrong with taking all that ambition and putting it into a bus trip through India? A climb up Kilimanjaro? A month studying Russian in Moscow?
 The trend, career experts said, is an outgrowth of today's nomadic job culture, as well as an attitude among many young people open to adventure and big experiences -- and, yes, a bit of indulgence. 
 Why not walk away when you are young, energetic and have the opportunity to camp at the Grand Canyon? Or to visit all the national parks?
 That was Jesse Keller's big ambition.
 After 10 years as a software engineer for a company in San Diego, Mr. Keller, 32, was ready for a break. He rarely used all of his vacation days. But last year he quit to pursue his goal: to visit all 58 national parks.
 On the phone from Montana after crossing off Grand Teton National Park (No. 38), he said there is more than whim behind his expedition.
 ''As the retirement age pushes farther back and the finances for that time of life are less and less certain, it was almost unconscionable to not take advantage of the opportunity to travel now when I had the money and the health,'' he said.
 He is not afraid of finding another job -- believing his skills are in demand -- and he is not tied down to any location. What worries him more is keeping from burning out again.
 ''The trick is finding a job that has the balance built in so that I don't have to go off on a grand adventure to recover from work,'' he said. 
 There are some risks to dropping out, career counselors said.
 ''Gaps in the resume are still a red flag,'' said Carol R. Anderson, director of career development and placement at Milano the New School for Management and Urban Policy. But for those who are not following rigid career paths, ''the cross-cultural competency that is best gained from living in a different country,'' for instance, can be a resume builder, she said.
 Employers are more or less at the mercy of those alternative ambitions.
 ''Gen-X'ers have demographics working for them: there aren't a lot of them,'' said Judith Gerberg, who has run her own career counseling company in Manhattan since 1985. That's particularly true as baby boomers begin to retire.
 Meanwhile, Mrs. Gerberg said, young people ''are used to creating wonderful opportunities for themselves.'' 
 A study done by the Society for Human Resource Management found that when human resource professionals were asked to select character traits from a list to describe age groups, baby boomers were characterized as ''results driven,'' and ''plan to stay with the organization over the long term.'' Generation X, though, was described as ''like informality,'' and ''seeking work/life balance.''
 So younger professionals, unlike older workers, are more willing to chuck it all away whenever things get to be too much, optimistic that they'll be able to start over.
 Valerie Karasz, 33, had been working as a bankruptcy lawyer in New York for three years when she quit last November. After spending a leisurely holiday with family in Washington and Florida, she went to a wedding in New Zealand, then spent four months traveling in Australia, Southeast Asia and central Europe. 
 She started a new job at a law firm doing compliance work in the alcoholic beverage industry last Monday.
 ''I'm excited to go back to work and start in this new industry,'' she said. ''I feel cleansed.''
 And maybe that's what the younger generation gets that their parents didn't: There's always another job. Having grown up in an era of relative prosperity and upward mobility, it's easy to come to that conclusion.
 ''Less employer loyalty is a product of this age group -- watching their parents' lives turned upside down by layoffs, downsizings, plant closings,'' Ms. Anderson of the New School said. ''The children of these parents understand that the 'employment contract' that existed only from the end of World War II has been broken.''
 So quitting is not such a big deal, as surveys show. While overall worker loyalty has improved slightly in recent years, young people are still highly mobile. According to a 2005 survey by Walker Information, which conducts research on customer and employee loyalty, 50 percent of employees 18 to 24, and 39 percent of employees 25 to 29, reported having a neutral or negative attitude about the employer and did not plan to stay. The study terms this group ''high risk.''
 ''The younger group weren't always negative about the company, they may be neutral, but it was clear that they didn't plan to stay for the next two years,'' said Chris Woolard a research consultant at Walker. ''They weren't all that attached to the company and they don't really plan to stick around.''
 Kimberly Thrush, 35, never thought she was the type to quit and run. But when it all got to be too constricting, she left her job in Japan as a vice president at a large American bank, after working in banking for 13 years, and headed home.
 ''I am the type of person who would never think of quitting a job without having one to go to,'' she said, expressing misgivings about finding her next job. In the meantime, she has ambitious plans. ''I'm going to look for travel specials and go somewhere different,'' she said. ''Maybe Africa.''
 J. R. Briggs and his wife, Megan, had six weeks off between jobs. Mr. Briggs, 27, a nondenominational evangelical pastor and Mrs. Briggs, 26, a ministry coordinator and a counselor, recently left their posts at a 5,000-member church in Colorado Springs. Both have jobs at a church in suburban Philadelphia. But before they started last week, they visited family members in Chicago and Ann Arbor, Mich., and also spent 10 days in Costa Rica. 
 ''To be unemployed for six weeks is a healthy thing to help you say 'I am not defined by what I do,' '' he said. ''It helps to understand who I am, who my wife is, and that our identity is more important than anything we do.''
 Todd Harvey, 32, found it almost impossible to take vacation time from his job caring for the homeless as director of housing development at a faith-based nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. He finally quit last July and traveled the country until he stumbled upon the Appalachian Trail and started walking all 2,200 miles from Georgia to Maine with his dog, Soren Kierkegaard.
 By renting out a duplex he owns in California, he is able to finance his backpacking adventure until he needs to report for graduate school in San Francisco on Aug. 28.
 Others sock away money for months or give up expensive apartments so they can, at least temporarily, leave their paycheck behind.
 In the end, timing is everything.
 ''Why now when I'm 28?'' said Mr. Aikin, the architect, about his coming motorcycle trip. ''Retirement is too far away. And I was too broke in college.''

HEADLINE: Go Southeast, Young Man

BYLINE: By Walter Isaacson. 
Walter Isaacson, the chief executive of the Aspen Institute, is the vice chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority and the author of ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life.''

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS is a tale of two cities these days. In areas that were smashed and then sat for weeks underwater when the levees broke, the devastation still stretches for miles and the valiant cleanup efforts seem as daunting as mopping sand from a beach. But the older areas that make the town famous, built on higher ground along the river, are humming again. From Tulane University through the Garden District to the business district and the French Quarter, people are back at work while chefs and musicians ply their wondrous magic. 
 It is also a city of two moods. The difficulties of recovery have left jangled nerves, but there is also a sense of opportunity. As Tulane's president, Scott S. Cowen, said at a conference cosponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, for anyone with ambition and civic spirit, there is no better place to be, nor better time to be there, than New Orleans now. And on the plane ride back from one of his 11 trips there, President Bush said that if he were young and looking to make his mark or some money, he would move to New Orleans. 
The Army Corps of Engineers helped bring some clarity last week by issuing a remarkably forthright report accepting full blame for the design flaws and negligence that caused the breaks in the levees it built. That helped people everywhere understand why federal money should, as Mr. Bush has pledged, mitigate the damage to the houses, businesses and utilities that relied on those levees, just as a corporation would have been expected to help cover damages caused by its negligence.
 The Corps is also providing New Orleans with an opportunity to create a safer city. It has been authorized to build fortified levees that should not break again, far stronger than ever, but it will not be spending the billions that would be needed to build ones that would prevent all overtopping. 
 That means people should be physically safe, but low areas will still experience occasional flooding. So the state passed a new building code, and homes must now be built a few feet above grade or flood level. The next step will be more complex. Residents of many flood-prone areas whose homes were destroyed will have to be convinced to move to higher ground.
 A crucial piece of this puzzle should be in place in a few days: a Congressional conference committee is poised to give final approval to $4.2 billion in community development money that has been carefully calibrated to encourage this prudent rebuilding. Once officials realized that their finger-pointing was not helping anyone, the plan for how to allocate this money directly to residents, and to guard against fraud, was devised by the Louisiana Recovery Authority and the president's relief coordinator, Donald E. Powell, with the approval of Housing Secretary Alphonso R. Jackson. A sensible formula will compensate those whose homes were destroyed by the levee breaks, buy back property in dangerous areas and help people either rebuild or relocate to higher ground.
 In the next year or so, in order not to choke off the recovery, the city may need help finding ways to assure that residents have access to affordable utilities and insurance coverage. And in the longer run, some of the royalties from offshore oil production should go to coastal restoration for all the states along the Gulf. But for the moment, now that the money from Congress is about to flow, here are some principles for how to get rebuilding right:
 Nurture the older neighborhoods, the ones on higher and safer ground (which is where sensible people built a century or two ago). There are a lot of vacancies and underused space in these areas, rich and poor. For example, instead of arguing about whether to rebuild the lower Ninth Ward, start by rebuilding its beautiful old Holy Cross area, which is on higher ground near the river, and encourage residents of the washed-out low-lying parts of the ward to take the offer of relocation money and move there.
 Harness the energy and coordinate the plans of the city's galvanized neighborhoods. The diverse Broadmoor section, for example, partnered with Harvard University to create its own rebuilding and economic development plan. Now comes the chance to meld these plans into a coherent vision for the city, and the Rockefeller Foundation has provided the money and expertise to do so. The goal should be to preserve the magic of the city's unique neighborhoods, which are the wellsprings of its soul and creativity, while avoiding random and scattered rebuilding.
 Avoid new concentrations of poverty. The core of New Orleans has always been racially and economically diverse. It must remain, as its great jazzman Wynton Marsalis says, the last great integrated city in a nation of segregated cities. The new rental housing should be mixed-income developments that promote diverse, stable neighborhoods.
 Let innovative schools blossom. The old Orleans Parish School Board ran one of the worst districts in the nation, and it has now effectively been abolished. A system of competing charter schools has sprung up, nurtured by the state and fostered in Washington by Education Secretary Margaret Spellings and Senators Mary Landrieu and Lamar Alexander. Eager local principals are getting to run their own schools, and education innovators who want to show what they can do, like the ones from the Knowledge Is Power Program, are rushing in to seize the opportunity. 
 Be gentle. The importance of New Orleans to the nation stems in part from its precarious location near the mouth of a great river. The region's people extract, refine and transport most of America's energy and ship much of its produce. But the city's value also comes from its creative and cultural heritage. In other cities, where the wind blew down whole tracts of houses, it was possible simply to bulldoze the rubble and build new developments. But the flooded yet still intact neighborhoods of New Orleans need more nurturing.
 Towns and subdivisions elsewhere will offer an easier life than that in New Orleans these days. But many people will find that it's a great time to be back in a city they love. They will relish the rare opportunity to be part of something historic, creative and larger than themselves. More outside money will flow in than has for decades, so the city could become the entrepreneurial magnet it was a century ago. For students, few places will offer a more enriching education in what it means to be a useful citizen than Tulane, Xavier, Loyola and the other New Orleans colleges. 
 And it's now even a greater place to visit, because in addition to its old charms it provides the chance to see a fascinating civic revival.

HEADLINE: After the Divorce, Serbia Alone Mourns the Lost Partnership

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, June 7 

 BODY:
Just over two weeks after Montenegro voted to bring an end to its federation with Serbia and declare independence, the two states have begun dividing up the assets they have shared. 
 In ceremonies across the two republics, soldiers and policemen have lowered the tricolor flag of Serbia and Montenegro flying over state buildings and replaced it with the flag of their own republic. But in each of the states, which together made up all that was left of the Communist-era Yugoslavia, the ceremonies appear to have taken on very different meanings.
While the Montenegrin government has been triumphant in asserting its new independence, here in Serbia there is a sense of loss as the government and people come to terms with a newly reduced identity.
 Serbia's government has begrudgingly accepted the results of the May 21 referendum, in which 55.5 percent of Montenegro's voters chose independence, just enough under the rules set up by the government and the European Union.
 Serbian leaders have said little about how they will reshape the government as it absorbs the functions that had been carried out by the federal administration. A spokeswoman for the Serbian government said nobody was available to be interviewed for this article.
 Many here describe those leaders as shocked by an outcome that they had previously refused to contemplate. 
 ''They feel as though something has been cut off from their body,'' said Nenad Djordjevic, a federal government employee who was an adviser to Serbia and Montenegro's minister for human rights. ''Some politicians here still think that the Serbian state lies where the Serbian people are.'' About a third of Montenegro's 620,000 residents are Serbs.
 Montenegro's separation is one more defeat for Serbia, which lost Bosnia and Croatia in wars more than a decade ago and may soon lose the United Nations-run province of Kosovo, which is still formally a part of Serbia. The United States and Britain advocate such a split. 
 Some say that the breakup of Serbia and Montenegro, and the loss of Kosovo if it occurs, will produce benefits for Serbia, which they say will be better able to face its own political and economic changes.
 ''This would be the first time since 1918 that Serbia will not be divided by ethnic and constitutional struggles,'' said Ceda Antic, a member of the G17 Plus party, a member of the coalition government run by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
 But for many, that is too difficult a thought to absorb for the moment.
 ''Like the majority of the population, I think, I'm in a funk,'' said Ljiljana Smajlovic, editor of the conservative newspaper Politika. She said it would take some time before people would be ready to acknowledge the creation of what is effectively a new state.
 Some are responding with a Serbian tradition: black humor. In Belgrade, people say that in the 1990's, the nationalist slogan was Serbia do Tokija, or Serbia to Tokyo. These days, they say, it is more accurate to say Serbia kao Nokia, or Serbia like Nokia. Just like the Finnish cellphones, Serbia comes in a newer and smaller model every year.

HEADLINE: Against Sweatshops: The Students' Case

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Sweatshops do not simply provide jobs; they violate notions of reasonable working conditions.
This is why student activists have tried a variety of tactics to inform the public while simultaneously demanding changes worldwide in factories with inhumane conditions or labor violations. 
 Student organizers understand that the competition among poor countries is a race to the bottom for the poorest people.
 A humane approach must begin with workplace democracy (collective bargaining), recognition of the right to earn a living wage, and international agreement about the differences between a sweatshop and a factory.

HEADLINE: Spanish Companies Flex Their Acquisition Muscle 

BYLINE: By Heather Timmons and Renwick McLean

 BODY:
WITH a hot real estate market and a growing generation of internationally seasoned managers, Spanish corporations are shopping for companies in Europe and the United States, outmaneuvering many of their neighbors in Germany, France and Britain. 
 The 16 billion euro ($20.5 billion) takeover of the British airport company BAA by Grupo Ferrovial, announced Tuesday, is the latest in a string of large purchases by Spanish companies looking beyond their border. Next, analysts and deal makers say, could be more acquisitions in banking, as well as in construction and airport companies.
Considered Europe's sleepy corporate citizens until recently, Spanish companies completed deals worth $64.9 billion outside their own borders in 2005, up 69 percent from the year before. Already this year, they have made $61.4 billion worth of deals outside the country, according to data from Thomson Financial. Because of the deals, Spanish companies are becoming global leaders in some industries, even as protectionist barriers are going up across Europe. Abertis Infraestructuras of Barcelona struck a deal in April to buy Autostrade of Italy for $14.8 billion; the combination, if cleared by the Italian government, would create the world's largest toll road operator. 
 Telefonica became Europe's second-largest telecommunications company behind Vodafone last year, after it acquired the British mobile phone company O2 for $31.5 billion in October. 
 Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte struck a deal to lease a United States toll road in Indiana. The move helped unleash plans for billions of dollars in privatizations of highways, marinas and public garages around the United States. Many of those deals are expected to go to Spain's infrastructure companies, including Cintra. 
 ''Traditionally Spanish companies have invested in Latin America, because it was the natural market for language and cultural reasons,'' said Javier Garcia de Enterria, a partner with the Madrid office of the law firm of Clifford Chance. In part because of increasing instability there, they are turning instead to the European market, and in some cases even looking to the United States, he said. 
 The long tradition of Latin American investment is actually helping Spanish companies as they look elsewhere for deals. 
 ''Many of these companies have invested in Latin America in the last decade, and that has allowed these companies to grow in size and to develop the structures of multinational companies,'' said Alejandra Kindelan, the chief economist of Grupo Santander. ''They know how to deal with different markets and countries,'' she said, and ''now they can look beyond emerging markets to more mature markets.'' 
 Spanish expansion in the United States has traditionally been limited to Hispanic markets, but that is rapidly changing. In addition to Spanish companies bidding on toll road projects and highway building in the United States, the bank BBVA is on the hunt for what many expect to be a large transaction. 
 ''As the United States gets more comfortable with the idea, you will see more and more'' Spanish companies winning deals, said Luis J. Perez, a partner with the law firm of Hogan & Hartson in Miami. 
 Ms. Kindelan and other economists say that an important factor in Spanish companies' appetite for foreign expansion has been the adoption of the euro, which has kept interest rates low and allowed Spanish companies to borrow money much more cheaply than in the past. 
 The Spanish economy has been the ''single biggest beneficiary'' of European monetary policy, said Holger Schmieding, Bank of America's chief economist in London. The European Union's harmonization fund, which gave money to poorer nations, also provided a lift, as did European Union financing of roads and airports. 
 In addition, Spanish companies can hire and fire temporary workers without major restrictions, Mr. Schmieding said. That means they can downsize or can grow quickly, unlike their rivals in France or Germany. The country illustrates how ''even partial labor market reforms can pay good benefits,'' he said. 
 Still, it is not clear whether Spanish companies still need the help of their European peers or are really able to outperform them. 
 Expansion in Europe through mergers and acquisitions is ''a necessary step toward further expansion in the United States, Canada, or Asia,'' Mauro F. Guillen, a professor in international management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, writes in his book ''The Rise of Spanish Multinationals'' published last year. 
 ''Without the skills and managerial personnel of their European counterparts, it is likely that Spanish firms will remain strong in the 10 percent of the world represented by Spain and Latin America, and largely absent from the rest,'' he wrote. 
 But so far, some Spanish-led cross-border acquisitions in Europe have been less tricky to navigate than deals coming out of other countries. 
 The Grupo Santander purchase of the British bank Abbey National has had fewer visible culture clashes than comparable acquisitions, like the combination of the German bank HVB and the Italian bank Unicredito, for example. Spanish deal experts say their cross-border integration may be easier because local mangers have a more open approach than their German, Dutch or French counterparts. 
 ''We are used to dealing with foreigners, in part because the service industry is a significant part of our culture,'' said Juan Gich, head of investment banking for Iberia at Lehman Brothers. 
 In addition, a new generation of managers, who have been educated at business schools in London, New York and Paris, bring a confident attitude to cross-border deals. ''They're saying we can conquer Europe, and we can integrate,'' Mr. Gich said.

HEADLINE: Energy Policy Is Far Too Important to Be Left to the Politicians 

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of "Principles of Economics." E-mail: rhf3@cornell.edu

 BODY:
HISTORIANS argue about whether the admonition ''First, do no harm'' actually appeared in the original Hippocratic oath. But no one disputes that it is sound advice, not just for physicians, but also for others entrusted to act on our behalf. Yet many government officials seem almost determined to ignore it. For example, the recent spike in gasoline prices has prompted a wave of proposals that if enacted would do far more harm than good.
 Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, among others, has advocated suspension of the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents a gallon. Similar proposals to suspend state taxes have been advanced in New York and at least 12 other states. These proposals make no economic sense. Tax suspensions promise only illusory relief in the short run and would actually create new financial burdens for consumers in the long run. 
An immediate problem is that a tax cut would be offset in part by OPEC's response to it. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sets its price target with an eye toward what motorists are able to pay. Dealing with OPEC is thus like dealing with a rational kidnapper, whose demands are governed by the ability of the victim's family to pay. A visible transfer of money to the victim's family (like an inheritance) would serve only to increase the kidnapper's ransom demand. Similarly, since OPEC now realizes that motorists are able to pay $3 a gallon, its best response to a gasoline tax cut would be to raise the price of oil by enough to keep gasoline prices at $3.
 A more general problem is that reducing gasoline taxes would promote inefficient consumption patterns. The lost revenues would also require some combination of increasing other taxes, borrowing more money from abroad (which taxpayers would have to repay in full, with interest), and enacting further cuts in valued public services. 
 Gasoline prices are rising because the world's appetite for oil has been outstripping dwindling supplies. Legislatures cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. To escape the burden of widespread energy shortages, we must consume less energy. And to achieve that goal, gasoline prices need to be higher, not lower. 
 The most efficient means to that end is thus precisely the opposite of what Senator Thune proposes. In my Feb. 16 column, I suggested an additional gasoline tax of $2 a gallon. All revenue would go into a common pool, which would then be returned on an approximately equal per capita basis by reducing payroll taxes. 
 Because rebates for individual consumers would be independent of the amount of gasoline tax they paid, the higher post-tax gasoline prices would strongly encourage conservation. This would not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but would also alleviate congestion and pollution. And just as a gasoline tax cut would encourage future OPEC price increases, a tax increase would discourage them. 
 As with all such proposals, the devil is in the details. Because the losers from any policy change cry more loudly than the winners sing, a tax increase would be palatable only if the resulting economic gains were distributed equitably. 
 Readers were quick to identify deficiencies in my proposed payroll tax rebate. It would not help retirees, for example, because they no longer pay this tax. The rebate for retirees could instead take the form of an augmented Social Security payment. (Because retirees typically drive less than workers, this supplement should be smaller than the payroll tax rebate.)
 Businesses could also receive rebates, which could be based on historical patterns of fuel consumption by industry and company size. To promote efficiency, the critical design feature is that the rebate for each business be independent of its current gasoline consumption.
 Would a steep gasoline tax jeopardize automakers like Ford and General Motors, whose current product lines emphasize light trucks and sport utility vehicles? It would shift demand away from such vehicles to more fuel-efficient ones, but automakers could respond by altering their product mix. The transition could be smoothed by announcing a start date well in the future -- say, Jan. 1, 2009 -- and then phasing in the tax gradually, say, by 10-cent monthly increments.
 What about low-income motorists who could not afford to buy new fuel-efficient cars? A gradual phase-in would also provide valuable transition time for these drivers. They could retire their current vehicles within a few years in favor of more recent used models with better fuel economy. Rebates could also be made progressive.
 Another reader's concern was that the new tax might be inflationary. But unlike the gasoline price increases of the 1970's, which sent hundreds of billions of dollars to OPEC, revenues from a tax would remain in the United States. The prices of products whose production or delivery is intensive in gasoline use would rise because of the tax. But even now, the gasoline required to produce these products imposes environmental and foreign policy costs on Americans. To the extent that higher gasoline prices encouraged conservation, they would be offset by lower costs elsewhere.
 An academic economist clearly runs less risk than a politician in proposing higher gasoline taxes. But how much political risk would such a proposal really entail? According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 55 percent of Americans would be willing to support a higher gasoline tax if it reduced dependence on foreign oil. Given that widely reported finding, proposing to suspend gasoline taxes in the midst of pervasive energy shortages will strike no one as bold political leadership. It might strike some as an unconscionable pander.
 It may be naive to expect our current crop of leaders to take affirmative steps to alleviate the energy crisis. But elections are coming. And in the meantime, surely we can demand that politicians do no further harm.

HEADLINE: With Oil's Cash, Venezuelans Consume

BYLINE: By JENS ERIK GOULD

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, June 7 

 BODY:
On a recent Sunday morning here, free-spending customers have emptied Vintage, a trendy upscale bar, of nearly all its best vodka. At the Castellana Chevrolet dealership nearby, buyers wait eight months to get the keys to cars they paid for long ago. 
 And on a recent weekend at the LG Digital Store and at RCA Electronics in the Sambil mall, consumer confidence has helped strip the shelves of television sets and refrigerators.
 ''Even our construction workers are spending their whole paychecks as soon as they get paid,'' said Gerardo Pereira, 33, the owner of Vintage, who says he has never seen Venezuelans of all social classes spend this much. 
 With oil revenue flowing into its coffers, the government is spending like never before on social development programs that free up cash for the poor by providing free education and health care and cheap food. Wage increases and infrastructure projects also fill the economy with money that filters down to Venezuelans' pockets. As a result, consumers are buying more each year, helping Venezuela post growth that exceeded 9 percent last year and in the first quarter of 2006. 
 But economists here and abroad say that such rosy indicators are part of an artificial economic boom that could later hurt the country; the spending spree, they say, is masking the fundamental limitations of an economy propped up by spending, but failing to generate enough new private investment to sustain longer-term growth and job creation.
 Michael Gavin, chief Latin American economist at UBS Warburg in Stamford, Conn., said, ''They're hollowing out the economy and setting Venezuela up for a real setback if oil prices ever return to more historically normal levels.'' 
 President Hugo Chavez, who has shaped much of his domestic economic policy around the funneling of oil revenue into social programs, has tightened his reins on the private sector; he has forced foreign oil companies to change their contracts, expropriated private land considered idle and imposed labor laws.
 Mr. Chavez has been emboldened by a sixfold increase in oil prices since he was elected in 1998. But for many investors, increased government controls and Mr. Chavez's brash moves against private business are clouding the outlook for operating in this country, one of the world's big oil exporters. 
 ''That's very bad and inconvenient,'' Domingo Maza Zavala, a central bank director, said in an interview. ''If this is the vision of our private investors, in a few years the Venezuelan economy will fall into a difficult situation because of productive inefficiency.''
 Mr. Maza says the government is making the same mistakes that Venezuelan governments made in the 1970's and 80's, when spending sprees in times of high oil prices were hard to curb once prices fell, leading to soaring national debt and economic downturns. 
 ''We know the bonanza will come to an end,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, I don't think the government is learning the lessons of the past.''
 Direct foreign investment nearly doubled last year, to $2.9 billion, from $1.5 billion in 2004, as the economy recuperated from a freefall that followed widespread antigovernment strikes in 2002.
 But Venezuela attracted 30 percent less direct foreign investment in 2005 than it did, on an annual average, in the second half of the 1990's, a period when the oil industry opened to multinational companies, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which tracks economic performance. 
 Total private investment rose 3 percent from 2000 to 2004, according to the central bank. Mr. Gavin of UBS Warburg says Venezuela's private-sector performance is weak compared with that in other growing Latin American economies. Mexico, for instance, attracted twice as much private investment in relation to its total output last year than Venezuela did in 2004. The central bank has not published figures for 2005. 
 Mr. Maza told the National Assembly on Wednesday that private investment was now below 15 percent of output, the level he says is needed to maintain a growing economy. ''This is one of the defects of the present growth,'' he said.
 An influx of foreign goods holds back industries from expanding and creating jobs, said Jose Rojas, a former Chavez finance minister who is now an economic consultant. Imports, nearly a third of them from the United States, increased by 28 percent last year, reaching almost $25 billion, the government says.
 Though the economy grew 9 percent in 2005, that growth produced a rise in the number of jobs just under 2 percent, according to the government's National Statistics Institute. 
 Yet public spending was up 40 percent in the first quarter of 2006, to $11 billion, according to the central bank. The planning and development minister, Jorge Giordani, expects the economy to grow as much as 7 percent this year, as the demand for goods has renewed investment in areas like telecommunications and commerce. 
 Middle-class Venezuelans seem happy to go along. ''When I see someone with a new model of clothing, I have to buy it,'' said Judith Quintero, 29, who said she was spending more of her own money since sales at the Confetti children's clothing store she manages went up 40 percent last month. ''My husband tells me I'm spending more than I'm making.''
 Companies are tight-lipped about their reluctance to invest because they do not want to upset the government and they are profiting now from the high consumption levels. Those levels nearly doubled in the first quarter, according to a market research firm, LatinSource.
 ''Businessmen are all very happy because they're making a lot,'' said Oscar Garcia Mendoza, president of Banco Venezolano de Credito. ''But they don't want to invest at all.'' 
 While windfall oil profits have caused building booms in other oil-producing countries like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Garcia noted that he could see no construction cranes as he gazed at a wide view of downtown Caracas from his high-rise office.
 President Chavez, a leftist who has become the Bush administration's most visible antagonist in Latin America, has discouraged much-needed investment by maintaining a strident discourse against capitalism while endorsing Venezuela's transformation to the ''new socialism of the 21st century.'' 
 With the judiciary controlled by the government, many businessmen say they think there is little respect for contracts, according to Antonio Canova of the law firm of Bolinaga Levy Marquez & Canova in Caracas. Investors are also concerned for their personal safety, as frequent crime troubles Venezuelan cities and a recent series of kidnappings and murders have jolted the country.
 Forty percent of industrial companies have closed since Mr. Chavez became president, most soon after he took office early in 1999, and the number of companies doing business has not recovered, the Venezuelan Confederation of Industry says. While the industrial sector foresees 10 percent growth this year, only one-tenth of companies are planning long-term investment like expanding their factories or building new ones, the group says.
 Edmond Saade, president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, adds: ''There are not really established rules and regulations to encourage the private sector. There are more to really control it and make its life more difficult.''
 Mr. Chavez has transferred foreign currency reserves and oil profits to a development fund, which Mr. Maza of the central bank estimates will reach $20 billion by the end of the year. That money finances a flurry of social development programs that are the hallmarks of the president's socialist ''Bolivarian revolution.''
 Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning policy group in Washington, says these programs have helped raise living standards and workers' productivity among the poor. He noted that figures from the National Statistics Institute showed that poverty had fallen 7 percent since Mr. Chavez came to power.
 Mr. Weisbrot disagrees with economists who foretell doom from the consumer-generated boom, saying that 11 percent first-quarter growth in industries other than oil is a more important gauge of the economy than investor confidence.
 For now, at least, Venezuelans are spending like there is no tomorrow. 
 ''People from every social status have money in their pockets,'' Mr. Pereira, the owner of the bar Vintage, said, collecting pricey bottles that patrons left behind half-full. ''So everyone's consuming.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on June 8 about an increase in consumer spending in Venezuela misstated the decrease in the poverty rate since President Hugo Chavez came to power. It declined by 6.3 percentage points, or 14.4 percent -- not by 7 percent.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Voices New Confidence

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: SAMOA, Calif., June 7 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger began his re-election campaign on Wednesday by racing through the state, boasting about budgets and bond issues and expressing confidence that he would defeat the newly minted Democratic contender, Phil Angelides, the state treasurer. 
 Mr. Angelides beat Steve Westly, the state controller and a former eBay executive, on Tuesday with 48 percent of the vote in the primary. In their race, the two spent the better part of their budgets on television advertising to accuse each other of malfeasance and general incompetence.
Mr. Angelides, the more liberal of the two, had the strong support of a majority of unions in the state and its top-ranking Democrats. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose constituents thought so little of him last winter that it seemed anyone with a bank account and a pulse could remove him, ran without serious opposition in the Republican primary and won nearly 90 percent of the vote. He said he was unafraid of the campaign against Mr. Angelides.
 ''I'm only afraid of not being able to do the things that I want to do,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in an interview in a restaurant here on the remote northern coast. ''And I'm not afraid of that, either.'' 
 The governor, looking relaxed, well coiffed and a shade somewhere between sun-kissed and Sunkist, added: ''I don't look at it as a campaign against somebody. I'm looking at it much more a campaign for the State of California.''
 Mr. Angelides, who declared victory early Wednesday in Sacramento, his hometown, said in a telephone interview that he was confident that he could beat Mr. Schwarzenegger. But he acknowledged that it would be an uphill battle.
 ''I've always thought so,'' he said. ''He has the Bush-Cheney team running his re-election, but I believe he has turned his back'' on the people and institutions of the state.
 Mr. Angelides made it clear he would try to link the governor to the unpopular president by drawing parallels to their fiscal policies and supporters.
 Even so, Mr. Angelides's nomination, some political analysts said, could portend poorly for the Democrats in the general election, when he will be forced to attract more centrist voters -- increasingly in the majority -- who may be less than tickled with some of his liberal views. His most notable liberal position has been a promise to raise taxes to pay for schools and other programs. 
 ''Obviously, Phil Angelides was able to rally the Democratic base, which tends to be more liberal and more labor oriented,'' said Mark Baldassare, the director of research at the Public Policy Institute of California. ''Probably Schwarzenegger's people are breathing a sigh of relief that a more centrist Democrat didn't win.''
 Mr. Angelides will also have to face down Mr. Schwarzenegger's inevitable star power, as demonstrated by the scores of people who rushed to the Samoa Cookhouse, logging millionaires and blue-collar workers who took their children out of school, to glimpse the governor.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger has seen his approval numbers jump back into the mid-40's, about even with his disapproval numbers, after months of sagging polls resulting from his costly failed effort last year to take on the teachers' union, among others, in a special election. 
 Normally at events like the one here, a governor, even a popular incumbent, has to compete for attention with the French toast. As Mr. Schwarzenegger worked the room, flashes of digital cameras went off like fireflies, and volunteers stayed after his visit, hoping to have him to sign their California flags. 
 Although his Hollywood career is what helped propel him to Sacramento and keeps his crowds enthusiastic, Mr. Schwarzenegger appears to be recasting himself as the role of cool wonk rather than movie star. Even his shoes are sensible. When asked by a local society reporter whether there would be a ''Terminator 4'' film, he skipped the answer.
 Instead of racing around and presenting himself as the big reformer who will kick around those who do not get on board, the governor is hewing to issues that are easier to sell and reached by consensus with the Legislature. Those include a multibillion-dollar bond deal to repair highways and schools that will be on the ballot in November.
 ''I think that I made mistakes,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in the interview. ''You have to have a bit more patience. Coming from the private sector, not having been involved in government, I wanted to do things as quickly as in the private sector, and that doesn't happen.''
 California voters, worn down by a plethora of special elections, general elections and primaries in the last few years, largely abstained on Tuesday. Fewer than 30 percent of the registered voters turned out, not counting those who voted absentee. 
 In addition to considering a variety of statewide offices, voters turned down two ballot measures. 
 One of them, Proposition 82, was initiated by Rob Reiner, the producer and director. It would have ensured that preschool for all 4-year-olds be paid by increasing the top tax rate on single residents who earn more than $400,000 a year and married couples who earn $800,000. 
 The proposition was rejected by 60 percent of those who voted. A bond initiative to improve libraries was opposed by 53 percent.

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill to Help Spur New Oil Refinery Construction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
The House passed a bill on Wednesday that its Republican sponsors said would streamline the permit process to build the first domestic oil refineries in a generation.
 The vote was largely along party lines, 238 to 179, closely mirroring a vote on the same bill last month, when 237 lawmakers supported it in a procedure that required two-thirds approval for passage. 
 The bill would create a federal coordinator to manage the permit process for a new refinery by bringing together agencies from all levels of government. Another provision would require the president to identify at least three closed military bases as suitable refinery sites, a provision that President Bush supports. 
 For now, the Senate has no comparable bill under consideration.
 Citing the rising demand for oil products and an industry operating at near peak capacity, the bill's proponents said new refineries would create added supplies.
 Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a chief sponsor of the bill, said it was intended ''to show America that we're doing everything possible to alleviate high energy prices.''
 But detractors argued that the measure would have little bearing on gas prices and was largely unnecessary, saying that the energy bill passed last year had suitable provisions for refinery construction. They also said oil company executives have told Congress that adding capacity through expansion makes more economic sense than building new facilities, with its risks of community opposition. Company executives have also testified that environmental laws have not impeded expansion plans. 
 ''Between September 2004 and September 2005, refiners have made 255 percent profit,'' said Representative Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, who was leading the opposition to the bill. ''When you're doing that well, why would you change anything?''
 While the number of domestic refineries has fallen to 148 from 324 since 1981, largely through mergers and consolidation, American oil companies are producing about 17.3 million barrels of the daily demand of 21 million barrels of oil and have plans to add 1.4 million to 2 million barrels a day over the next several years.
 The last time a refinery was built in the United States was 1976.
 Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that sharply higher oil prices have not seriously hurt economic activity in this country or around the world. However, he added, ''Recent data indicate we may finally be experiencing some impact.''

HEADLINE: Alabama Chief Easily Defeats Former Justice

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
In the battle to be the Republican candidate for governor of Alabama, Bob Riley, the incumbent, easily defeated Roy S. Moore, the former Alabama chief justice who drew national attention when he refused a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building's rotunda and was removed from the bench. 
 Alabama's was among the most colorful contests on Tuesday, as voters picked candidates for governor in several primary elections.
On the Democratic side, the contest was nearly as lively: Lucy Baxley, Alabama's lieutenant governor, defeated six other candidates, including Donald Siegelman, a former governor who was, even on Election Day, standing trial on racketeering and bribery charges.
 In Iowa, Chet Culver, the secretary of state, narrowly defeated three other Democrats, including Mike Blouin, the state's former economic director, and Ed Fallon, a state representative from Des Moines. In November, Mr. Culver will face Representative Jim Nussle, a Republican, who had no opposition on Tuesday. Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, decided not to seek re-election after two terms. 
 In South Dakota, Gov. Michael Rounds, who in March signed into law the most restrictive ban on abortion in the nation, was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Jack Billion, a retired surgeon from Sioux Falls, defeated Dennis Wiese, a former president of the South Dakota Farmers Union from Flandreau, for the Democratic nomination. Both had criticized Mr. Rounds for signing the abortion ban.
 In New Mexico, Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and J. R. Damron, a Republican, faced only nominal challenges from write-in candidates.

HEADLINE: Muslim Women Don't See Themselves as Oppressed, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By HELENA ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Muslim women do not think they are conditioned to accept second-class status or view themselves as oppressed, according to a survey released Tuesday by The Gallup Organization.
 According to the poll, conducted in 2005, a strong majority of Muslim women believe they should have the right to vote without influence, work outside the home and serve in the highest levels of government. In more than 8,000 face-to-face interviews conducted in eight predominantly Muslim countries, the survey found that many women in the Muslim world did not see sex issues as a priority because other issues were more pressing. 
When asked what they resented most about their own societies, a majority of Muslim women polled said that a lack of unity among Muslim nations, violent extremism, and political and economic corruption were their main concerns. The hijab, or head scarf, and burqa, the garment covering face and body, seen by some Westerners as tools of oppression, were never mentioned in the women's answers to the open-ended questions, the poll analysts said. 
 Concerning women's rights in general, most Muslim women polled associated sex equality with the West. Seventy-eight percent of Moroccan women, 71 percent of Lebanese women and 48 percent of Saudi women polled linked legal equality with the West. Still, a majority of the respondents did not think adopting Western values would help the Muslim world's political and economic progress. 
 The most frequent response to the question, ''What do you admire least about the West?'' was the general perception of moral decay, promiscuity and pornography that pollsters called the ''Hollywood image'' that is regarded as degrading to women. 
 An overwhelming majority of the women polled in each country cited ''attachment to moral and spiritual values'' as the best aspect of their own societies. In Pakistan, 53 percent of the women polled said attachment to their religious beliefs was their country's most admirable trait. Similarly, in Egypt, 59 percent of the women surveyed cited love of their religion as the best aspect. 
 At 97 percent, Lebanon had the highest percentage of women who said they believed they should be able to make their own voting decisions, followed by Egypt and Morocco at 95 percent. Pakistan was lowest, at 68 percent. 
 The survey, ''What Women Want: Listening to the Voices of Muslim Women,'' is a part of The Gallup World Poll, which plans to survey 95 percent of the earth's population over the next century. 
 Dalia Mogahed, the strategic analyst of Muslim studies at The Gallup World Poll, said the new data provide fresh insight into the Muslim world, where Western perceptions generally cast women as victims. ''Women's empowerment has been identified as a key goal of U.S. policy in the region,'' said Ms. Mogahed, adding that Muslim women's rights have generated a lot of interest without much empirical information on ''what Muslim women want.''
 Ms. Mogahed, who was born in Egypt and wears a Islamic head scarf, rejected the idea that Muslim women had been brainwashed by the dominant male culture, citing as proof the fact that women freely stated that they deserved certain rights. 
 ''In every culture there is a dominant narrative, and in many cases it is constructed by people in power who happen to be men,'' Ms. Mogahed said.

HEADLINE: State Democratic Chairman Finds That His Attack on Faso's Stand Backfires

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Patrick Healy and Karen James contributed reporting from New York City for this article.

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 7 

 BODY:
What started out as a partisan attack on John Faso, the Republican candidate for governor, quickly backfired on Democrats on Wednesday after their chairman suggested that tax cuts might not be a priority for Democrats this year. 
 Herman D. Farrell Jr., the state chairman, called a news conference to make what he called a preview of attacks on the legislative record of Mr. Faso, a former state assemblyman. But when Mr. Farrell was asked if cutting taxes was one of the top three priorities for Democrats, he said the party would focus on creating new jobs in the state instead.
Later in the day, Mr. Farrell issued a clarification and said he misspoke. 
 In his original remarks to reporters on Wednesday morning, Mr. Farrell said, ''Jobs is the most important thing,'' adding, ''If you create jobs, then you get the income. Once you get the income, then you can afford to look at tax cuts.'' 
 A few hours later, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the likely Democratic candidate for governor, was distancing himself from Mr. Farrell's remarks at a campaign stop in Buffalo. And Mr. Spitzer's opponents -- both Democratic and Republican -- issued statements attacking the remarks. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer said that Mr. Farrell was not speaking on behalf the candidate's campaign and that Mr. Spitzer had said it was his ''priority on Day 1'' to lower property taxes. 
 ''I've made it eminently clear that the No. 1 objective is to revive the state economy,'' Mr. Spitzer said in Buffalo, The Associated Press reported. ''We will do that by pursuing multiple strategies, one of which is smart tax cuts relating in particular to property taxes, which have been a burden on homeowners across the state, a burden that is unfair.'' 
 In Mr. Farrell's statement clarifying his position, he said he ''should have expanded my comment to say that making the economy more robust in general is our top priority, and that includes cutting taxes, as well as bringing jobs to New York.''
 Mr. Faso has made tax cuts the centerpiece of his campaign and has already begun repeating that Mr. Spitzer will certainly raise taxes if elected governor. 
 In its attack on Mr. Spitzer, the Faso camp used some of the same terms -- like ''extreme'' and ''out of touch'' -- that Mr. Farrell had used to attack Mr. Faso's position on social issues, like abortion, gay marriage and women's health care. 
 ''By stating that New Yorkers do not need tax cuts, the state Democratic leaders are proving that they are clearly out of touch with New Yorkers but clearly willing to pay back special interests,'' Susan Del Percio, a spokeswoman for Mr. Faso, said in a statement. 
 Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat seeking to challenge Mr. Spitzer in the September primary, later joined the attack on Mr. Farrell, saying that both he and Mr. Spitzer were part of the ''Albany insider all-star team.'' 
 ''Now we really know -- Eliot Spitzer and the status-quo Democrats in Albany just don't care that your property taxes are the highest in the nation,'' Mr. Suozzi said in a statement. ''They are strangling our economic growth and killing jobs, and that they are driving people to leave our state in droves.''
 Mr. Suozzi also bristled at Mr. Farrell's suggestion that he should drop out of the race, saying he is ''running against what each of those individuals represents.'' 
 While the Republicans have united around their candidate for governor, no such Republican unity exists in the race for senator. 
 Kathleen Troia McFarland, who is seeking to challenge Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton this fall, rebuffed the Republican state chairman, Stephen J. Minarik III, who had asked her to drop out of the race. Mr. Minarik supports her rival, John Spencer, who beat Ms. McFarland by 27 percentage points in the delegate vote at the party convention last week.
 Mr. Minarik, who dislikes contested Republican primaries, successfully nudged William F. Weld out of the governor's race on Tuesday to clear the way for Mr. Faso, the party's designated candidate.
 In a phone call to Ms. McFarland, Mr. Minarik asked her to follow suit, in the name of party unity.
 While the chairman and Mr. Weld were allies, Ms. McFarland has no such ties to Mr. Minarik, and she said it was easy to say no.
 ''I looked my supporters in the eye and told them I was staying in this race, and I'm not going to go back on my word,'' Ms. McFarland said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Visit to U.S. Isn't a First for Chile's First Female President 

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, June 7 

 BODY:
Michelle Bachelet has lived in the United States twice, first as a child and then as a single mother studying military affairs at the Inter-American Defense Board in Washington. On Thursday, she will return to the capital, but this time on her first official visit as president of Chile.
 Elected with a comfortable majority in January, Ms. Bachelet, 54, is her country's first female president, a pediatrician and, like her predecessor Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist. But at a time when Washington's relations with paladins of the Latin American left like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia are increasingly contentious, trade and political ties between the United States and Chile are cordial and growing stronger.
 ''We share fundamental values and principles about democratic development with an open economy, and a respect for human rights,'' she said during an hourlong interview Tuesday at the presidential palace here. ''Because we have a fluid and frank friendship, there is room for both agreement and divergences.'' 
 In recent years, Chile has tried to steer a course between the anti-American populist left and Washington's muscular conservatism. Ms. Bachelet, a former political prisoner who was defense minister before running for president, has continued that policy, and describes herself as an advocate of tolerance and pluralism.
 ''Latin America has common challenges and problems, poverty, discrimination and exclusion among them, and the real threat is that of social explosions that affect democracy,'' she said. ''But countries and their realities are different, so you are going to find leaders who may have the same objectives but who have completely different solutions.''
 Chile, she said, has chosen ''to be integrated in a world that has an open economy,'' and has benefited from a free-trade agreement with the United States whose timetable she would like to accelerate. There may be a cloud on the horizon, however.
 Latin America must soon choose a new representative to the United Nations Security Council, and both Venezuela, Washington's bete noire, and Guatemala are contending for the seat. According to news media reports here, discounted by American officials, the Bush administration has given Chile an ''ultimatum'' to vote for Guatemala if it does not want relations to suffer.
 ''I have not felt pressured'' by Washington, Ms. Bachelet said, adding that she did not favor a third, compromise candidate, as has been suggested here.
 President Bush, who visited here in November 2004, and Wall Street have praised Chile and its embrace of free trade and market capitalism as a model for other Latin American countries. But Ms. Bachelet indicated a certain discomfort with Chile being designated ''the prize pupil in the class,'' as she put it.
 ''I don't want to go back to concepts related to the cold war, in which here is the group of the good guys, here the less good, here the so-so and here the bad guys,'' she said. ''The logic of the market does not resolve all problems,'' she added, ''and as I see it, you need strong and powerful social policies by the state to resolve the problems of income and equality of opportunity.''
 Mr. Bush has also been a booster of Chile's privatized social security system, which he has suggested as a model for the overhaul he has advocated in the United States. But dissatisfaction with pensions is growing here, and during the recent presidential campaign, Ms. Bachelet, also a former health minister, promised major changes.
 ''There are a whole series of problems, strongly linked to a system that had certain presuppositions that haven't come true,'' she said. ''People retire and find that they are entitled to a pension that is between 30 and 50 percent of their wages, and not the 70 percent or more that they were promised.''
 The system particularly discriminates against women, she said, because ''even when we earn the same and accumulate the same savings, we have a smaller pension,'' since women live longer. Seasonal workers, the self-employed and employees who move from job to job have also suffered, she said, which led her to order an increase in the government pension for the poorest when she took office in March.
 In addition to her official agenda, Ms. Bachelet will take part in events in Washington that reflect curiosity and pride in her status as Chile's first female president. Thursday night she is scheduled to be honored at a dinner sponsored by women in politics, which Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is also scheduled to attend.
 Ms. Bachelet also plans to visit the middle school she attended while living in Bethesda, Md., in 1962 and 1963, when her father was a military attache at the Chilean Embassy in Washington. That was the first time she had been outside Chile, and the exposure to American society helped mold her intellectually, she said.
 ''It was a lovely experience, because I found a society with a democratic history, a rich diversity of thought, and which offered opportunities to its citizens,'' she said. ''The idea of the melting pot was the biggest novelty to me, and I would say that all of that allowed me to acquire a political and cultural foundation that has been quite positive to my political performance.''
 But from the moment that Salvador Allende, the first Socialist to govern Chile and also a physician, was elected in 1970, the United States conspired with the military here to overthrow him. That resulted in the 1973 coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power, and to the jailing and death of Ms. Bachelet's father, by then an air force general loyal to Mr. Allende. She and her mother were forced into exile, first in Australia and then in East Germany.
 ''There is no rancor,'' she said when asked about the episode. ''Since I had lived in the United States, I knew how to differentiate between people and policies.''
 In recent days, she has been tested by high school students, who have taken to the streets here to demand more spending on education and less on the military. Ms. Bachelet said she viewed peaceful protest as part of the give-and-take of a flourishing democracy.
 ''Chileans are saying, 'This is a country that has done well, but we demand more,' and that is natural,'' she said. ''There are demands, which are legitimate, and I have made a decision as to what the reforms will be to improve the quality of instruction.''
 Concern for the well-being of the poorest Chileans is part of her manifesto as a Socialist in the 21st century, Ms. Bachelet said. 
 ''We believe strongly in a democracy that has a strong social tint, with social justice and solidarity,'' she said. ''The state is important, but I also aspire to a warmer, more human society in which people help each other and struggle against all forms of inequality.''

HEADLINE: El Perro

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:

Opens today in Manhattan
Directed by Carlos Sorin
In Spanish, with English subtitles
Not rated; 96 minutes
 ''El Perro'' is a lovely, rugged neo-realist fable from Argentina about a man and a dog. The man, an unemployed, possibly illiterate mechanic named Juan Villegas (played by a nonprofessional actor of the same name) is a fairly ordinary fellow. But the dog is another story. A purebred Argentine Dogo with pedigree papers and a noble demeanor, he is naturally charismatic. More than that, he seems to possess the power -- serendipitous if not quite supernatural -- to influence human destiny, or Juan's at any rate. 
At 52, Juan has been cast adrift by economic hard times. Recently laid off after 20 years at a roadside service station, he tries to earn a living by selling handmade knives, which are more often admired than purchased. Despite his shy, anxious smile and unfailingly courteous manner, he looks like a man on the brink of despair, his prospects as flat and bleak as the Patagonian landscape where the film, flawlessly directed by Carlos Sorin, takes place. As soon as Juan acquires the dog -- a token of gratitude for fixing the fanbelt on a Mercedes -- his luck starts to change. The animal, whose papers identify him as Bombon but who Juan calls Lechien, attracts attention wherever he goes, and before long Juan is pulled into a hectic and unfamiliar new world of breeders, trainers and dog shows.
 He is half-seduced by dreams of glory, but the film's real concern is dignity. Juan is as modest a hero as you are likely to encounter on a movie screen, and neither he nor Mr. Sorin -- or, for that matter, Lechien -- have especially grandiose aspirations. That ''El Perro'' is so unassuming is part of what makes its humane, sympathetic story so satisfying. A. O. SCOTT

HEADLINE: Where Cutout Images Created Cutting Commentary 

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
A smiling engineer holds the lever of a formidable machine, bristling with wheels and sprockets, in a photomontage that appears to symbolize the blessings of industrial power. Artfully deployed across the white space behind the machine are the German words ''Tempo Tempo, Fortschritt, Kultur'' (''Tempo Tempo, Progress, Culture''), the whole somewhat satirically saluting the engineer as a Utopian wunderkind capable of rebuilding society in the wake of World War I.
 The photomontage was made in 1927 by Marianne Brandt (1893-1983), then an associate at the Bauhaus, the progressive German design school founded in 1919 and wiped out by the Nazis in 1933. Ms. Brandt's forte was really metal work. (Her small silver and ebony teapot of 1924 has become a classic of Modernist design.) But with a strong graphic talent and a lively imagination, she also turned out a group of intricate photomontages. Perhaps because they dealt with her feeling consistently trumped by men, she kept these to herself until the 1960's. 
 Ms. Brandt produced some 45 photomontages, working from the mid-1920's into the early 30's. She was inspired by the photograms and photomontages of her teacher at the Bauhaus, the Hungarian artist, photographer and designer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and also perhaps by her more famous contemporary, the Dadaist Hannah Hoch. 
 Most of these fantastical creations, commenting on mores, society, industrialization and new roles for women, had previously never been shown publicly. Now 30 of them, selected by a guest curator, Elizabeth Otto, assistant professor of art history at the State University of New York at Buffalo, are on view at the International Center of Photography. The show was organized for the Bauhaus Archives of Berlin, where it first appeared.
 Scissoring images from the popular press of the Weimar era, Ms. Brandt cleverly juxtaposed them in striking arrangements, so that as a whole, each image takes on allegorical significance beyond its individual reality. Her first photomontages, however, ''Montage I'' and ''Montage II'' (1924), were totally abstract: stark compositions that divide the paper into two triangles, one black, one white. A simple photogram -- derived from metal rings and circles -- is imposed on each sheet. 
 The results very much resemble the work of Mr. Moholy-Nagy. His art so impressed Ms. Brandt, who was solidly trained in figurative art, that a year earlier she had burned all her paintings. Afterward, her only figurative work occurred in her photomontages.
 Unlike the sharply political satires produced by Ms. Hoch and John Heartfield, also a Dadaist, Ms. Brandt's works didn't deal specifically with the evils of Fascism and capitalism. Her compositions were more allegorical and diffuse; sometimes lighthearted and personal, sometimes meditative and philosophical. One of the catchiest is ''Parisian Impressions'' (1926), which melds scenes of the city in a colorful paper caper set in Paris, in which women play a liberated role.
 Topped by a scantily clad showgirl who wears a gilded starburst and stands on a star floor cut out of gilt with breastlike points, the tour winds its way past a clown's head, a diva posing coyly in a flamboyant gown, a sculptured female Egyptian head topped by a bowler, a pair of shapely women's legs poked at by a portly bon vivant and an aerial view of the Eiffel Tower. It ends with the face of the young American singer and dancer Josephine Baker, then the toast of Paris; the head of the actor Adolphe Menjou embraced by a bare-breasted showgirl; and smaller images, including a woman driving a fancy car and another wheeling a baby carriage. Her idea, presumably, was to present Paris as a city where women were more mobile and better off because of their greater freedom.
 In ''With All Ten Fingers'' (1930), Ms. Brandt took a very different tack. This two-person composition shows a woman at the bottom of the paper, on her knees in a pleading posture, her fingers tied, puppetlike, to strings manipulated by a conservatively dressed businessman at the top of the page. A huge blank space, filled only by the strings, lies between them.
 Probably inspired by the economic decline of the Weimar Republic in its last years, in which many white-collar workers, female and male, lost their livelihood, the work reflects Ms. Brandt's own situation. The metal factory where she worked as head of design was a far cry from the aesthetically conscious Bauhaus; it was turning out kitsch despite her own efforts to raise the product level. Unable to quit because her salary supported not only her but also her family and friends, she saw herself as the victim of circumstances created by distant men, like the recalcitrant head of her factory who refused to accept her ideas.
 In other works, Ms. Brandt brooded more philosophically on the fate of humankind, plagued by cycles of war and unrest for which there seemed no lasting solution. An untitled composition of 1930, also brilliantly simple in its design, shows two soldiers, a larger figure, a giant warplane and a military cemetery. The plane, the famous 12-motored trans-Atlantic passenger carrier known as the Do-X, is presented as a military menace looming over the three men. One, a soldier shown in silhouette, has one foot in the cemetery -- rows of crosses placed at a diagonal in the picture -- as he gesticulates frantically for help.
 The second soldier, dressed in a uniform more of the past, a skull and crossbones on his sleeve, grovels in the cemetery's snowy ground. The largest figure, not in uniform but holding what appears to be an explosive weapon, squints fanatically at a target outside the picture's frame, the cemetery at his back.
 The emptiness of the work, with its suggestions of hopelessly isolated soldiers whose purposeless death is near, might be interpreted as a critique of the enthusiasts in 1920's Germany calling for renewed military adventures.
 It reflects Ms. Brandt's skill at putting images together to provocative effect, which can now be appreciated by a wider audience.

HEADLINE: White House Raises '06 Growth Estimate

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
The White House increased its estimate of economic growth in 2006 but offered a more pessimistic view of inflation in new forecasts released on Thursday. 
 The Bush administration lifted its forecast for gross domestic product to 3.6 percent, up from 3.4 percent in its projection released in December.
The midyear outlook also showed a higher pace of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index expected to rise by 3 percent, an increase from the previous forecast of 2.4 percent.
 The White House forecast an unemployment rate averaging 4.7 percent this year, lower than the 5.0 percent rate estimated late last year. The administration said payroll growth should average 156,000 a month in 2006.
 The United States economy surged at a 5.3 percent annual pace in the first three months of this year, the fastest pace in two and a half years. But some signs have emerged that the economy may be shifting to a slower pace of growth. At the same time, economists have become more concerned about inflation. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said a rise in underlying inflation was a cause for concern. That warning rattled American financial markets.
 The White House forecasts on Thursday were close to those of private economists in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey.
 A Blue Chip poll in early May projected gross domestic product growth in 2006 of 3.4 percent, a slight slowdown from the 2005 pace of 3.5 percent. The Blue Chip poll pegged inflation at 3.1 percent in 2006, versus 3.4 percent in 2005.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall Sharply Early, but Finish With Some Gains

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Braking a steep slide in global equity markets, American stocks retraced their losses yesterday, recovering to finish roughly where they began. 
 But the question now facing investors is whether this upward swing will continue. Yesterday marked the first trading day since last Thursday that stocks did not decline, and the Dow Jones industrial average remains below the 11,000 barrier. It closed at 10,938.82, a gain of 7.92 points, or 0.07 percent. Yet at midday the index had been off nearly 200 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished with a gain of 0.14 percent, closing at 1,257.93, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 0.3 percent for the day to close at 2,145.32; both were down sharply at midday. 
 '' 'Was this the bottom?' will be the question that haunts us for the next few days,'' said Bill Groeneveld, head trader at vFinance Investments. ''I don't think anyone will be coming out of the gate saying, 'Wow, this was a nice turnaround.' '' For the week, the Dow is still off. 
 American investors have been in an edgy mood since Monday, when Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, signaled that the central bank would continue to fight inflation with higher interest rates. 
 Markets in Europe and Asia were rattled by similar concerns yesterday as central banks there raised interest rates. An unexpected interest-rate increase by the central bank in South Korea contributed to the Asian declines. In Europe, a quarter-point increase in the European Central Bank's benchmark short-term interest rate, though widely expected, nonetheless pushed Continental markets lower. Denmark, South Africa and India also raised rates, though the Bank of England announced that it was leaving its rates unchanged.
 The Fed's rate-setting committee will next meet on June 28 and 29.
 Investors around the world have been preoccupied lately with the prospect of rising interest rates and the threat of inflation at a time when economic growth is showing signs of slowing, especially in the United States. 
 ''These things are sort of feeding off each other, and at the moment they're not playing out in a favorable way,'' at least for stocks, said Mark Cliffe, global head of financial markets research at ING. ''It's sort of taking on a bit of a dynamic of its own, which is sort of what makes it so dangerous.''
 When stocks were posting some of their heaviest declines earlier in the day, the New York Stock Exchange imposed its trading collars, which help stabilize trading by temporarily halting the sale of some stocks.
 Oil prices fell and the dollar gained yesterday, touched off by reports that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a major terrorist figure in Iraq, had been killed. The benchmark contract for crude oil to be delivered next month fell 47 cents, to $70.35 a barrel; tensions over Iran's nuclear program had driven the price up to $72.60 a barrel as recently as Monday.
 Still, the yield on 10-year Treasuries, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell slightly, to 4.996 percent, a sign that investors think inflation could ease in the coming months. The price rose 6/32, to 101.
 ''The fact that bond prices are going up is actually a vote of confidence in the Fed that they'll get it right,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. ''And in the long term, that will be good for stocks. That will mean that interest rates will stop going up. And that will help sustain economic expansion, not weaken it.''
 A more long-term risk to the economy, analysts said, is if the Fed raises interest rates too high as the economy is slowing down. ''This is where policy makers have to act very carefully,'' Mr. Cliffe said. ''A misstep could lead to an exaggerated reaction in the markets, which in turn could have real-world consequences, particularly if stock markets continue to fall.''
 Yesterday's global declines appear to result in part from investors tending to be less willing to tolerate the high levels of risk that they have accepted in recent years. 
 ''We're seeing a reversal of a multiyear trend of increasing risk in portfolios,'' said Markus Krygier, chief currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. ''You have a lot of investors realizing that they have a lot of risk in their portfolios, and they're scaling back.''
 Major stock indexes in France, Germany and Britain and smaller markets throughout Europe posted losses of 2.5 percent or more yesterday.

HEADLINE: Inventories at Wholesalers Rose More Than Expected in April

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers rose a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent in April as automotive stocks increased the most in 10 months and inventories of machinery and metals rose sharply, a government report showed on Thursday. 
 The Commerce Department said the rise in inventories was outpaced by a 1.3 percent rise in wholesale sales in April. That took the inventories-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how quickly stocks would be depleted at the current sales pace -- down to 1.16 months, matching a record low hit in January.
Economists had forecast that inventories would rise 0.5 percent after March's previously reported 0.2 percent increase. The Commerce Department revised the March inventory gain upward to a 0.6 percent increase, while the March wholesale sales gain was revised up to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent.
 Stocks of durable goods, items meant to last at least three years, rose 1.2 percent in April after a gain o of 0.5 percent in March.
 Automotive inventories rose 2.8 percent in April, their largest monthly increase since June 2005, while automotive sales fell 0.1 percent, pushing the automotive inventories-to-sales ratio to 1.44, its highest since reaching the same level in January 2005.
 Machinery inventories rose 1.1 percent, metals stocks rose 2.4 percent and lumber rose 1.8 percent.
 Inventories of nondurable goods rose 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent increase in March.
 A Labor Department report yesterday said the number of workers claiming an initial week of jobless aid fell by a greater-than-expected 35,000 last week to the lowest level in two months. 
 First-time claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell to 302,000 in the week ended June 3 from an upwardly revised 337,000 claims the previous week. 
 Wall Street economists had forecast a smaller drop in initial claims, to 325,000 from an initially reported 336,000.

PERSON: Thomas S. Johnson

HEADLINE: A Job Downtown for a Banker With a Broken Heart

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
IF gray hair, like guilt, can be a byproduct of association, then Margaret Lester, the capable assistant to Thomas S. Johnson, the retired GreenPoint bank chairman who lost a son on Sept. 11 and who serves as chairman of the executive committee of the beleaguered World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, can blame the boss for hers. And does. 
 ''Exciting but complicated,'' she says, leading the way down an art-lined hallway to Mr. Johnson's office at 90 Park Avenue. Although GreenPoint, which he ran from 1993 to 2004, has since been subsumed by North Fork, which in turn is being taken over by Capital One, Mr. Johnson retains this plush, hushed space as a courtesy for his past service to the bank and continuing philanthropic responsibilities toward the place he calls ''the pit.'' He attends more fraught meetings now than he did as chief executive of GreenPoint, a job he took after being second in command at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, where a 1991 merger with Chemical Bank rendered Mr. Johnson, a Harvard Business School graduate, unemployed for the first time since he was 12 and trudged a paper route in Racine, Wis. 
''One thing I learned,'' he says wryly, ''is that when mergers occur, it's better to be the No. 1 guy than the No. 2.'' A painted rock in the lineup of knickknacks on his desk bears this reminder: ''If you are not the lead dog the view never changes.''
 May was a chaotic month for Mr. Johnson, 65. He will soon relinquish his spot on the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and may or may not replace John C. Whitehead as chairman of the foundation, which announced on May 8 that it was suspending memorial fund-raising until state and city officials settled on a viable building plan, learned on May 10 that Mr. Whitehead would step down, and on May 26 accepted the resignation of its president, Gretchen Dykstra. About leaving the development corporation, he says it became ''a conflict'' with his work at the foundation.
 To say that the foundation, which early in May released a highly unpopular memorandum estimating the cost of the memorial and memorial museum at $672 million with additional infrastructure costs of $300 million, finds itself in flux is an understatement. 
 ''We never said this was actually going to be a billion-dollar project,'' Mr. Johnson maintains.
 TO say that Mr. Johnson cannot find common ground with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who chastised the foundation for not sticking to fund-raising, and Gov. George E. Pataki, whose office released a like-minded rebuke, is an overstatement. He hopes they can agree to disagree on the fund-raising snag: the foundation has gathered $130 million in pledges, of which a donation in the $1 million to $5 million range will come from his own pocket, with a mandate to raise $300 million. To become Mr. Whitehead's designated successor, Mr. Johnson needs their nod.
 ''I'm a big Bloomberg fan,'' he says, sitting in a wing chair near the signature accent piece in his memento-filled domain, a not-quite-to-scale model of the Empire State Building that his wife found at a flea market and lugged home because she knew he would love it. ''I even wore a Democrats for Bloomberg button. Moratorium is too strong a word for the fund-raising situation, but you can't go out and talk to donors when you can't look them straight in the eye and tell them what's going to be built and when it's going to be built and who's going to pay the last dollar.'' 
 Resolution is, he says, on the way.
 He agrees with commissioning Frank J. Sciame, a downtown builder, to lead a review process that by June 15 is to introduce cost-cutting changes to ensure the return of a $500 million memorial and memorial museum budget. But he does not believe the foundation's role can or should be confined to fund-raising.
 ''Since this foundation is charged with raising the money for, building, owning, and operating the memorial, we feel that for us to do the responsible thing, we need to act like an owner,'' he says. 
 The museum's opening date is set to be Sept. 11, 2009.
 ''There comes a time in any big project when people have to make the ultimate trade-offs and get on with it, and I think we're there. Believe it or not, we are virtually on the schedule that was set maybe three years ago; we're supposed to begin building in the spring of '06, and guess what, we're right there.'' 
 Almost. But Mr. Johnson insists he is dedicated to, not frustrated by, the process: ''I cry every day, but not because of this project. I cry because of my son being gone. The work I've devoted to this is, for me, therapeutic. I'm glad I was 61 and still working, going 100 miles per hour, when this happened, rather than 71 and retired with nowhere to go. I think it would have killed me.''
 Mr. Johnson's middle child, Scott, who graduated, like his father, from Trinity College but proclaimed he'd never wear a suit or work in a bank, was 26 and working as a bank stock analyst for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in the south tower on Sept. 11. ''My son called me and told me not to worry, that the plane had crashed into the other tower. I turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane hit,'' he says, his eyes reddening. 
 ''I believe a commercial rebirth downtown is not only acceptable but necessary to honor those who were killed. But the neighborhood will never be fully repaired until that pit is covered over -- in a respectful and dignified way.''

HEADLINE: Plenty of Enemies to Go

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The killing in Iraq of the archterrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is important -- both for Iraq and for the U.S. political debate about Iraq.
 It is important for Iraq for a few reasons. First, Zarqawi was finally tracked down because someone in his organization or in the Sunni community in Iraq turned against him. We need more of that, because Iraq will only work if more Sunnis turn against the terrorists and join the government. Second, Al Qaeda can talk all it wants about replacing Zarqawi, but he is not so easily replaced, because he was a world-class, first-team all-star terrorist. For three years he terrorized Iraq, while eluding the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and C.I.A. Bad guys like him don't grow on trees. But his death will be a turning point only if it leads more Iraqis to come together into a coherent government and army. Ultimately, that is all that matters.
Zarqawi's death, though, also interests me in terms of U.S. politics. Recent polls show that not only are the Democrats more trusted to manage key domestic issues -- from health care to the budget -- but they have pulled even with Republicans on national security, a traditional Democratic Party weakness. If I were the Democrats, though, I wouldn't get too comfortable. 
 What the polls show is largely the result of President Bush's incompetent performance in Iraq, rather than the emergence of a convincing Democratic national security message or group of candidates respected on defense. When it comes to national security, I've always felt that voters don't listen through their ears. They listen through their gut. They vote based on a visceral sense of whether a candidate understands we have real enemies and is ready to confront them. 
 What Zarqawi and the recently arrested group of terrorists in Canada remind us of is that, whatever you think about the Iraq war, open societies today are threatened by these utterly ruthless jihadists. Many Americans feel that. If Democrats want to really seize control of the national security issue, they must persuade the country -- in its gut -- that they have a convincing post-Iraq strategy to rally the world against these Islamo-totalitarians.
 Precisely how is the subject of two insightful, provocative new books. One is ''The Good Fight: Why Liberals -- and Only Liberals -- Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again,'' by Peter Beinart, editor at large of The New Republic. The other is "With All Our Might: A Progressive Strategy for Defeating Jihadism and Defending Liberty,'' essays edited by Will Marshall, who heads the Progressive Policy Institute.
 ''Democrats should be full-throated in their critique of Bush,'' Mr. Beinart said in an interview. ''He has done terrible things. But Democrats are involved in a two-sided struggle: one is against Bush, and one is against Islamic totalitarianism. They are two separate things. You have to have an answer to that second problem.''
 Harry Truman's great achievement, argued Mr. Beinart, was persuading his party and the country ''that anti-Communism was a liberal principle, not just a conservative one, and that Democrats had their own strategy to deal with it -- a strategy that included powerful international institutions like NATO, which made American power legitimate abroad, and civil rights, which made America a better country at home.''
 Democrats need to do the same today. That means, he said, building institutions that can intervene in failed states, offering their own strategies for confronting the jihadists, and dealing honestly and decently with prisoners in this murky war. 
 ''Some Democrats want to believe that the only reason we lost the last election is because the other side plays dirty and we don't,'' Mr. Beinart said. ''But that's not the only reason we lost.''
 Going into 2008, added Mr. Marshall, when Mr. Bush will not be on the ballot, Democrats need to convey to voters ''that they viscerally understand that liberty is in danger'' when groups of people around the world think they can kill anyone at any time. ''There has been real denial about that among some Democrats,'' he said, ''and a tendency to focus only on what we've done wrong.''
 Democrats can be credible on this issue. Democrats understand ''that the president has squandered our assets in fighting an overly militarized war on terror,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''We understand that allies matter and that power should be exercised through institutions that legitimate our power and help others work with us. And we understand that America's economic might and our status as an open and prosperous society has enormous magnetic appeal to people.''

 BODY:
COSTS are rising everywhere for American corporations, from energy to employee health insurance premiums. Yet in their drive to cut expenses, most notably by moving factories and call centers to other countries, they are overlooking the escalating cost of the executive suite. It's time to apply market logic to this disturbing trend and begin outsourcing chief executives. This measure would unlock tremendous value for shareholders. 
 So far, outsourcing manufacturing and services has led to higher chief executive compensation, at the expense of shareholder profit. For example, I.B.M.'s chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, who has been moving jobs to India, last year saw his total compensation rise 19 percent to $18.9 million -- even as the total return for his company's stock fell 16 percent. 
 That's proof that globalization hasn't gone far enough. China, India and other emerging markets offer shareholders a virtually unlimited talent pool from which to draw chief executives. With an increased supply of candidates, a truly independent corporate compensation committee would be easily able to hire superior leaders at salaries and benefits that are a small fraction of what their American counterparts in those fancy corner offices demand. 
 Several orders of magnitude separate the compensation of American and overseas chief executives; the Federal Reserve notes that while a typical American chief executive in 2004 got a compensation package 170 times greater than that of the average American workers, in Britain it was 22 times and in Japan 11. 
 But there are several benefits beyond the immediate savings. Major American corporations have been shifting their factories and labor force to China and India for some time now. It would make sense for the chief executive of an American corporation to come from, and be based in, those areas of the world where the potential for market growth is the greatest. It would be reassuring to have a chief executive who understood the local business practices, the country's cultural underpinnings and the language. 
 Also, given the importance placed on performing well in science and math in countries like China and India, it would be more likely that an offshored chief executive would have had a rigorous technical education instead of degrees in the ''softer'' management disciplines that are common at American business schools. Critics may question whether it is wise for an American company to have its chief executive in Bangalore or Beijing. But this is the thinking of a bygone era. More and more corporate chiefs say that they do not want their companies to be seen as American anymore. Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, has declared, ''What we're trying to do is outline an entire strategy of becoming a Chinese company.'' 
 Indeed, considering how the United States is perceived by the world these days, this is just smart marketing. And installing a foreigner from a developing country as chief executive would be a savvy move.
 Other critics might point out that while a chief executive's compensation package may be eye-popping to the average person, in terms of his company's total market capitalization, it is really quite modest. This is an excuse, not a justification. 
 Current chief executive compensation creates what economists term a perverse incentive. An American chief executive, who is paid an average of $11.3 million annually, gets rewarded enough in one year to exceed the lifetime standard of living of 99.99 percent of the world's population. Even if he's booted from his job because of poor performance, he's set for life. 
 It is far better for shareholders to have chief executives whose compensation packages are based on the long-term performance of the company. Or in plain language, it is better to have a ''hungry'' executive instead of one who stays fat and happy even when the corporate ship capsizes into the troubled waters of bankruptcy. 
 In addition to perverse incentives, the current level of chief executive compensation creates opportunity costs. The money saved by hiring a cheaper executive can be invested in even more offshoring initiatives. A virtuous circle of shareholder profitability can be established. 
 Moreover, this would be a boon for management consultancies that can help companies scour the world for chief executives. McKinsey and Booz Allen, take note, and take outsourcing to its logical conclusion.

HEADLINE: Hatred He Bred Is Sure to Survive Terrorist's Death

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 8 

 BODY:
By finally eliminating Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the American military and its Iraqi allies have killed the man who put a face on the Iraqi insurgency.
 The question now is how large a blow his death deals to the guerrilla movement he drove to such bloody extremes.
The likely answer, according to American and Iraqi officials and experts who have followed Mr. Zarqawi, is this: While his death could erode the ability of his group, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, to carry out suicide and car bomb attacks -- and possibly set off a violent struggle to succeed him -- the insurgency and the sectarian war he helped ignite will go on without him.
 It was Mr. Zarqawi, in a letter obtained by American forces in early 2004, who first called on Sunni insurgents to turn their sights on the Shiites. A ''sectarian war,'' Mr. Zarqawi wrote, was the only way Sunni insurgents could win in Iraq, by provoking a Shiite backlash and a rallying of the millions of Sunnis from outside the country. 
 Much of what Mr. Zarqawi wished has come true. The bloodletting in mixed Sunni-Shiite cities like Baghdad is now unfolding so quickly that it appears to have a life of its own, with hundreds of burned and bullet-riddled bodies turning up each week in the city morgues. And the Sunni insurgency is so diffuse and so broadly based that it seems unlikely to be stopped by the death of its most visible leader.
 ''Zarqawi may be gone, but the conflagration that he set alight continues to burn,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorist expert at the RAND Corporation in Washington. ''That is the reality. He has already set in motion powerful forces that won't necessarily stop just because he is dead.''
 Unlike some terrorist leaders -- like the man he claimed to follow, Osama bin Laden -- Mr. Zarqawi went beyond providing inspiration and public relations for his movement. He fought on the front lines with his men.
 Indeed, American and Iraqi officials say Mr. Zarqawi probably played a central role in planning some of the bloodiest and most spectacular attacks: the suicide bombing of the United Nations headquarters in October 2003; the bombings on the Ashura holiday in March 2004, which killed more than 140 Shiite pilgrims; the destruction of Al Askariya shrine in February, which set off a wave of sectarian killings that has not abated.
 But the precise impact of Mr. Zarqawi's death -- on the insurgency and on Al Qaeda itself -- will not be clear for some time. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a far-flung and decentralized collection of semiautonomous terrorist groups. To date, at least 60 groups have claimed to have carried out attacks against Iraqi and American targets under its banner. 
 Together, these groups acting in Al Qaeda's name are believed to be responsible for a large percentage of the attacks on Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. Mr. Zarqawi was believed to have been the chief facilitator of Al Qaeda's terrorist operations, offering expertise, materiel and a fresh supply of young men ready to offer themselves up for what the group referred to as ''martyrdom operations.''
 The various components of Al Qaeda can probably continue to carry out attacks, if not with the same audacity summoned by Mr. Zarqawi.
 Dozens of other insurgent groups, including some of the largest, like Ansar Al Sunna and the Islamic Army of Iraq, have little or no relationship to Al Qaeda. Indeed, some are deadly rivals. They, too, will carry on.
 What is more, Mr. Zarqawi, a Jordanian, had apparently begun handing over the leadership of his organization to Iraqis, possibly in anticipation of his death. He had also begun to establish what his comrades described as a framework for a future Islamic state in Iraq. 
 In January, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia announced that it had joined the Council of Holy Warriors, seven insurgent groups headed by an Iraqi, Abdullah al-Baghdadi. Most of the senior leaders around Mr. Zarqawi are now believed to be Iraqi; American officers said recently that they had killed 161 members of the organization, many of them foreigners.
 Some experts doubt whether Mr. Baghdadi exists, and whether Mr. Zarqawi ever relinquished day-to-day control of his organization.
 ''Zarqawi was under pressure to hand over power to Iraqis, and like most Arab leaders under pressure to democratize, he created a false parliament,'' said a senior Iraqi intelligence official, speaking of the Council of Holy Warriors. ''He was still in command.''
 Some Iraqi officials say they are expecting a bloody struggle for control of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. 
 ''There is no immediate alterative to Zarqawi,'' the senior Iraqi intelligence official said. ''There will be a vacuum of leadership. His close circle, his organization, will not agree on one of them to succeed him. There is the prospect for division in this group.''
 A similar thing happened among the senior leaders of the Palestinian terrorists clustered around Abu Nidal in the 1980's, when assassinations ignited a violent struggle, according to Mr. Hoffman, the RAND Corporation analyst.
 ''This is the best way to undermine a terrorist group,'' he added. ''Information that sows internal discord and disloyalty has a radiating effect in the organization. That could set in motion the unraveling of Al Qaeda.''
 Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, a spokesman for American forces in Iraq, said the likely successor to Mr. Zarqawi was a person known only by his nom de guerre, Abu al-Masri. Al Masri means ''the Egyptian.'' 
 In a statement posted on a jihadi Web site, a writer claiming to be the deputy emir of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Iraqi, vowed to carry on with ''the same plan that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi drew up.''
 ''We pledge to God to continue raising his way in the Land Between the Rivers, or die,'' the statement said. Mesopotamia means ''the Land Between the Rivers.''
 In recent months, American officials said they had decimated Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. At news conferences, they flashed photo after photo of people who they said were killed or captured leaders. Despite these statements, the organization continued to mount extraordinarily lethal attacks. That suggested that Al Qaeda was rapidly replenishing its ranks; it could do so again.
 In any event, the fruits of Mr. Zarqawi's labors may outlive him. Filled with hatred for Iraq's Shiite majority, whom his group often referred to scornfully as ''converters,'' Mr. Zarqawi killed thousands of them, mostly civilians struck by one of the suicide bombers he dispatched to markets, street corners and police recruiting stations.
 The most spectacular and overtly sectarian attack came on Feb. 22, when bombers destroyed Al Askariya, a golden-domed mosque revered by Shiites. That set off a wave of Shiite-on-Sunni violence -- precisely what Mr. Zarqawi had hoped for -- and a violent backlash by Sunni gunmen.
 On the day of Mr. Zarqawi's death, Iraq stood at the brink of all-out civil war, and no one did more than he did to bring that about. 
 Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser, said he hoped there was still time to slow the slide into sectarian bloodletting.
 ''There is a fracture between the two communities,'' Mr. Rubaie said. ''His work over the last three years has not gone in vain.''

HEADLINE: A Ratings Service Downgrades Ford Debt

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 8 

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term debt of Ford and its financing arm further into junk status on Thursday, citing a ''sparse product pipeline'' and a restructuring plan that it said would be slow to have an effect. 
 The announcement sent Ford's stock to a 52-week low, down 18 cents, or 2.65 percent, to $6.61.
Fitch lowered Ford's default rating to B+ from BB and its senior unsecured debt rating to BB- from BB.
 It also assigned a recovery rating of RR3 to Ford's senior unsecured debt, meaning it calculates that the automaker has a 50 percent to 70 percent chance of recovery if it files for bankruptcy protection.
 Fitch lowered the Ford Motor Credit Company's issuer default rating to B+ from BB and affirmed its senior unsecured debt at BB with a recovery rating of RR2, which indicates recovery prospects of 70 percent to 90 percent. The outlook on all the ratings is negative.
 A Ford spokeswoman, Becky Sanch, said the company was committed to its turnaround plan.

HEADLINE: European Bank Raises Rate but Doesn't Signal Future Moves 

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: MADRID, June 8 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank raised its benchmark interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point, to 2.75 percent, but avoided saying that it would sharply tighten credit to control inflation. 
 Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the central bank, said the bank would continue to increase borrowing costs gradually, a course it began in December as part of a long-expected worldwide trend toward higher rates.
Also on Thursday, central banks in South Africa, India, Denmark and South Korea all increased their interest rates, after Turkey did the same on Wednesday. The United States Federal Reserve, which has recently expressed concerns about inflation, now appears likely to follow suit this month. 
 Major stock indexes fell sharply in Asia and Europe on Thursday, while closing little changed in the United States after plunging earlier in the day. The dollar reached a one-month high against the euro as investors digested the possibility of more lucrative investments that come with higher United States rates.
 After two years of holding its benchmark rate at 2 percent, the European Central Bank has raised it three times, by a quarter-point each time, over the last nine months. Mr. Trichet said the bank would decide on the pace and magnitude of further increases based on the developing European outlook for inflation and growth, and not on any preset course. 
 ''We are always free to do what we judge is appropriate,'' he said. 
 He said the 18 members of the bank's rate-setting body had discussed the possibility of raising rates by a half percentage point on Thursday, but that the ''overwhelming sentiment'' in the group was for the smaller increase. 
 A number of central bankers in Europe over the last month had refused to rule out the bolder move after inflation in the countries that use the euro currency accelerated to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in May -- well above the bank's informal target of 2 percent.
 Mr. Trichet pledged that the bank would ''monitor closely'' the potential for rising inflation in the 12 euro nations, but left out talk of ''vigilance'' -- a code word the bank has used to foreshadow higher rates the following month. His comments suggested to most experts that the bank's next increase would come in late August. 
 Erik F. Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ''They gave us the same steady story. I'm pretty confident the next move will be August.'' 
 Ken Wattret, an economist with BNP Paribas in London, said, ''The E.C.B. seems comfortable with this snail's pace of tightening, but that may simply mean it takes them longer to get where they are going.'' 
 Mr. Trichet spoke from Madrid, where the central bank gathered for one of the two meetings a year it holds outside its Frankfurt headquarters. He said the central bank had discussed the recent turmoil in financial markets, and he lauded a ''reappreciation of risk'' among investors, who had previously driven stocks relentlessly upward as corporate profits rose. ''There was a certain level of underpricing of risks in the global financial markets,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 As inflation has quickened in both Europe and the United States, global stock markets have retreated over much of the last month amid fears that central banks would have to squeeze growth by raising interest rates above a ''neutral'' level that neither promoted nor curbed growth.
 Mr. Trichet pointedly refused to endorse this view but by saying that the euro-zone economy was ''close to its trend potential rate,'' the European bank raised the possibility that a humming European economy would increase inflation as companies pass on higher prices to eager buyers. 
 Still, Mr. Trichet said this did not mean that the central bank had decided to push up rates above a neutral level, which economists say lies from 3.5 percent to 4 percent. 
 The bank also updated its quarterly economic forecast, predicting that the euro-zone economy would grow from 1.8 percent to 2.4 percent this year and 1.3 percent to 2.3 percent in 2007. Its estimate for next year is slightly lower than the one issued in March, reflecting a rise in oil prices.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Files a Trade Complaint Against China's Labor Practices

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. filed a trade complaint on Thursday asking President Bush to penalize China, asserting that it violates workers' rights by suppressing strikes, barring independent unions and letting factories ignore laws on minimum wages and child labor.
 The complaint says that repression of workers' rights has enabled Chinese companies to push down labor costs by at least 47 percent, undercutting American companies and causing the loss of more than 400,000 factory jobs in the United States. 
''The Chinese work force is so large and its labor repression is so severe that it is dragging down standards for the entire world economy,'' the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary- treasurer, Richard Trumka, said. ''The fact is that China is violating international trade law, and our nation is doing nothing about it.'' 
 With Mr. Bush on the defensive and the Congressional campaign heating up, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hopes that its petition will get candidates to focus on China, the soaring trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs. 
 G. Hamilton Loeb, a Washington lawyer who often represents the Chinese government and industry, said the complaint seemed largely political: ''They're teeing it up, figuring that it will give them an issue they can use in the midterm House campaigns. An issue like this might have a swing effect in a very close race.''
 The federation filed a similar complaint two years ago, but Mr. Bush quickly rejected it, with administration officials saying they would use persuasion and cooperation, rather than confrontation, to deal with labor violations in China.
 At a news conference, A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said on Thursday that they might have a better chance persuading the administration to approve trade penalties this time because several members of Congress are backing the complaint and because the annual trade deficit with China has soared more than 50 percent in two years, to $202 billion in 2005. 
 Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, said he was supporting the petition because China has arrested and imprisoned those who oppose unjust labor practices. 
 ''There is no recourse for millions of Chinese laborers trapped in poor working conditions,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Despite the administration's efforts to encourage the Chinese to comply with international labor standards, the Chinese government continues to ignore worker rights.''
 Stephen Norton, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, said the government was studying the complaint. He said it was too early to speculate on the outcome. 
 ''In general, the administration believes that a strong and growing relationship with China, driven by mutual interests, is the best way to encourage economic, social and political reform in China,'' Mr. Norton said. ''We hope that our continued engagement will be the best way to address the concerns we have with labor rights and working conditions in China.''
 He said that the Labor Department had provided its expertise to the Chinese authorities, helping to reduce worker deaths.
 The administration has 45 days to respond to the petition, which was filed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. 
 But there is some debate about the scope of that legislation. Union leaders say that the act authorizes the federal government to assess trade penalties against countries that violate internationally recognized labor rights, like the right to form unions and the bans on using child labor and forced labor. 
 Some trade lawyers argue, however, that the World Trade Organization will not allow the United States to punish countries that violate labor rights.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O's complaint cites numerous cases in which Chinese authorities have suppressed efforts to form unions independent of the official government-backed organizations. The complaint also says that Chinese authorities regularly fail to enforce minimum wage and safety laws, noting that 26,700 Chinese workers died last year from industrial injuries and illnesses.
 ''This petition carefully documents what most Americans already know, but the Bush administration has yet to confront: that China persistently and systematically denies even the most basic rights to its people,'' said another Congressional supporter of the complaint, Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Trade Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 Thea Lee, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. economist, said the group's concern was not that China had low wages, but that it repressed worker rights. If the Chinese government enforced workers' rights, the complaint argues, the country's overall manufacturing costs would rise sharply.
 While some labor groups argue that low-wage countries have an unfair advantage in trading, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said wealthy nations benefit from trading with poor nations.
 ''The U.S. gains on the consumption side when we are able to import stuff from China cheaper than we can make it,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''Then American companies have to compete against those companies, and they are driven to higher levels of productivity. It boosts productivity in the United States.''
 At the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s news conference, George Bornes asserted that Chinese competition had caused him to be laid off after 38 years working at Wheatland Tube's steel pipe factory in Sharon, Pa., He said China's pipe exports to the United States had soared to 300,000 tons a year, from 9,000 a few years ago.
 As a result, he said, Wheatland has idled the plant and laid off 300 workers. Mr. Bornes said he was tired of seeing Wheatland jobs ''threatened by China's violations of fair trade and our own government's failure to enforce our trade laws.''

HEADLINE: What Happens If Inflation Is Overstated?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
AMONG some Americans, it is almost an article of faith that the Consumer Price Index understates inflation -- there are conspiracy theories about why that happens. After all, holding down the C.P.I. saves the government money in a variety of ways and hurts those with pension or Social Security benefits linked to the index.
 But you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to conclude that in the last decade, an important part of the index has been understated. That is the housing component. 
Since 1983, the government has measured the price of homes not by looking at house prices but by computing what it calls ''owner's imputed rent.'' That is the rental value of the house you own. It accounts for nearly a quarter of the entire Consumer Price Index.
 When the change was made, the government provided statistics indicating that previous inflation rates would not have been very different under the new method, and that remained true until 1996.
 Since then the home price index maintained by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight has doubled, while the imputed rent figure has risen by less than a third.
 Had the government computed the Consumer Price Index using actual home prices since 1996, I estimate that it would have risen by an average of 4.1 percent a year, as opposed to the 2.5 percent reported. The core rate -- inflation excluding food and energy costs -- would be 4.2 percent, not 2.2 percent.
 Perhaps the Federal Reserve was too hesitant to raise rates, and thus allowed speculative bubbles to form, because it was seeing inflation through rose-tinted glasses.
 But now the problem could be the opposite. If the housing boom is ending, rental costs may start to catch up with house prices. The reported inflation rate would be higher than the real rate, at least to people who say the best way to measure home prices is by measuring home prices.
 To be sure, some economists like the rental gauge, saying it measures consumption spending. Others think that the best measure is mortgage payments. When interest rates were declining, those rose slower than home prices but faster than imputed rents.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, alarmed investors last week when he pointed to a rising core inflation rate as a cause for concern. The reaction seemed a bit overdone, given that no Fed chairman ever speaks well of a rising core inflation rate, but the speech persuaded everyone that at least one more Fed rate increase was coming.
 Mr. Bernanke wants American consumer spending to weaken, but for the slack to be taken up by American businesses and overseas consumers, particularly in Asian countries with large trade surpluses. He called for ''a greater flexibility of exchange rates over time,'' and no one thinks he meant that the dollar should strengthen.
 Arranging that is tricky. Higher interest rates might weaken the economy, but could also help the dollar. Lower rates could hurt the dollar, but also strengthen the economy. His best hope may be that the conundrum cited by his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, will keep operating but in reverse, as a halt to rising short-term rates leads to dollar weakness and to rising long-term rates as foreigners show less eagerness to buy Treasury bills and notes.
 Flexibility may be essential. ''If Bernanke commits categorically to a response to core price pressures,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG, ''he could find himself raising rates because housing does worse because of the arithmetic of how that plays out in the C.P.I.''
 Mr. Bernanke may come to understand why Mr. Greenspan so rarely said anything clearly.

HEADLINE: City Budget Director Sees Surplus With Tempered Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The New York City budget director, citing his expectation of annual deficits exceeding $3 billion starting in the second half of next year, refused to rule out tax increases yesterday when asked about the effect of the recent cut in the city's share of federal antiterror assistance. 
 The budget director, Mark Page, tried to dampen the exuberance of fiscal observers -- and lawmakers -- over the city's flush finances, even as he announced that tax collections had come in about $170 million higher than was expected only a month ago, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented his $52.7 billion executive budget on May 4. 
Officials have marveled at the size of the surplus for the fiscal year that ends on June 30, but they continue to disagree about its magnitude, since the mayor is not counting billions set aside for future costs. In separate reports yesterday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. put the surplus at $5.4 billion and State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi at $5.5 billion. 
 ''This has been an extraordinary budget year, one that we will probably never see again,'' Mr. Thompson said. 
 The figures from the comptrollers include about $2.1 billion that the mayor has set aside for future costs. Mr. Page directs the Office of Management and Budget, which did not count that sum toward the surplus and put the figure at $3.4 billion, not counting the additional $170 million announced yesterday.
 Mr. Bloomberg has an interest in making the surplus seem smaller, and in making less money available for spending increases or tax cuts. 
 In a sign of those pressures, hundreds of union members, arts advocates, directors of nonprofit groups and students crowded the City Council chamber, after hours of testimony by city officials, to push for various programs. Yesterday was the last day of a second round of annual budget hearings and the only day during this round that the public could testify. 
 About 70 people signed up to speak before Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens, the chairman of the Finance Committee. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies called for more financing of day care, child welfare, AIDS, nutrition and youth programs. The Alliance for the Arts pushed for cultural programs. The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation made an appeal on behalf of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
 The Bloomberg administration also has an interest in playing up the severity of the cut in aid from the Department of Homeland Security, a theme Mr. Page echoed. ''I'm not aware of any immediate plans to raise taxes,'' he said. ''Ultimately, we get the money out of taxes or we get the money from somebody else.''
 Mr. Page added that federal aid was ''a very valuable commodity'' for the city. 
 ''To the extent you don't get it and you still have the same things you need to pay for -- ultimately, that burden comes back to us,'' he said. ''Whether that means you have to increase taxes at some moment or you don't have the opportunity to pull back on taxes at some moment, I don't know.'' 
 Mr. Page and Mr. Thompson agreed that fixed costs -- interest payments on the city's debts, pension contributions and premiums for the health insurance plans of city employees -- were growing rapidly and outpacing revenues and inflation. Both men, along with the city's Independent Budget Office, expect a balanced budget and a modest surplus for the 2007 fiscal year, which starts on July 1.
 None of them, however, agreed on the scope of the projected deficits for the three fiscal years 2008 to 2010. 
 Mr. Page expects deficits of $3.6 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion for those three years. Mr. Thompson said yesterday that his deficit estimates were lower than Mr. Page's, by $305 million for 2008 and $45 million for 2009. Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the Independent Budget Office, predicted much lower deficits: $2.5 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion for the three years.
 Mr. Page acknowledged that his estimates were conservative but made the point that deficits are dangerous, no matter the magnitude. 
 ''Even if you go with the I.B.O. estimate of revenues in the out years of our financial plan, which are about $1 billion higher than the ones we are carrying in the executive budget, you're still left with a forecast deficit in '08, '09 and '10 in the neighborhood of $3 billion,'' he said. ''The problem with forecasting, in general, is that you never absolutely know the right answer.''
 He added, ''It's easier to have a little bit more money show up than to have a little bit less money show up.''

HEADLINE: Quinn Backs Key Element Of Trash Plan

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn has decided to support a new recycling plant on the Hudson River near the meatpacking district, removing a major hurdle in the Bloomberg administration's ambitious 20-year plan for disposing of the city's trash.
 In doing so, Ms. Quinn has stepped into a politically charged issue that pits her against other elected officials, parks advocates and many residents of her own West Side district, where the recycling plant would be built. It would occupy part of Pier 52, near Gansevoort Street, in Hudson River Park. 
Ms. Quinn's decision, which she began quietly telling people about this week, signals that the two sides of City Hall may be nearing an agreement over the long-stalled plan for getting rid of the city's residential garbage. Although state law requires the city to have a trash plan, the most recent one expired in 2004. Since then, the administration's efforts to adopt a new plan have been blocked by the City Council.
 The administration's plan emphasizes recycling and hauling garbage by barge and rail to reduce the traffic from trucks, particularly in the boroughs outside Manhattan. It would create four marine transfer stations for residential waste, including one on the Upper East Side at 91st Street, which has been opposed by nearby residents.
 The plan also calls for building a new recycling station at Gansevoort Street and converting an existing recycling station on Pier 99 near 59th Street at the northern end of the park to handle commercial waste. The recycling operation there would move to the Gansevoort Street site.
 While environmentalists have praised many elements of the trash plan, it has also drawn criticism from council members, parks advocates and some community groups. Gifford Miller, the previous Council speaker, lobbied furiously against the trash plan, in no small part because the proposed Upper East Side transfer station fell within his district.
 At Mr. Miller's direction, the Council moved last year, in a closely contested vote, to reject the sites for the residential waste transfer stations. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg vetoed the Council's action, and the Council was unable to muster enough votes to override him.
 Ms. Quinn could have similarly proved to be an obstacle, but unlike Mr. Miller, she has enjoyed a close relationship with Mayor Bloomberg and has collaborated with him on efforts to tighten restrictions on lobbyists, curb illegal guns and combat domestic violence.
 She said in an interview yesterday that Manhattan should be responsible for disposing of its own waste, and that a recycling plant could be operated at Gansevoort Street without disrupting the park or the surrounding neighborhood. She noted that there was already traffic at the pier, which has been used by sanitation trucks, and that the recycling plant would include an education center for the public. 
 ''Whether or not it will cause political problems, I guess time will tell,'' she said. ''My constituents elected me to do what I believe is best for the district, and best for the city.''
 Still, Ms. Quinn said she remained undecided about the conversion of the 59th Street station, as well as the creation of a residential waste station at East 91st Street. ''I'll be making a decision, and the Council will be taking action, on the entirety of the plan this summer,'' she said. 
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said that administration officials and Council leaders had held a number of productive meetings over the trash plan. ''We believe the plan is responsible, attainable and economical and should be passed,'' he said.
 The Gansevoort Street site would also require state legislative approval because it falls within Hudson River Park. Some parks advocates and elected officials contend that any expansion or change in the use of the 59th Street station would require state approval as well.
 In addition, the overall trash plan would have to be approved by state environmental officials.
 Two members of the State Assembly, Richard N. Gottfried and Deborah J. Glick, whose adjoining districts would be directly affected by the recycling plant, said they disagreed with Ms. Quinn's decision and would continue to oppose the recycling plant. 
 ''It's not the most helpful thing, but it is also certainly not the last word,'' Ms. Glick said. 
 Albert K. Butzel, president of Friends of Hudson River Park, said that Ms. Quinn had made ''a big mistake.'' He said the recycling plant would take over one of the largest chunks of open space in the park, block the view and limit public access to the water. 
 ''I think she is losing sight of what parks mean to people,'' Mr. Butzel said. ''Are you going to put a garbage plant in Central Park next time because it's convenient?''
 But Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, envisions a recycling plant that could be incorporated into the design of an urban park on the Hudson River. His group generally supports the trash plan, but it has specific concerns over recycling, he said.
 Mr. Goldstein added that Ms. Quinn's support for the recycling plant made it more likely that the entire trash plan would be approved by the Council. ''It is significant because it could lead to breaking the logjam on the issue of siting waste facilities,'' he said. ''But in this city, nothing is for certain until the concrete is poured.''

HEADLINE: Some Rich Nations Slow With Pledged Aid

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Last summer, leaders of some of the world's richest nations promised to increase aid significantly to combat global poverty by 2010, but a new analysis of their giving patterns has found that several got off to a slow start. 
 Based on their own official statistics, three of the nations -- Britain, Germany and France -- actually decreased their aid to developing countries in 2005 from 2004, according to the analysis, which was conducted by Oxfam and released Wednesday. 
In contrast, Oxfam found that development assistance from Italy, Canada and Japan grew substantially during the same period, with Italy registering the largest increase in aid, 46 percent.
 Giving by the United States grew 16 percent, though after increased aid to Iraq and Afghanistan was subtracted from the total, American giving fell by 4 percent.
 Oxfam's findings, based on data provided to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by the countries themselves, were particularly surprising for Britain and France. Their leaders, Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Jacques Chirac, had led the campaign for increased giving before the Group of 8 countries met in Scotland last July. At the time, Mr. Blair in particular lobbied President Bush to commit to spending more.
 The Group of 8 countries are France, Germany, Britain, the United States, Canada, Italy, Japan and Russia. Aid figures were not yet available for Russia.
 ''We need to see them getting back on track to meet their promises,'' said Max Lawson, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam International. Mr. Lawson added, though, that it would not be correct to single out the United States for praise ''given that U.S. aid is coming from a very low base and the increases are going predominantly to Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 The latest foreign aid figures, released for 2005 by the O.E.C.D. in April, show large increases in giving. However, Oxfam said, the figures are artificially inflated by huge debt write-offs that the rich nations will take for 2005 and 2006, but account for money they would have collected in much smaller amounts over many years.
 For example, the rich countries will count the full cost of canceling $18 billion in Nigeria's debt in 2005 and 2006, while Nigeria itself will save only slightly less than $1 billion in debt payments a year over 20 years.
 Oxfam's analysis spread these write-offs over many years to reflect what the wealthy nations were actually losing in annual debt payments, and that substantially reduced their aid levels.
 According to Oxfam, aid from Germany fell by 8 percent in real terms, and by 2 percent for France and Britain. 
 Based on commitments made before the Group of 8 meeting last July, the O.E.C.D. estimated aid would increase by $50 billion to $130 billion by 2010 for all nations combined.
 The French Foreign Affairs Ministry did not respond to a request for comment yesterday. A spokeswoman for the German Embassy in Washington said in an e-mail message that debt relief was a legitimate form of assistance, and added that Germany remained committed to significant aid increases.
 David Snider, a spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development, said he could not comment as he had not yet read the Oxfam report.
 In a written response to Oxfam's report, Britain's Department for International Development acknowledged yesterday that British development assistance declined in 2005 from 2004 by 2 percent in real terms, once adjusted for debt relief.
 But Hilary Benn, Britain's secretary of state for international development, said in the statement that the government was still fully committed to fulfilling its promises and ''is fully on track with its plans to achieve this.'' 
 Oxfam said the debt relief deal, which is aiding 19 poor countries, has paid off in greater investments in health and education. For example, revenues that would otherwise have been used to pay off debt helped Zambia provide free health care.

HEADLINE: Death of a Terrorist

 BODY:
It is good news for Washington, and even better news for Iraq, that the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was finally killed on Wednesday by an American airstrike. The group that Mr. Zarqawi led, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, organized and carried out some of the most beastly bombings and beheadings of recent years. 
 But as Americans discovered earlier, after Saddam Hussein's two sons were killed and the Iraqi dictator himself was arrested, it will take far more than the elimination of a handful of iconic leaders to stem the tide of the Iraqi insurgency and reverse the country's alarming slide into civil war.
It will take, most of all, the consolidation of an effective Iraqi government of national unity that can win the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of Iraq's Shiites, Kurds and Sunni Arabs by respecting their religious and ethnic diversity, protecting their personal security and assuring them the essentials of modern life. These include, at a minimum, reliable electricity, decent hospitals and schools, and a functioning economy that generates adequate employment.
 A modest step in that necessary direction was taken yesterday with the parliamentary confirmation of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's remaining cabinet members. These ministers will now take on the critical and daunting job of reforming Iraq's unreliable national army and out-of-control police forces, which have been deeply penetrated by sectarian thugs and gunmen whose taste for chaos and violence has sometimes seemed to rival Mr. Zarqawi's.
 Mr. Zarqawi played a substantial role in spreading terror and mayhem across Iraq. He fanned hatred among Iraq's different religious and ethnic communities, although at times Washington appeared to deliberately exaggerate his importance to create an identifiable enemy and to distract attention from the more authentically Iraqi-rooted insurgency. 
 Mr. Zarqawi's relationships with home-grown leaders of that insurgency and with top Al Qaeda leaders around Osama bin Laden were, in fact, often troubled. The circumstances of his death, however, could well erase all recollection of those differences in order to enshrine him as a useful martyr. In that new role, his memory could continue to haunt Iraq for some time to come.

HEADLINE: Logging-Rights Auction in Oregon Will Proceed

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
A legal struggle over logging in two roadless tracts of a national forest in Oregon ravaged by fire four years ago is coming to a conclusion as logging rights on more than 400 acres will be auctioned off by the Forest Service on Friday. 
 A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the sale could proceed. The timber sales, on two small tracts inside 500,000 fire-blighted acres, would not usually attract much attention -- and indeed, it is unclear how much demand there will be for the timber, most of which has been dead and prey to insects and rot for four years.
But Oregon has long been the central battleground for environmental groups opposed to any logging anywhere on the 500,000 acres.
 The objection is that logging could set back the regeneration of the forest by damaging fragile new growth, and that it would set a precedent for logging in an area that, under the currently approved plan for the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, was supposed to remain roadless.
 Opening a roadless area at a time when governors are still drawing up proposals to indicate their preferences for where roads should and should not be built in the federal forests, drew the governors of Oregon, Washington, California and New Mexico to oppose these two sales. One tract is more than 200 acres called Mike's Gulch, about 30 miles inland, and the other is called Blackberry, which covers slightly less than 200 acres along the Pacific coast. 
 Patty Burel, a Forest Service spokeswoman, said the years of litigation had prevented the government from acting quickly on the sale proposals, and reduced the number of trees that remain economically desirable. 
 The logging rights to be auctioned, she added, come with a stipulation that no roads be built to take the logs out; removal must be done by helicopter.
 Michael Carrier, the natural resources policy director for Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon, who opposes the sale, asked in a telephone interview: ''Is it largely a symbolic gesture? And what are they messaging? Are they signaling industry that they're serious? Are they sending a shot across the bow of Governor Kulongoski?''
 The purpose of the sale, Ms. Burel countered, was ''for economic recovery to the community and the local economy.'' 
 She added, ''We will reforest successfully after this is completed.''

HEADLINE: Auto Workers and Union on Edge as Buyout Deadline Looms

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and JEREMY W. PETERS; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit for this article and Jeremy W. Peters from Flint, Mich.

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 8 

 BODY:
It's crunch time for the United Automobile Workers.
 Union members like Rick Yrlas, a 51-year-old auto worker in Flint, Mich., must decide in the next couple of weeks whether to accept a buyout offer from General Motors, where he has worked for 30 years.
If he takes the buyout, he would be giving up a job that pays $75,000 a year and provides the medical benefits that helped him stay afloat when he became sick in recent years. He is already eligible for retirement, and the buyout would give him seed money to start his own tamale business and for his wife, Lolly, to open a hair salon.
 For G.M. and Ford, which is offering a similar program, the buyouts provide a way to reorganize in a more efficient way than if they stuck to the letter of their union contracts. 
 For the U.A.W. leadership, however, the offers represent far more than the ''take it or risk it'' discussions playing out around the kitchen tables of nearly 150,000 of its members. 
 The buyouts are a symbol of a lost fight, an admission that the jobs the union worked so hard to win can no longer be preserved and that the protection long offered to laid-off workers has become too expensive for struggling auto companies to afford.
 That creates pressure on U.A.W. leaders to forge a new direction during their national convention, which starts in Las Vegas on Sunday. The conventions are held once every four years to elect leaders and set strategy. 
 The union's membership is at the lowest point since World War II and is shrinking every day as more plants are closed and workers accept the buyout offer.
 In its only official word on the buyouts, the U.A.W. said last month that 12,400 G.M. workers had accepted the packages, which range from $35,000 to $140,000. But the number now is believed to be closer to 20,000, according to Wall Street analysts. And if there is a rush at the end to accept, as union and company officials expect, then the number of workers opting to retire or leave should be close to G.M.'s goal of 30,000.
 G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, declined to say at the company's annual meeting this week how the buyout plan was progressing.
 Ford is offering workers up to $100,000 to leave their jobs, including $35,000 to those eligible for retirement. The company is also offering a plan that pays up to $15,000 in college tuition, plus half a worker's salary for three years. Ford has no target for reducing its payroll, but the buyouts are being offered to workers at plants that it plans to close.
 Without the deals, the two companies, which collectively plan to cut 60,000 jobs over the next few years, would have to provide full pay and benefits to laid-off workers under programs like the Jobs Bank at G.M. and the G.E.N. pool (for guaranteed employment numbers) at Ford. About 6,500 workers are in the G.M. program and about 1,100 in Ford's plan.
 Adding more workers to those job-protection programs would put G.M. and Ford at a ''substantial competitive disadvantage'' to their rivals, including Asian auto companies, which took a record 40 percent of the American market in May, said Joe W. Laymon, group vice president for human resources and labor relations at Ford.
 And there is no guarantee that the income security programs would survive beyond the 2007 contract talks scheduled to begin next summer, when executives are expected to push for them to be curbed if not eliminated.
 Mr. Yrlas, who inspects pickups for defects at the Flint plant, is still fence-sitting. 
 Even after 30 years, he has little personal savings and would be throwing himself and his family at the mercy of the unforgiving Michigan economy without much cushion. 
 Mr. Yrlas's colon ruptured three years ago and he was on sick leave for six months, collecting half his pay. The bills started to pile up. The last few years, he said, ''it just seems like I've been playing catch-up.'' 
 He has, however, been testing his wings with a fledgling tamale business. Each Friday, he cooks up about 150 tamales, and takes them to work, where he sells them for $12 a dozen. They usually sell out in two hours, he says. 
 He envisions turning his garage, now cluttered with a freezer, lawn equipment and a few gasoline cans, into a catering kitchen. 
 Mrs. Yrlas, he says, could help with the cooking and also work from their basement, where she already cuts hair during her time off from a local beauty parlor, where she makes $7.50 an hour plus tips.
 ''It could happen some day,'' he said. ''This place has got potential. I could spin my wheels fast, spend the money and we could do things.'' 
 At least in theory, Mrs. Yrlas, 52, agrees: ''It'd be nice to fix this up better, have our own business,'' she said.
 Mr. Yrlas said that almost every other day, ''I say, 'Where are the papers, I'll sign.' '' 
 But he's holding off.
 ''There's a gamble here,'' he says. ''If things don't work out, then I'm stuck and I'd have to go get that $8 job.''
 The uncertainty, coupled with Mrs. Yrlas's reluctance to quit her job despite its low pay, helps explain why he has not made a final decision. Workers have until June 23 to sign up, and until June 30 to change their minds.
 Mr. Yrlas said he had not received any financial advice from his union local, which held an informational session about the buyouts a few weeks ago. Ben Mata, the local's president, said Thursday that he had been flooded with calls from about two dozen financial planners, offering to counsel workers.
 But like the national union, whose leaders have refrained from encouraging or discouraging G.M.'s 113,000 hourly workers to accept the deals, Mr. Mata said he left it to members of Local 598 to seek out financial advice.
 That does not mean leaders do not have opinions, however. Mark Hawkins, the local's chairman, said he believed that any workers short of retirement who accepted the deals were ''crazy.''
 Referring to the payments of up to $140,000 for workers to leave, Mr. Hawkins said: ''Their jobs are worth way more than that. Management is making this offer to reduce people. Once they reduce people, they'll reduce plants. We're not excited about that.''
 Mr. Mata, for his part, is more pragmatic: ''Here's the bottom line: if they don't make money, we don't make money. We're aware that they're in trouble. So rather than be reactive, we'll be proactive.''
 The union is wise not to push its members either way, said the former U.A.W. president Douglas A. Fraser. After all, putting the onus of a decision entirely on workers allows the union and its president, Ron Gettelfinger, to avoid the appearance that they are working hand in glove with the company. 
 ''The beauty of the buyout is that it is an individual decision, and individuals are motivated by different reasons,'' Mr. Fraser said this week. 
 Ford, for its part, views the buyouts as ''solutions or reactions to the reality in our industry right now,'' Mr. Laymon said.
 ''I think it's a good thing, I think it's a very responsible thing, to release an unbelievable pressure point,'' he added.
 But the buyouts will do nothing to relieve the pressure on Mr. Gettelfinger next week in Las Vegas, said Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 Union leaders will have to walk a fine line, Professor Chaison said. They may feel a need, as a show of strength, to oppose further concessions. But there is no denying that ''the pay is going, the jobs are going and these are extraordinary times,'' he said.
 Professor Chaison added that the U.A.W. president, in his main speech on Monday, will need to somehow make sense of this difficult time for its members. One tack, he suggested, would be to stress that ''the greatness of our union lies not only in our power but our flexibility, and in our ability to make changes to reflect our times.''
 The Yrlas family has long relied on G.M. for their livelihoods. Mrs. Yrlas took a $35,000 buyout from G.M. 15 years ago, but did not receive benefits. Three of Mrs. Yrlas's six brothers, and Mr. Yrlas's father and sister, worked there as well. 
 But with jobs disappearing, the Yrlas family sees no prospect of G.M. work for their three sons, aged 16, 17 and 21, who all still live at home. Their fourth son, 32, worked at G.M. for a short time as a temporary worker, but quit for a higher-paying bartending job in an affluent suburb of Detroit. 
 ''It's a G.M. family,'' Mrs. Yrlas said, but then corrected herself. ''Was a G.M. family. Our kids won't work there.''

HEADLINE: The Range Gets Crowded for Natural Beef 

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

DATELINE: SAGUACHE, Colo. 

 BODY:
As he drove his truck into the family ranch on a recent sunny morning, Mel Coleman Jr. put on his Stetson hat and greeted his Uncle Jim, who runs the ranch. In a pasture behind the house, five horses hovered placidly and several black Angus cows ambled up to a salt station. 
 Mr. Coleman, 55, spoke wistfully of his days branding and moving cattle on the ranch his ancestors started in 1875. The sprawling ranch, in the high-desert San Luis Valley about 180 miles southwest of Denver, is the birthplace of Coleman Natural Foods, founded by his late father, Mel Coleman Sr., in 1979 under a different name.
From the start, his father sold ''natural'' beef -- something alien to most shoppers and meat producers back then. On a sales trip in the early 1980's, his father camped out in a rented car to save money as he made his pitch to grocers. His cows, he said, were not given antibiotics and growth hormones like the big producers' cattle were, and he fed them a vegetarian diet. 
 It took the elder Coleman years to win converts, not only among retailers but also among consumers and government regulators. Now, paradoxically, natural and organic meats have become so popular that even the big conventional meat producers are getting into the business, and Coleman is left in the unexpected position of scrambling for shelf space. 
 Coleman itself has changed. The company has grown to become one of the largest producers in the still small natural and organic meat industry. Coleman is now owned by an investment firm. As chairman, Mr. Coleman spends countless days traveling from the company's headquarters in Golden, Colo., promoting the latest line of products with retailers and nurturing relationships with the 700 independent ranchers who supply most of its meat. Those largely family-owned ranches are facing their own pressures, from persistent drought to volatile meat and crop prices, tempting some to sell to developers. 
 The elder Coleman was also an early advocate of more stringent labeling of beef. The Agriculture Department did finally adopt standards for ''natural'' food in the mid-1980's, but it required only that those products be ''minimally processed'' and lack artificial ingredients.
 Much later, in 2002, the government developed regulations for organic food, and those are much more stringent. Organic food -- including produce, meat and the grain fed to cows and other animals -- must be grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics and growth hormones in most cases, though loopholes exist. 
 ''Mel Sr. was one of the pioneers to develop a truly natural meat company, '' said Dave Carter, head of the National Bison Association and former chairman of the Agriculture Department's National Organic Standards Board. ''His legacy lives on. But now the natural label has lost its meaning.''
 Today, many companies offer natural and organic meat. Three of the biggest conventional meat producers -- Tyson Foods, Swift & Company and National Beef -- have introduced natural products in the last few months. They have joined the niche players in natural and organic foods, among them Organic Valley of LaFarge, Wis.; Maverick Ranch Association of Denver; Laura's Lean Beef Company of Lexington, Ky.; Dakota Beef of Howard, S.D.; and Niman Ranch, based in Oakland, Calif. In addition, much organic meat is still sold directly by ranchers at farmers' markets and over the Internet.
 Coleman Natural thinks that shoppers are discerning enough to trust that its standards are higher than the Agriculture Department's. But the company is also hedging its bets and gradually expanding its smaller organic business.
 ''We like to say we're one grain away from being organic,'' Mr. Coleman said. 
 That one small grain bears a big price tag. Organic cattle feed can cost up to 30 percent more than genetically modified and chemically treated grains. That means shoppers nationwide pay a premium for organic meat -- as much as 50 percent for beef and 20 percent for chicken. For instance, in the Boulder, Colo., area, a pound of 91 percent lean organic ground beef sells at Whole Foods for $6.09, compared with an 85 percent lean all-natural product for $3.99. Albertson's sells conventional choice grade beef for $1.99 a pound. 
 Organic meat is the fastest-growing segment of the $14 billion organic food business, even though it represents only 2 percent. Last year, organic meat sales, which includes poultry and fish, soared 55 percent, to $256 million from 2004, far faster than the overall organic food industry's 15 percent annual clip, according to the Organic Trade Association. The association estimates that organic meat accounts for only 0.22 percent of overall meat sales. Organic growth is expected to accelerate now that Wal-Mart has decided to offer more organic food. 
 According to the consumer research and consulting firm ACNielsen, natural meat sales, which excludes fish, nearly doubled in four years, to $681.3 million in the year ended April 22. (The firm tracks only natural-labeled bar-coded products sold in mass merchandiser stores, excluding Wal-Mart.)
 ''Organic food is just at a tipping point heading mainstream,'' said Samuel Fromartz, author of the new book ''Organic, Inc.'' 
 George Chivari, president of Coleman, estimates that organic meat will account for as much as 25 percent of its sales by 2010, up from 12 percent this year and 7.5 percent in 2004. He would not disclose sales or income figures for the company, other than to say that its profits are increasing. 
 Coleman was bought in 2002 by the investment firm Booth Creek Management for an undisclosed price. A few months earlier, Booth Creek bought Petaluma Poultry, the largest organic poultry supplier in the United States. Today, Petaluma operates under the Coleman roof, and nearly half of Coleman's sales stem from poultry. 
 George Gillett, a partner in Booth Creek and the strategist behind the Coleman and Petaluma purchases, is helping take Coleman Natural further into mainstream grocery stores. Today, most sales come from Whole Foods, Wild Oats and other natural grocers, as well as some big retailers like Costco, Safeway and Kroger. Mr. Gillett aims to put beef, chicken, pork and other animal products in the same delivery trucks, making it easier and more cost-effective for retailers to buy in high volume. 
 Mr. Gillett knows supermarkets well. A few years ago, Booth Creek and another investment firm bought a majority stake in the giant meat packer ConAgra Beef from ConAgra Foods of Omaha for $1.4 billion. That business is called Swift & Company, one of the big three meat packers that recently began competing with Coleman in natural meat. 
 Mr. Gillett, who is chairman of Swift, does not view Swift's move as a problem for Coleman. ''There's a validation process occurring,'' he said. Coleman being in the natural meat sector ''to some degree legitimizes it.''
 Coleman's push to diversify into other meats, including pork, and prepackaged and deli-ready foods (organic and natural), reflects its desire to accommodate consumers as well as to cushion itself from one-time and cyclical downturns in meat prices. Some of Coleman's rivals in the natural category, meanwhile, are jumping head first into organics. Maverick, a family operated meat producer, recently announced that it would be 100 percent certified organic within five years, up from 5 percent now. 
 Charlie Moore, vice president for marketing and one of the four sons of the Maverick founder, Roy Moore, wonders how he can compete against the big meat packers. ''They process more cattle in one day than we do in one year,'' he said. ''For us, going organic is also about survivability.'' 
 Both natural and organic meat producers agree that their success depends on the viability of small ranches and farms. Developers are eager to buy them out when the going gets tough. Many ranches face extinction as their owners approach retirement and their descendants abandon the rugged lifestyle. 
 From 1982 to 2003, nonfederal acreage (including state- or county-owned and tribal land) devoted to grazing fell more than 5 percent, from 611 million acres to 576 million acres, according to the Agriculture Department. And that figure does not include agricultural land that has been sold in small parcels called ranchettes. 
 To help blunt the momentum of vanishing ranchland, Coleman Natural is spending thousands of dollars a year, through the American Farmland Trust, to help farmers and ranchers manage their animals and the land they graze on in more environmentally protective ways. One strategy is to work with public or private land trusts to place their land under an agriculture conservation easement. Typically easements limit subdivision and nonagricultural development, in perpetuity, while allowing landowners to retain ownership of the property and the right to use, lease or sell it for similar agricultural use.
 Cathy and Mike McNeil, who own a ranch in Monte Vista, Colo., have done just that. Their McNeil Ranch sells frozen natural and grass-fed beef under the Diamond F Brand label. While grilling some homegrown, grass-fed hamburgers for a visitor in their home, the couple explained how a prolonged drought in 2002 forced them to sell about 400 head of cattle out of a total 950 from their 3,000-acre ranch. Within a couple of years they will have sold all of their land -- for a total of $1.8 million -- to another land trust as a conservation easement. They retain a right to continue ranching. 
 At the Coleman ranch, Mr. Coleman said farewell to his Uncle Jim and drove along the lonely dusty county roads, pointing out the modest house where he grew up. These 105,000 acres of pastureland, covered with Western wheat grass and rabbit brush, were owned by various Coleman family members and are now largely under conservation easements. 
 ''We may be investing also in some of our competitors' future,'' he said, ''but if it changes agriculture and helps preservation and the sustainability of our environment, and brings economic sustainability of small family farms and ranches, that's a good deal.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Widens, But Economists See Relief

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
An influx of foreign cars, sporting goods, toys and electronics helped stretch the United States trade deficit slightly wider in April. 
 With rising oil prices adding to the imbalance between what Americans imported and exported, the trade gap rose to $63.43 billion, up 2.4 percent over March. It was the first time the deficit had grown since January.
But economists, usually quick to point out that multibillion-dollar trade deficits are not sustainable, seemed largely unmoved. Many expect the gap to bottom out or contract in the coming months as the economy slows and consumers spend less. 
 What many economists and investors found more troubling, however, was the data on import prices that raised fresh concerns about inflation. 
 Investors bid stocks downward, erasing modest gains posted early in the day. Strong rebounds in most Asian and European markets failed to provide much of a lift on Wall Street.
 The slump in equity prices that swept through global markets this week was touched off mainly by signs that central banks around the world planned to keep raising interest rates to fight inflation. Yesterday, those fears came back to haunt Wall Street once again, this time with a new set of numbers.
 The Commerce Department reported that prices of imported goods, excluding petroleum and natural gas, jumped 0.6 percent in May, compared with 0.1 percent in April and a drop of 0.3 percent in March. Because energy prices are so volatile, economists consider the import price data, excluding energy, to be a much more reliable gauge of inflation. 
 ''We're starting to see this inflation creep turn into a crawl,'' said Richard Yamarone, director for economic research at Argus Research. ''And before you know it, if unchecked by the Fed, this may turn into an outright gallop.''
 The Federal Reserve meets at the end of the month to decide whether to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate again. 
 While the latest inflation numbers came as an unwelcome surprise to many economists, the trade deficit figures released separately by the department came in slightly below forecasts. A lower-than-expected deficit combined with signs that consumers may soon spend less on exports because of higher energy prices gave some economists a reason to think the trade picture could soon improve.
 ''I think in May and June we're going to see very tepid imports of consumer products,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight. ''They're pulling in their horns and shying away from the big-ticket items.''
 Higher prices for imported oil combined with falling exports and rising imports helped lift the trade imbalance in April. Americans imported more cars, household goods and clothes while exporting fewer expensive items. On the consumer side, pharmaceutical exports fell. On the commercial side, exports of airplanes dropped.
 The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened 9.4 percent in April, to $17.03 billion, accounting for about a quarter of the overall imbalance. The gap with the European Union fell 7.2 percent, to $9.37 billion.
 There is some disagreement among economists about whether the United States trade deficit will become worse before it gets better, and whether the economy will slow enough to curb the appetite for imported goods.
 ''With domestic demand likely to be reasonably healthy in the months ahead,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, wrote in a note to clients, ''it is probable that the volume of nonoil imports will continue to grow, thereby keeping the trade deficit on a widening trend.''
 But if growth in foreign countries, especially in Asia, continues, Americans will export more and the trade outlook could improve, some economists think.
 ''The U.S. will continue to have a deficit, it just will not be as large,'' said Tanweer Akram, a senior economist at Moody's Economy.com. 
 The trade deficit was about 3 percent wider in April than in March, and 12 percent wider than in April 2005. Its size has roughly doubled since early 2002.

HEADLINE: New Crusade For Master Of Overstock

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
WHEN last we looked in on our old friend Patrick M. Byrne, the conspiracy-mongering trash-talking lawsuit-filing chief executive of Overstock.com, it was late February. Mr. Byrne had sued Rocker Partners, a short selling hedge fund, and Gradient Analytics, a small equity research firm, accusing them of conspiring to drive down Overstock's stock price. And he was gloating because a handful of financial journalists, including the MarketWatch.com columnist Herb Greenberg -- whom Mr. Byrne viewed as a charter member of the anti-Overstock conspiracy -- had received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. appeared to be looking into Mr. Byrne's stock-manipulation allegations, but quickly backed away from the subpoenas to the journalists. 
 Here we are four months later, and all I can say is that Mr. Byrne certainly has been keeping himself busy! He assumed the post of chairman when his father, the former Geico boss John J. Byrne, stepped down as Overstock's chairman, after saying publicly that he wished his son would spend less time crusading and more time running the business. He announced a quarterly loss of $15.9 million, blaming himself for the disappointing results, as he usually does. It's becoming something of a quarterly ritual. 
Overstock received its own subpoena from the S.E.C., leading Mr. Byrne to issue one of the odder news releases in modern times, which included this statement from him: ''I may be the first C.E.O. in history to celebrate receiving an S.E.C. subpoena.'' The day before, Overstock announced that it had raised $16.8 million by issuing stock to a big purchaser. The day after, Overstock announced that the transaction had been withdrawn.
 And then, a few short weeks ago, in Overstock's home state of Utah, the state Legislature passed a bill -- which Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. quickly signed into law -- that took aim at a practice that Mr. Byrne has been crusading against for months, but which few other chief executives in the country seems to think is much of a problem: naked short selling. 
 Huh?
 WHAT is naked short selling? So glad you asked. Typically, when someone wants to sell a stock short -- that is, make a bet that the price will go down -- he is required to borrow the stock from someone else, usually a brokerage firm. Assuming the price drops as the short seller hopes, he then buys the stock at the lower price and pockets the difference as his profit. Here, by contrast, is how the S.E.C. describes naked short selling on its Web site: ''In a 'naked' short sale, the seller does not borrow or arrange to borrow the securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due (known as a 'failure to deliver' or 'fail').'' 
 Sounds pretty technical, right? And for the most part, it is. The S.E.C. goes on to say that there are often legitimate reasons for a ''failure to deliver'' and that in some circumstances naked short selling isn't even necessarily a violation of the agency's rules. But it can be an abusive practice. Witness, for instance, the news Thursday that the New York Stock Exchange was investigating the possibility that naked short selling contributed to the decline in the shares of Vonage, the Internet phone company that went public last month.
 To better monitor naked short selling -- and try to lower the number of ''failures to deliver'' -- early last year the S.E.C. instituted something called Regulation SHO, which compiles what the agency calls a ''threshold'' list of companies in which there are more than 10,000 shares that have ''failed to deliver'' in the allotted time. Overstock has been on the threshold list pretty much ever since Reg SHO came into being. Which, to Mr. Byrne -- though to virtually no one else -- means that shadowy, bad people, who lurk in the darkest corners of Wall Street, are breaking the law and creating ''phantom shares'' of the stock through the practice of naked shorting.
 Actually, Mr. Byrne doesn't really characterize his naked shorting crusade as an Overstock issue -- the Overstock situation, he told me yesterday, merely brought the whole situation to light. Indeed, his lawsuit against Rocker Partners has nothing at all to do with naked short selling. (Rocker Partners and Gradient are aggressively defending against the Overstock lawsuit.) Rather, he portrays himself as a Don Quixote-like figure, fighting to rid Wall Street of ''criminals'' -- a word he used frequently during our short interview. (He asked if he could tape our conversation, so I'm confident you'll be able to read it soon on the Internet. That has become one of Mr. Byrne's favorite tactics.)
 ''Right now,'' he said, ''people in certain hedge funds are being scofflaws and the S.E.C. is giving hall passes to criminals'' -- by not making public the names of the institutions that have persistent ''fails'' beyond the allotted time frame, information he believes should be in the public domain. In fact, the S.E.C. has no intention of releasing such information, precisely because the agency fears that it might cause the companies on the list to seek retribution. 
 Mr. Byrne says that firms and hedge funds that consistently fail to deliver are in violation of the law and that the rampant abuses are creating ''systemic risk,'' generating millions of ''phantom shares,'' destroying small-cap companies and robbing small investors who are getting, as he puts it, ''I.O.U.'s'' instead of real shares. Before our conversation ended, he tossed me one of his favorite lines: ''Somewhere in America, a grandma is eating dog food tonight because these people are looting the savings of America.''
 If you find this all a little hard to take seriously, join the crowd. Grandmas are eating dog food because of a ''failure to deliver?'' Really? Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus. Apparently, though, that doesn't bother Utah's legislators and its governor.
 Here's something else Mr. Byrne told me: he really wasn't that involved in the Utah bill. Not exactly. The state senator who sponsored the bill, Curtis Bramble, said that it was first brought to his attention by a Utah lobbyist named Douglas Foxley. As it happens, one of Mr. Foxley's clients is Overstock.com. According to The Deseret News, Mr. Byrne is also the largest individual political donor in the state, whose contributions include $75,000 toward the 2004 gubernatorial campaign of Governor Huntsman. (Mr. Huntsman denies that the contributions were the reason he supported the bill.) When it passed the Legislature, the bill had virtually no opposition, though I suspect that is largely because most legislators had little idea what it was about.
 So what will the new law do? According to The Deseret News, it will require sellers involved in ''failure to deliver'' transactions ''to report to the Utah Division of Securities and reveal the identities of all parties, including dates, locations and prices involved in the sales.'' In other words, Mr. Byrne is hoping to use the state regulatory apparatus to pry out the information the S.E.C. won't supply. 
 The state will also have the ability to set daily fines starting at $10,000 a day for brokers that don't comply with the new state rules about disclosure, and companies will also be able to sue for damages. I should add that the law applies only to thestocks of Utah-based companies -- but every broker-dealer in the country would have to comply with it. 
 When I spoke to Governor Huntsman, he heralded the new law as a way to attract entrepreneurs to the state of Utah. ''Our future as a state consists of companies that are just getting off the ground,'' he said. ''For me, this was a means of enhancing our attractiveness to these kinds of companies, by making the playing field a little more transparent, a little more fair. This is an issue that is important to many of them.''
 I don't really think the practical effect of the new law is going to lead to a surge of hungry, shackled entrepreneurs moving to Provo, though. The Securities Industry Association, the big Wall Street lobby, is up in arms about the new law, and will undoubtedly sue on the grounds that Utah is trying to pre-empt federal securities law and impose an operational requirement that it simply doesn't have the right to impose. I'm putting my money on the association.
 Another possibility, which the securities lobby pointed out in a letter to the governor, is that Wall Street firms would just stop trading in the stocks of Utah-based companies. ''Limiting interaction with Utah companies could make trading in such companies illiquid and negatively impact the ability of companies to raise capital necessary to grow and prosper,'' it said in the letter.
 Twenty-five years ago, the state of Utah made a concerted -- and quite foolish -- legislative effort to impose its will on Wall Street. Back then, the issue was money market funds, a new financial product that was helping middle-class Americans keep pace with raging inflation at a time when bank interest rates were fixed by law at 5 1/4 percent. Egged on by the banking industry, the Utah Legislature tried to outlaw money market funds. But in that case, the state was saved from embarrassment when a crucial opponent of money market funds made a procedural error that could not be reversed. Because of that mistake, money market funds were saved for the citizens of Utah.
 This time, the state wasn't so lucky. There wasn't one small mistake this time. Just one big one.

HEADLINE: Call Her Homeowner

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
A WOMAN'S place is in the home of her own.'' So concludes This Old House, commenting on a survey from the National Association of Realtors.
 ''Last year single women became homeowners at more than twice the rate of single men and made up 21 percent of all buyers,'' Lisa Selin Davis writes.
Among the reasons given for the surge are that women are marrying later, are making more money and are more confident in making repairs, thanks in part to women-only repair seminars put on by the major home improvement chains. 
 ''Such independence, coupled with low mortgage interest rates, make real estate an attractive place to sock away savings,'' Ms. Davis writes.
 Here are two other intriguing facts from the magazine:
 3/5paragraf 4/5According to the Census Bureau, of the 4.3 million Americans ages 25 to 34 who are living at home with their parents, some 63 percent are men.
 3/5paragraf 4/5About 85 percent of women are, have been or will be solely responsible for a house within their lifetime. 
 WHERE TO LIVE -- Despite the gains in homeownership, the United States ranks only ''an abysmal'' 17th worldwide among the best places for women, Marie Claire reports. 
 No. 1, according to the rankings compiled by the World Economic Forum, is Sweden, which is the ''most advanced country for women, with greater levels of equality, power and well-being than anywhere else,'' Abigail Haworth writes.
 More than 60 percent of all Swedish college students are women; women's sports are given as much TV airtime as men's; and ''Swedish men do more housework than anywhere else -- an average of 24 hours per week.''
 Rounding out the top 10 places for women based on their ''health, financial and gender-equality practices,'' were, in order: Norway (''by law, all company boards must be at least 40 percent women''), Iceland, Denmark (''women have the highest employment rate in the world and smallest gender wage gap''), Finland, New Zealand, Canada, Britain, Germany and Australia.
 SUPPLY-CHAIN ECONOMICS -- In their rush to outsource manufacturing to China, companies are leaving themselves vulnerable to any number of costs they may not have thought about, argues George Stalk Jr. of the Boston Consulting Group. 
 By definition, lengthening the supply chain means it takes longer to get products into stores. By the time the goods arrive they can be out of date, forcing retailers to mark them down or write them off. Conversely, it means that retailers can run out of products that are in demand, Mr. Stalk points out in Supply Chain Management Review.
 In addition, increased shipping into ports on the West Coast, which ''has been growing at a rate equivalent to one Port of Vancouver per year,'' is creating bottlenecks that are making supplies to retailers uneven.
 The net result, Mr. Stalk says, is that companies are more vulnerable than they think. ''In their rush to source from China, many companies are blindly walking into a strategic trap,'' Mr. Stalk writes. ''The trap is thinking sourcing from China will result in lower product costs, when, in reality, the supply chain dynamics will drive up overall costs and reduce profitability -- thereby creating an opening for a competitor.''
 To get around the problems, he offers suggestions that will lead to higher costs initially, but should eventually lead to greater profitability. His ideas on what to do include: 
 3/5paragraf 4/5Use air freight, especially on ''products with the highest margins and volatility.''
 3/5paragraf 4/5Pay a premium to get preferred treatment on shipments; for example, to make sure your goods are loaded last and unloaded first.
 3/5paragraf 4/5Create warehouses in less crowded ports. Wal-Mart and Home Depot have warehouses in Savannah, Ga., for example. 
 FINAL TAKE -- Here's something to think about, courtesy of Backpacker, before you take off for that long hike in the mountains this summer. You are liable for the expenses associated with rescuing you, should it come to that, and it can cost up to $20,000 just to send out the helicopter.
 You will be happy to know rescue insurance is available. So are good maps and compasses. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Look Overseas For Companies On the Move

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
FOREIGN stocks have outperformed the homegrown variety for the last couple of years. One fund industry executive, who in his days as a portfolio manager extracted more than his fair share of gains from domestic stocks for his investors, contends that the discrepancy is far from an ephemeral trend. 
 C. Bruce Johnstone, managing director of Fidelity Investments, prefers putting money into markets that feature ''three pillars'': rising corporate earnings, reasonable valuations and benign inflation and interest rates. The markets that possess those in greatest abundance, he said, are overseas, and he expects that to remain the case despite short-term swings. 
 ''I think we ought to be diversifying around the world,'' Mr. Johnstone said at a recent conference. ''We had the wind to our backs all through the 20th century in a lot of ways that we won't in the 21st century.'' 
 His case amounts to a juxtaposition of short-term negatives for domestic stocks and long-term positives for foreign ones. He pointed to ''a lot of early warnings signals that things are starting to slow down'' in the United States, including a shrinking dollar, credit tightening by the Federal Reserve and an apparent peak in the housing market. 
 What about valuations? Mr. Johnstone finds American stocks cheaper than they were when the 1990's bull market came to an abrupt end, yet they remain more expensive than many foreign markets, he said. 
 The main point in favor of investing overseas, in his opinion, is that you get more future for your money. Many countries are experiencing the first flowerings of democracy and capitalism. His argument is that as education, tax reform, property rights and other legal protections expand, so does the ability and inclination of people to improve their lives. 
 ''Every time you inch your way forward on any of these factors,'' he said, ''people are freeing up their creativity, productivity and energy level.'' That equates to faster growth, personal and financial. 
 His long-range perspective sets Mr. Johnstone apart. He is far from alone in forecasting relative strength in overseas markets, but he has been doing so for years, while many others have come around only recently. The outperformance of foreign stocks has encouraged them to predict more of the same, like railbirds at the track betting on a favorite halfway through the race and only after it has built up a big lead. 
 ''I've always had this view,'' he said in an interview. ''Obviously, it has paid off for the last several years.'' 
 It was the payoffs his investors received from his 19 years managing Fidelity Equity Income that cemented Mr. Johnstone's reputation. From 1971 to 1990 his fund had an average annual gain of 14.16 percent, compared with 10.77 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 Now that he is promoting the virtues of committing money overseas, Mr. Johnstone assures investors that he is advising them to do as he does, not just as he says. He says he keeps two-thirds of his personal retirement portfolio invested in foreign stocks, via Fidelity funds, of course. 
 HIS biggest holding, he said, is Fidelity Emerging Markets. That would give him stakes in such companies as Samsung Electronics and Kookmin Bank in Korea; the Russian energy concern Lukoil; Teva Pharmaceutical in Israel; and a couple of Brazilian commodity producers: the energy company Petrobras and the mine operator Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. They were among the fund's largest positions on March 31, the most recent date for which Fidelity would provide information. 
 Two other funds in his personal portfolio, he said, are International Small Cap and International Small Cap Opportunities. Their largest holdings included Banca Italease, a company that leases equipment to financial institutions; Hitachi Construction Machinery in Japan; Central African Mining and Exploration; and SolarWorld, a German maker of solar energy equipment. 
 The emphasis on emerging markets may raise eyebrows among risk-averse investors, especially after the drubbing these markets took last month, when they fell more than 10 percent. Mr. Johnstone said that wide diversification and a long horizon mitigate the wide swings that emerging markets are prone to. 
 ''I understand that volatility is higher when you're in emerging markets; however, in a very long-term portfolio I'm very comfortable with that risk,'' he said. ''My continuing point of view is that there are places around the world that are going to have better growth rates, not for the next year but for 10, 20, 30, 50 years. For people not to consider this opportunity is ridiculous.''

HEADLINE: Illegal Immigrants And the Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Worker Next Door'' (Op-Ed, June 3): 
Barry R. Chiswick is exactly right in pointing out that the American economy would function quite well without the low-skilled labor supplied by illegal immigrants. 
 But the real question is what to do with the 12 million illegal immigrants who currently live here, as well as the millions of people in Mexico and elsewhere who would like to live in the United States and contribute to our economy.
 The flexibility and strength of the American economy could also be used to improve their welfare, to little detriment and the likely benefit of most United States citizens.

HEADLINE: Illegal Immigrants And the Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Barry R. Chiswick is correct in saying ''there are no low-skilled jobs that American workers would not and do not do.'' 
As a migrant fruit picker in the late 1970's and 1980's, I was disgusted to hear people say Americans won't do this kind of work. It was and is a lie. 
 I worked alongside a group of Americans, many descendants of the Dust Bowl Okies and Arkies, who wanted to continue picking fruit. But they couldn't. An unchecked influx of illegal immigrant workers in the fruit orchards not only kept wages down, year after year, but also encouraged the widespread use of farm labor contractors who provided their own crews. 
 Jobs became harder and harder to find. I clearly remember a summer in the mid-1980's, when I went from orchard to orchard in eastern Washington looking for a job picking cherries. Everywhere I went, I was told there were no jobs. And every ladder was occupied by an immigrant. 
 It's fine to be sympathetic with immigrants desperate for low-wage jobs in America. But I just wish everyone would stop saying that they are doing jobs Americans refuse to do.

HEADLINE: Parts Supplier Reaches Buyout Deal With U.A.W. 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 9 

 BODY:
The Delphi Corporation, the auto parts supplier, reached an agreement on Friday with the United Automobile Workers union and General Motors that offered buyouts to all of its 24,000 workers and reduced the possibility of a crippling strike.
 The plan, which G.M. will finance, expands a plan announced in March that covered 13,000 Delphi workers, and comes on the eve of the union's leadership convention, which begins Monday in Las Vegas.
Agreement on the buyouts allows the two companies and the union to focus negotiations on other crucial issues like the level of wage and benefit cuts at Delphi, the amount G.M. is willing to pay for buyouts and to subsidize workers' wages, and the number of workers who will be left at Delphi, once the cuts are made. 
 The situation also needs to be settled, analysts say, for G.M. to proceed with its own restructuring. 
 The broadened buyout offer will ''really alleviate a lot of the uncertainty and take away a lot of the militant impetus in the union for a strike,'' said David L. Gregory, professor of labor relations at St. John's University Law School in New York.
 Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October, is the country's biggest parts supplier. It was part of G.M. until it was spun off in 1999. G.M. remains liable for pension and retirement health care benefits for Delphi workers who were at the automaker before the spinoff.
 On March 22, G.M. offered buyouts ranging from $35,000 to $140,000 to all 113,000 of its hourly workers and 13,000 of the 24,000 U.A.W. members at Delphi. In addition, it agreed to take back 5,000 Delphi workers. 
 After announcing that deal, Delphi asked a federal bankruptcy judge for permission to set aside its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wage rates and less-generous benefits. Delphi also said it would close or sell 21 of its 29 plants in the United States, and cut 20,000 hourly jobs, many held by U.A.W. members.
 In return, the U.A.W. threatened to strike Delphi if that happened, a move that could cripple G.M. Last month, workers voted to give leaders the authority to call a strike.
 Since then, the issue has played out at the negotiating table and in court. Hearings on Delphi's request to set aside its contracts began last month, and the union had been set to present its case this week. 
 But on Friday, a federal judge postponed the hearings until Aug. 11, easing the likelihood of a strike before then, since the U.A.W. contract remains in effect. And, the additional time increases the prospects that the two companies and the union will come to terms.
 In a statement, Delphi said it was ''committed'' to reaching a deal outside of court. The U.A.W., for its part, said the additional time would allow it, Delphi and G.M. to focus on negotiations without the ''distraction'' of the court hearings.
 A spokeswoman for G.M., which has not said how much it expects the buyouts to cost, said the broadened plan was a ''win-win all the way around.'' 
 Analysts said the development was promising. 
 ''It's a very encouraging sign, because it greatly reduces the risk of a long strike,'' said one automotive analyst, John Casesa, managing partner of Casesa Strategic Advisers in New York. A lengthy walkout ''is mutually assured destruction for G.M. and the U.A.W.,'' Mr. Casesa added.
 But getting to a deal will require intense discussions that will ultimately reveal just how much G.M. is willing to pay to help overhaul its former parts supplier. 
 Delphi has proposed cutting Delphi workers' wages from about $28 an hour to $22 an hour, then to $16.50 an hour, assuming a subsidy of $50,000 a worker paid by G.M., which has not committed itself to the plan.
 Without the subsidy, Delphi would cut wages next year to $12.50 an hour, or less than half what workers earn on their current contract, which is essentially the same as the contract at G.M.
 The longer time for negotiations increases the chance that the U.A.W. will agree to some concessions, a move that experts say is generally inevitable once a company asks for its labor contracts to be set aside.
 Still, ''it's always superior if you can reach an agreement outside of court,'' Mr. Gregory of St. John's University Law School said. 
 Under the buyout plan, workers with at least 30 years experience, making them eligible to retire, would receive $35,000 and their complete retirement benefits including a pension and health care. 
 Workers with 10 to 26 years would receive $140,000 to leave, while workers with one to 10 years experience would receive $70,000. Both groups would receive a pension once they reached retirement age, but no health care benefits.
 A small group of workers who joined Delphi in the last year, and received different benefits, would receive $40,000 to give up their jobs. 
 Another program would pay workers with 26 to 29 years of service a monthly stipend of $2,750 until they are eligible for retirement, if they will leave now. The plan originally applied to workers with 27 to 29 years experience, but was lowered by a year under the new program.
 Claudia Piccinin, a Delphi spokeswoman, said the plan ''allows us to more rapidly transform our U.S. manufacturing operations and also softens the economic impact on our hourly work force.'' 
 The deadline for accepting the buyouts at G.M. and Delphi is June 23; workers have a week after that to change their minds. Discussions continue with Delphi's five other unions on a similar buyout program.
 G.M. lost $10.6 billion in 2005, and continues to lose money on its automotive operations despite posting a profit in the first quarter. G.M. wants to eliminate 30,000 jobs and close all or parts of a dozen plants through 2008, and it hopes to get that many workers to agree to its buyout plans.
 Earlier this year, Delphi asked a federal judge to cancel hundreds of its parts contracts with G.M., an action that would allow it to raise the prices G.M. pays it for parts. The move ignited an angry reaction from G.M., which agreed last fall to give up discounts it had negotiated with Delphi so the company would have more cash at the beginning of its bankruptcy.
 On Friday, the judge postponed a hearing on that request by Delphi until Aug. 11, allowing the two sides time to reach a deal in that dispute.
 Expanding the buyouts at Delphi came as the U.A.W.'s lead negotiator, Richard Shoemaker, is set to retire next week. He also oversees talks with G.M., and is considered to be the union official closest to the U.A.W. president, Ron Gettelfinger.
 Mr. Gettelfinger will choose a successor for Mr. Shoemaker at the U.A.W. convention next week. Whoever succeeds Mr. Shoemaker will immediately join Mr. Gettelfinger in the three-way discussions, which have been among the most difficult that the union has faced since the 1979 talks that resulted in concessions to Chrysler.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about an agreement between Delphi Corporation, the auto parts supplier, and the United Auto Workers to extend a buyout program referred imprecisely to the role of General Motors. (The error was repeated in a front-page article on Monday.) While G.M. will pay the full cost of the first 13,000 buyouts that were offered, it will split the cost with Delphi for an additional 10,000 buyouts.

HEADLINE: Fed Makes It Clear That Rates Will Rise Again

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
SIGNS of slower economic growth, paradoxically, would normally have been welcome news this week, bolstering the idea that the Federal Reserve would stop tightening the money supply and raising interest rates. But when signs of slow growth were accompanied by evidence of accelerating inflation, it was hard to see a bright side.
With the stock market falling, the deal-making machinery on Wall Street fell silent. There were a couple of takeovers involving foreign companies, both with significant interests in the United States.

FIRST THINGS FIRST -- Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and almost every other Fed member were meticulously on message: Make no mistake this time, rates are going up. 
 After sending mixed messages in the past about when the steady march of interest rate increases might end, Fed members stepped up to uniformly express concern that prices were rising too fast: at a 3 percent annual rate over the last six months and 2.3 percent over the last 12 months.
 Speaking at a conference in Washington on international monetary issues, Mr. Bernanke described those rates as ''unwelcome developments.'' In the past, he has said that core inflation should hover between 1 and 2 percent a year. 
 The Fed, he added, ''will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained.''
 The inflation rate for May is scheduled to be released Wednesday. Analysts expect an increase of 0.3 percent for the month.

SIGNS OF A SLUMP -- Inflation concerns were stoked earlier in the week when the Labor Department said that the number of workers making their first unemployment insurance claims fell sharply last month, suggesting a tight labor market that could lead to higher wages as companies compete for workers.
 But analysts dismissed the number as a statistical fluke, and reaffirmed that they expected that the number of initial jobless claims would start climbing this month as the economy slowed.
 Evidence of a slowdown came from the Commerce Department, which said that wholesalers' inventories rose 0.9 percent in April, much faster than expected. The decline was led by automakers, which may be an early sign of how stubbornly high energy prices are starting to affect the broad economy.
 Additional evidence of economic growth will come Tuesday, when the Commerce Department releases retail sales figures for May.

BRIGHT SPOT -- Grupo Ferrovial, a Spanish construction and real estate company, offered to buy BAA, the world's biggest airport operator, for $19 billion in a significant vote of confidence in the rebounding air travel industry.
 BAA, the former British Airports Authority before it was privatized in the 1980's, owns Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports in England; Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports in Scotland; and interests in airports in Naples, Italy, and Budapest. In the United States, it runs the Indianapolis airport and manages the retail shops at airports in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Boston.
 Ferrovial owns a controlling stake in Bristol International Airport in England and a minority stake in Belfast City Airport in Northern Ireland. It also manages airports in Australia and Chile, and runs toll roads in Spain, Canada, Chile, the United States, Portugal, Italy and elsewhere.
 Some airlines expressed concern that Ferrovial would have to raise landing fees at its airports to cover the cost of the acquisition. Others said they hoped the company's experience would expedite construction of a third runway at Heathrow, near London.

BIG FINE -- An Austrian bank agreed to pay at least $675 million to avoid criminal charges and settle bankruptcy claims stemming from its role in helping the commodities brokerage firm Refco conceal losses before it collapsed into bankruptcy.
 Of that total, $8 million will be used to settle a class-action lawsuit, and the rest will be split evenly between the United States Justice Department and victims of the fraud at Refco.
 As part of the settlement, the bank, Bawag, acknowledged that it had helped Refco's former chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, conceal crippling losses from investors and creditors by lending him hundreds of millions of dollars and permitting him to shift funds among the company's various accounts.
 Bawag acquired a 10 percent stake in Refco in 1999. Refco, which was based in New York, sold shares to the public last year but collapsed a few months later amid evidence of fraud in its accounts.
 Mr. Bennett is under house arrest, awaiting trial on eight felony counts of fraud.

COMMERCIAL BOOM -- While sales of new and existing homes continue to fall from month to month, suggesting that the residential real estate rally is fading, there are signs that people are still bullish on commercial property.
 Brookfield Properties, a Canadian company that owns 67 office buildings in New York City, Boston, Washington and Canada, agreed to buy Trizec Properties, which owns 61 towers, for $4.8 billion. The deal, which also calls for the assumption of $4.1 billion in debt, will create one of the largest commercial landlords in North America.
 In New York, Brookfield already owns the World Financial Center; acquiring Trizec will let it add the Grace Building on 42nd Street and One New York Plaza. Trizec also owns Bank of America Plaza in downtown Los Angeles.
 Shares of other commercial property companies, including Equity Office Properties and Boston Properties, have been mentioned as the next possible takeover candidates.
