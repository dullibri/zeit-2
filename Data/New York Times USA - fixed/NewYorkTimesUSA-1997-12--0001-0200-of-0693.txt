HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING: How Fast to Cut Back? Two Views;
Until Payoff Is Clear, Haste Means Big Waste

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHAT, Americans worry?
To the frustration of environmental activists, the still-distant risks from global warming have yet to grab the attention of Main Street. But to many economists, the difficulty in mobilizing public support to meet America's international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 may yet prove a blessing. For while some of the skepticism about the virtue of quick, decisive action is coming from the energy and auto industries, most independent experts also urge a long, hard look before we leap. 
 To be sure, there may well be easy opportunities to slow global warming through bottom-up steps like better insulation and modest changes in agricultural methods.
But crash programs, most economists argue, are apt to increase the cost of containing emissions without increasing the benefits. More important, they question the logic of diverting vast economic resources from other uses without a better understanding of the payoff. "The most effective policy won't be the most dramatic," cautioned Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
The economists' immediate concern is the difficulty of slowing emissions without support from China, India, Brazil and a half-dozen other big emerging economies. While Europe, America and Japan are heavy emitters of greenhouse gases, it's widely agreed that the cheap fixes lie elsewhere.
William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, estimates that bribing or bullying the developing world to switch to energy-saving, carbon-sparing technologies -- things like insulating buildings and generating electricity with natural gas rather than coal -- would get the job done for one-ninth the cost of squeezing comparable emissions out of the developed economies. His computer simulations suggest that cutting emissions in the United States back to 1990 levels by 2010 would require a doubling of energy prices, "more than the price run-up during the two oil crises," he noted.
Just as costly as doing it in the wrong place would be doing it at the wrong pace. A blitzkrieg on emissions, compared with a more deliberate effort to pick the low-hanging fruit first, would require that relatively new carbon-emitting capital -- power plants, industrial equipment and vehicles -- be scrapped rather than replaced gradually. And it would force countries, companies and consumers to adopt exotic greenhouse-friendly technologies like fuel cells before they are fully worked out -- or fully affordable. No less important, a rapid transition would tie up capital that could otherwise be used to increase productive capacity.
A hundred billion here, a hundred billion there could add up to real money.
Economists also note that while the debate in Kyoto is about annual levels of emissions, what matters in terms of climate change is the accumulated levels of greenhouse gases. Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, a research organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry, compare two paths to stabilizing atmospheric carbon at 550 parts per million, double preindustrial levels, around the end of the 21st century. With the rapid transition mandated by current international agreements, annual emissions would peak at seven billion tons around 2050. But on a cost-minimizing path, the emissions would peak at 10 billion tons but then fall more rapidly to achieve the same atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas. Taking the faster route to the same end would double the cost, adding a trillion dollars to the ultimate bill. "So much depends," Dr. Richels said, "on what we call 'when flexibility.' "
If the issues of where and when emissions should be curbed give policy wonks reason to pause, they pale in importance beside the core question: How much is climate stabilization really worth?
Sharp, rapid increases in temperature might transform the biosphere in catastrophic ways, conceivably threatening human survival. But the pace and amount of warming that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change now views as most likely -- an average increase of about four degrees Fahrenheit by 2060, with an increase in rainfall of 7 percent and a one-foot rise in sea level -- suggest a different story.
According to the most plausible computer simulations, the economic impact on the temperate zones would be relatively small; increases in agricultural productivity could more than offset the added costs from storm damage and coastal flooding. Canada and Russia could be big winners, as their growing seasons lengthen and heating bills fall. Even the United States might come out ahead: Robert Mendelsohn, an economist at Yale, estimates that output would increase by $37 billion.
The picture is far more dire for the poor, predominantly agricultural tropics, vulnerable to flooding, drought and epidemics. But in a world of limited resources, and limited generosity, Thomas Schelling, an economist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, argues that it would make more sense to divert the sums needed to curb global warming into investments that mitigate poverty in the developing world.
"They have more immediate environmental problems -- sanitation, congestion, disease -- that demand prior attention," he said. "Their best defense against climate is their own development."
Many economists who are sanguine about the likely consequences of unchecked temperature increases would still recommend buying some insurance against less likely catastrophe scenarios -- for example, the possibility that the melting of polar ice could liberate trapped methane and lead to runaway warming. But they insist that it would be irrational to throw big sums at risks this remote. Dr. Nordhaus, the Yale economist, said, "I've seen nothing that justified increasing the wholesale price of energy by more than 10 percent," roughly a nickel a gallon at the gasoline pump.
In light of both President Clinton's reluctance to do much without the participation of the developing world and the resistance of Congress to any increases in energy prices, the hurdles to any consensus on swift action appear formidable. That will please analysts who see nothing good coming from on-again, off-again hysteria over climate warming. But it worries Dr. Nordhaus, who wonders how we will ever learn to walk without a few baby steps.
"Let's do something modest," Dr. Nordhaus urged, "but let's really do it."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Cost of Reducing Emissions"
While there is general agreement that heat-trapping gases are on the rise, there is little agreement about how much it will cost to reduce emissions. Studies on the costs vary widely based on a number of factors including: the emissions goal; when that goal must be achieved; whether rights to emit gases are tradable; whether taxes are imposed on emissions and how the revenue from such taxes are used; and the depth of society's desire to meet the target.
Some studies look at reductions from the top down, trying to predict how changes in one sector of the economy will effect everything else. These models generally predict that there will be some sort of economic cost. Bottom up studies examine the economy sector by sector, looking for ways to increase efficiency. These models tend to predict overall economic benefits. Here are examples of studies that illustrate each perspective.
 
TOP DOWN
 
ORGANIZATIONS -- Stanford Univ., Electric Power Research Institute
APPROACH -- Uses bottom up for where energy comes from and top down for the rest of the econaomy
GOAL -- Atmospheric carbon levels of 550 parts per million, double the pre-industrial level.
CONCLUSION -- The most important factors in keeping the cost of reductions down are phasing them in slowly and allowing trading of emissions rights.
COMMENT -- Richard Richels, one of the study's authors, says that some pure bottom up studies underestimate the hidden costs of switching technologies to reduce emissions. For example, he says there are more fuel efficient cars than Volvos, but consumers buy Volvos because of their reputation for safety.
 
Chart tracks annual emissions levels for stabilizing carbon dioxide concentrations at 550 parts per million, from 1990 through 2100. It also shows worldwide cost of stabilizing carbon dioxide concentrations, based on 1990 investment cost
 
BOTTOM UP
 
ORGANIZATION -- Five national labs of the Department of Energy
APPROACH -- Bottom up
GOAL -- Reduce emissions by 2010, if possible to 1990 levels
CONCLUSION -- Energy savings would offset additional investments needed to reduce emissions so that net costs to the U.S. economy are estimated to be near or below zero.
COMMENT -- The study looks at two methods to reduce emissions: promoting energy efficiency and imposing a tax on emissions of carbon.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
Congress, the Kibbitzer at the Climate Table, Waits for Its Turn

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton's negotiators sit down in Japan on Dec. 1 with their international counterparts to hammer out a treaty to fight global warming, a skeptical and suspicious Congress will be watching closely over their shoulders.
A growing body of scientific evidence supports the idea that emissions of heat-trapping gases are disrupting normal weather patterns. Opinion polls show that the theory is gaining public credibility. 
 But Congress is wary. Coping with climate change is shaping up as another thorny intergenerational issue, like overhauling Social Security or Medicare, that forces lawmakers to make painful political choices now that will probably not yield tangible benefits for years or even decades.
At a spirited hearing earlier this month, House members groped with how to deal with the problem. They bombarded Timothy E. Wirth, an Undersecretary of State who has been the Administration's lead negotiator on global warming, with detailed questions that he could not answer about a treaty's economic consequences. In exasperation, Representative Dan Schaefer, a Colorado Republican who heads the House Commerce energy and power subcommittee, warned Mr. Wirth, "If you do it dumb, it could cost a lot of money."
The politics of global warming on Capitol Hill is still very much unformed. Only a handful of lawmakers have studied the complicated issue in depth. But that has not stopped many others from staking out positions consistent with those of their traditional allies in labor, business or the environmental movement.
Even after President Clinton's vow last month that the United States would not sign any climate treaty that hurt the American economy or failed to win commitments from developing nations to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, Congress is still dubious.
CONGRESS plays a pivotal role in the issue. Any treaty will require approval from two-thirds of the Senate. The House has no formal role in ratifying treaties, but every step needed to carry out an accord, from policy changes to spending on programs, would have to go through that chamber.
The lawmakers' underlying fear is that the United States will end up shouldering an unfair share of the emissions reductions. That, they say, would lead to some kind of energy tax to curb consumption, which would chill the economy, which would cost jobs. Legislators also express concern that binding limits on emissions might be deferred for large developing countries like China and Mexico, projected as the fastest-growing polluters of the future.
Republicans are already promising to make tax cuts a major issue in the 1998 Congressional elections, so they say any accord that even hints at a tax increase will be dead on arrival.
"Protecting our environment is an honorable goal," Representative Bill Paxon, a fast-rising Republican star from New York, said earlier this fall. "But we must ask ourselves an equally important question: 'Can we afford to destroy our children's economic future in the process?' "
Of course, unyielding opposition to action would be a tricky proposition for even the most free-market Republicans. President Clinton and the Democrats have used environmental issues -- and the perceived disdain Republicans have for them -- as an effective political cudgel in the past two years. But in the current political climate, economic concerns trump most environmental worries.
The science of global warming is still a contentious issue among lawmakers. A solid core of members of Congress -- most of them Republicans, but some Democrats -- insist that the proposed emissions changes are based on inconclusive evidence. That position is supported by the major foes of a climate treaty: the oil, coal and automobile industries and major electric utilities.
"The science doesn't fit into neat little boxes," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who is leading a Senate observer group to the final negotiations in Kyoto, Japan. "Many climatologists will tell you this is nonsense. We just don't know enough about it."
But other lawmakers are leery of the Administration's plan to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2012 even though they agree that there is an impending crisis. Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who is a powerful defender of the nation's coal industry, said, "The problem is global and can only be solved on a global basis."
Democrats and Republicans are divided within their own ranks. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who staunchly defends Detroit's automobile industry, criticize the Administration for going too far.
An avid environmentalist, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, says President Clinton must make a stronger case for a global agreement. "There is no consensus on the Hill, and there won't be until the President explains the issue better to the American people," Mr. Waxman said.
CONGRESS has already influenced the Administration's negotiating position. On a vote of 95 to 0 in July, the Senate passed a resolution urging the Administration not to pursue a treaty unless the agreement requires developing nations to control their emissions.
This nonbinding resolution forced the Administration to harden its stance toward developing countries. The measure also urged Mr. Clinton to avoid any treaty that would cause "serious harm" to the American economy, a provision that helped move the Administration away from considering direct energy taxes and toward a series of tax credits and research subsidies to encourage energy conservation.
"Our challenge," said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, "is to shape an agreement which sets tough, realistic global-emission reduction goals while harnessing market forces to lower costs, foster technological development and insure economic growth."
Treaties are complex documents that, even after they are signed, take years of preparation before they can be ratified. "Assuming a fully acceptable treaty is reached in Kyoto," said Todd Stern, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton on climate change, "you could be well into 1999 by the time you're talking about ratification."

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
U.S. Gas Output Is Rising

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
THE United States said today that its emissions of heat-trapping gases grew last year at the highest rate since the nation pledged to cut them back.
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases grew 3.4 percent in 1996, the latest year for which comprehensive estimates are available, the Energy Department said in a report. The department attributed the increase to strong economic growth, unusually severe weather and increased use of coal by electric utilities. 
 Emissions from energy use in residential and commercial buildings grew 6.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, despite programs intended to increase energy efficiency.
At the same time, the report said, growing consumption of fuel by less efficient cars and light trucks suggests that motor vehicles may soon overtake industry as the largest source of greenhouse gases.
"The economy is booming, energy prices are relatively low, and a lot of people are paying a lot less attention to energy efficiency," said Steven Nadel of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization.
The report was acutely embarrassing to American negotiators at world climate talks this year, because the United States, with less than a 20th of the world's population, gives off almost a fourth of the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.
In a treaty on climate change signed by 160 nations in 1992, the United States and other industrial countries pledged to reduce their emissions of such gases to the 1990 level by 2000.
But American emissions in 1996 were 7.4 percent above 1990 levels, the report said. For some time the Clinton Administration has forecast that by the end of the decade, emissions of the gases in the United States will be 13 percent higher than in 1990. With the economy still growing and people driving farther in cars that use more gasoline per mile, the upward trend is widely expected to continue.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING: How Fast to Cut Back? Two Views;
Turning Green Puts Some in the Black Now

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GARY HIRSHBERG, the president of Stonyfield Farm, knows two ways to increase his profits. By expanding his yogurt-manufacturing capacity, he can pay back his investment in a year and keep growing. Or by installing readily available technology for energy conservation at his New Hampshire plant, he can recoup his costs in two years or less and bank the future savings till the cows come home.
Mr. Hirshberg has chosen to do both. Stonyfield, he says, will increase production 40 percent next year. By taking steps like installing efficient lights and reusing waste heat, he is now using 9 percent less energy each year per pint of yogurt, increasing his profit margin. And by investing some of those energy savings in forestry projects that trap carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere, he has reduced the company's net manufacturing emissions of carbon dioxide to zero, he says. 
 "Forget the moral principles, forget our children, forget the flooding of South Florida, forget malaria," he said, ticking off reasons to fight global warming. "We are willing to support this strictly on the economics."
Stories like this have gripped President Clinton's attention and prompted him to promise that the transition to an economy that relies far less on carbon fuels will be essentially painless and can begin today.
"If we do it right, protecting the climate will yield not costs, but profits; not burdens, but benefits; not sacrifice, but a higher standard of living," Mr. Clinton said in October when he outlined the Administration's proposals for fighting climate change. "Energy savings give better service at lower cost with higher profit."
Traditional economists and big industry groups say that unless energy prices go up sharply, companies and consumers will be slow to adopt new technologies, even though the investments may pay off at today's energy prices. But there is also a substantial group of analysts who say that a profitable shift to greener energy pastures is under way and will accelerate if the Government adopts policies that promote conservation.
If prices for the carbon in fossil fuels rise in the future as a result of the Administration's proposals, this group says, that will only expand opportunities faster, tamping down any economic damage.
The Administration's proposal would limit emissions of carbon dioxide by issuing emissions permits that companies could buy and sell. Companies that achieved emissions reductions cheaply could profitably sell their excess permits to companies with higher emission-control costs. The effect would be to put a price on the carbon in fuel, a price that would reflect the costs of controlling emissions. Some forecasters predict that under this approach, the price of the carbon in fuel would rise by $100 a ton or more, making oil, coal and gas much more expensive; others say innovations would keep the cost much lower.
"Somewhere between $25 and $50 a ton of carbon, new technologies become so unbelievably attractive that you cap the price," said Joseph J. Romm, the Energy Department's top official in charge of renewable energy and efficiency programs. "At $50 per ton of carbon, people will be installing windmills as fast as the manufacturers can make them."
As the prices of fossil fuels rise, he explained, it makes less sense to operate coal-fired power plants, which would be swept away by cheaper ways to make electricity.
"We are not betting on one technology," Mr. Romm said. "It is a hundred technologies, each one of which can do its share."
AMORY Lovins, the co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research group that is a leading proponent of energy conservation, said, "There are huge opportunities for profitably improving the energy of using energy, but they remain unbought because of 30-odd specific types of roadblocks that keep the market from working properly. Turning each of those obstacles into a business opportunity can save a lot of energy quickly even at present energy prices."
All manner of gizmos for home, office and factory are either on the drawing board or on the shelf to help conserve energy or to produce it more cleanly in the 21st century, the optimists say. The list includes photovoltaics, fuel cells, biomass fuels, fluorescent lights, insulating windows, efficient cars, stingy thermostats and miserly appliances.
But doubters, especially traditional economists, say it is well documented that people neglect to invest in devices that save energy and pay for themselves at current energy prices. In their daily lives, many people forgo simple conservation measures that offer quick savings, like turning a water heater's temperature to 125 degrees from 150 degrees.
"If only 20 percent of the homes in the U.S. used high-efficiency washers," said John Tomlinson, the project manager of a study done by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on Maytag's new washing machines, "we would save enough energy to heat 800,000 homes."
But those washing machines can cost $900, and many consumers hesitate to shell out that much money to save money later.
On the other side of the energy business, where power is produced and sold, the optimists predict that lots of clean technology is just over the horizon.
An analysis of research goals done by the President's Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology optimistically suggested in November that wind-power farms in the Great Plains could "plausibly" export electricity all over the country at a competitive price by 2030.
One reasonable target, the report suggested, would be to replace old coal-fired power plants with windmills. The plants that produce nearly a third of American carbon dioxide emissions will be ready for retirement in the next few decades. If wind power production grows about 33 percent annually from now until then, the switch to carbon-free electricity would be well under way by then.
"This is a very rapid growth rate, but is less than that of the U.S. nuclear industry from 1957 to 1977," the report noted.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
Deep in Siberia's Forest, Finding Clues to the 'Missing Sink'

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SHAPLEY 

 BODY:
MARCHING slowly northward toward the Siberian tundra, a vast army of larch trees is a key suspect in one of climatology's most pressing mysteries: the whereabouts of the nearly two billion tons of carbon dioxide that disappear each year into something other than thin air.
And though their feathery, yellow-green leaves fluttered to the soil months ago, the Russian larches are regarded as a symbol of hope by many climate scientists, of the chance that some unpredictable natural mechanism will moderate an otherwise inexorable trend toward a warmer world. 
 But they are quick to add that the Russian forest, which accounts for one-fifth of the world's trees, could just as easily stand for something else: the many uncertainties facing a young science being asked to make forecasts about a system that is, after all, as complicated as the earth itself.
While the larches and other forests in the Northern Hemisphere appear to be retarding global warming, researchers say, it is also possible that in a few decades they could be accelerating it.
Call it the case of the missing sink -- carbon sink being the term climate scientists use for anything that absorbs and retains carbon dioxide. In the late 1970's, carbon sinks were just arithmetic, pursued by oceanographers and ecologists who were trying to account for all the terms in the earth-air carbon budget. They totted up sources of CO2 and subtracted the amount absorbed by known sinks, like the ocean, to predict how fast mankind's outflow should translate into atmospheric accumulations.
The figures didn't add up. Carbon was missing -- lots of carbon. Last year the missing sink was an estimated 1.8 billion tons of carbon, more than one-fifth of the 8.1 billion tons of the gas pumped out that year by human activity, according to the latest data compiled by Pieter P. Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, in Boulder, Colo.
In a 1990 paper published in Science, Dr. Tans, with Dr. Taro Takahashi of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Dr. Inez Y. Fung of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, proposed that the forests and soils of the Northern Hemisphere must be the missing sink.
Scientists have since concluded that this sink's increased absorption of carbon is a feedback mechanism from increased carbon dioxide levels in the air.
Through photosynthesis, all green plants absorb carbon to grow. Higher levels of carbon in the air fertilize larger, faster-growing trees. Despite the widespread deforestation drawing attention in the tropics, across the Northern Hemisphere there are a lot more trees. With the decline of lumbering across parts of Canada, the United States and western Russia, and the removal of other lands from agricultural use, trees are growing again on millions of hectares.
And the rise in global temperatures that many scientists already attribute to mankind's carbon emissions has extended the range of trees like the larch northward.
Some important confirmation came when Dr. Olga N. Krankina left the St. Petersburg Forest Academy for Oregon State University, bearing analyses of decades of detailed data kept by Soviet forest rangers, which she turned into estimates of these forests' carbon storage.
In a 1996 paper, Dr. Krankina estimated that Russia's forests could absorb up to 2 billion more tons of carbon, between forest regrowth and expansion on the northern frontier -- an amount she says is equal to three years of Russian fossil fuel emissions.
Such comparisons have led forest-rich industrial nations like the United States to argue that the carbon their sinks absorb should be counted against the amount their power plants and factories emit in computing targets for reductions.
But leading scientists warn against putting too much reliance on forests. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York noted that no one has much of a clue as to how feedback mechanisms would work under conditions never before experienced. It's possible, he said, that something that is now a sink could "fill up," or could even become a net source of carbon. The behavior of sinks could make the difference between manageable climate change and potential catastrophe, he said.
FOR her part, Dr. Krankina acknowledged in a recent interview that for the Russian forests to absorb those extra 2 billion tons of carbon would require "all the cleared land to be regenerated and maintained, and the extent of fire will have to be reduced," although Russian forest rangers' budgets have been starved in their country's recent economic turmoil. And even under such ideal conditions the forest sink would soon slow its growth, meaning that the projected 2 billion tons would do little more than buy a few years' breathing space.
Indeed, just as the Russian forest's northern fringe holds out hope, trees are dying on its southern edge, in what could be a preview of the effect of higher temperatures.
Last year in southern Siberia, Herman H. Shugart of the University of Virginia saw "hundreds of square miles of dead trees," killed by silkworms and bark beetles, whose range has been growing. Dead trees are vulnerable to fires. In the long run, Dr. Shugart said, "You just don't know how those terms in the carbon budget equation are going to work out."

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING: Around the Globe, Big Worries and Small Signs of Progress;
In India, Climate Evokes Old East-West Passions

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
JUST as India and the West had begun to put past frictions behind them, global warming has come along to reignite the sort of passions that were commonplace during the cold war, when India's perspectives were those of an ally of the Soviet Union and a founder of what was known as the non-aligned movement, with its fixation on the evils done to developing nations by the rapacious West.
In the months leading up to the United Nations conference on climate change in Kyoto, Japan, Indian environmentalists and politicians have joined in a chorus of angry denunciations of proposals that Western nations, particularly the United States, have advanced for limiting emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. Phrases like "environmental colonialism" and the "Western rape and pillage of the world's resources" have poured forth, along with predictions that Kyoto could forge a new and even deeper split between the richer and poorer nations of the earth. 
 At one level, the Indian anger seems curiously misplaced, considering the acknowledged deterioration of India's own environment and the blame that many of these same environmentalists and politicians place on governmental failures at home. If India's environment is visibly among the most polluted anywhere, particularly in terms of air quality in the major cities, it is a problem closely linked to a burgeoning population, now nearly 980 million, that has almost tripled in the 50 years since independence and continues to grow by 20 million every year with scant sign of any government effort to promote birth control.
As anybody struggling with the choking levels of air pollution in New Delhi, Bombay or Calcutta can attest, India is fighting a losing battle with urban traffic levels that double every five years, Dickensian factories that generally ignore environmental controls and the reliance in heavy industry on heavily sulfurous coal. The situation in New Delhi, the capital, has become so threatening that some Western embassies have begun discouraging the assignment to India of any diplomat or family member with respiratory problems, especially small children. Indian experts have even warned that rising sea levels could cost the country large portions of its 3,000-mile coastline within the next 50 years.
But when it comes to international efforts to deal with global warming, many of those who will have a decisive voice in India's policies approach the issue as though environmental degradation is mainly the fault of, and a problem for, the industrialized nations of the West. If there were any doubt of the strength of feeling on the matter, it was dispelled when Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral attended the meeting in Edinburgh in October of the nations of the Commonwealth and agreed to a closing communique that said, seemingly innocuously, that all countries attending the Kyoto meeting "will need to play their part in policies that would result in significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
Mr. Gujral was met with a barrage of criticism at home to the effect that he had sold out India and other developing nations with large greenhouse gas emissions, China and Brazil prominent among them. Those nations have said that it is up to the United States and other Western nations to cut back on emissions without imposing similar requirements on poorer countries that are struggling to catch up economically with the West. This position has been squarely rejected by President Clinton, who announced in September that the United States "will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in the effort."
Indians marshal numerous arguments against their country's accepting any mandatory emissions controls. Many are rooted in political arguments that depict the "one-worldism" of Western environmentalists as a mask for efforts to shackle the economic development of poorer nations just as they show signs of beginning to claim a greater share of the world's wealth.
Even among Indian environmentalists who accept the need for limits, there is a common political premise: that whatever environmental regime emerges from Kyoto should be based on "per capita entitlements" to pollute the atmosphere, an approach that would ultimately allow India and China, with nearly two-fifths of the world's population, to pump more carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere than the United States, Canada and all the nations of the European Union combined. JOHN F. BURNS

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING: Around the Globe, Big Worries and Small Signs of Progress;
Island Nations Fear Sea Could Swamp Them

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TARAWA, Kiribati, March 2

 BODY:
ONE sunny day in January, as Teunaia Abeta stood by and watched, horror-struck, a high tide came rolling in from the turquoise lagoon and did not stop.
There was no typhoon, no rain, no wind, just an eerie rising tide that lapped higher and higher, swallowing up Mr. Abeta's thatched-roof home and scores of others in this Pacific island nation. 
 "This had never happened before," said Mr. Abeta, 73, who wore only his colorful lava-lava, a skirtlike garment, as he sat on the raised platform of his home fingering a hand-rolled cigarette. "It was never like this when I was a boy."
That tidal surge was followed by another one in February. The flooding has helped focus minds here on warnings that global warming could cause the seas to rise enough in the next century or so to obliterate island nations like this one scattered in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
"The only resource we have is water," said Phillip Muller, foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, another country that could easily be drowned by rising seas. "Our livelihood is the sea. Now, all of a sudden, it's not a friend. It's threatening our existence."
Greenhouse warming is linked to a rising of the seas in two ways: by causing the water to expand as it warms and by melting glaciers and icecaps. "It's so close to the heart here," said Giff Johnson, editor of the Marshall Islands' newspaper, "because you're talking about people's very existence being wiped out by the ocean rising."
Industrialized countries like the United States are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, but they are reluctant to curb industry much while the scientific jury is still out on the seriousness of the effects. That annoys the island nations, which argue that by the time the jury reaches its verdict, they may be visible only at low tide. "It's like little ants making a home on a leaf floating on a pond," grumbled Teburoro Tito, President of Kiribati. "And the elephants go to drink and roughhouse in the water. The problem isn't the ants' behavior. It's a problem of how to convince the elephants to be more gentle."
Many of the island countries in the Pacific, including Kiribati (pronounced KIH-rih-bus), are collections of coral formations. Usually a string of islets around a turquoise lagoon, they resemble not so much nations as sandbars. Each island peeps just a few feet above sea level and is only about a hundred yards wide, sometimes less. A country like Kiribati, situated about halfway between California and Australia, can be three times as big at low tide as at high.
The countries most likely to go under the sea include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, all in the Pacific, and the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean. Many other island countries, including Tonga, Palau, Nauru, Niue and the Federated States of Micronesia, may lose much of their territory but for now are probably not in danger of total submersion.
The populations are small: Kiribati has 75,000 people, and only 10,000 live on Tuvalu. Those numbers pale beside the 150 million additional refugees forecast worldwide as a result of climate change by 2050, according to a 1993 academic study published in the journal Bioscience. Other studies suggest that a rise of three feet in ocean levels would force the evacuation of perhaps 70 million Chinese and 32 million Bangladeshis.
Yet at least countries like Bangladesh would survive, though perhaps in truncated form. The Pacific islanders fret not only about whether their countries will exist outside of history books, but also about changes they see in their climate today.
"These aren't storms, they're surges," said Mr. Johnson of the Marshall Islands. "It's nice weather, and all of a sudden water is pouring into your living room. It's very clear that something is happening in the Pacific, and these islands are feeling it."
Perhaps the most comprehensive study was issued last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of experts. It suggested that seas may rise 18 inches by 2100. But it emphasized the enormous uncertainties and suggested that the real figure could be much lower or higher.
Even a rise of two or three feet would devastate Pacific island countries like Kiribati. Technical solutions, like sea walls, are available to protect low-lying lands, but those solutions are unaffordable for most low-lying island countries. In Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where the islets are in some places only as wide as the two-lane road that traverses each of them, a single wave often sprays the country from coast to coast. One study found that protecting the capital alone would cost up to three times the total national economic output. NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

HEADLINE: It Takes All Sorts to Make The World of Judith Ivey

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
In a profession in which vanity comes second only to ambition, Judith Ivey is close to an anomaly. At 46, with 25 years' experience, she is proud to be considered a veteran character actress, someone who can swing back and forth between mothers and daughters while adapting herself to the widest diversity of personalities and accents.
By making movies (six last year), she can subsidize her stage habit, and she works with equal ease on Broadway and far Off Broadway. With supporting roles in two current films ("The Devil's Advocate" and "Washington Square") and a string of television credits, she is at work in Martin Sherman's "Madhouse in Goa" at the Second Stage. 
 As with so many other aspects of her career, she is doing "Madhouse" because she likes her role, or rather, her roles: as Mrs. Honey, a garrulous Tennessee Williams-esque Southern lady on tour in Greece, and in the second act as a somewhat less defined friend of an ailing writer. Color these women Ivey.
The roles were originally played in London by Vanessa Redgrave, with a far-flung semblance of a Southern accent. When Ms. Ivey was told at a recent lunch that her performance in the play was better than that of Ms. Redgrave, she beamed her delight: "Oh, wow! That made my whole day. I can quit now."
Onstage and in films, she is the soul of spontaneity, with a naturalness that is the opposite of histrionics. No matter how layered the character, she is believable, which is what people have been saying about her since she made her first impact on New York theater in 1982 as a 60's dropout in Deborah Eisenberg's "Pastorale" and on Broadway in Nell Dunn's "Steaming," a slice of English life, in which she played a Cockney, without clothes and, in the Ivey manner, without pretensions.
For "Steaming" and David Rabe's "Hurlyburly," she won back-to-back Tony Awards as best featured actress, but because of the limited number of Broadway plays, she did not find herself surrounded by a cascade of offers. She chose to appear Off Off Broadway in "Second Lady," M. Kilburg Reedy's poignant monodrama about the wife of a Vice-Presidential candidate who is unfit for office and for marriage.
Then she went to Hollywood, to "raise my TVQ, my profile, to be more recognizable in order to be a part of the Broadway theater," she said. This has led her to a bicoastal life, personally and professionally. With her husband and two children, she has homes in both Manhattan and Los Angeles.
Born in El Paso and raised in Odessa, Tex., she spent a nomadic childhood, to which she credits her ear for regionalisms. At Illinois State University, she polished her talent for art and for acting. Her fellow students included Gary Sinise, Terry Kinney and others who later founded the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. Several years older, she had begun her career while they were still starting out. At first, she seemed to be making more of a name for herself in commercials. Playing Juliet at a Chicago theater, she finished her performance and then drove to a restaurant for a long night shooting as the Red Lobster girl.
Looking for greater opportunity, she packed her belongings in a U-Haul and left for New York City. She was soon cast as an understudy in Alan Ayckbourn's "Bedroom Farce" and then took over the role from an English actress. Pam Gems's "Dusa, Fish, Stash and Vi" was followed by a role in the unemployment line, where another actor said that a top casting agent had called her the hottest young actress in New York. "I thought what the hell are the rest of them doing -- collecting unemployment?"
At one discouraging point, she considered taking up another profession. Because of her love of animals, she thought about becoming a veterinarian. Her agent talked her out of that. If she had gone in that direction, of course, she would now be a veteran vet.
Sticking to her principles -- choose well and keep busy -- and taking the advice of Joanne Woodward that acting is cyclical, she became self-supporting. Her preference would be to work in a repertory company, but seeing none on her horizon, she has had to create her own kind of rep, as exemplified by the range of her current roles.
In "Washington Square," she plays a kindly aunt out of Henry James; in "The Devil's Advocate," she is a Bible-believing Southern lady who has had a brief affair with the devil himself (Al Pacino), and in "What the Deaf Man Heard" on television, she played another in her series of loudmouth waitresses, but one with a sensitive heart.
Speaking about these roles led her to a discussion of the art of character-building through accents and manners. Often she starts with someone from life. While filming "What the Deaf Man Heard" in North Carolina, she saw Mrs. Honey, or rather, a Mrs. Honey.
Shopping in a furniture store, she heard a woman say -- and she mimicked her thick Texas accent -- "Ah want tew o-dah a bay-yed."
"I just looked up and there was Mrs. Honey, with her black hair and silver streak," she said. "I stopped still in my tracks and memorized as much about her as I could." When she returned to New York to do "A Madhouse in Goa," she drew a picture of that woman for the show's costume designer, and began her immersion in the role: transformation through a mastery of detail.
In rapid order, she demonstrated her command of dialects, often as it related to her life. From Texas, she moved to Colorado ("the ideal non-dialect sound") and southern Illinois. ("It's real ny-zel and flaaat," she said, "one of the worst sounds in the wurrld. Like nails on a blackboard.") From there, she shifted to Cockney, North Country and Brooklyn, which she did as Aunt Blanche in the film version of "Brighton Beach Memoirs." When the director Gene Saks said, "I never thought I would have to say this to you, Judy, but you're too Jewish," she took that as a high compliment.
Another distinguishing feature of her acting is her eccentric humor, which she manages to find in each of her characters, even those like the mother in Jon Robin Baitz's "Fair Country," who is deep into depression. For her, "there is irony in everything," which is why she has been rereading "Macbeth," searching for a comic dimension in Lady Macbeth's seduction of her husband, a kind of "teasing sexuality" that she has not yet seen explored by other actresses.
What she likes about theater in contrast to films is that onstage, "I'm the editor," she said. "I'm the focus puller. I'm everybody. I get to make this happen in this moment."

HEADLINE: Oil's Numbers Game

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Oil supplies and prices are likely to remain relatively stable even though the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided over the weekend to raise its production quotas by about 10 percent.
Industry analysts said that the higher quotas merely acknowledged the amount of oil that OPEC members were already producing, because some of them, like Venezuela and Nigeria, had been ignoring their previous quotas. 
 The main beneficiaries of the new quotas will be Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, because they alone have the capacity to increase production quickly.
Some experts said that the net result of the higher quotas would be the addition of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil a day in supplies from OPEC countries. That is a modest amount, considering that world demand for oil is expected to grow by about two million barrels a day next year.
"There will not be a flood of new OPEC oil," said John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a research group for the oil industry based in New York.
Thus, oil prices could average a little lower next year than the roughly $20 a barrel this year. Most analysts agreed that OPEC's decision would help to keep prices firm in the long run, though prices could drop this week in immediate reaction to the higher quotas.
At their meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Saturday, OPEC members agreed to raise their production quota to 27.5 million barrels a day from 25.5 million.
Quota cheating by some countries had brought OPEC's actual production to an estimated 27.8 million barrels a day in October.
Analysts said OPEC ministers appeared to have received reassurance from Saudi Arabia -- which under the new quotas could add 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day -- that it would continue to restrain production if world demand was lower than expected.
The increased quota gives more flexibility to Saudi Arabia, by far the OPEC member with the largest reserve capacity, to manage its production. That, in turn, would provide OPEC with more breathing room to allow for more production from Iraq if sanctions against it are eased by the United Nations next year.
"The politics on how to absorb Iraq is going to be easier," said Adam E. Sieminski, an oil analyst for NatWest Securities.
Saudi restraint could also help offset higher production from non-OPEC sources like the North Sea, where a number of projects will begin production.
But barring such developments, Saudi Arabia -- along with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- is expected to take advantage of the higher quotas and add production.
Saudi Arabia's quota was raised to 8.76 million barrels a day from 8 million; Kuwait's was raised to 2.19 million from 2 million, and the United Arab Emirates' was raised to 2.37 million from 2.16 million.
Mr. Lichtblau said these three countries were the only ones that had the spare capacity to add more output quickly.
He noted that Saudi Arabia was the main OPEC member to push for the higher quotas, and it did so because the Saudis believed that OPEC needed to re-establish its credibility in the oil markets.
"It was getting silly," Mr. Lichtblau said, pointing to the quota cheating by some OPEC members.
The Saudi Minister, Ali Naimi, who did not talk to reporters after the four-day meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, was able to prevail at the meeting to get the higher quotas with support from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
Analysts said that the biggest uncertainty still hanging over the oil markets next year was Iraq.
If Iraq continues to be allowed to export only about 700,000 barrels a day under the current oil-for-food limitations set by the United Nations, the chances of world prices staying close to this year's level are good.
If the sanctions are eased, however, Iraqi oil production could rise to close to 1.3 million barrels a day, possibly leading to sharply lower prices unless the Saudis hold back their production.
There is also some uncertainty on the demand side. The current financial crisis in Southeast Asia could result in slower economic growth and thus lower the demand for oil, which grew worldwide by a strong 3.5 percent this year.
Still, OPEC ministers were optimistic that strong demand would offset higher production.
Demand is expected to grow from an average of 73.8 million barrels a day this year to 75.6 million barrels a day next year, according to the International Energy Agency.
"Prices will hold up," said Issa Mohammed al-Mazidi, the oil minister of Kuwait. "This rise is a very reasonable one."

HEADLINE: Money Starts to Show in Internet Shopping

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
For all the chat, the browsing, the waiting and the endless cyberhype, much of American business has stared at the Internet and thought, skeptically: "Show me the money."
This holiday season may be the first in which consumers respond by showing businesses that offer goods and services on line a significant amount of sales. Many Internet merchants have found that volume is up sharply this year as more consumers learn how to find what they want and become comfortable that they will not be defrauded when they do. 
 The American Express Company calculates that $4 billion to $6 billion will be spent making credit card purchases over the Internet this year, with sales increasing at more than a 400 percent pace annually. More conservatively, Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., puts the figure at $2.4 billion, double last year's total.
"Nineteen ninety-seven has been a watershed year for many merchants on line," said Kate Delhagen, an analyst with Forrester Research. Its recent survey found that 25 percent of what it estimates to be 40 million Internet users had bought something on line.
Of course, Internet sales are still only a tiny part of the overall economy. And many shoppers will always want to see, feel and carry home what they buy.
"Back in the early 1980's, when the Home Shopping Network first came on line, I can remember people on Wall Street said, 'Retail is dead and everyone will be buying on their TV's,' " said Nathan Morton, chief executive of Computer City, the superstore unit of the Tandy Corporation. "Well, a couple of decades later that hasn't happened." Nonetheless, Computer City, looking at the number of technology-savvy consumers, is joining the rush to sell on the Internet with a site of its own.
Internet merchants see this holiday season as a critical test of the appeal of buying on line.
"Seventy-eight percent of our members are window shopping on line," but only 12 percent have made a purchase, said Wendy Brown, vice president for electronic commerce at America Online Inc., which offers links to dozens of merchants that collectively are making one million sales a month. "Our job this holiday is to convert more shoppers to buyers."
Even without a lift from holiday sales, the Internet is rapidly growing important to certain businesses. Already, 2 percent to 3 percent of the computer hardware in the country is purchased on line, Forrester estimates. The Dell Computer Corporation, a pioneer, is selling more than $3 million worth of personal computers a day on its World Wide Web site, triple the pace of eight months ago.
But on-line shopping is rapidly moving beyond the obvious appeal of computer products. The next biggest sellers are airline tickets, books, and music and gift items. Indeed, 10 percent of the sales of 1-800-Flowers, the florist service, has been on line this year.
The convenience of on-line shopping has appeal from the biggest to the smallest purchases. Two of the fastest-growing categories are on-line purchases of automobiles and groceries. Though some of the initial department store efforts to sell fashion on line have been flops, some merchants are finding that they can tap into the same market that buys clothes from catalogues.
"If you know how a pair of Eddie Bauer jeans fits, you don't need to go to the store to buy it," said Ms. Brown of America Online.
It is that same quest for convenience that propelled the mail-order business over the last two decades and that is driving many people on line. Internet stores are open around the clock and are equally accessible to people around the world.
"The malls are getting more and more crowded," said Robert Fisher, president of Gap Inc., which started selling jeans and gifts on its Web site two weeks ago. "Customers will come on line and find an easy place to shop." The Gap's site re-creates some of the experience of store shopping with a computer animation section that allows users to see how various combinations of shirts, pants and shoes will look together.
The peak shopping hours are late morning to early afternoon, as buyers take advantage of the faster Internet access offered on many office computers. But the Internet caters to night owls, as well. Forty percent of the purchases on America Online occur after 9 P.M.
Another appeal of on-line shopping is the prospect of finding a bargain. With lower operating costs, some companies are offering significant discounts. Amazon.com Inc., the on-line bookseller, offers some titles at 40 percent off the list price. A series of searches conducted by the accounting firm Ernst & Young found that for 90 percent of a basket of gifts -- ranging from cordless drills to cameras to bunches of roses -- the Internet offers better deals than traditional stores.
Yet not everyone can find all those bargains. For many, on-line shopping is filled with all the exasperation that accompanies many of the other highly promoted and imperfectly realized features of the Internet. The most frequent complaint from on-line shoppers is that finding and buying things is slow and complex. Some of that is caused by the delays inherent in Internet connections, particularly the slow speed of the modems that people use to connect from home. But many sites, shoppers say, are so poorly organized that shopping can be about as efficient as using a phone book that is not in alphabetical order.
"Speed is the name of the game," said Scot Melland, who runs the Net Market Internet shopping mall for CUC International Inc., the consumer services company. CUC is releasing a new version of the site that removes some of the initial fancy features, such as moving messages, that slowed shopping.
Mainstream merchants were reluctant to move onto the Internet, especially after a decade of experiments with home shopping and early on-line services proved to be expensive flops. But the most recent batch of Internet start-up companies has caught the attention of the biggest store chains. Perhaps the best known of these has been Amazon.com, which had sales of $38 million in the third quarter, up 32 percent from the second quarter of this year.
Thus, many of the names in the typical mall or strip center -- like Barnes & Noble Inc., the Gap and Toys "R" Us Inc., have started to open sites on the Internet, giving on-line shopping added visibility and pushing it closer to the mainstream.
The nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is replicating its endless aisles with a Web store selling everything from computers to corn flakes. Sears, Roebuck & Company is going more slowly, starting with a site to sell just its Craftsman line of tools.
And even if Internet sales are small, more and more merchants are finding that opening a store on the Internet is an attractive investment compared with a store in a mall.
"If you ask whether we should build a store in Morristown, N.J., or spend the same money for an Internet site that can reach the whole world, light bulbs go off," said Ms. Delhagen of Forrester.
Indeed, Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor equipment company, found that with 20 people, its year-old Internet operation sells as much as a store that employs 80 people.
"Our sales are increasing by 30 to 100 percent each month," said Matthew Hyde, the manager of the on-line store. "By 1999, I expect to sell as much as our biggest stores."

HEADLINE: Coleman A. Young, 79, Mayor of Detroit And Political Symbol for Blacks, Is Dead

 BODY:
Coleman A. Young, the combative, tart-tongued former union organizer who became the first black Mayor of Detroit when he was elected in 1973 and then went on to run the city for a record 20 years, died on Saturday at Sinai Hospital in Detroit. He was 79.
The cause was respiratory failure, officials said. 
 A popular and streetwise politician, Mr. Young became a hero to black voters who saw his victory as a sign of their growing power in local government, especially in cities in need of healing after race riots in the previous decade. His election came as a growing list of black mayors in Northern cities were elected by black voters long frustrated with white-dominated administrations.
But like the other black mayors, Mr. Young also presided over a city that more than once came close to bankruptcy. Detroit had already been reeling from high unemployment in the automobile industry, a high crime rate and deteriorating housing when he was elected.
Afterward, the Motor City lost even more of its factories, stores and jobs as well as thousands of its middle-class residents, particularly whites who had been moving to the suburbs in great numbers since Detroit's 1967 race riots. Mr. Young, in his autobiography, "Hard Stuff" (Viking Penguin, 1994), noted that 1.6 million whites lived in Detroit at the end of World War II and that only 200,000 were left by 1990.
"I don't dispute the gravity of Detroit's problems," he wrote. "They are basically the same problems that beset every American city, except that they are magnified by the fact that modern Detroit was built around the auto industry, which has been losing blood for two decades, and the accompanying reality that white flight, industrial and social, has left Detroit with the damnedest demographics in America."
Mr. Young, inaugurated in January 1974, decided that the city could not survive without cooperation among business, labor and the state and Federal governments. So he called together some of Detroit's leading business and labor figures and persuaded them to approve his plan for reshaping the riverfront. With their help, the Renaissance Center office-retail complex became the showpiece of downtown, and the adjacent Hart Plaza, a riverfront park, became the area's anchor.
The center, built for $350 million by a consortium of of more than 50 corporate investors led by the Ford Motor Company, opened in 1977. It included four cylindrical office towers and a hotel. In May 1996, the Renaissance Center was bought by General Motors for about $80 million, apparently reflecting the real-estate market's wariness in investing in a deteriorated downtown.
Mr. Young also developed a five-year economic plan for Detroit that he presented to President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 with the idea that it could be a blueprint for saving the nation's cities. Mr. Young had hoped that Mr. Ford, a former Michigan Congressman, would not let the state's largest city falter. But the plan failed to gain the support of the Republican Administration.
Even so, Mr. Young's efforts led to several major construction projects in his first and second terms, including new plants for General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation. The Mayor was also credited with keeping Detroit financially afloat in the late 1970's and early 1980's by persuading city workers to accept cuts in salaries and fringe benefits and voters to approve a $96 million increase in income taxes.
But that was not enough to keep businesses and residents from fleeing the city. Although the riverfront began to look prosperous, the rest of downtown was often compared to a war zone, with neighborhoods crumbling, businesses boarded up and poverty remaining high.
Still, black Detroiters viewed Mr. Young as their future and their hope. That view was first reflected in Mr. Young's three-day inauguration celebration, when blacks joined the city's political elite. It was also at that inauguration that Mr. Young's stormy relationship with the largely white suburbs seemed to begin.
"I issue an open warning to all dope pushers, to all rip-off artists, to all muggers," he said at his inauguration in pledging to fight crime. "It is time to leave Detroit. Hit Eight Mile Road. And I don't give a damn if they are black or white, if they wear Superfly suits or blue uniforms with silver badges. Hit the road."
The reaction to Mr. Young's speech illustrated the depth of the racial divide between the city and its suburbs. Blacks heard one thing in his inaugural remarks while whites heard something completely different. Blacks applauded the new Mayor, understanding him to say that Detroit would get tough on crime and address their concerns about brutality and harassment in the largely white police department.
But because Eight Mile Road is the border between Detroit and its northern suburbs, the Mayor's statement angered many white suburbanites. They saw the warning as an invitation for the city's criminals to enter the suburbs and wreak havoc, and it troubled many white city residents, who saw it as an attack on the police.
Most white voters had backed Mr. Young's opponent, John F. Nichols, a white former Police Commissioner, who lost by a slim margin. Mr. Young won the election largely on the promise to ease tension between the police and black residents.
As a step in that direction, he eliminated a police decoy unit whose officers had been accused of killing 22 black residents and arresting hundreds more without cause during its two-and-a-half-year existence. And he began a hiring program that infused the police force with officers from a wide range of ethnic and racial minorities. Under the program, the proportion of blacks rose to more than 50 percent in 1993 from less than 10 percent in 1974 and has remained at about that level.
Both actions were credited with reducing the number of brutality complaints against the city's police to 825 in 1982 from 2,323 in 1975.
Mr. Young won his second term in 1977 with 60 percent of the vote and seemed politically invincible by his third term in 1982. Even his critics said he could be the Mayor as long as he wanted. But his third term was marred by two Federal investigations that grew out of his efforts to direct city business to black-owned companies. No charges were ever filed against him in either case.
He breezed to a fourth term in 1986 without making the expected bridge-building racial appeals. Isabel Wilkerson, writing in The New York Times after Mr. Young won a nonpartisan primary over a dozen challengers, said the Mayor, running in a city in which 70 percent of the voters were black, seemed "to revel in the sort of polarization that other politicians dread."
A biographer of Mr. Young, Wilbur Rich, a political science professor at Wayne State University, said in 1989: "He embodies all the things that a lot of black people can't be themselves -- tough, combative, confrontational. He will tell white people off in a minute. That's reassuring to a lot of black people."
Mr. Young was twice married and divorced. He is survived by a son, Coleman Young Jr., and by two sisters, Juanita Clark and Bernice Greer of Detroit.
Coleman Alexander Young was born on May 24, 1918, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. His family moved to Detroit when he was 5, settling in Black Bottom, a racially and ethnically mixed neighborhood where Mr. Young's father opened a dry-cleaning and tailoring shop.
Mr. Young graduated from high school with an excellent academic record but went to work on a Ford assembly line after failing to obtain financial aid to attend the University of Michigan. He became a union organizer and then a postal worker before being drafted in World War II. He served in the 332d Fighter Group, the all-black Army Air Corps unit known as the Tuskegee Airmen, rising to second lieutenant.
He returned to the post office after the war. Later dismissed for union organizing, he bounced from job to job before helping to organize the Negro Labor Council, a group seeking equal job opportunities for blacks. His work with the council led to his being called in 1952 before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating Communism. Under questioning about his work with the council, Mr. Young declared, "I am not here as a stool pigeon."
Mr. Young was considered too radical by labor and management, and it was difficult for him to find work in the 1950's. He found a series of jobs, including salesman, cabdriver and painter, but kept his interest in politics. In 1959, he ran for state representative from the Black Bottom District but lost by a small margin. In 1963 he was elected to the State Senate, where he served until becoming Mayor. In the Senate, he was instrumental in gaining open-housing legislation and repealing a ban on busing to achieve racial integration.
As one of the first big-city mayors to support Jimmy Carter's Presidential bid in 1976, Mr. Young enjoyed his greatest prominence during the Carter Administration. He was the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1977 to 1981 and the chairman of the Democratic Convention Platform Committee in 1980. He also led the United States Conference of Mayors from 1981 to 1983 and the National Democratic Conference of Mayors in 1980.
Near the end of his fifth term in 1993, with his health deteriorating because of emphysema, Mr. Young decided not to run for re-election. His power and influence were somewhat on the wane, but few doubted that if his constituents sensed that he needed them in a close election, they would turn out for him.
Perhaps emblematic of his tenacity, Mr. Young had been in intensive care since July 24. He suffered cardiac arrest on Nov. 12, and his heart stopped for about 40 minutes before doctors revived him. He had chronic respiratory problems, which periodically led to rumors that he had died, and took pride in his ability to survive against the odds.
He wrote in his autobiography: "I would also call Detroit the most resilient city in America, to which end I kind of like to think that it takes after its Mayor of the past 20 years. We've been through a lot together, up to and including the unsubstantiated rumors of our demise."

HEADLINE: Lillian B. Miller, Historian, 74; Studied Art by the Peale Family

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Lillian B. Miller, a Boston butcher's daughter who made American cultural history her oyster and the Peale family of painters her particular pearls, died on Thursday at a hospital in Washington. She was 74 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
Her family said the cause was a cerebral hemorrhage. 
 As a man who painted George Washington seven times, Charles Willson Peale has hardly been an unknown figure. But until Dr. Miller came along in 1974 and began turning out volume after annotated volume covering four generations of Peale family papers, Peale had been largely dismissed as little more than a comic footnote to American history, a well-known practical joker whose grandiosely named sons -- Rembrandt, Raphael, Rubens and Titian -- drew scholarly snickers.
Since then, largely because of Dr. Miller's efforts, Peale and the artistic dynasty he established have enjoyed something of a renaissance, one that was underscored in 1986 when a painting by Rembrandt Peale sold for $4 million.
For all her contributions to the Peales' reputation, Dr. Miller was an accidental cultural historian, a woman who cut her own path through the pitfalls of 20th-century American culture.
As the daughter of struggling immigrants from Lithuania, Lillian Beresnack grew up all but oblivious to Boston's cultural riches. Her girlhood passion was literature.
At Radcliffe, as the first member of her family to earn a college degree, she became interested in American history and, while working her way through school as secretary to the head of the Harvard observatory, picked up the skills that would lay the groundwork for her scholarship.
As a Columbia University graduate student, she worked as secretary to the historian Jacques Barzun and the literature professor Lionel Trilling, impressing both scholars so much that when Mary McCarthy abruptly quit her teaching post at Bard College in 1946, they recommended her as a replacement, which is how a 23-year-old secretary came to spend three years teaching literature to returning G.I.'s in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., while making frequent trips back to Columbia to research her master's essay on the Socialist labor leader Eugene V. Debs.
Barzun and Trilling were hardly the only scholars she impressed. At a seminar on American history she caught the eye of a fellow student, Nathan Miller, a budding economic historian who became her husband in 1948.
Dr. Miller spent the 1950's having babies, keeping house in Manhattan and working on her doctoral dissertation. It wasn't easy for a woman to be a scholar in those days, as Dr. Miller discovered when the American Association of University Women rejected her application for a fellowship because she was pregnant.
In 1960, in the pattern of the era, she followed her husband to the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, where he began a long career as a history professor and she helped make feminist history. With the prodding of a sympathetic state attorney general, the university quietly abandoned a nepotism rule, allowing her to teach in the same department with her husband.
Dr. Miller had briefly considered researching the artists project of the Depression-era Works Progress Administration for her dissertation, but when she discovered how little attention had been paid to the role of art in American history, she decided to fill the gap.
When her dissertation, "Patrons and Patriotism: The Encouragement of Fine Arts in the United States: 1790-1860," was published in 1966, it created such a stir that in 1971 the Smithsonian Institution lured her to Washington to become historian of the National Portrait Gallery.
With her husband accommodatingly commuting between Milwaukee and their new home in Bethesda, , Dr. Miller developed major historical exhibitions. Then in 1974, as the Smithsonian's historian of American culture, she published the voluminous Peale family papers on microfiche, providing scholars of diverse fields with a trove of source material and giving her a life's work.
Dr. Miller, who organized an acclaimed traveling exhibition of Peale works last year, published four of a projected seven volumes of Peale family papers.
In addition to her husband, Dr. Miller is survived by a son, Joel, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Hannah Lieberman of Phoenix and Rebecca Miller-Randall of Chester, Conn.; four sisters, Elsie Hurst and Edith Sahl of Newton, Mass., Ginger Lanahan of Raynham, Mass., and Dorothy Bearman of London, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Army May Settle Political Feud

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attacked the President and the Supreme Court today, accusing them of setting off a political crisis that has paralyzed the Government and damaged the economy. "If people look at what has been happening in the last few weeks, they will see who has been conspiring against the interests of the country," the Prime Minister said in a televised speech.
Western diplomats said today that there was an increasing likelihood that the military would be forced to step in to end the political feuding, probably by supporting a new government of technocrats rather than politicians. The army asked on Saturday that a visit by the head of the United States Central Command, Lieut. Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, be postponed. "Obviously they are clearing the decks," a Western diplomat said. 
 The Supreme Court is hearing a contempt case against Mr. Sharif based on his earlier attacks on the court. It also has before it cases in which he is charged with corruption.
The situation is expected to heat up on Monday, with various politicians saying they will call their followers into the streets. The Supreme Court is also scheduled to resume the contempt trial; it was interrupted on Friday when Mr. Sharif's supporters attacked the court building.
Anwar Iqbal, a political columnist, predicted tonight that Parliament would begin impeachment proceedings against President Farooq Leghari. On Friday, the President rebuked the Prime Minister as being behind the " mob assault" on the court.
The crisis has been brewing almost since Mr. Sharif was elected in February, with the largest parliamentary majority in Pakistan's history. The governing party then passed a law stripping the President of his power to dismiss the Prime Minister and call elections. In August, Mr. Sharif clashed with the Supreme Court when Parliament passed a law giving the police extraordinary powers to deal with suspected terrorists. The Chief Justice said the law violated basic liberties.
Later, the court suspended a law the governing party had intended to use to curb defections by its members in Parliament. That prompted outbursts from Mr. Sharif that resulted in the contempt charges.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Dog Bites Man

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Sometimes you can tell a lot about a country by what's on the front pages of its newspapers. Sometimes you can tell even more by what's on the back. Here's what's back-page news in Russia: The pilots of a helicopter based in Yessentuki, in southern Russia, had not been paid for so many months that on Nov. 22 they flew their chopper to a secluded spot and hid it. They said they would only return it when they received their back pay. Or, how about this for back-page news? The employees of the Ministry of Atomic Energy -- the folks responsible for maintaining Russia's nuclear warheads -- haven't been paid in 10 weeks. Ho hum. Dog bites man.
Discovering what is back-page news in Russia helps one better understand (although not accept) why Russia responds differently than America to the prospects of Iran or Iraq acquiring weapons of mass destruction. To put it simply: Russia is otherwise engaged. It's hard to worry about Iraq's weapons when your own nuclear employees are going unpaid and crews are hiding their helicopters. As The Washington Post Moscow correspondent David Hoffman remarked to me, "Russia today is like a blender with the top off and the motor running." We want them to just flip a switch and stop everything from spewing out. But it's not so easy. 
 America and Russia today are in different worlds, and that's new. During the cold war America and Russia were playing on the same global chessboard, with the same pieces -- nuclear weapons -- and with the same stakes: global control. They took every regional crisis equally seriously. With the end of the cold war, two changes have occurred: First, the balance of power between the U.S. and Russia is no longer measured by nukes alone, but by economic and technological strengths, in which the U.S. is far, far superior. Russia is still in its Wild Bill phase and America is in its Bill Gates phase. Iraq and Iran for America are twin evils. Iraq and Iran for Russia are sources of back pay. Iraq owes Russia $7 billion.
Second, the U.S. and Russia today are no longer playing on the same global chessboard. They are each playing on many different chessboards. Some overlap, some don't. For instance, says the Russian foreign policy expert Vyacheslav Mikonov, "Russia simply does not consider Iranian Muslim fundamentalists the worst thing in the world." For Russia, the Saudi fundamentalists are worse because the Saudis supported the Chechen separatists. For Russia, the second worst are the Taliban fundamentalists in Afghanistan. Since the Iranians oppose both the Saudis and the Talibans, they're good for Russia. Also, in the dispute over how Caspian Sea oil will be divided, Iran is allied with Russia and Turkmenistan, against Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
The fact that the Russians are not with America 100 percent doesn't mean they're against America 100 percent. This is not the return of the cold war. It's the essence of the post-cold war. That is why we get these ambiguous outcomes: Russia persuades Saddam to let the U.N. weapons inspectors back in, but only to hasten the day when the sanctions can be lifted and Russia gets paid.
To understand this is not to excuse it. Indeed, the U.S. must hold Russia's feet to the fire, without mercy, when it comes to preventing Iraq or Iran from acquiring nukes. I don't care what Russia's unique interests are. This is a global interest. To understand this, though, is to appreciate that in managing relations with Russia there will be areas of overlap and areas of discord. And those overlaps and discords will be driven not by ideological competition, as in the cold war, but by differences in geography, history and income.
The cold warriors who want to treat Russia as though it's still and will always be an irredeemable foe will be blind to the potential benefits of working with Russia in some areas. Russophiles who want to treat Russia as a fellow Western democracy will be blind to the dangers inherent in Russia's very different circumstances.
As the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum points out, Russia and China are now the same problem -- two post-Communist powers with their own regional interests, some of which overlap with ours, others of which conflict. The only way to manage both is by building bridges where possible and drawing red lines where necessary.

HEADLINE: U.S. Melted Down Gold Items From Nazis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Seven years after World War II ended, the United States melted down gold plates, buttons, coins and smoking-pipe ornaments that were apparently looted from Hitler's victims, and turned the gold over to European central banks.
According to long-secret documents that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plans to release this week to a conference of historians tracking Nazi gold, the personal effects were smelted into gold bars in 1952 by the now-defunct United States Assay Office, then part of the Treasury. 
 It has long been presumed that the gold returned to European countries on orders of a commission set up by the United States, Britain and France after World War II was entirely composed of "monetary gold" ingots stolen by the Nazis from central banks. But there were lingering suspicions that personal gold was mixed in, and the Federal Reserve documents now establish that more than 40 bars of gold created by the United States came from the homes and pockets of individuals, presumably including Holocaust victims.
Jewish groups and the United States Government plan to use the documents to press their case that $54 million in gold remaining in the possession of the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold -- the panel assembled to return looted assets to central banks -- should be given to Holocaust survivors and their heirs.
Other newly declassified documents from American archives, also expected to be presented at the conference, which begins Tuesday in London, reveal other bizarre details from recent investigations of the trail of wartime assets that have now spanned the globe.
For instance, it has long been known that the United States and Britain paid Switzerland -- a neutral country during the war -- millions of dollars for the care of prisoners of war held by the Japanese. But a newly released transcript of a coded message written by Swiss officials in 1945 shows that a secret deal was reached in August 1944 by Japanese and Swiss officials to divert 40 percent of those funds to pay off Japan's debts to Swiss businesses.
The message was intercepted by the United States and declassified last month by the National Security Agency.
At the time of the message, Switzerland was providing war materiel to Japan, as well as to the Germans and the Allies. The secret Swiss cable says that the rest of the British and American money intended to aid the prisoners was "at the free disposal of the Japanese Government."
In another cable discovered by researchers at the National Security Agency, the deputy director of Germany's central bank boasts to his superiors just days before his country's surrender that Swiss authorities were secretly cooperating with him to smuggle gold out of Germany. That was in direct violation of an agreement between Switzerland and the United States to block all financial transactions with Germany.
The German banker's cable to Berlin describes the movement of three tons of gold to Bern that day and says that Switzerland's secret cooperation with the Reichsbank, Germany's central bank, "creates a possibility for continuation of numerous German-Swiss contractual relationships of a public and private nature."
Other insights may come from a yet unreleased preliminary report of an independent historical team organized by Switzerland. It is expected to trace what happened to gold pulled from the teeth of victims of the Nazis, which American officials believe was later smelted into gold bars. But the documents found so far, historians familiar with a draft of the report say, do not trace a paper trail between the death camps and the mints that created the gold.
"It's not the kind of thing people kept exact records of," said one historian familiar with the report.
The Federal Reserve obtained the gold buttons, coins and pipe ornaments from the United States High Commissioner for Germany in February 1952, its records show. It is known that they came in 17 boxes, but a description of the documents sent by a Federal Reserve official, James R. Hennessy, to the World Jewish Congress earlier this month says, "Our records do not provide any further information as to the nature or origin of the deposit."
The Federal Reserve's role was limited to acting as a custodian of gold for the Tripartite Commission, though the records show that the Treasury helped to turn the assets into negotiable gold that could be distributed to European countries.
Last month, other documents were revealed showing that the Treasury melted down bars of gold -- stamped with the swastika of the Prussian mint -- that had previously belonged to Spain so the gold could be reissued as American-produced gold and used in a transaction in which Spain purchased American-made telephone equipment.
At the time the coins, buttons and pipe ornaments were smelted, sorting out the ownership of private gold was far from Washington's top objective. With the cold war well under way, all of the focus was on the economic stabilization of Europe -- thus the rush to melt down gold and send it back to Europe.
While the origin of the personal gold items is not clear, other historical records show that immediately after the war, American occupation forces came across large stores of gold that were seized from Jews and other Nazi victims, often as they were driven out of their homes.
Other effects were taken from them in the concentration camps, including dental gold -- although no dental gold is listed on the Federal Reserve's inventory.
The Federal Reserve records prove, though, that at least some of the gold returned to Europe was not "monetary gold." The Tripartite Commission -- set up by the United States, France and England -- had insisted for decades that it was.
"It's a fair assumption that the monetary reserves of central banks in Europe did not include smoking pipes," said Elan Steinberg, the executive director of the World Jewish Congress, who plans to attend the meeting of historians in London.
Most of the nations that received gold from the Tripartite Commission have informally agreed, in principle, to let the $54 million or so that remains in the Commission's account be used for some kind of humanitarian purpose. But final agreement has not been reached.
One of the biggest surprises in the new documents coming to light was the discovery that Switzerland had reached a secret agreement to use some of the money entrusted to it by the United States and Britain for its own purposes. In his memoirs, the American Ambassador to Japan when the war began, Joseph Grew, described in glowing terms how the Swiss minister looked after American interests in Japan during the war.
The document describing the agreement was found by a researcher in the Center for Cryptologic History at the National Security Agency, the intelligence service that conducts electronic eavesdropping. It is dated Nov. 3, 1945, after the war ended, and was sent from Bern to the Swiss Embassy in Washington in code using a version of the Enigma machine. The Swiss, like the Germans, did not know that the Enigma code was cracked during the war.
The Swiss memorandum began: "On 17 August 1944 we concluded with the Japanese Government a clearing agreement of an absolutely confidential nature, in accordance with which 40 percent of the franc payments by the British and American Governments for prisoners of war and internees in Japan are utilized for the transfer of Swiss claims in Japan, and 60 percent are at the free disposal of the Japanese Government."
It is not clear how much money the Americans and British entrusted to Switzerland for this purpose, but the memo says that at the end of the war the account showed "a balance of 14 million francs," or about $3 million at the time.
With regard to the recently discovered cable from the deputy director of the German central bank, it has long been known that Switzerland violated its agreement with the United States to freeze financial transactions with Germany starting in early 1945. But the cable hints that this was part of a longer-term plan. Later, Switzerland also reneged on a 1946 agreement to turn over half of other German assets in its vaults so the proceeds could be used to help war refugees and other victims.
But recently the United States has said it would not press to enforce the 1946 agreement, which was superseded by another agreement several years later after it became clear that Switzerland had no intention of turning over most of the assets.
The Swiss Government is also taking part in the London conference and says that it is committed to further investigations to dig up the truth about its financial role during and after World War II. But the subject has become an enormously raw one in Switzerland, and a referendum to set up a large national humanitarian fund, a form of repentance, will not be held until next year at the earliest.
Although other funds have been set up by Switzerland's private banks, Swiss officials fear that under current circumstances, with the public feeling under attack for actions taken a half century ago, the referendum might fail.

HEADLINE: Holiday Shoppers Start Selectively, Lining Up for 1997's Hot Items and for Discounts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
If ever a Thanksgiving weekend underscored the way Americans now shop for the holidays, this one was it.
From Friday morning on, retailers said yesterday, malls were jammed and shoppers lined up by the hundreds at the discount stores. But actually, sales were light across the board. 
 Though hot items were snatched up early -- plan on suffering if you have yet to buy a Sing and Snore Ernie -- most consumers hit the stores over the weekend simply because it is a tradition. But few did a lot of their holiday shopping in those days, because many people now wait until Christmas is closer to buy gifts.
"I felt traffic was up compared with last year," said John Konarski, vice president of the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York. "But I don't necessarily know if sales were up." The trade association measures traffic in 35 malls around the country each Thanksgiving weekend.
The day after Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday in the retail industry, reflecting merchants' desire to see their profit line turn that color. But only 10 percent of holiday sales are now rung up during the Thanksgiving weekend. Many shoppers use Black Friday instead as a way to assess what is out there, and buy only what is marked down or apparently in short supply. Rather than spending, they view the holiday window displays, go to the movies and eat food that provides respite from turkey leftovers.
"You go out on Friday because you were in the house all day Thursday watching games and eating," Mr. Konarski said. "There were lots of people out there, but they were not overloaded with shopping bags."
That has left retailers nervous about the success of the season. Still, because in recent years increasingly fewer shoppers have been checking off their entire lists the Friday after Thanksgiving or the rest of the weekend, it is hard to use this period as a guide for the rest of the season
"The day is important," said Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores. "But is it indicative? Who knows?"
For example, last year the strong Thanksgiving weekend sales pointed to a solid holiday season, but by Christmas sales had turned sluggish.
Mr. Gould said that Black Friday ranked about 15th in importance among the holiday shopping days, and that this year the day had single-digit percentage sales increases over last year.
Other retailers were equally cautious. "The weekend was sort of normal," said Stephen C. Elkin, chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, a unit of Neiman Marcus.
Like other retail executives, Mr. Elkin declined to provide hard numbers. But Telecheck Services Inc., which measures check writing in more than 27,000 locations each year, said that check writing on Friday rose 2.2 percent from Black Friday last year, a drop from 1996, when check writing increased 3.6 percent over the previous year. Checks are not a preferred payment method for most shoppers, but Telecheck's numbers tend to be consistent with industry trends.
The strength in the nation's economy suggests that holiday spending should be strong, and there are predictions that sales will rise 3.8 percent, to $162 billion. But consumers have remained fairly tight with their holiday spending in recent years, because they are either tapped out or simply shopped out.
"It is likely to be a very peculiar season," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "Consumers are in very good shape, with wages rising faster than price, low unemployment and high confidence. But a lot of Christmases have gone by since the recession. After a while, folks have run out of things to buy. And for those not well off, there is evidence that they are maxed out on their credit cards."
As such, retailers have resorted to two methods of getting strong sales the weekend after Thanksgiving. They mark everything down or open their doors before most people have finished loading the turkey platter into the dishwasher. The most successful retailers do both.
At Sears, Roebuck & Company, for example, shoppers had the chance to win a $500 gift certificate if they shopped between 7 A.M. and 10 A.M. on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Those were also the hours when the company's popular Craftsman tool sets were on sale. Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson's, as well as Kmart and others, opened at dawn, offering early-bird specials.
"Early opening specials were very effective in getting consumers in the stores," said John Costello, a senior executive vice president at Sears. "Sales were solid and above last year's."
Toy merchants, though, seemed to be bucking the trend of light shopping, because hot toys tend to sell out early. This year's biggest hit is clearly Sing and Snore Ernie, a doll whose tummy moves while it "sleeps." The doll sold out all around the country this weekend.
Other hot toys include Talk With Me Barbie, hand-held video games and anything Winnie the Pooh. The "retro" toy hit of the year appears to be the yo-yo.
"It was an excellent weekend," said Stanley Greenman, the chief executive of Noodle Kidoodle, a toy store chain. "It's not over till it's over, but early indications look good." Toys "R" Us will not give specific sales figures until the end of the season.
But in other merchandise categories, this season is proving to be much like last year. Apparel retailers are talking about the success of chenille, and velvet and cashmere are again making a splash. Home items like bread makers, cookbooks and throw pillows are also selling well.
Of all holiday retailing trends in recent years, the strongest has been aggressive discounting.
Department stores and malls were a sea of sale signs over the weekend, and the stores that sell merchandise for less all year tended to fare the best.
"Modestly priced merchandise did relatively much better than the rest of the gang," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry newsletter. He cited the Kohl's Corporation and Stage Stores Inc., both lower-end department stores, as being the most packed.
Even among toys, prices can matter.
"Everybody is watching interactive Barney," Mr. Konarski of the shopping center trade group said. "It seems to be doing well, but the big thing in its disfavor is the price. It sells for $100, but then when you add in the extras, it can run well over $200."
Shoppers simply expect sales the day after Thanksgiving.
"There is no question that people are looking for bargains," Mr. Barnard said. "We buttonholed a lot of consumers and they were grumbling that there were not enough sales."
Though all the discounting can lead to more sales, it can cut into profits as well.
"It seems like people are very focused on attainment of sales increases," said Jay Scansaroli, a partner in charge of the retail practice at Arthur Anderson Worldwide. "But how much of margin will be lost in getting them? It is a difficult formula for retailers."

HEADLINE: Religion's Search for a Home Base

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ

DATELINE: CLEARWATER, Fla.

 BODY:
In 1975, L. Ron Hubbard, the flamboyant founder of the Church of Scientology, was intent on finding a home base for his religion, which had come under criticism in several countries. The result was Operation Goldmine.
Late that year, a dummy corporation paid $2.3 million in cash to buy the Fort Harrison Hotel, a historic building that was the symbolic heart of downtown Clearwater. The buyer was identified as the United Churches of Florida, an unknown organization. 
 A reporter for The St. Petersburg Times discovered that the true owner was Scientology and the disclosure started a battle that echoes today in the suspicion surrounding the death of Lisa McPherson while she stayed at the Fort Harrison.
It turned out that Scientology had come to Clearwater with a written plan to take control of the city. Government and community organizations were infiltrated by Scientology members. Plans were undertaken to discredit and silence critics. A fake hit-and-run accident was staged in 1976 to try to ruin the political career of the Mayor, Gabriel Cazares. A Scientologist infiltrated the local newspaper and reported on the paper's plans to her handlers.
The full scope of Scientology's deceit in Clearwater was not revealed until the late 1970's, when records seized in an F.B.I. raid on church offices in Los Angeles were released by a Federal judge.
In 1982, the City Commission held four days of televised hearings on Scientology's tactics in Clearwater and then passed an ordinance imposing stiff record-keeping and disclosure requirements on charitable and religious groups.
Scientology sued the city, and in 1993 a Federal appeals court overturned the ordinance as unconstitutional. The city had passed the measure, the court said, with "an underlying objective to employ the tax laws to discriminate against Scientology, a purpose that is patently offensive to the First Amendment."
In recent years, Scientology has tried to be seen as a good citizen in this city of 100,000. The church is most visible downtown, where it has spruced up its buildings. Its security patrols have been credited by some with helping to deter street crime. Plans are under way to build a 26-story training center across from the Fort Harrison Hotel.
The church has also sponsored political forums for local candidates, and one of its members serves on the Downtown Development Board, an elected body that oversees attempts to revitalize the business center.
Yet some officials still see Scientology through the dark lens of its past deeds. Many candidates refuse to attend the church's political forums and some business people blame the church for downtown's sluggish economy.
Others argue for more pragmatism, contending that accepting the Scientologists is the only way to revive downtown.
"They are not going to go away," said Elise K. Winters, a lawyer and former chairwoman of the Downtown Development Board. "You can either treat them like a boogeyman and give downtown to them or you can treat them like any other property owner. You've got to decide if you want downtown to succeed or you want to nurse old grudges."

HEADLINE: For the Czechs, The Fairy Tale Is All Over Now

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Not so long ago, there was a fairy-tale land in Central Europe.
The Prime Minister was regarded as a smart economist who knew best how to move his country from Communism to capitalism. The President was feted around the world as an oracle for human rights. The magical capital -- Golden Prague -- all spires, domes and cobblestoned alleys, was revered by Americans as a romantic travel destination for the 1990's. 
 But there is not much golden about the Czech Republic these days.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus was forced to resign early this morning, having been turned on by his party colleagues after a scandal and forsaken by the international finance community.
President Vaclav Havel, 61, visibly heaving for breath, has been convalescing after being hospitalized for serious pneumonia, less than a year after half of a lung was taken out during cancer surgery.
Prague, now overrun by tourists and trinkets, has watched its cozy image dented after a number of racial incidents against Gypsies and the killing this month of a Sudanese university student by a gang of skinheads.
"It was too good to be true," said Pavel Tigrid, who at 80 is a wise old man of the republic and a presidential adviser.
"We were a little bit cocky," he said, "and our Prime Minister certainly so."
Mr. Klaus finally paid for what friends as well as foes said was arrogance when his political colleagues disclosed details on Friday of a slush fund of contributions to the party held in a Swiss bank. The Prime Minister said he knew nothing about it, but few believed him and Mr. Klaus had little choice but to agree to demands -- and Mr. Havel's request -- that he and his Government resign.
After meeting this afternoon with leaders of the three parties in the governing coalition to discuss the formation of a new government, Mr. Havel said action would be delayed until Mr. Klaus's Civic Democratic Party chose a new leader at its congress on Dec. 13. Until then, Mr. Havel said, the Klaus Government will remain in power.
One thing is certain, politicians here said: Czech politics have lost the stability that distinguished the country from the rest of Central Europe.
The economy is where Mr. Klaus's overconfidence hit hardest, they said. Two years ago Mr. Klaus triumphantly told the Czechs that the transformation of their economy was complete. They believed him. But this year, as speculators set off a currency crisis in the spring, they saw the crown devalued, small and medium-sized banks collapse and the unregulated stock market sag under persistent scandals.
In recent surveys, 80 percent of the people polled were concerned about the economy.
"People thought the transformation was over," said Daniela Stanikova, 23, a film student. "Then this year we are told the worst is still to come. I think we have 10 bad years ahead."
Ms. Stanikova said that many people now realized that the state-owned companies privatized through Mr. Klaus's voucher system -- in which ordinary Czechs were given shares in companies that many then sold to investment funds -- remained overstaffed and unproductive. "People will start losing jobs," she said.
Foreign investors are disenchanted too.
"The Czech economic performance has been relatively discouraging compared with its peers in the region," said Gabor Bognar, a London-based economist at Goldman, Sachs who specializes in Central Europe. "Overall the fundamentals are not improving, and in some cases deteriorating."
Productivity has been consistently low compared with Poland and Hungary, he said. Except for the Skoda car plant, in which Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake, Czech companies have attracted few foreign strategic partners. Thus, Czech companies have benefited little from outside management know-how, Mr. Bognar said.
Czech banks have been a consistent problem, and Mr. Klaus was warned in Washington this month by the Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that he needed to hurry and restructure his country's banking, officials here said.
The close relationship between the banks, investment funds they control and industrial companies has led to embezzlement and lax loan policies. The Czech National Bank said in June that 32 percent of the loans held by the state-controlled banks were substandard -- three and four times the number in Polish and Hungarian banks, respectively.
Mr. Klaus appeared to have started to heed Mr. Rubin and a memorandum from the International Monetary Fund that criticized the Government for underestimating the cost of restructuring the banks. On Nov. 19 the Government announced plans to sell large stakes in the top three banks to foreign investors.
The Government also took its first steps this month to regulate the stock market. Parliament passed legislation for a Securities Exchange Commission. But Western investors and diplomats said Mr. Klaus's heart was not in the reforms. They were concerned, they added, that the rules for the new agency had been so watered down that it would lack the teeth it needed.
The uncertain health of President Havel, who before his surgery was a two-pack-a-day smoker, is another worry. He is considered the country's best salesman abroad, an antidote at the White House and Buckingham Palace to the aggressive style of Mr. Klaus.
But Mr. Havel had to cancel a visit to Britain and lunch with Queen Elizabeth this month when he was hospitalized for two weeks with pneumonia. Although he looked better on television Saturday when he called on the Klaus Government to resign, his breathing was still uneven.
Mr. Havel has announced that he will seek re-election by Parliament in January, and there is no expected opposition. Czechs have expressed concerns about his candidacy, but not because they do not want him as President. A survey two weeks ago showed that 54 percent of those polled felt that the ailing Mr. Havel should not run for his own sake.
Czechs, conservative by nature, have another reservation as well. They are dismayed by his marriage to Dagmar Veskrnova, a flamboyant and outspoken actress.
Mr. Havel and Ms. Veskrnova wed in January, less than a year after the death of his first wife, Olga, a popular woman who stood by Mr. Havel during his years in prison as a dissident. "It's the new wife," complained an aide about the difficulty of planning Mr. Havel's re-election effort.
Along with the country's political and economic woes, the Czech image has been shaken by a surge of racial violence. This month a 24-year-old Sudanese student at the University of Economics in Prague, Hassan Elamin Abdelradi, was stabbed to death by two skinheads in a racially motivated murder, the Prague police said.
An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Gypsies live in the Czech Republic, and since the collapse of Communism the hostility of the majority of the population toward Gypsies has become more obvious. The European Center for the Rights of Roma in Budapest has reported more than 1,250 attacks against Gypsies in the Czech Republic since 1990. Ten of the attacks resulted in deaths.
Czechs have known for a long time about the need to include rather than exclude the Gypsies in everyday life, Mr. Tigrid said. "We neglected it, and now it will take a long time," he said.
But as several thousand Gypsies have sought asylum in Canada and Britain this year, the problem has spilled beyond the country's borders. As a way of stopping Gypsies from entering Britain, the British Foreign Office considered imposing visa requirements on Czechs.
Visas would have meant an end to the Czech Republic's long-sought membership in the European Union, which is envisioned for early next century, said Jiri Pehe, Mr. Havel's foreign policy adviser. The very core of the European Union is the absence of visa requirements among member countries.
Americans young and old flock to Prague to see what many imagine to be Paris in the 1920's transplanted to Central Europe in the 90's. Secondhand bookstores, smoky cafes and crowded pubs abound. The famed beer remains excellent. But in many cases commercialism has overtaken preservation, lofty prices have replaced bargains and the artistic life is fun but not sustaining.
"What is happening is that this country is becoming a normal country," said Lubos Beniak, managing director of Reader's Digest in the Czech Republic. "It's a country with its ups and downs, with G.D.P. going up and down, with new Cabinets installed and dropped. There's not a country in the world where the news can always be good."

HEADLINE: China Won't Reduce Value Of Currency, Official Says

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 30

 BODY:
China will not devalue its currency despite growing pressure to do so, Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the nation's economic czar, said in a newspaper report published today.
Determined to keep exports moving out and foreign investment coming in, China could try various steps to counter fresh competition from its Southeast Asian neighbors, Mr. Zhu said. But devaluation, he stressed, is not an option. 
 "In the face of the devaluation of currencies in Southeast Asian countries, China will take measures to increase the competitiveness of its exports and its absorption of overseas funds," Mr. Zhu said in a People's Daily report. "It has no need of and will not resort to methods that would mean a devaluation."
Mr. Zhu, in charge of China's ambitious economic restructuring program, is widely expected to be named China's next Prime Minister in April, replacing Li Peng, who is required to give up the post after 10 years in office.
Mr. Zhu's comments on financial matters are usually listened to carefully here. And with rising concern about how China may be affected by the financial crisis in much of Asia, they take on added significance.
Sharp drops in the value of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are expected to lower the prices of exports from those nations to the United States, Europe and Japan. A large portion of those exports are assembly-oriented products -- like shoes, toys and electronic goods -- that compete with similar products made in China.
At the same time that China faces the prospect of falling exports, it is already seeing a steep drop in foreign investment, down 35 percent in the first 10 months of this year, according to official reports.
China's spectacular economic growth -- averaging 10 percent over the last five years -- has been built on exports and foreign investment. Declines in these two key areas are of great concern, though no one yet knows how badly they will cut into China's growth rate.
China's currency, the yuan, is not freely convertible or traded on world currency markets, and economists disagree about whether and by how much the yuan may be overvalued. Its exchange rate has hovered close to 8.3 to one dollar for nearly four years, since it was last devalued in early 1994.
By rejecting devaluation, Mr. Zhu is expressing confidence that China's economy is still essentially healthy, and also warning against any sudden measures that might be disruptive.
Mr. Zhu predicted that China's economy would grow by 8 to 9 percent each year into the early years of the next century.
Economists say that one factor discouraging Beijing from a devaluation is that doing so could put additional pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, which has already been threatened by currency speculators.

Struggle Over a Symbol
A request by the Philippines for the United States to return two church bells taken by American troops near the turn of century has been met with scorn by some people in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the bells are kept at an Air Force base. To Filipinos, the bells symbolize their nation's painful struggle for independence; to Americans who want to keep the bells in the United States, they are a memorial to fallen soldiers. A14

Census Data Study Shows Effects of Immigration
An analysis of updated census data by scholars at New York University shows how the city continues to be reshaped by its new immigrants, even though these groups have yet to make their mark on the city's political landscape. The study, based on a Federal Census Bureau survey of 18,000 households in 1996, found that more than 11 out of every 20 New Yorkers were immigrants or the children of immigrants, that nearly half of all Bronx residents and a third of Manhattan's population were Hispanic, and that nearly a fifth of the population of Queens was Asian-American.

A Shock Course in AIDS
Life has changed in Chautauqua County, upstate, since residents learned that a drifter from Brooklyn had been accused of knowingly infecting several young women in the area with the virus that causes AIDS.

The Mayor Vanishes
Mayor Giuliani was conspicuous in his absence from the city over the weekend, as he indulged himself with a couple of days off for the first time in almost four years. But the Mayor's mini-vacation was perhaps even more notable for its being shrouded in secrecy: Mr. Giuliani, who boasted during the recent campaign that he was available to New Yorkers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, refused to tell anybody where he and his family were going, and aides and advisers would not give away his secret.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Philippines History Entwined in War Booty

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo.

 BODY:
On a wind-whipped military post first occupied by Army Indian fighters, Trophy Park contains some unusual war booty: two Spanish colonial church bells from the Philippines, each stamped with the coat of arms of the Franciscan missionaries.
Long ignored by drivers whizzing past the park at what is now Francis E. Warren Air Force Base here, the bronze bells are at the center of an international dispute and are emblems for rival views of American military history. 
 The bells are a symbol to both sides in a violent page of history from the turn of the century, known in the United States as the Balangiga Affair and in the Philippines as the Balangiga Massacre.
To Wyoming veterans, the bells are a reminder of the worst massacre of Army soldiers in the decades after Custer's defeat. The tolling of the bells on Sept. 28, 1901, signaled the start of a surprise attack by Filipino guerrillas that virtually wiped out an Army garrison in the village of Balangiga (pronounced bal-un-JEE-guh). Of 74 soldiers in the unit, 45 were killed and 22 were wounded as guerrillas pressed their uprising against American rule.
To Filipinos, the bells, captured in a counterattack by American forces, are a reminder of reprisals in which troops were ordered to kill anyone over 10 years old, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths.
With the 100th anniversary of the Philippines' declaration of independence from Spain coming in June, the Philippines' Ambassador to the United States, Raul Chaves Rabe, has made two pilgrimages here in southeastern Wyoming, hoping to soften local public opinion. At the recent Asia-Pacific economic conference in Vancouver, President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines appealed to President Clinton to return one of the bells and a copy of the other.
"You have your Liberty Bell in Philadelphia," Mr. Rabe argued just after visiting this city of 50,000 people last month. "The Balangiga bells run parallel to that as symbolic of our independence."
In the Philippines, petitions, films and editorials have fueled the campaign for the return of one or both bells. In the United States, where Filipinos rank among the nation's largest immigrant groups, support is also growing. In Chicago, a Philippine-American cultural group is presenting a new musical based on the incident, "The Bells of Balangiga."
"The bells signify the heroism of a people fighting for its independence and sovereignty," said Angela Mascarenas, producer of the theater company, Pintig Cultural Group. "They should go back to Balangiga."
But if it were up to Joe Sestak, a retired Air Force colonel who commands the American Legion in Wyoming, both bells will stay right where they are. The Filipinos can make do with copies, Mr. Sestak asserted.
"We are not involved in the business of dismantling memorials to our comrades that have fought in other wars," said Mr. Sestak, who recently won a unanimous vote by leaders of the Legion across the state to keep the bells in Cheyenne.
Local veterans who defend Trophy Park complain that younger people, many of whom never served in the military, are rewriting history and adding a dollop of guilt.
"We don't have to rewrite history and give back the bells because, yeah, our men were involved in atrocities, too," said Robert R. Scott, a retired Air Force brigadier general who is a civilian adviser to the base. "Those bells were used to make the attack against our troops."
E. Jayne Mockler, a State Democratic Representative from Cheyenne, retorted: "We are not forgetting history. We were never told the proper history."
Both sides seem to agree on the outlines of the Balangiga story.
After the American annexation of the Philippines in 1898, following the Spanish-American War, the authorities in the province of Samar, 400 miles southeast of Manila, invited American soldiers to set up a garrison to protect the port of Balangiga.
On a Saturday, Sept. 27, 1901, about one month after soldiers from Company C of the Ninth Infantry arrived, guerrillas infiltrated the town. Disguised as women, they carried coffins, saying they contained the bodies of children killed by cholera. Fearing the plague, the Americans did not inspect the coffins as they were carried to the town church.
Early Sunday, as the American commander was at his desk writing a memorial service for President William McKinley, who had been assassinated three weeks earlier, the church bells unexpectedly started to toll. At this signal, the "mourners" tore off their dresses, opened the coffins and pulled machetes.
"I remember my father screaming out at night, 'They are coming, the goo-goos are coming,' " recalled E. Jean Wall, a 70-year-old Arizona interior decorator whose father, Adolph Gamlin, was an Army sentry who survived. "He would often visit with other survivors. When they got to the gory details, we would be hustled out of the room."
The gory details included soldiers' being beheaded and their bodies mutilated. The survivors managed to escape in dugout canoes, though some drowned or were lost to sharks.
Retribution was swift, led by Brig. Gen. Jacob W. Smith, whose subsequent actions earned him the nickname of "Hell Roaring Jake." A decade earlier, as a cavalryman, he had fought at Wounded Knee, a battle that left about 200 Sioux and 29 Army soldiers dead in South Dakota.
"I want no prisoners," he ordered a subordinate, saying all Filipinos over the age of 10 were to be killed, according to testimony at General Smith's court martial. "I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the better it will please me."
The final death toll is unknown, but after the scorched-earth campaign, thousands of civilians were dead and many of Samar's towns, including Balangiga, were in ashes. General Smith was convicted, cashiered and "admonished" for violating "military discipline."
In 1904, when Company C returned to the United States, it brought back three bells from Balangiga. Two were left at its first post, here in Cheyenne. Through the century, the unit has always carried a third bell, down to the company's current posting, in South Korea.
The bells were not the only war booty to end up in Cheyenne. A 19th-century Filipino statue of the Madonna and Child graces the official residence of the Bishop of the Diocese of Cheyenne, Joseph Hart.
A discreet advocate of returning a bell as a symbol of reconciliation between the Philippines and the United States, Bishop Hart said, "As long as I am going to advocate giving one of the bells back, I suppose I should give the statue back."
Robert A. Underwood, Guam's delegate to the House of Representatives, is sponsoring a resolution to urge President Clinton to return one bell. Mr. Underwood, a grandson of a Spanish-American War veteran, said: "It is a perfect gesture to the only country in Asia that fought with the U.S. in the Korean War and in the Vietnam War. The bells are much more part of their national identity than ours."

HEADLINE: SOUTH KOREA SAYS I.M.F. HAS AGREED TO HUGE BAILOUT

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The South Korean Government said this morning that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund about terms for a huge rescue of its teetering economy.
Details of the agreement, including the amount of money that will be provided to South Korea, were not immediately available, and I.M.F. officials said the agreement had not been completed this morning. 
 The state-owned Korea Broadcasting System reported, however, that the amount of the bailout would be $55 billion, of which $20 billion would come from the United States and Japan and $15 billion more from the World Bank; the rest, presumably, would come from the I.M.F.
If that figure is correct, it would make the bailout the largest ever, eclipsing the $48 billion made available to Mexico about three years ago. Moreover, it would be far in excess of the $20 billion the South Koreans said 10 days ago that they would seek.
"At this stage, the I.M.F. working-level team and South Korea have put together an agreement, but it still needs to be approved by the I.M.F. managing director," Lim Chang Yuel, South Korea's Minister of Finance and Economy, told reporters after emerging from a meeting early this morning.
The South Korean Government said it would announce details of the agreement later today.
But Hubert Neiss, the lead negotiator for the monetary fund, said an agreement had not been completed. "The working level has not agreed either," he said in a brief telephone interview. "We have gone as far as we can." But, he added, "hopefully, there will be an agreement."
Though Seoul initially sought about $20 billion, Mr. Lim has recently suggested that more would be needed to help South Korea maintain a prudent level of the foreign currency reserves needed to pay foreign debts and to help restructure its ailing finance sector. Analysts have estimated that Seoul would need $60 billion or even more.
In exchange for the bailout, South Korea had to agree to terms that will probably cut its economic growth in half next year, raise unemployment sharply, cut Government spending and open its financial markets more to foreigners. This could cause social unrest in a nation whose labor unions have fought fiercely to preserve their nearly lifetime employment.
Mr. Lim said the agreement could receive formal approval from the I.M.F. this week, with some money available almost immediately after that. Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to arrive in Seoul later this week after attending a meeting of Asian finance officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
In Washington on Sunday night, a United States official said there were issues to be resolved before the agreement on an I.M.F. rescue would be complete. But he said the Clinton Administration expected that a bailout for South Korea would employ the same framework used for Indonesia in October, with the I.M.F. in the lead and the United States part of a backup group should the fund's money be exhausted.
The bailout is the third major one this year for East Asian nations whose rapid growth and industrialization were once the economic envy of the world. Thailand received $17 billion, and Indonesia is promised as much as $40 billion.
But the situation in South Korea is more serious because the nation has the 11th-largest economy in the world, making it as large as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia combined.
In recent weeks South Korea has faced a plummeting currency and stock prices and a cascade of corporate bankruptcies, and the bad news did not end with the announcement about possible help: By midafternoon, the stock market's leading index was down 10.18 points, or 2.5 percent, to 397.68, its lowest level in more than 10 years and less than half the level of two years ago. The South Korean currency, the won, was also falling, to 1,175.5 won to the dollar, an all-time low. It was about 1,163 to the dollar on Friday.
American officials have worried that problems here could spill over to Japan, one of South Korea's major trading partners and lenders. Problems in Japan, the world's second-largest economy, could potentially widen the United States trade deficit.
The agreement was reached very rapidly, which could reflect a belief among officials that the situation is more serious than thought. When he arrived here on Wednesday, Mr. Neiss of the I.M.F. set a target of reaching an agreement within two weeks. Instead, it took only about five days.
"The situation, of course, is serious," Mr. Neiss said on Sunday. "In such a situation, it is important to act very fast."
Mr. Neiss would not comment on a report Sunday in the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, which, citing unidentified sources, said American officials and Mr. Neiss were alarmed that South Korea's foreign currency reserves were more depleted than thought. With such low reserves, South Korea might be in danger of defaulting on some international debt, about $66 billion of which is due within a year.
Seoul's foreign currency reserves, which were reported to have totaled $30 billion at the end of October, have been drawn down further by the Government's futile attempt to defend the currency against a big devaluation in November.
The South Korean newspaper said one reason the agreement came so fast was that the Government decided that the terms set by the I.M.F. were not so onerous.
According to South Korean news reports, the Government agreed to cut nearly 10 percent from expected spending next year. It agreed to a goal for overall economic growth of about 3 percent, roughly half this year's expected growth of 6 percent, as part of an effort to cut the nation's account deficit.
A sticking point concerned the I.M.F.'s recommendation that South Korea liquidate commercial banks and merchant banks that are already, in effect, insolvent. Seoul had wanted to restructure those banks, in part because a collapse would lead to big job losses. It is not clear how this item was resolved.
The Government of Japan, which has struggled for years to prevent such failures in its ailing financial sector, recently let the fourth-largest brokerage firm and one of the 10 largest commercial banks go out of business. The change was not totally by choice, however, in that healthier financial institutions resisted Government efforts to have them prop up the ailing bank and securities company.
South Korea's rapid economic growth was fueled by capital lent to big companies by banks under control of the Government. But many of those investments were unwise, leaving a mountain of bad debts. Now, as companies collapse, some banks have become basically insolvent and have called in loans from other companies, putting those companies in danger of default as well.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
Who Cares About a Few Degrees?

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS and other experts who have spent years trying to get people concerned about the prospect of global warming have always faced a central problem: temperatures change all the time.
From summer to winter, Minneapolis goes from 90-degree heat waves to 10-below deep freezes. At the end of a spell of Indian summer, Manhattan can go from 65 degrees to 25 in a few hours. 
 So why should anyone get excited about a global rise of a few degrees in a few decades?
But the debate before negotiators in Kyoto, Japan, is about climate, not weather. It is about long-term shifts in patterns of weather, not seasonal or day-to-day shifts from rain to sun, cold to heat.
Understanding the difference between weather and climate is the first step in understanding why many scientists are predicting that changes that seem trivial in terms of any single day -- a change, say, of five degrees Fahrenheit -- could have large impacts on many facets of life when those changes are on a global scale.
Global warming would not change the range of weather experienced day to day, but it would increase the odds of having weather that is considered troublesome by 20th-century standards: summer droughts, winter deluges, hurricanes and the like.
At the heart of the theory that has dozens of nations poised to act to lessen the threat is the long-established idea that earth's atmosphere behaves like the roof of a greenhouse.
The atmosphere was first compared to a "glass vessel" in 1827 by the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier. He recognized that the air circulating around the planet lets in sunlight -- as a greenhouse's glass roof does -- but prevents some of the resulting warmth from leaving.
If the air had no heat-trapping effect, the heat from the sun would quickly radiate back into space, leaving the planet with a surface temperature of nearly zero degrees Fahrenheit.
In the 1850's, a British physicist, John Tyndall, took things further and tried to measure the heat-trapping properties of various components of the atmosphere. Surprisingly, the two most abundant gases -- nitrogen and oxygen -- turned out to have no heat-trapping ability. Ninety-nine percent of the atmosphere has no insulating properties at all. It is all up to a few trace gases -- mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide -- to keep the planet cozy. If the air did not contain carbon dioxide, the planet would be some 20 degrees cooler. Without water vapor, it would be a deep-frozen ball of ice.
By the 1890's, scientists had figured out that the great blossoming of combustion in the Industrial Revolution had the potential to change the atmosphere's load of carbon dioxide. The idea was summarized succinctly in the April 1896 issue of The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine by a Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius, who wrote, "We are evaporating our coal mines into the air."
PRECISE monitoring of carbon dioxide concentrations since the 1950's has shown a relentless upward trend. Some of the carbon dioxide has gone into the ocean, and some has been absorbed by growing trees, but the amount in the air has continued to rise.
There has been a simultaneous rise in the planet's average temperature, although at a far slower -- and more uneven -- pace. Other factors appear to have acted like a buffer, including a rise in the amount of sooty particles in the air; they act something like a parasol, reflecting some of the sun's energy back into space before it can warm things up.
Nonetheless, many scientists, using computer models, say that they can account for buffering mechanisms and still see problems ahead, particularly if significant cuts are not made in the rates at which petroleum and coal are burned.
Indeed, many of their calculations indicate that the necessary cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide would actually have to be far greater than even the most ambitious targets on the negotiating table in Kyoto.
There has also been a rise in the atmosphere's burden of methane and nitrous oxide from sources related to human activities, and these gases also trap heat.
Even though the greenhouse gases exist in only trace amounts -- they are measured in parts per million and, in some cases, parts per trillion -- they exert a powerful influence on the temperature of the planet. So a tiny change in their concentrations can cause a big change in the way the atmosphere behaves.
Dr. John W. Firor, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, likes to compare the situation to that of a corporation that is vulnerable to a takeover. A change of a couple of shareholders' votes can mean the difference between survival and getting swallowed up. It is a "highly leveraged situation," he said, using the parlance of Wall Street.
He and many other scientists say the risks of meddling significantly with the insulating atmospheric greenhouse are simply too great to continue on the current course, adding more than seven billion tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to the air each year.
But they acknowledge that many of the feedback loops and connections between the components of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, ice caps and, ultimately, climate are complex and remain poorly understood. The computer models with which scientists are projecting the range of future consequences from this rise are still a relatively crude representation of the real world of clouds, ocean currents, jet streams and other complexities.
Some consistent critics of the projections say the models are rife with weaknesses -- particularly in predicting how warming could affect cloud cover and in how solar energy moves from the surface to the highest levels of the atmosphere and then out into space.
An increase in cloudiness could act like panels on a greenhouse roof, countering the heat-trapping effect of the greenhouse gases by reflecting the sun and leading to cooling.
Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consistent skeptic on the perils of climate change, said the negotiations in Kyoto were mostly focused on bolstering the resumes of diplomats.
Even if the models are correct -- which Dr. Lindzen doubts -- the cuts in greenhouse gases on the table are so small that they will hardly matter, he said.
"Climate always changes, whether man does anything about it or not," Dr. Lindzen said. "Now any changes will be attributed to policy, not nature."
BUT many of his colleagues disagree, saying that the models have held true despite continuing efforts to weed out spurious results.
And many of them say it is essential to act now. Dr. Stephen H. Schneider, a Stanford University biology professor, said that in the 20th century, there had already been a distinct warming trend and a change in precipitation patterns that was hard to ascribe to anything other than the manmade increase in greenhouse gases.
"Is this nature being perverse or is it us?" Dr. Schneider said. "The only way to prove it for sure is hang around 10, 20 or 30 more years, when the evidence would be overwhelming. But in the meantime, we're conducting a global experiment. And we're all in the test tube."

Charts: "Carbon on the Rise"
Changes in the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, have been directly linked to changes in global temperatures. After a long period of stability, carbon dioxide levels began to rise with the onset of the Inudstrial Revolution. The increase has become progressively more rapid in this century, reflecting ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuels. Trying to gauge the changes ahead, a United Nations panel made a range of estimates of how carbon levels would increase in the 21st century under a "business as usual" scenario -- in the absence of an effort to limit carbon emissions. Three of the estimates are shown; for details, see p. 4. Many scientists believe the likelihood of catastrophic climate changes will increase the closer the atmosphere comes to a doubling of the preindustrial carbon level.
 
The Earth's 'Glass Ceiling'
Sunlight heats the Earth. But the Earth would be far cooler if not for the presence of water vapor and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They let sunlight through to warm the Earth, but trap some of the heat escaping back to space in the form of infrared radiation - just as a greenhouse's glass ceiling slows the escape of heat. Increasing the atmosphere's levels of greenhouse gases is like adding thicker glass to a greenhouse's roof. As more heat is trapped, the greenhouse grows warmer. Many scientists believe that the carbon dioxide released by human activities has already begun to raise the Earth's overall temperature.
 
Clearing the forests
Possibly the first large-scale human effect on carbon dioxide levels occurred with the clearing of North American and European forests.
 
Railroads
With the rise of steam power in locomotives, facotries and ships, coal became the foundation of the industrial economy that spread across the globe in the 19th century.
 
Oil
Oil, first pumped in Pennsylvania in 1859, surpassed coal as the world's primary energy source in the mid 1960's. Shown above is a Texas oil field in 1919.
 
Cars
Since 1960, the number of automobiles worldwide has incrased more than twice as fast as the population, rising from 127 million registered vehicles in 1960 to 647 million in 1995.
 
Rain forests
The burning of the Amazon rain forest, left, put Brazil high on the list of carbon emitters in the 1980's. The fires, which continue today, are also removing a valuable carbon sink.
 
Coal
Coal use remained high in the Communist bloc until its economy collapsed along with the Soviet Union; these countries are still struggling to rid themselves of their dependency on this carbon-heavy fuel. A mine in Silesia, Poland, left.
 
Population
More people means more energy use. One big uncertainty in predicting climate change is how soon the 20th century's rapid growth -- from 2 billion people worldwide in 1900 to 5.87 billion today -- will level off.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
In Kyoto, The Subject Is Climate; The Forecast Is for Storms

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN its 4.5 billion years of existence, the earth has withstood both deep cold that nearly turned the entire planet into a ball of ice and blazing heat that opened the Arctic to alligators and other warm-weather creatures.
Compared with that, and even with far less extreme climatic swings in the 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age, today's climate -- for all its sometimes sharp variations -- is remarkably stable. 
 Now, for the first time, humans are altering the atmosphere in ways that mainstream scientists believe are threatening to shatter that relative calm and set off a new round of climatic disruptions and extremes.
Starting today, representatives of some 150 countries will meet in Kyoto, Japan, to take what they hope will be the first step in a decades-long effort to cope with the prospect of global climate change. Rarely, if ever, has humanity made an attempt like this one: to exercise deliberate, collective foresight on a risk whose full impact is unclear and will not be felt for decades.
And rarely has any question on the global bargaining table been so difficult.
The negotiators' task is to agree on measures that would begin to reduce emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Chief among these "greenhouse" gases is carbon dioxide, which is spewed into the air every day around the globe by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas in power plants, factories and motor vehicles.
The world runs on these fuels, and any action to control their use would reverberate in every corner of the global economy. This attempt to manipulate the world's energy system has set off a complex clash of economic and political interests.
Among other things, it pits rich countries against poor ones, rich countries against one another and the nations and industries that produce fossil fuels (as well as some industries that use them heavily) against much of the rest of the world. Even as the great majority of players say they accept the need for common action, each is making its own calculation of cost and benefit, advantage and disadvantage.
The panel of scientists from around the world who advise the negotiators under United Nations auspices has said that if no action is taken, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise by two to six degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, and more after that. That might not sound like much, and it is a far cry from the deepest cold and hottest heat of the remote past. But it is not trivial; the difference between the average temperature now and that at the depths of the last ice age, some 20,000 years ago, is only five to nine degrees.
IT would be more warming, coming more rapidly, than the planet has experienced in the last 10,000 years, the period in which human civilization arose. It could profoundly affect the earth's climate.
The seas would rise, according to the panel of scientists, inundating many coastal areas and swamping small island nations. The world as a whole would become rainier, with most of the increase coming in the big downpours that cause floods. At the same time, drought-prone areas would get more droughts.
Climatic zones would shift away from the poles, the scientists predict. Since the warming would be unusually rapid, many natural ecosystems might be unable to adjust, and whole forest types could disappear. Growing seasons are already lengthening in northern latitudes, and temperate-zone agriculture might benefit in the long run. But in dry areas, like much of Africa, warming could bring agricultural and economic ruin. Tropical diseases like malaria and dengue fever could spread. And while temperate-zone winters would be milder, summer heat waves would be more intense and deadly. The list goes on.
Such forecasts, of course, are rife with uncertainty. But many scientists believe that much of the impact is unavoidable. The implication is that preventive action to head off the risk, however uncertain, should have been taken years ago.
But who knew? It has been only two decades since 20th-century scientists, with their computer models, first began to make numerical forecasts of climate change, only one decade since the issue first burst into the public consciousness and only five years since the nations of the world gathered at Rio de Janeiro and signed a treaty aimed at preventing dangerous climatic change.
For much of the last two decades, scientists have cited a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations -- to 560 parts per million from 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th century -- as a threshold of concern. If that threshold should be reached, they say, the air at the earth's surface would warm by anywhere from a relatively moderate three degrees to eight degrees, a level at which the impact of some of the predicted climatic changes could assume catastrophic proportions.
Now many are saying that it may not be possible to prevent a doubling late in the next century. The world's economic and political systems cannot turn on a dime, they say, and they argue that the real task now is to prevent concentrations from growing beyond a doubling, to possibly even tripling or quadrupling. Those concentrations, they say, would bring certain climatic catastrophe. In the meantime, the world may have to learn to adapt.
Not everyone is so pessimistic. Environmentalists' goal is to stabilize carbon dioxide concentrations at about one and a half times the preindustrial level, then to begin to gradually reduce them. Although that might still cause some disruption, they believe, it would head off the most damaging effects.
There remain contrarians who say the problem has been overblown and may not exist. Given the uncertainty that permeates climate science, even many experts who are not skeptics argue for modest action until the extent of the problem is clearer.
As has been the case all along under the 1992 Rio treaty that governs the Kyoto talks, the industrialized countries are expected to take the lead in setting specific targets for reducing emissions. The rationale, based largely on considerations of equity, is that they got rich by burning fossil fuels and are responsible for most of the problem. But developing countries are also to undertake specific commitments at some point because their emissions will probably surpass those of the rich nations in two decades or so.
When that will happen, and how, will be a big issue in Kyoto, possibly a deal-breaker. If the talks collapsed, the process would not be over because discussions would certainly resume at some point. But proponents of action argue that valuable time would be lost.
AT Rio five years ago, the rich nations adopted the voluntary goal of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. But many nations, including the United States, will miss that target. Proposals now on the table for the meeting in Japan call for legally binding reductions. They range from reducing the rich countries' emissions to 1990 levels by around 2010 (proposed by the United States) to cutting them to 35 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 (proposed by the developing countries). None of the proposals would reduce emissions enough to keep overall atmospheric concentrations from rising.
But, given the political reality, those proposals probably define the range of what can be achieved just now. Some environmentalists believe that it is possible to emerge from the talks with cuts sufficient to preserve the option of eventually stabilizing concentrations at one and a half times preindustrial levels. They also say it is possible in Kyoto to send a signal to industry that business as usual must change. Some experts who argue caution, on economic grounds, believe likewise. But other interested parties, including oil-producing countries and many American manufacturers, argue that any action now risks unacceptable short-term economic damage. Environmentalists counter that by insisting that in the long run, cutting fossil fuels would make the economy more efficient.
At most, Kyoto will be a beginning, not an ending.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL WARMING;
No Simple Fight: The Forces That Shaped the Clinton Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO GET a sense of where President Clinton ended up after a year-long White House struggle to shape his global warming plan, consider who quit after it was announced.
It was Timothy E. Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for global environmental affairs, one of the greenest of the President's advisers and nominally the top official directly in charge of negotiations toward a new climate treaty. 
 Mr. Wirth advocated an aggressive plan for significant cutbacks in the nation's emissions of greenhouse gases -- one that could have had significant costs for the economy. Bit by bit, that plan was scaled back as Mr. Clinton listened, and listened again, to the warnings of senior economic advisers like Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Janet L. Yellen.
Mr. Wirth's decision -- to leave his post after the Kyoto talks to head a foundation created by the billionaire Ted Turner to support the United Nations -- followed a long, meandering and occasionally intense debate inside the White House that reflected many of the conflicts that bedevil climate change policy.
The conflicts went beyond the traditional clash of green eyeshades and green armbands, to encompass opposing views on technology's potential and on ways of making predictions about unpredictable systems. The debate also pitted the old Bill Clinton, whose instinct would have been to side with Mr. Wirth's call for sweeping government action, against a new Bill Clinton, chastened by his health-care failure and acutely aware of the domestic impact of foreign policy.
And it was shadowed by two futures: for Mr. Clinton, by a desire to shape his legacy, and for Vice President Al Gore, by the need to balance his strong environmental views against the coalition-building that leads up to a presidential run.
FIVE years ago, President George Bush joined other leaders of developed nations in pledging at the Rio environmental summit to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Two years ago, when it was already clear that the U.S. and some other countries would miss that voluntary target, Mr. Clinton agreed to join an effort to come up with a binding treaty for reductions at Kyoto.
In the struggle that followed, President Clinton's economic advisers stopped him from promising deep, quick cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases, but they argue that they did not win this debate; they say they merely acted as a counterweight to Mr. Wirth, Katie McGinty, the White House environmental adviser, and environmental groups. The President, his economic team notes, did not agree to delay cutbacks in emissions for as long as the economists had initially suggested.
"The spin is that we won," one senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton said recently. "The reality was a little more muddled. We agreed there needed to be goals, even aggressive goals. But there also needed to be escape hatches, in case the economic effects turned out to be a lot more damaging than we thought."
MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production.
In later years, a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions, coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat.
If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions, emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict.
But nobody knows how much that will cost. "There is no credible, widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States, or in most other countries, that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions," said Eileen B. Claussen, a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago.
It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels, but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now, what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer.
That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary, Ms. Claussen said.
There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all, the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore, and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change.
But as one of Mr. Clinton's top aides noted during the debate: "Al has discovered it's a lot easier to write a book about the subject than to grapple with the economic costs. But he's getting the hang of it."
In the end, Mr. Gore was highly receptive to the economic arguments, especially when the chorus of warnings included American business groups, whose support he will need when running for President.
The real debate within the Administration pitted the pure economists against the technologists, the people who deal with the gross domestic product against those who specialize in British thermal units.
The economists were deeply worried that any policy intended to drive down the use of fossil fuels -- especially a policy like the one the Administration favors, to put a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide and to let a market in emission permits dictate the price of fossil fuels -- would, in effect, amount to a system of energy rationing and energy taxes. In their rear-view mirrors, these advisers saw the economic disruptions of the oil shocks of the 1970's.
But the technologists argued that the new policy would stimulate the appearance and rapid adoption of exciting new technologies that would make it possible to conserve energy and to produce more of it without fossil fuels. In their rear-view mirrors, they saw the efficiency gains and higher productivity that resulted from putting the nation on an energy diet in the 1970's and the 1980's.
Both groups have economic models that prove their arguments. But no model is particularly well suited to predict what will happen to energy prices under the Clinton Administration's plan. That is because the plan calls for using inherently unpredictable free markets, rather than rigid regulations, to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The Administration wants to put a fixed overall cap on the total emissions of greenhouse gases by industries. Then it would issue individual companies permits that would allow them to release a certain amount of the gases. Limiting the supply of something increasingly in demand generally has the effect of driving up its price. But the Administration hopes that the permits, which would be traded on a free market, will limit the price pressures on energy and encourage innovation instead.
For instance, a company that found a cheap way to control carbon dioxide emissions could sell its extra permits to a company with high control costs. Both companies would benefit economically from the transaction, and the market in permits would stimulate the invention and adoption of the cheapest possible control technologies.
The Administration hopes to extend the permit system worldwide, allowing poorer countries with low emissions to raise money by selling part of their right to emit greenhouse gases to developed countries that have plenty of cash but have bumped into their pollution limits.
Selling this at Kyoto, where developing nations are demanding deeper, faster cuts, is shaping up as a daunting task. But Mr. Clinton has tried to build his second term on proposals to marry government goals and market mechanisms, and has always prided himself on his deal-making abilities.
This time, it may be the deal of the next century.

Chart: "Targets and Timetables"
On the table in the Kyoto conference will be a wide of proposals for legally binding reductions for developed nations over the next two to three decades.
 
United States
 
TARGET
Reduce emissions to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012; unspecified reductions below 1990 levels after that.
Applies to all six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride.
 
SUMMARY
Imposes a cap on average emissions for the period 2008 through 2012. A system for tradable permits between companies and credits for reductions before then. Supports a similar worldwide trading system. Insists that developing countries make some "meaningful" commitment on emissions levels.
 
European Union
 
TARGET
At least 7.5 percent below 1990 level by 2005; 15 percent below by 2010.
 
SUMMARY
Cleaning up the former East Germany's industrial base and Britain's conversion from coal to natural gas has given the European Union a running start.
 
Developing Nations and China
 
TARGET
Reduction to 1990 levels by 2000; 7.5 percent below 1990 by 2005; 15 percent below 1990 by 2010; 35 percent below by 2020.
Applies to carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
 
SUMMARY
Rejects specific and legally binding targets and global trading system for developing nations at this time. Calls for a fund to compensate poorer countries harmed by climate change or for any economic losses caused by emissions cuts in richer nations (for example, oil-exporting countries.).
 
Japan
 
TARGET

HEADLINE: After Bad Year for A.M.A., Doctors Debate Its Prognosis

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
THE patient has had a bad year: on that much the doctors all agree. But their opinions on the underlying diagnosis and prognosis differ radically.
Some say the 150-year-old American Medical Association is still very much its old healthy self: the pre-eminent medical association in the country, almost 300,000-strong, devoted to safeguarding the profession's highest moral and ethical principles. 
 "We are the voice of the profession, for the profession and for the patients," said the organization's president-elect, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey.
But other doctors are wondering more vocally than ever whether the association that claims to speak for them still has any real right to do so. The organization's membership is declining; its policy-making body, the House of Delegates, espouses views far to the right of many members, especially younger doctors, and its continuing efforts to protect the turf of American-trained doctors gives support to critics who say it operates more like a trade union than a professional organization.
Only about 40 percent of the country's roughly 700,000 doctors and 55 percent of its medical students are now members, in contrast with the organization's heyday in the 1960's, when about 90 percent of doctors in private practice belonged. Despite a public relations campaign begun several years ago to promote a "new A.M.A." devoted to patient care and public health, it still struggles against a reputation as a reactionary organization dedicated mainly to maintaining doctors' incomes.
Yet even its harshest critics acknowledge that the association can speak for the profession with an eloquence and credibility that none of the hundreds of other medical groups in the country can match.
"It represents the best and the worst of medicine," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor in chief emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine.
Last August, the association announced an exclusive contract with the Sunbeam Corporation to endorse the company's home-health-related appliances in return for anticipated millions in royalty dollars. A week later, facing a torrent of criticism, it withdrew from the deal, dismissed three nonphysician executives and established an ad hoc panel of ethicists and other experts to review all existing relationships with for-profit companies and to establish acceptable guidelines for future ones.
For the doctors who lead the association, that is the end of the story, despite a pending breach-of-contract suit by Sunbeam. "We'll move on," said Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, chairman of the trustees.
Outside the organization, though, the Sunbeam events have crystallized larger questions.
Dr. Relman said, "The recent episode damaged their reputation a good deal, their reputation as an organization promoting professional values and maintaining standards."
Dr. Richard J. Baron, a Philadelphia internist and association member, called the Sunbeam deal a disaster. But he added, "We're in such a bad way as a profession that I'm reluctant to shoot down any medical organization that may offer some vehicle for unifying us."
Certainly no medical association rivals the A.M.A. either in members or financial resources. Even the largest among the others, like the American College of Physicians, have less than half the association's membership. No other group matches the association in operating revenue ($208 million in 1996) or in its ability to play hardball in Washington. Ampac, its political action committee, consistently ranks among the top 10 spenders on Capitol Hill, Federal Election Commission data show. In the 1995-96 election cycle, political spending by the association and its state chapters totaled about $3 million.
The association makes political and other policy decisions not by popular vote but in three interacting bodies of elected and appointed representatives: a House of Delegates seating almost 500, a 19-member executive board and a 9-member ethical and judicial council.
In twice-yearly meetings, the House of Delegates votes on policy issues that include seat belts, infant car seats (for, 1978), tobacco advertising (against, 1985), doctor-assisted suicide (against, 1996) and the criminalization of the late-trimester procedure its critics call "partial birth abortion" (for, 1997).
Yet critics say this elaborate structure stifles the organization's ability to cope with changing times.
They point out that a large percentage of country's medical people remain well outside the association's ranks. The 20 percent of American doctors who are women are underrepresented in the ranks, and even rarer in the House of Delegates. The 3 percent of doctors who are black have been slow to leave the ranks of the National Medical Association, formed in the 19th century when state restrictions in the South effectively barred blacks from the A.M.A. Although more than half of the nation's doctors are in their 20's, 30's and 40's, the average age in the House of Delegates is more than 60.
And the numerous doctors who immigrated to this country after graduating from foreign medical schools are also notably underrepresented. Foreign graduates now account for almost 25 percent of doctors working in this country, but fewer than 30 percent of them belong.
"On any issue pertaining to international medical graduates, it seemed that our biggest obstacle was always the A.M.A.," said Dr. Abraham Verghese, who was born in Ethiopia, received his medical training in India and is now a professor of medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center in El Paso.
This year, the association is formally soliciting the participation of foreign graduates. Still, the organization's ambivalence toward foreign graduates, who are often felt to take up hospital training slots that Americans might otherwise occupy, remains palpable. A recent xenophobic editorial in American Medical News, the association's official newspaper. began "Land of (too much) opportunity" and argued that foreign doctors who trained in this country's hospitals should "return to their land of origin."
"The changes they are making are cosmetic but not heartfelt," said Dr. Verghese, who is not a member of the association. "I don't think their fundamental position has changed."
Other nonmembers ascribe their disaffection with the association to its century-long advocacy of fee-for-service health care, which they regard as a position inspired by Victorian sanctimony and robber-baron greed that gave rise to today's health care crisis.
"They're responsible for fiddling while Rome burned," said Dr. David Himmelstein, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and a spokesman for Physicians for a National Health Program, which favors a health care system similar to the Canadian one, in which the government pays for medical care."They spent 80 years devoted to the well-being of the doctors' pocketbooks, to the encouragement of doctors' greed as an overriding concern."
Dr. Himmelstein is not a member of the association.
But Dr. Douglas Robins, a Washington dermatologist who also advocates a single-payer national health insurance system has been a member for 25 years. "I have a lot of respect for the organization," he said. "But the House of Delegates clearly does not reflect the opinions of the rank and file. The population of doctors in the country is changing dramatically, and the A.M.A. represents only part of them."
Last winter, Dr. Robins formally proposed that the organization study the merits of a single-payer plan. The House of Delegates voted him down.
Dr. Robins said he would like to see the organization change, but he predicted instead that "they will lose more members, become less relevant, less effective at lobbying, generally lose credibility."
Dr. John D. Clough, an Ohio doctor who edits The Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine and is also a longstanding member of the association, has similar concerns. He said the organizational structure, in which local, county and state medical societies funnel representatives to a national organization, no longer worked.
"Physicians have diversified to the point where it is very hard to find economic or political issues they all agree on," Dr. Clough said. "But yet these organizations have continued to remain politically active, mostly for conservative causes, so that they wind up working against the interests of some of their members."
Dr. Clough believes that organized medicine has got to evolve, to refocus a little and begin to realize what unites doctors. "There are a lot of altruistic issues that you can bring physicians together on, that focus on the benefit of the patient rather than the benefit of the doctor, on fewer self-serving things," he said. "That's the way it should be."
In fact, the association sponsors a steady stream of initiatives that fit that bill, from how-to pamphlets guiding doctors in the management of family violence, child neglect and sexual assault to a thick annotated code book of medical ethics for general reference. This year the association founded a research center called the Ethics Institute to examine the ethical aspects of managed care, end-of-life care and genetic medicine. An independent entity, the National Patient Safety Foundation, was also begun this year with generous support from the association to study, demystify and reduce the frequency of medical errors.
"Perhaps they are trying to recreate themselves as a moral voice in a world that's crying out for one," said Dr. John Lantos, a pediatrician and ethicist at the University of Chicago. "Could you imagine, for instance, if the A.M.A. went on record saying that every physician has an obligation to care for the poor?"
Like any political party, the association inevitably promotes a continuing personal calculus of compromise among members and nonmembers.
"It's an immense organization with its finger in literally hundreds of issues," Dr. Dickey said. "By its very breadth of interest and action, it creates controversy. You can't have as broad a policy as we do and not have some folks who disagree with you, vehemently in some cases."
"We all get mail," Dr. Seward said. "But its interesting when you look at it -- we probably get as much both pro and anti mail from nonmembers as we do from members."

KIDS' STUFF
Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood
By Gary Cross
283 pages. Harvard University Press. $29.95.
In only a few decades, American toys have undergone a startling metamorphosis. Baby boomers grew up with toys that were supposed to prepare them for the real world: doctor and nurse's kits, model airplane kits, Tonka trucks and Betty Crocker bake sets. Even their make-believe toys -- based on the space craze and the western fad -- were vaguely rooted in America's past and future. The toys that boomers' children covet, in contrast, have almost nothing to do with the real world: there are dinosaurs equipped with laser beams and missiles, pastel-colored ponies with manes and tails to comb and robots that turn into airplanes and cars. 
 Even venerable G.I. Joe changed to keep up with the times: the average soldier (modeled on fathers' experiences in World War II and Korea) was later reincarnated as a high-tech hero, outfitted with laser beams and rocket command vehicles to fight off menacing aliens.
"By the 1980's play was divorced from the constraints of parents and their real worlds," writes Gary Cross in "Kids' Stuff," his fascinating new study of American toys. "Toys that evoked memories of real wars, western adventure or dreams of future space exploration gave way to action figures, combinations of cliches torn from any realistic context. The dolls and play sets that encouraged girls to act out their mothers' roles were replaced by Barbie's fantasies of personal consumption. Preschool play, once the realm of blocks, pull toys and teddy bears, now featured junior versions of fashion and action play. Educational toys were increasingly marginalized. Even Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys were edged off store shelves by fantasy playthings."
In "Kids' Stuff," Mr. Cross -- a professor of history at Pennsylvania State University -- not only gives the reader a succinct history of toys in America, but also examines the reasons for the sea change that has taken place in the toy industry in recent years. He looks at changing notions of childhood and disparate theories of play, and he assesses the declining popularity of the educational toy as a means of developing a child's creativity and skills.
Although Mr. Cross makes it clear that he is distressed by the increasingly commercialized -- and inane -- toys that have been merchandized in recent years, he has not written a polemic or diatribe, but an intelligently informed analysis that reveals a lot about how our attitudes toward children. and children's attitudes toward the world, have evolved over the last century.
As Mr. Cross sees it, the ascendence of the fantasy-novelty toy began back in the 1930's with celebrity-inspired toys like the Shirley Temple doll and the Buck Rogers pistol, and was later given a huge boost by television, which enabled toy makers to ignore the concerns of parents and appeal directly to children with escapist fare. From the 60's on, more and more toys (like Creepy Crawlers, Garbage Pail Kids and Rat Fink) would be designed to satisfy children's anarchic impulses while irritating their parents.
By the 70's, Mr. Cross observes, this development was accelerated further by many parents' confusion about "appropriate sex roles" and "the proper uses of war and violence in play." "No longer," he writes, "did they buy toys that claimed to prepare girls to be good mothers and wives or boys to become successful men of work and science. Even the toy soldiers that glorified the wars of fathers no longer worked by the late 1960's because of the controversies over Vietnam. Parents were less willing to give children toys that claimed to teach the young to follow in their parents' footsteps. They had lost confidence that they knew what their children's path to maturity should be."
Oddly enough, the new toys that filled the vacuum -- sappy Care Bears and My Little Ponys for girls; violent He Man warriors and Transformers for boys -- did nothing to eliminate traditional sex roles; as Mr. Cross points out, they simply made "male heroism more fantastic and female caring less grounded in reality."
At the same time, mergers and buyouts in the toy business had created a new selling environment in which there was more incentive, in Mr. Cross's words, "to pick winners rather than to meet the developmental needs of children." With the defeat of reformers' efforts to prohibit toy ads on children's television in the late 70's, toy companies found a new way to virtually guarantee a winner: "program-length commercials," that is, cartoon shows like "He-Man and Masters of the Universe," "Care Bears" and "Strawberry Shortcake" that kept a toy and its add-ons and accessories in front of children week after week. By the fall of 1985, Mr. Cross reports, the top 10 best-selling toys all had their own cartoons.
Although the late 80's saw a brief "back to basics movement," television and movie tie-ins surged back again in the 90's with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Spiderman. Indeed the action figure seems to have permanently displaced old-fashioned toys like the teddy bear. As Mr. Cross observes, "the economic advantages of the 'recognizable' toy based on TV fantasy were too great for any alternative to prevail."

Dollar Up vs. Yen on Doubts About Japan's Overhaul Plan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar surged to its highest level in five and a half years against the yen yesterday on speculation that Japan might not do enough to bail out ailing banks and securities firms.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said yesterday that he would doanything necessary to stabilize the financial system. Yet he also indicated that his first priority would be to protect depositors, not banks. 
 Traders took the remarks as a suggestion that the Government might let weak banks fail and that the worst might not be over for Japan's financial institutions. That is keeping investors wary of buying the yen, which is down 6.5 percent versus the dollar in the last month.
"It's unusual for Japan to take speedy and aggressive solutions to problems," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Baring Capital Markets. "The yen will still weaken."
The yen was also dragged down by fresh signs of economic woes in South Korea. Officials there said the country remained at odds with the International Monetary Fund over how much economic pain it would have to endure in exchange for a bailout plan aimed at helping its debt-ridden financial system.
Questions over the bailout plan hurt the yen because South Korea is one of Japan's biggest trading partners and biggest debtors.
"Korea is the 800-pound gorilla for Japan," said Bob Near, an institutional currency salesman at Bank of New York. "What's happening with Korea puts pressure on Japan."
The Korean won fell to a record low yesterday, pushing the dollar up to 1,187 won.
The dollar rose as high as 129.32 yen before settling in New York late yesterday at 128.91 yen, up from 127.82 yen on Friday. The dollar rose to 1.7771 marks, from 1.7645 marks on Friday -- its highest against the mark since Oct. 22. The pound fell to $1.6846 from $1.6886.
Against the mark, the dollar rose on expectations that Germany's economy was not expanding fast enough to prompt the Bundesbank to raise interest rates any time soon.
The mark was also hurt by signs of weakness in Russia, where stocks fell to a seven-month low. Problems in Russia can weaken the mark since Germany is Russia's biggest trading partner and lender.

HEADLINE: Asian Pact Endorses I.M.F.-Led Bailouts

BYLINE: Dow Jones

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Finance ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed a plan today for dealing with future Asian financial crises that gave the leading role to the International Monetary Fund.
And they failed to push forward a proposal by Malaysia's Finance Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, to create a special Asian standby facility to supplement I.M.F. lending. 
 In a statement issued on the first day of a meeting here -- which also included discussions with senior finance officials of Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Australia and the United States -- the ministers said that "Asean countries in a position to provide financial assistance would give special consideration to support any member country requiring such assistance."
Rather than setting up a separate Asian standby facility, they confirmed an initiative in Manila that gives the I.M.F. the leading role in organizing more comprehensive surveillance of troubled Asian economies as well as in organizing new sources of emergency financing.
The trigger for any kind of financial assistance for Asian countries will be entry into an I.M.F. program, the Philippine Finance Secretary, Roberto De Ocampo, said.
But Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, seemed displeased with the decision, saying he would have preferred an Asian financing mechanism that was not "merely an appendage" of the I.M.F.
The United States argued that a separate relief mode for Asia would create a "moral hazard," allowing borrowing nations to think that they could get access to money without adopting the tough financial and budgetary steps the I.M.F. requires.
A bailout for Indonesia organized in October, of nearly $40 billion, is seen as the model for the new process. The I.M.F. and other donors are providing $18 billion in exchange for strict economic reforms. Japan, Singapore, the United States and others have pledged "second line" funds if the $18 billion proves insufficient.
Asean's Secretary General, Ajit Singh, said that under the arrangement announced today, additional funds for Asean countries in financial trouble would not be amassed up front, but would be collected when needed on a voluntary basis from participating Asean members.
In fact, Singapore and Brunei are the only Asean nations with substantial reserves. The economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have been ravaged by five months of financial turmoil.

Bond Prices Inch Up as Data Indicate Inflation Stays Mild

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged up in quiet trading yesterday after a trade association's report suggested that the economy was growing slowly enough to keep inflation at bay.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly manufacturing index posted a bigger-than-expected decline, while its index of prices paid, an inflation gauge, also fell. 
 The report "was positive for bonds," said Garth Nisbet, who manages $750 million in bonds at the Crabbe Huson Group in Portland, Ore. "The numbers being down add to the case for the economy slowing."
Slower growth reduces the likelihood that inflation -- which erodes the value of bonds' fixed payments -- will accelerate.
The report was one of the first major economic indicators to be released after turmoil in Asia roiled stock markets worldwide and sent investors scurrying to the safety of Treasury securities. Traders have also been buying bonds on expectations that the turbulence in Asia will slow the United States economy enough to restrain inflation.
"Now we are getting information that is more current and reflects the new economic realities," said Tony Crescenzi, head Government bond trader at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company. "The data finally takes on importance again and it will matter" to bond investors, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32, to 101 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent in a shortened session on Friday.
The Treasury sold $14.54 billion of new three-month and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction. The three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.11 percent, down from 5.145 percent last week, and the six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 5.195 percent, the same as last week.
Bond prices also got a lift yesterday from a rally in the dollar, and from declines in oil and gold prices, traders said.
Gold slumped to its lowest levels since March 1985, while crude oil fell to a five-month low. The drop in gold, a traditional hedge against rising prices, suggests that investors are not worried that inflation is about to quicken.
Also, the dollar climbed as high as 129.32 Japanese yen, the most since May 29, 1992. A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated bonds more attractive to investors overseas.
Comments from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan reduced concern that Japanese banks and Government institutions would resort to selling some holdings of Treasury securities to shore up finances or pay for a bailout.
"People are less concerned about repatriation" of funds by Japanese institutions, said Robert McGee, economist at Tokai Bank.
Among corporate borrowers, BNP U.S. Funding L.L.C., Avon Energy Holdings and Amgen Inc. are a few of the companies planning to sell a combined $2 billion of debt this week.
Companies generally refrained from tapping the corporate bond market last week because demand often dwindles around the holidays.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Index Shows Activity Cools For Factories

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
A closely watched gauge of manufacturing cooled in November, reflecting slowdowns in new orders and production that suggested factory activity peaked earlier in the year.
The gauge, the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index, declined to 54.4 last month from 56 in October, the association said today. 
 The index, one of the freshest barometers of the economy's performance, has fallen in three of the last four months after reaching a two- and-a-half-year high in July.
Still, index readings of 50 or above mean factory output continues to expand. Moreover, a separate Commerce Department report today showed that construction spending increased in October for the fourth consecutive month, climbing one-tenth of a percent, to a record $605.5 billion.
"The economy is still very, very strong," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the N.A.P.M. survey committee and an executive at the Sonoco Products Company, a packaging manufacturer in Hartsville, S.C. "Our members continue to be very optimistic," though the economic crisis in Asia is causing businesses to rethink their 1998 prospects, he said.
The purchasing managers' report contributed to a strong rally in the financial markets because it signaled that the economy remained vibrant but not growing at an inflationary pace. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 190 points, or 2.43 percent, to 8,013, its first finish above 8,000 since the big drop in October. Yields on the Treasury's 30-year bond, an indicator of interest rate trends and inflation fears, fell to 6.04 percent.
Components of the purchasing report "are consistent with the view that activity is slowing," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York.
The price-index component fell to 51.9 in November from 55.9 during October. The orders index decreased to 54.5 from 59. The production index fell to 58.6 from 60. These indexes do not measure how much factories produced or to what extent prices rose or fell. Instead, they gauge the number of manufacturers surveyed that reported increased production or paid more for raw materials.
With the economic crisis in Asia damping demand for United States exports, overall growth in the current fourth quarter -- as measured by the gross domestic product -- is expected to fall short of the third quarter's 3.3 percent gain.
"There's caution about the economic outlook," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. However, "the economy isn't quite softer yet," she said.
Asia's economic problems could put a damper on the United States because "a lot of companies that had big contracts for infrastructure projects just aren't going to get those sales," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass.

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson, in Kenya, Links Benefits to Fair Elections

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 1

 BODY:
On his first trip as a United States special envoy, the Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered a strong message to the Kenyan President today, warning that general elections here next month must not be rigged or marred by violence if Kenya hopes for good relations and trade with the United States.
"We hope that by turning the lights on Kenya, that this will definitely help in the process of having open, free, fair, world-class elections," Mr. Jackson said at a news conference this evening after meeting with President Daniel arap Moi. 
 Mr. Jackson, whom President Clinton recently appointed as "special envoy for democracy," arrived in the Kenyan capital late Sunday night for three days of talks with Government officials, clergy and opposition leaders about the elections scheduled to be held on Dec. 29.
He met with Mr. Moi for nearly an hour this morning. During the meeting, diplomats said, the American envoy said he made it clear that Kenya's relations with the United States depended on the elections conducted without fraud. Mr. Jackson told reporters that it was necessary for the region's stability that "people's fears about rigging be allayed."
Mr. Jackson, the most prominent black politician in America and twice a candidate for President, said that changes adopted by the Kenyan Parliament last month, making it easier for challengers to campaign, were steps in the right direction, even if they were incomplete. He said it appeared that opposition politicians were now holding rallies and speaking out in public without interference from the police.
Mr. Moi, the 74-year-old strongman who has been in power in Kenya since 1979, is expected to win the election with little trouble. Though Mr. Moi can command only about 40 percent of the electorate, he faces a splintered opposition, divided along tribal lines and unable to unite behind a single candidate or platform.
Still, the elections are widely seen here as a watershed for Kenya, a test of how far the country has moved toward an open democracy since 1992, when Mr. Moi reluctantly agreed under heavy international pressure to abandon the one-party state and allow multiparty elections. Those elections, however, were marked by widespread ethnic violence and official harassment of opposition leaders.
Mr. Moi's party pushed through several reforms this fall after pro-democracy demonstrations escalated into riots between the police and opposition supporters over the summer, sending the tourist-driven economy into a tailspin and drawing harsh criticism from Western democracies and Japan, which provide millions in aid to Kenya.
To forestall cuts in foreign aid and take the wind out of the reform movement's sails, Mr. Moi last month repealed several colonial-era laws that gave the President broad powers to detain political opponents, control parties, disperse demonstrations and ban publications. The Parliament also expanded the electoral commission, adding more opposition members, and mandated that the state-controlled television and radio give equal time to the opposition.
Mr. Moi's political opponents maintain that the reforms do not go far enough and came too late to help them.

HEADLINE: Clinton Conditionally Supports U.S. Role in Bailout

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the United States was prepared to contribute to the bailout of South Korea, but only if the South Korean Government agreed to the kinds of painful economic changes being demanded by the International Monetary Fund.
Although American participation in the rescue plan has been likely since South Korea agreed to request international financial assistance last month, Mr. Clinton appeared to be using the prospect as a carrot to entice Seoul to give ground in its last-minute negotiations with the I.M.F. 
 Mr. Clinton did not specify how much money the United States might make available, and other Administration officials said they would not determine an amount until the I.M.F. negotiations had been completed. But they said any American financing would be used as a backup to the I.M.F. package and would be offered in conjunction with similar pledges likely to be made by Japan, members of the European Union and other nations.
News reports in South Korea in recent days said the United States and Japan would put up a combined $20 billion to supplement, if necessary, the roughly $20 billion being provided by the I.M.F., plus billions of dollars that would come from other international organizations including the World Bank.
But analysts said the direct American contribution to the bailout was likely to be far smaller than those reports suggested. In a similar package negotiated recently for Indonesia, for example, the United States said it was prepared to use as much as $3 billion to help stabilize that country's currency and halt the spread of financial instability across Asia.
In remarks to reporters at the White House, Mr. Clinton said he expected South Korea to take some "tough medicine," as Mexico did when its economy was rocked three years ago by a devaluation of its currency and widespread weakness in its financial system.
"I favor a strong agreement with the I.M.F. that would actually restore financial stability and confidence in South Korea," Mr. Clinton said. "And if such an agreement could be made, then I would favor the United States participating, along with Japan, much the same way we did in the recent matter involving Indonesia."
The I.M.F., with the support of the United States, has been pressing South Korea to close weak financial institutions, raise interest rates to support the value of its battered currency, sharply cut Government spending and weaken the ties between the Government and some of the country's largest industrial conglomerates.
American officials said they were willing to commit money to the South Korean bailout as a "second line of defense" to be used only if the funds provided by the I.M.F. proved inadequate to stabilize the currency, the won. Only strict trading limits imposed by Seoul have kept the won from free fall in the last few weeks. Mr. Clinton would not seek Congressional authority for the backup financing, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, but would instead use the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a pool of money set up 60 years ago that can be used at the President's discretion to maintain stability in currency markets.
The fund is a war chest built up over the years, in large part through profitable buying and selling of currencies by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Use of the fund does not require any appropriation by Congress.
The same fund was used by Mr. Clinton to advance $12 billion to Mexico when the Republican-controlled Congress balked at approving a broader rescue package. Mexico repaid the loans in full. The stabilization fund would also be the source of the $3 billion committed to Indonesia if I.M.F. financing proves inadequate.
The fund currently has about $40 billion in assets. Of that, about $15 billion is held in dollars, another $15 billion is in German marks and Japanese yen purchased over the years on foreign exchange markets in defense of the dollar, and $10 billion is held in a form of i.o.u. In practical terms, the fund has more than $10 billion immediately available to deal with the situation in South Korea, and more could easily be made available.
However, the Administration's relationship with Republicans in Congress over international financial assistance remains strained. Republicans blocked an Administration request last month to increase the lines of credit extended by the United States to the I.M.F., and they have intermittently tried to place restrictions on the use of the stabilization fund.
Congress is out of session, but Mr. Rubin said that he had kept Congressional leaders up to date about the situation in Asia and that the response to plans for use of the stabilization fund for Indonesia and possibly for South Korea had been "constructive."

HEADLINE: Global Warming Talks Open in Kyoto

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Dec. 1

 BODY:
A conference that is supposed to cap more than two years of negotiations on what to do about global warming opened here today amid widespread concern that too many hard issues remained to allow the completion of an effective agreement before the talks end in nine days.
"This negotiation hasn't matured; it's like new wine, and I don't know if we can ferment it in time," said Melinda Kimble, a senior State Department official who is leading the United States delegation until the higher-level ministerial phase of the talks begins next Monday. 
 Today, however, Ms. Kimble hinted at some flexibility in the American position on setting targets for reduction of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.
After more than two years of bargaining, delegates from more than 150 countries are meeting for their final session in the high-tech Kyoto International Conference Hall, set among lovely hills, gardens and ponds in this ancient capital and repository of traditional Japanese culture.
Surrounded by thousands of lobbyists and journalists from around the world, the negotiators are trying to agree not just on the amount by which emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide should be cut over the next 10 to 20 years, and on what schedule, but also on how to share the burden, what gases to include and how to structure the immensely complex task.
The job has turned out to be more complicated and difficult than was envisioned in March 1995, when parties to the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change decided that stronger action was needed, say many who are involved. In 1995, it was seen simply as a matter of deciding on a reduction target and a timetable for the industrialized countries. Now it has broadened to include the highly contentious role of developing nations, as well as a number of elaborate mechanisms by which the reductions might be carried out.
As a result, many experts say, there is a distinct possibility that the talks will not be concluded here, at least not fully, and will have to be extended much as were negotiations on setting up the World Trade Organization -- a task that took more than a decade.
But not everyone is pessimistic, and Ms. Kimble today sent a signal that prompted Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Maltese executive secretary of the United Nations climate secretariat, to declare that "the negotiation is on its way."
Ms. Kimble said at the opening session of the conference of parties to the 1992 Rio climate treaty, under which the talks are being held, that the United States would no longer insist on a flat-rate, one-size-fits-all reduction target for all countries. Instead, she said, the Americans were "prepared to consider the possibility of limited, carefully bounded differentiation" of targets among industrialized countries.
Different targets for different countries, tailored to their economic and social profiles, have emerged as a possible way to get around the impasse among rich countries over what targets and timetables for reductions they should adopt. The European Union, Japan and Russia have all proposed variations on the theme of differentiation, but the United States had until today declined to join in what could ultimately be the key to an agreement on one of the talks' two central issues.
On the other central issue -- how soon developing countries should be bound by specific reductions targets and timetables -- Ms. Kimble said they need not take the same form as those of rich nations. Rather, she suggested, the poorer countries might voluntarily, or as a result of future negotiations, adopt emission growth targets.
The Clinton Administration has said it will sign no agreement that does not include all countries, and Ms. Kimble's statement was the clearest indication so far of what sort of participation by developing countries might be acceptable to the United States.
But the developing countries have insisted all along, and reiterated today, that consideration of specific commitments for themselves is out of the question until the richer nations demonstrate that they are actually reducing emissions. The rationale is that since the rich countries got wealthy by burning the coal and oil that emit carbon dioxide and are the biggest emitters of the gas, they should lead the way.
The United States insists that the developing countries should take on additional commitments, beyond a very general injunction to take steps to reduce emissions required by the 1992 treaty, because their emissions will outstrip those of the rich countries early in the next century.
Scientists advising the negotiators say that if emissions are not reduced, the average global surface temperature will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. This, say the scientists, would cause sea levels to rise, many coastal zones and small island countries to be inundated, climatic zones to shift, rainstorms to become heavier, floods and droughts to become worse, heat waves to become more lethal and some natural ecosystems to disappear.
Any agreement in Kyoto on reductions would be considered a first step, since none of the proposals now on the table for industrialized countries' emission reductions would stop overall greenhouse gas concentrations from continuing to accumulate in the atmosphere; they would merely reduce the rate a bit.
One of the most stringent reduction proposals on the table, advanced by the European Union, would limit overall emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to 7.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2005 and 15 percent by 2010.
The United States has proposed that levels be stabilized at 1990 levels in the period 2008 through 2112. The Administration says that would trim emissions by 30 percent from what they would be in the absence of any action.
The American proposal diverges from all others under consideration in that it applies to a larger "basket" of six greenhouse gases that also includes hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride. The Administration argues that this is an environmentally friendlier course, but a harder one that would not allow the Europeans to achieve their proposed goals.
"I do not see a major difference between the U.S. and the E.U.," said Hiroshi Ohki of Japan, who today was elected president of the conference of parties to the 1992 treaty that are meeting here. He said he believed that the industrialized countries could come to an accommodation.
In addition to the developing-country issue, a number of time-consuming and intricate technical problems must also be dealt with. Among these are the question of how to structure an emission-trading system that the United States says would cut the cost of reduction; which greenhouse gases to include in a reduction regime; the degree to which forests (which absorb carbon dioxide) should be considered in giving credit for reductions, and how differentiated targets could be devised and applied.
If time runs out, say some representatives of environmental groups, extending the talks would be better than producing a flawed agreement that pleases no one -- and that might not be ratified by key countries like the United States -- just for the sake of having an accord.
Mr. Zammit Cutajar remained optimistic. "We have a lot of time," he said, "10 whole days and nights."

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge As Fears Ebb About Asia

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING

 BODY:
A sense that Japanese and Southeast Asian officials are moving quickly to address the financial problems in their economies fueled a rally in stock markets around the world yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 2.4 percent to above the 8,000-point level for the first time in more than a month.
Interest rates also fell in the United States, following a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management that its factory index slipped last month. That was taken as a sign that the economy was not racing ahead too fast, and the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent on Friday. 
 Lower interest rates helped to spur a rally in bank stocks, which also benefited from lessening concerns about Asian exposure as well as from another big bank merger. The National City Corporation of Cleveland agreed to acquire First of America Bank, based in Michigan, in a stock worth $80.10 a share, or $6.7 billion. National City shares fell 3 15/16, to 62 13/16, while those of First of America leaped 14, to 72 3/4. Citicorp rose 9 1/2, to 129 7/16; J. P. Morgan gained 6 9/16, to 120 3/4, and BankAmerica added 6, to 79.
Asian and European markets were strengthened by reports that the Japanese Government was ready to inject public funds to thwart a widespread financial crisis. They were also encouraged by the South Korean Government's announcement that a bailout package there was imminent, though an agreement with the International Monetary Fund apparently unraveled later in the day. Early today, Japanese stocks were slightly lower, while shares in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index were up more than 3 percent.
"The bad news is you've got this disease, but the good news is you've got this treatment," Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Company International Inc., said of Southeast Asia's financial woes. "These countries do have the right kind of medicine being applied."
The problems of Japan and Southeast Asia's emerging markets will lead to a slower rate of economic growth in that region, but the "feedback to the U.S. will not be that big," Mr. Brusca predicted. Thus, he added, the prospect of the American economy suffering a recession as a result of the Asian problems is unlikely.
"The scenario where Godzilla attacks New York and steps on Manhattan is not very credible," Mr. Brusca said. "I don't think it's time to write horror stories."
After falling 57 points last week, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 189.98 points yesterday, or 2.43 percent, to 8,013.11. The gains pushed the Dow's closing price to more than 8,000-point level for the first time since Oct. 22.
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.03 percent, or 19.38 points, to 974.78, its highest close since it peaked Oct. 7 at 983.12.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index also posted strong gains, jumping 30.17 points, to 1,630.72, a gain of 1.88 percent. Microsoft added 2 5/16 a share, to 143 13/16, while Intel rose 3 7/8, to 81 1/2. Xilinx, like Intel a maker of semiconductors, jumped 5 7/8 a share, to 40 7/16.
The American market has also begun to benefit from problems overseas, as some investors here have shunned international investments and channeled cash back into the domestic market, Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, said.
In addition, declining interest rates are making fixed-income investments less attractive when compared with stocks, he said.
"The message of the rally is relief that some of these concerns have been lessened," Mr. Cripps said, referring to Asian worries. "And there are not a lot of other places to put your money for a return that is greater" than found in stocks.
In plowing into equities, investors initially flocked to larger corporations. As dismay about the international scene lessened, shares of multinationals also rose. Those gains pushed Morgan Stanley's index of the 50 largest multinational companies up 2.3 percent. The index is now up 35.4 percent this year, more even than the robust year-to-date climbs of 24.3 percent for the Dow and 31.5 percent for the S.& P.
"These are the stocks that are supposed to be hurt by a rising dollar," Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal & Company, said of the gains among multinationals. Shares of Coca-Cola rose 2 1/16, to 64 9/16.
Mr. Rice said he believed such stocks were advancing "because basically nothing happened." He added: "None of the currencies collapsed. None of the world markets collapsed. I don't think we've seen the last of the problems, but no bad news is good news."
Still, he warned, any unexpected turmoil could cause the market to tumble. "We're setting ourselves up for the possibility of another correction," Mr. Rice said. "As oversold as we got is as overbought as we're going to get."

 BODY:
Paul Craig, president of the Capstone Turbine Corporation, arrived at company headquarters here near dawn last year to find a stranger standing in the parking lot by one of Capstone's test products. Fearing that the man might damage the small power generator, which was whining like a miniature jet engine, Mr. Craig confronted him.
The stranger turned out to be Paolo Citterio, a young Italian food company executive who had recently seen a demonstration of Capstone's technology. "I have been sitting here for an hour watching and listening to your machine," Mr. Citterio said. "It makes my heart sing." 
 Mr. Citterio is not the only one who has fallen in love with the Capstone turbogenerator, which produces 30 kilowatts of electricity -- enough to power a small restaurant or a convenience store -- hot air and virtually no pollutants. Backers of the privately held company include Benjamin Rosen, the venture capitalist who helped found Compaq Computer, Lotus Development and other technology winners; Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and William H. Gates.
Why would such superstars stray from the digital world to risk money on the stodgy power industry? It's because they believe history just might repeat itself, with the small generator revolutionizing the power industry just as the microprocessor did the computer industry.
"The little turbine engine has the same relationship to large power plants that the PC had to the mainframe," Mr. Rosen said in an interview in his Park Avenue office. "It puts the source of power at the user site."
Not everyone, of course, sees the microturbine as a sure-fire blockbuster, with skeptics saying small-scale generation will never be economical. And even if the turbine is a hit, Capstone's success is not assured, for companies with deeper pockets might seize the market.
With deregulation of electric power beginning in California on Jan. 1, the power industry here has virtually abandoned the idea of continuing to build expensive central power plants that take years to build, require miles of distribution wires and take decades to pay off. Many analysts say future demand will be met by smaller generators that are closer to where the electricity is used.
The small turbine generator, or microturbine, based on the same technology as a jet engine, seems to be a perfect solution. While large turbine generators have been in use for years, the microturbine is quieter, cleaner, relatively maintenance-free and requires no long power lines. It can burn a variety of fuels, including natural gas, diesel, gasoline and methane.
Two dozen companies, mostly utilities, have been testing the Capstone generator, which looks like a small barrel wrapped in a shiny silver space blanket, exposing it to harsh cold in a Canadian gas field and sticky heat in the Florida swamps. Several of the generators, each of which is housed in a refrigerator-size unit, can be joined together to produce higher levels of power. Capstone plans to make its first 300 commercial models by the end of the year, 5,000 more in 1998 and then ramp up production to 25,000 in 1999.
While the generator may be a perfect fit in remote areas like oil rig sites and gas fields, where it can produce electricity from natural gas that is often simply burned off, Capstone and its partners have come up with 300 other applications, from powering supermarkets to making pizza to helping power companies meet peak demand.
In December, Mr. Citterio plans to switch on three test units at one of his family's plants in Freeland, Pa. The hot exhaust will be used to cure hams and sausages. Mr. Citterio, 35, said the cost of the electricity would be the same as the local utility charged, making the heat a bonus worth $7,000 a year for each unit.
Then there is the demand in developing countries, sorely lacking both electricity and capital. "The market is not going to be in North America forever," Mr. Craig said.
To be sure, some people say Capstone may wait a long time before there is a market anywhere for microturbines. "They are cute as hell, like a little puppy," said Dale Simbeck, vice president for technology at SFA Pacific, a consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif. "How much of the promotion becomes reality only time will tell."
Mr. Simbeck says the high fixed costs of many development projects and the relatively low output of the Capstone turbine make its use uneconomical. Other, more efficient generators are becoming cleaner, and he predicted that deregulation in the United States would unleash a glut of electric power capacity that would drive prices down, making it hard for microturbines to find a market.
"There is lots of excess capacity," he said. "Once you deregulate the market, that excess capacity will be able to be moved where needed."
Tony Prophet also expects Capstone to have a tough time but not because there is no future for small turbine generators. Mr. Prophet is president of a division of Allied Signal Inc., which will have its own microturbine by next year.
Mr. Prophet has already made regional distribution deals with the Unicom Corporation, the parent of Commonwealth Edison of Illinois, and Sonat Inc., an oil and natural gas company. Unicom plans to use the Allied Signal turbogenerator to power a McDonald's and a Walgreen.
About a dozen other companies, including the Ingersoll Rand Company and Elliott Energy Systems Inc., are also developing small turbines. Mr. Prophet predicted Capstone would stumble because the market, which he estimated at between $8 billion and $10 billion, would be dominated by a few large, well-capitalized companies like Allied Signal.
Mr. Rosen is not worried, saying the market is so large it can handle a lot of competition. "Nothing is more competitive than the PC business," he explained, using his favorite analogy. He said that Compaq, of which he is chairman, will probably have $24 billion in revenues this year but is planning to be a $50 billion company by 2000. "Even if we had no competition, we probably couldn't grow much faster," he said.
Still, he is aware of the risks. Mr. Rosen first learned about the company five years ago from his brother Harold, a retired rocket scientist who was looking for a way to power an electric car. In November, after spending $24 million of Benjamin Rosen's money, Rosen Motors, which earlier this year successfully tested an automotive power train incorporating the Capstone turbine, ceased operations because it could not persuade a major auto company to invest in further development.
The Rosen brothers thought the power market would allow Capstone to develop its technology and lower its costs before the automotive market took off around 2005. Now, Capstone is not even counting on the automotive market.
"I had no idea that stationary power would grow so fast," Benjamin Rosen said. "That has really become the tail that is wagging the dog."
When Harold Rosen discovered the company that in 1995 would become Capstone, it was called Nomac Energy Systems, after its two founders, James Noe and Robin Mackay, two former employees of Allied Signal. They had the idea of creating a microturbine generator and had received some financing from NASA, the Ford Motor Company and others, but they were struggling.
In 1993, Mr. Rosen arranged for financing from Sevin Rosen Funds and Canaan Partners, another venture capital firm, and strengthened the company's management. But it was not until Mr. Craig signed on the next year as vice president for engineering that many of the technological problems began to be solved.
"The early machines used up more energy going in than came out," said Harold Rosen, who with his brother is on Capstone's board.
The beauty of the Capstone microturbine is that it has only one moving part. Air heated by fuel drives a turbine, a generator and a compressor that spin on a single shaft. Most turbines use oil as lubrication. But the Capstone turbine uses a cushion of air, making the machine virtually maintenance-free.
Such "air bearings" have been around for years, but it was hard to design a stable one for a microturbine because it needs to spin at an extremely high speed -- 96,000 revolutions a minute -- to generate enough power. Mr. Craig spent much of his career designing turbine generators for airplanes and turbochargers for cars and trucks. After much work, he and his team came up with a patented solution. (The Allied Signal microturbine also has a patented air bearing.)
In 1995, after the first prototype was completed, Capstone secured an investment from Fletcher Challenge Ltd., a conglomerate based in New Zealand, which is now Capstone's largest single investor at about 20 percent. Last year, the company raised $50 million in a private placement. Investors included Mr. Allen's Vulcan Northwest and Mr. Gates, who contributed $5 million.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said this "small" investment was made because Mr. Gates believes "it is very interesting technology."
Capstone has now grown to more than 115 employees from just 10 three years ago. It has more than quadrupled the size of its San Fernando Valley headquarters and is building a new factory about 10 miles away that will be ready by the middle of next year.
The new plant will be the first step in increasing production and lowering costs. The first models will sell for about $15,000 each and produce electricity at a cost of 4 1/2 cents to 5 cents a kilowatt-hour, well below the nationwide average of 69/10 cents.
Mr. Craig, who became president and chief executive last year, predicted that the company would be profitable in 1999.
That is important because everyone at Capstone, in addition to its outside public relations agency, has equity. Michael D. Irvine, who has been in the energy and power industry 30 years and is Capstone's vice president for corporate development, said he took a 55 percent pay cut to join the company but bargained for more stock options.
"Very few things like this come along," he said. "It's time to grab for the brass ring."
Benjamin Rosen said Capstone would probably go public within two years. Though he believes the it might ultimately be bigger than Compaq, which is one of the fastest-growing companies, he is reluctant to say it will succeed as quickly.
"We have to show that the Capstone turbine is cost-effective and reliable," he said. "We think it is, but we have to prove it."

HEADLINE: Gore to Join U.S. Team at Global Climate Conference in Japan

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton, concerned that the global climate-change conference now under way in Kyoto, Japan, will adopt more stringent pollution targets than the United States is willing to accept, announced today that he was sending Vice President Al Gore to the meeting to argue the American position forcefully.
The choice of Mr. Gore as the senior United States representative at the conference came after months of intense debate within the Administration and was made public after the 10-day meeting had already begun. Mr. Gore will spend only one day in Kyoto, next Monday, during which he will present the American policy in a speech and meet briefly with members of other delegations before returning to Washington. 
 As recently as last week, Administration officials had said that Mr. Gore would not attend the Kyoto meeting because other Governments would be represented by lower-level officials. But as the momentum for a sweeping declaration from Kyoto for reducing climate-warming emissions as grown in recent days, White House officials decided that Mr. Gore needed to attend to prevent the United States position from being shouted down.
The President said at a White House picture-taking session today that the American policy was "aggressive and achievable," setting realistic targets for reducing gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. He warned delegates from more than 150 nations now meeting in Kyoto against "promising to do something that neither we nor others can do."
Mr. Clinton was alluding to a European position that calls for cuts in production of so-called greenhouse gases far beyond anything that American businesses or the Clinton Administration believe can be achieved in the next 10 to 20 years.
Mr. Gore said he and the President "are perfectly prepared to walk away from an agreement that we don't think will work."
He added, "So it should be crystal clear to all the parties there that we're going to present the U.S. position forcefully and clearly."
Mr. Gore has much at stake in the global-warming debate, having been one of the first American politicians to raise an alarm about the problem. Mr. Gore was a central figure in the Administration debate and only reluctantly accepted the compromise position that is far more modest than the prescriptions he offered while in the Senate and in his book, "Earth in the Balance."
Mr. Gore will not lead the United States delegation to the climate talks, nor will he negotiate with other nations on what commitments the conference will make. Those jobs remain with Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State.
This fall, the Clinton Administration pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. This would be achieved with tax incentives, subsidies for clean energy production and conservation, and by trading pollution permits among industries.
Mr. Gore said that the American proposal would bring a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases in the United States by the year 2010. He called that a "huge change" that can be achieved without significant economic pain.
And he said, "Whether there is an agreement in Kyoto or not, the United States is prepared under President Clinton's leadership to unilaterally take the steps that we believe should be taken in order to deal with this problem."

South Korea Resistance Delays I.M.F. Agreement
The Government of South Korea backtracked and reopened negotiations over a bailout plan for its economy after having announced a day earlier that an agreement had been reached.
The International Monetary Fund has demanded the closure of insolvent banks and other strong steps. By this morning, all three South Korean television networks were reporting that the Government had partly capitulated on some bank closures. But South Korea's stocks and currency fell sharply again. Page A1. 

The United States is prepared to contribute to the bailout of South Korea, but only if the South Korean Government agrees to the economic changes demanded by the International Monetary Fund, President Clinton said. D4.
 
Finance ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed a plan that gives the I.M.F. the leading role in future Asian financial crises. D5.
 
Manufacturing Pace Slows
A closely followed report by American factory purchasing executives showed manufacturing slowed in November, fresh evidence of a cooling economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index has fallen for three of the past four months after reaching a two-and-a-half-year high in July. D2.
 
Treasury prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing Management's report. The bond's yield fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent. D10.
 
F.T.C. Sticks to Its Standards
The Federal Trade Commission decided to preserve a standard a half-century old that requires a product to be "all or virtually all" made in the United States to be labeled as such, a standard often interpreted to mean 98 percent of a product's value. A1.
 
Fight Looms Over Pensions
Retirement advocates warned that a Labor Department plan seriously threatens pension fund accountability. Under the plan, large pension funds would no longer be required to disclose their assets annually. D2.
 
Iraqi Oil Compromise Offered
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has recommended that the Security Council consider increasing the amount of oil Iraq may sell in return for food and medicine, but he stopped short of proposing a specific figure. The Security Council is expected to maintain current Iraqi oil export levels of $2.1 billion every six months with a promise to consider increases in the future. A13.
 
Crude oil prices fell sharply on the action by the Secretary General and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its output ceiling to 27.5 million barrels a day from 25.033 million. On other markets, coffee prices jumped. D19.
 
Global Warming Talks Begin
After more than two years of bargaining, delegates from 150 countries are meeting in Kyoto, Japan, for nine days of talks on what to do about global warming. A10.
 
Workers Are in Short Supply
There is a shortage of workers in the New York metropolitan area, but it is scattered, concentrated in pockets by industry, geography and skill level. A1.
 
Dollar Surges vs. Yen
The dollar surged to its highest level in five and a half years against the yen on speculation that Japan might not do enough to bail out ailing banks and securities firms. The dollar closed at 128.91 yen, up from 127.82 yen on Friday. The dollar rose to 1.7771 marks, from 1.7645 marks. D19.

HEADLINE: Bailout for Korea Is Left Unresolved As Seoul Hesitates

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Dec. 2

 BODY:
An agreement for the economic rescue of South Korea unraveled Monday and negotiations began again, as Seoul resisted taking the severe steps, such as closing insolvent banks, that were advocated by the International Monetary Fund.
By this morning, some Government officials were saying that a new agreement had been reached, and a Cabinet meeting was called to discuss the plan. All three major television networks here were reporting that South Korea had partly capitulated, agreeing to close more than half of the 12 banks that are overwhelmed with bad debts. 
 But at a Cabinet meeting, Lim Chang Yuel, the Minister of Finance and Economy, said that there were still issues to be resolved and he did not even present the plan to the meeting, which adjourned after 10 minutes, according to a spokesman for President Kim Young Sam.
Some agreement is still expected this week. But the disarray suggests how difficult biting the bullet is for a nation that has become the world's 11th-largest economy after experiencing breakneck economic growth for three decades.
While the terms of any bailout have not been announced, press reports here have said that about $55 billion may be made available to South Korea by the I.M.F., by nations like the United States and Japan, and by other international organizations like the World Bank. That would make the rescue the largest ever, surpassing the $48 billion allocated for Mexico in 1995 after its currency crisis.
South Korea's stock market and the value of its currency plummeted further this morning, after both fell sharply on Monday. The declines could indicate concern that the conditions set by the I.M.F. would produce a sharper economic slowdown than had been anticipated.
The Finance Ministry ordered nine ailing banks to suspend business today until the end of the year, and the Korea Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of eight of the banks. The ninth bank's shares are not publicly traded. But it was unclear from the Finance Ministry order whether the business suspensions satisfy I.M.F. demands.
The near-relentless declines in South Korea's stocks and currency since the nation asked for I.M.F. aid on Nov. 21 have come on fears that the conditions set by the lending agency would cause a sharp economic slowdown. But the declines also reflect fears that regardless of how harsh the terms, the measures may not be strong enough to truly overhaul a financial system hobbled by bad debts from reckless bank lending.
By late morning in Seoul, the stock exchange's composite index had plunged 18.90 points, or 4.81 percent, to 374.26, after a 3.6 percent decline on Monday, The drop on Monday took the index below the 400 level for the first time in more than 10 years. The currency, the won, was trading at 1,267 to the dollar, a record low and down more than 6 percent from the record low that was set on Monday.
Korean press reports said the big obstacle in the negotiations was the I.M.F.'s request that South Korea liquidate troubled merchant and commercial banks.
Seoul, worried about increasing unemployment and a possible run on banks, has favored allowing these institutions to be revamped or merged with healthier companies. About 12 of the nation's 30 merchant banks and 3 or so commercial banks are considered candidates for closing. Merchant banks, which are smaller than commercial banks, primarily lend to small businesses.
The two sides were also said to disagree over the target for economic growth next year, though the final figure is likely to be about half of this year's expected growth rate of 6 percent. A smaller growth target would mean higher taxes and less Government spending, costing South Koreans jobs and income.
Mr. Lim, the Finance Minister, had said early Monday that an agreement had been reached. But he never came to a news conference scheduled to disclose details, heading back for more I.M.F. negotiations instead.
I.M.F. officials had said throughout Monday that there was no agreement.
The I.M.F. bailout is intended to reassure international financial markets that Seoul will be able to pay its foreign debts.
"In the short term, it will help gain back international confidence in the Korean economy," said Sakong Il, a former finance minister who is now chairman of the Institute for Global Economics, a research organization. "It will stabilize the foreign exchange market."
Regardless of the terms of an I.M.F. rescue, South Koreans have been bracing for austerity since the Government first agreed to accept aid. "We are all prepared for quite serious recession now," said Park Ungsuh, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, part of the nation's largest industrial conglomerate. He said the unemployment rate might double to about 5 percent.
Dr. Park said that the bailout's effects could indirectly hurt even creditworthy companies if banks refused to lendmoney out of fear for their own survival.
Richard Samuelson, director of research for SBC Warburg Dillon Read in Seoul, predicted that the stock market index would eventually drop to 300 and that the won would sink to the point that it would trade at 1,400 to the dollar.
One bright spot for South Korea is that exports are growing, propelled by the weakening of the won, which makes Korean products more competitive overseas.
The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy reported Monday that South Korea had a trade surplus in November of $211 million, only the second monthly surplus in nearly three years and a sharp contrast to the $1.96 billion deficit in November of last year. But the shift came not only from increased exports but also from a steep drop in imports because of the economic woes.
South Korea's deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, is expected to fall to about $13 billion this year from $23.7 billion last year.
That is good news for South Korea because the huge deficit is one reason it is troubled by foreign debt. However, the rise in exports has raised fears in the United States that South Korea and the other ailing Asian nations will try to export their way out of their economic problems, undercutting American producers.

HEADLINE: Tight but Quirky Job Market As the New York Area Revives

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
A phenomenon absent from the New York regional economy for nearly a decade, and almost unthinkable through the grim recession years of the early 1990's, has suddenly re-emerged here: a shortage of workers.
From low-wage day laborers in Bridgeport, Conn., to computer programmers on Long Island and in New Jersey, to retail clerks and paralegals here in Stamford, the industries and areas affected are diverse. The shortage is especially acute in the suburbs, particularly here in Fairfield County, where unemployment has fallen to 2.7 percent in and around Stamford and Danbury. 
 At the Stamford Town Center mall, wages have jumped sharply, with clerks now making about $7.50 an hour, or 13 percent more than last year, and the "Now Hiring" sign at Filene's is almost as big as the store's name on the mall entrance. Shaw's Supermarkets has begun a shuttle service, taking new workers from inner-city Bridgeport and New Haven to its stores in the suburbs. Other employers here have begun recruiting in places as far away as South Africa, Poland and Russia.
In many corners of the nation, like Raleigh, N.C., and Des Moines, where unemployment has been low for years, stories like this perhaps no longer qualify as news. But that is not the case in the New York region. Not since the late 1980's, when the last boom economy reached its peak, has the region even remotely glimpsed "full employment" -- which economists generally say occurs when most people who want a job can find one.
But in many important ways this job market is not at all like that of the 1980's boom, or like any of the other job booms that are occurring elsewhere in the country. In the New York region, the labor shortages are spotty and scattered, concentrated in pockets by industry and geography and skill level. Corporate downsizing -- though on a smaller and more subdued scale than a few years ago -- is also continuing as companies shed management jobs. That is creating an environment of winners and losers, and of anxiety amid prosperity. The large numbers of residents of the region leaving welfare for work has also created labor ripples. Fast food outlets, for example, report few shortages in the region, and thus little pressure to raise wages.
And New York City still has one of the highest big-city unemployment rates in the nation, at 9.1 percent -- though that has come down over the last four months from a 10 percent peak in early summer.
Though companies have created tens of thousands of new jobs in fields like financial services, technology and consulting, the numbers of people seeking those jobs has grown even faster, and many unemployed city residents do not have the right skills, employers say. That has kept New York's unemployment rate high, while further driving down the jobless rate in places like Stamford, as many of the new jobs have gone to commuters.
Economists say that the contrast of joblessness amid a hiring frenzy -- as well as the lingering effects of the deep recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's -- have made workers in the New York region more tentative in their wage demands than workers elsewhere in the nation.
"Places like Des Moines, Minneapolis and Dallas have been experiencing tightness for some time -- labor is emboldened there," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm. "In Stamford, the tightening is much more recent -- and very recent in cutting across a wide range of industries."
Christopher L. Bergstrom, the director of economic development for the City of Stamford, described the current economy as a "boom with angst."
"Even though it's a tight labor market, people don't necessarily feel all that secure," he said. "People know they can still lose their jobs, even though there aren't enough workers to go around."
Nonetheless, amid the anxiety there are increasing numbers of workers with good jobs, for whom the closing months of 1997 are like the reprise of a song that some thought might never be played in this region again.
"A lot of the things my husband and I have now -- a few years ago I wouldn't have thought were attainable," said Laura Kuck, a 26-year-old paralegal in Stamford who is benefiting from the competition among employers. Mrs. Kuck, who lives about 40 miles north of here in New Fairfield, has changed jobs several times in the last two years, and has seen her income climb by more than $10,000 as a result. Her husband, Eric, a warehouse manager, was recently lured to Stamford by a job offer as well.
The lumpiness of the region's job story can be found within towns and even within companies. Mrs. Kuck's boss, Mark P. Santagata, a partner at the law firm of Cacace Tusch Santagata, said that he and his partners had been searching for a receptionist for six months, and that they had just hired an office manager after an exhaustive search.
But if they wanted to hire another lawyer, they could have their pick. "If I put an ad in the paper looking for an attorney, I'd have 50 resumes on my desk in a day," Mr. Santagata said.
Similarly, some companies that have been having poor luck hiring new college graduates have been reaching out specifically for older workers, checking in at places like Senior Employment Services, a nonprofit agency that works primarily with people age 50 and over.
But Karen Cornwell, the agency's director, said the calls from the newly jobless had not stopped, either. On one recent morning, for instance, a senior executive from Champion International stopped by. Champion, a paper products company with its headquarters here, said in October that it would eliminate about 30 percent of its jobs, and the executive, a woman in her early 40's who had worked for the company since college, was on the layoff list. She was scared and did not want to be identified. "But I told her her prospects were good," Ms. Cornwell said.
Around the region, employers and economists say that job markets have tightened in a kind of rolling wave that has affected some places earlier and more profoundly than others.
"It's been a challenge in New Jersey for the last year; Connecticut started to get tight about nine months ago, and the last six months on Long Island," said Gordon J. Bingham, a senior vice president for marketing with Olsten Staffing Services, the Long Island-based temporary-help agency. "It's difficult to fill the high end and the low," Mr. Bingham added. "The middle is still easier."
Technology is the common thread of most of the jobs that are in high demand. Entry level clerical workers making $18,000 to $35,000 a year who can operate computers have seen their wages jump by about 15 percent this year, said Catherine C. Candland, president of Advantage Staffing Services, an employment agency in Stamford. For highly skilled programmers, Ms. Candland said, there are "no limits" on pay, with many salaries reaching $300,000 a year or more.
Ms. Candland said that some people who lost jobs in the recession as middle managers have returned with technology training and are earning even more than before. Many more, she said, have had a hard time adapting.
Still, the demand for technology skills seems only to increase. At SPC Warburg Dillon Read, a division of the Swiss Bank Corporation that is moving its headquarters to Stamford from Manhattan over the next year, more than half of the 450 to 475 new jobs are in those two hard-to-fill high- and low-end technical categories. The firm has pitched the area's quality of life and amenities like day care as part of its hiring package.
New state and Federal welfare laws aimed at getting welfare recipients into jobs are also having an effect on the labor market. Jonathan A. Mathias, owner of the Corporate Deli and Grille in downtown Bridgeport, said that a year ago he could walk over to the bus depot, a block away, and find five or six people available for a day's work, cleaning up a storage room or basement. Most were welfare recipients, and most have disappeared from the streets, apparently into full-time jobs, Mr. Mathias said.
On one recent morning he stood in his kitchen, hands and arms covered halfway to the elbow with gritty, aromatic brown cooking grease, struggling to fix an old electric grill with a burned-out thermostat.
"A year ago, I would have been supervising," Mr. Mathias said.
The fast-food industry, on the other hand, perhaps because of the influx of former welfare recipients looking for full-time jobs, has reported few shortages -- a stark contrast especially to the late 1980's, when places like McDonald's had to bus workers from the Bronx to staff its restaurants on the Connecticut Turnpike.
Looming behind all the falling unemployment numbers in the region, of course, is the economic force of New York City. Unemployment rates are low in places like Stamford partly because local companies are hiring, but also because New York City companies are hiring as well -- a fact that is obscured by New York's high unemployment rate. New York City jobs that go to suburban commuters and local jobs created in the suburbs have exactly the same effect in pulling down jobless rates in Connecticut, which sends about 33,000 commuters a day to Manhattan for work.
And the city has entered the late fall on a very strong note. In the first 10 months of 1997, New York companies created 53,000 new jobs, more than in any comparable period since 1984. About 43,000 more New Yorkers are working now than just four months ago, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
Some experts fear that a combined and heightened demand -- city and suburbs, big firms and small ones all competing for the same group of workers -- could choke off the region's economy before it really gathers steam.
"Now we've got the jobs, and the question is, can we get the workers?" said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
Companies like Silicon Valley Internet Partners, an 18-month-old Boston-based company that opened its first Manhattan office in September 1996, show the New York City side of the job equation: The firm has grown tenfold in just 14 months, to 60 employees from 6. The target for the foreseeable future is 100 percent growth per year, said Aron Dutta, a vice president and general manager of the New York office. So far, Mr. Dutta said, hiring has not been a problem -- about 30 percent of the staff was stolen away from Wall Street giants like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.
The world at large represents yet another recruiting possibility. Olsten now recruits and brings into the United States 25 to 40 technically trained foreign nationals every six weeks to fill the demand for computer programmers and software engineers. Many of them, the company says, choose to work in the New York region because the ethnic diversity means they are more likely to find a community or neighborhood of fellow immigrants.
The City of Stamford is also exploring a public-private program to begin recruiting foreign technical workers, under a public-private partnership with local employers. Poland is the first target because of the large local Polish population. The University of Connecticut has also set up a campus here specifically aimed at training technical workers, and Mr. Bergstrom at the city's Economic Development Department dreams of a whole educational overhaul that would offer children from preschool on up a technology-rich experience that he says would prepare them for the future he sees unfolding.
But how hiring and employment will work by the time the future arrives for those children is anybody's guess.
Ebeth Pretorius, a computer software worker from South Africa, took a job in New York in 1992, working for the technical subsidiary of Olsten, just as companies were downsizing. She saw the corridor outside her office in Rockland County empty of workers. Now it is full again, but everything is different. Because of the hiring squeeze, she said, all the technical workers in her office are now, like her, contract workers.

The F.B.I. Director, Louis J. Freeh, gave a long memorandum to Attorney General Janet Reno last week in a last-ditch appeal to persuade her to seek an independent prosecutor to investigate campaign finance abuses, law-enforcement officials said. Those who have seen Mr. Freeh's memo say it argued his contention that the conflicts of interest for the Justice Department are so great that Ms. Reno's department cannot credibly investigate the campaign finance issue. Ms. Reno is expected to reject Mr. Freeh's advice today. A1
 
Cloning Gains Acceptance
In the nine months since Dolly the lamb was cloned from a cell taken from an adult sheep, there has been an enormous change in attitudes about cloning people.

HEADLINE: Disney Concert Hall Gets a Pledge

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Over the past decade, the ambitious dream by Walt Disney's family for a grandiose Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles has turned bleak. Intended to reinvigorate downtown neighborhoods and even transform the entire city, the project stalled and almost collapsed under the weight of financial problems, red tape, bureaucratic bungling and artistic disagreements.
But today, the dream of Disney's widow and family seemed on the verge of reality. 
 Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of The Walt Disney Company, announced that the company planned to donate $25 million for the concert hall, a major step toward full financing of the project.
The concert hall, with a grandiose design by Frank O. Gehry, the renowned architect from Santa Monica, Calif., has been a high priority for the administration of Mayor Richard J. Riordan and business leaders who have sought for years to revitalize downtown Los Angeles, which turns into a dark and eerie enclave at night. Despite several first-rate hotels, restaurants, museums and the Los Angeles Music Center, downtown is rarely visited by residents of outlying neighborhoods, like the monied sections of Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Brentwood, less than 30 minutes away.
The Riordan administration has seen the Disney Concert Hall as a way to turn downtown into an anchor for this sprawling city of 3.5 million people -- in a county of 9.1 million.
The leaders hope the concert hall will also accelerate other major projects, including a planned $300 million sports arena and entertainment center, and a new Roman Catholic cathedral by the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo.
Standing at the Los Angeles County Music Center, across the street from the parking lot where the Disney hall is to be built, Mr. Eisner said, "We think the Disney Concert Hall is an extremely worthwhile project and one that will benefit the citizens of Los Angeles for many years to come."
Mr. Eisner has been criticized in recent years for not pledging money to help build the center in honor of his company's founder. Asked why the contribution was being made now, he said: "I think the Disney hall needed this final push. It was always known that there would be an appropriate time to get in."
The Disney donation is a "challenge gift" that depends on other corporate sponsors donating $25 million more toward construction.
"I am confident funds will be raised to match the Disney company gift and that the building will get under way in 1998," said Andrea L. Van de Kamp, chairwoman of the Los Angeles Music Center and a member of the Disney Hall Oversight Committee.
The 2,350-seat concert hall is scheduled to open in 2001, serving as the home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which now performs across the street at the crowded Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
The concert hall project was begun a decade ago with a $50 million gift from Walt Disney's widow, Lillian B. Disney. Over all, the Disney family has contributed nearly $100 million.
But almost from the outset, the project has been mired in red tape, mismanagement and controversy over its free-flowing design by Mr. Gehry. It has been compared to the hull of a futuristic ship -- "a Matterhorn for music where thousands can gather to take the ride," Herbert Muschamp, the architecture critic for The New York Times, wrote in 1992.
The project was halted in 1995, after escalating costs raised the price to $265 million, from the original estimate of $110 million, though the estimate was later lowered to $220 million. Mr. Gehry's design was attacked as too complicated and costly -- and when an effort was made to restrict his participation in the design of the hall, Mr. Gehry threatened to remove his name from the project.
In recent months, the usually reticent Diane Disney Miller, a daughter of Walt Disney who lives in Napa Valley, has interceded and, by all accounts, played an important role in forging a consensus that has brought Mr. Gehry back into the fold. The project is now being managed by a coalition of nine members who represent a cross-section of opinions about the concert hall. Solidifying Mr. Gehry's position on the project was his new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, which has received critical acclaim and was brought in on budget.
"I am pleased that everything is resolved and that we are moving ahead in a positive way to get the project completed," Ms. Miller said.
Adding to the momentum for the Disney hall was the appointment last June of Eli Broad, chief executive of SunAmerica, the financial services corporation, and a leading figure in the city, as chairman of the concert hall's oversight committee, which has the responsibility for fund-raising and completion of construction of the hall.
Mr. Broad said that the Disney company's $25 million gift -- plus an additional pledge today of $5 million by Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of the Disney company and a nephew of Walt Disney -- brings the total committed to the project to about $160.4 million, or 73 percent of what is needed to complete the hall.
"Our goal is in sight," Mr. Broad said.
Under the terms of Roy Disney's gift, there will be a performing arts center at the concert hall for students of the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, which is 25 miles north of Los Angeles.
Mr. Riordan said in a statement, "This concert hall will be a beacon for our city; a symbol of the beauty, culture and excitement that is Los Angeles as we usher in the 21st century."

Going Home, American Shoots Film In Vietnam

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
Making the first American movie ever filmed entirely in Vietnam hasn't been a bed of lotus blossoms, say its producers and its young director, Tony Bui, 25.
All of them hope Mr. Bui's "Three Seasons" will create as much excitement when it is released in the spring as "The Quiet American" did nearly 40 years ago. 
 The Vietnamese-American auteur was 2 years old when his parents, with high-level connections to the defeated Government of South Vietnam, fled with the family to the United States. He says he hated every minute of his first visit here five years ago.
But his heart kept pulling him back to the city that used to be known as Saigon, and now he's here shooting his first full-length movie despite obstacles as disparate as a typhoon, Government censors and the constant roar of the motorbikes that are taking over the city two decades after the Communists did.
The film's major supporters include Harvey Keitel, who plays an American veteran in search of the child, now a young woman, he fathered here. But this is not another war movie about American hang-ups on Vietnam.
"From my first visit here in 1992, I knew that what I had to do was to tell the stories about this place that are the least told: the stories of the Vietnamese, from a Vietnamese point of view, and in Vietnamese," Mr. Bui said after shooting a pedicab race scene in the hot sun just after the dry season started.
"Three Seasons" aims to be a sentimental and sensitive exploration of the profound social and cultural changes that have swept the country of his birth since the Communists reunified it by force in 1975.
All the actors but Mr. Keitel are Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans, and shooting is being done with a Vietnamese company, state-owned Hang Phim Giai Phong, or Liberation Film Studios. And Government censors are keeping a watchful eye on both script and shooting.
"It's a film with only one known star, but I hope people in France, Germany or Idaho will all recognize the struggles, the hopes and the dreams of the people in this poor third-world country as very similar to their own," said Mr. Bui, who grew up in Sunnyvale and San Jose in California and studied filmmaking at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, graduating in 1995.
The producers are only 34: Jason Kliot, a New Yorker who graduated from the Dalton School and Amherst College, and Joana Vicente, his wife and partner in Open City Films Inc. of New York City.
They all came here to start making the film in September and expect to finish it at the end of December for only $1.5 million, a 10th of what they estimate it would cost to do the shooting in the United States. The film is scheduled for release by October Films, which introduced "Breaking the Waves" and "Secrets and Lies" in the United States and was acquired by Universal Studios last year.
Mr. Bui, an athletic-looking young man with long black hair pulled back in a ponytail, chuckled at the idea of a major studio backing a micro-budget film that will be released in the United States with subtitles, but insisted that the Vietnamese soundtrack was part of the point of view he wanted.
So is this city, a place where giant high-rise hotels, residences for rich expatriates and retail shops with expensive Western goods rise starkly out of seething slums, in a country still run by Communists despite its capitalistic economic policy.
Mr. Keitel, who speaks in English, completed a week of shooting here in mid-November.
The three seasons of the title are the interwoven stories of a pedicab driver and a passenger he eventually rescues from prostitution; Mr. Keitel and a street urchin he meets before he finally finds his daughter, and an elderly Vietnamese housekeeper who loses her job in the city and goes to the countryside to help a Buddhist monk who is dying of leprosy.
The script, written by Mr. Bui and his brother, Timothy Linh Bui, is both sweetly Vietnamese and appealingly American. "Tony believes very strongly in people helping each other in difficult situations," Mr. Kliot, the producer, said.
The crew of 25 Americans and 60 Vietnamese got plenty of practice doing that as soon as shooting began, when Typhoon Linda made a mucky mess of one of one of their outdoor locations, near a bridge over the Saigon River.
The street urchin in the story was plucked from the ranks of the real "dust of life" orphans who still swirl around the knees of foreign tourists and try to sell trinkets, newspapers and cigarettes to eke out a living. The boy, who wears a Woody Woodpecker T-shirt, is called Woody in the script.
Most of the pedicab drivers in the film are not actors but wiry men who really do peddle cyclos, but not Hai, the Vietnamese hero of the film. He is played by Don Duong, an actor with a deep, resonant voice who is well known in Vietnam and is Mr. Bui's uncle.
Through an interpreter on location, Mr. Duong said, "I love this film because it talks about hard-working people who are struggling to make a better life for themselves, and I'm happy to be playing in it."
Playing is not the word for what he was doing in a climactic scene, the cyclo race. The shooting created monumental jams of knotted motorcycles, cyclos and cars in the outlying Thu Duc district as the police held up traffic for the filming. Later, Mr. Duong and his competitors pedaled again and again up and down a red-dirt back street to capture the moment when the two leaders in the race collide and his character, an underdog, pulls ahead to win.
He then uses his $200 prize to hire his streetwalker passenger for a night, not for her services but just to let her sleep in a luxury hotel, wake up alone and enjoy the breakfast in bed she had told him she dreamt of as an escape.
She is played by Zoe Bui, who is not related to the director but, like him, was taken to the United States by her family as a child.
Mr. Duong, who said he was paid $1,500, made only one critical observation. "We get less money than the American stars," he said.
Most of Mr. Keitel's scenes are in the rainy season with the urchin, and in a spontaneous gesture after he finished shooting here, he made a $25,000 donation to the Ho Chi Minh City Child Welfare Foundation.
The Americans say that the two ever-present Vietnamese Government censors on the set, who are both with a mysterious state organization known to the producers only as A-25, are often suspicious about hidden deeper meanings in the script.
The censors, whose approval is required for the film to be shot here and will be needed for its release in Vietnam, are extraordinarily sensitive, the Americans say, to the way prostitution, supposedly a relic of Vietnam's decadent past, is portrayed. They also fretted about whether the ailing monk in the story, who lives near a pagoda that rises out of the center of a small pond and writes poetry, could somehow be a sneaky allusion to President Ho Chi Minh, who lived in a similar place in Hanoi until he died in 1969.
But both director and producers take a philosophical view about official interference, which has seldom been heavy-handed.
"The way I look at it, we're in a Communist country and we have to obey the rules," Mr. Kliot said. "Some of the things we have to worry about in the United States are just as annoying: the constant legal censorship, for instance," he added, explaining that the script originally called the street boy Mickey Mouse.
"We can't use that because of copyright problems," Mr. Kliot said. "We can't put him in a Superman cape in one scene because Warner Brothers owns the Superman rights and said no. Woody Woodpecker is Universal, so that's okay. But Tony has to alter his vision slightly because of legal constraints."
Mr. Bui, whose short film "Yellow Lotus" was critically acclaimed this year, is aware that Dang Nhat Minh, a fellow overseas Vietnamese director, was forbidden to visit Vietnam for three years because of official displeasure over his movie "Cyclo."
But he says he thinks "Three Seasons" will keep official cooperation because of its honest portrayal of Vietnamese society. "If you have the patience to work with the censors, you can talk with them," he said. "I want to show the country in a positive light, but the only way to do that is by being realistic."

HEADLINE: Tristan E. Beplat, 85, Banker Who Aided Japan After War

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Tristan E. Beplat, an international banking executive who played an important role in the economic reconstruction of postwar Japan, died on Friday at the Columbia Medical Center in Ormond Beach, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Princeton, N.J., and Daytona Beach, Fla.
He died of complications after a fall, his nephew, Raymond E. Beplat, said. 
 A Manhattan native, Mr. Beplat began his banking career in 1937, joining what was then the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
It was during World War II that his involvement with Japan and Asia began. As a first lieutenant in 1944, he was selected to participate on a team to help rebuild the economy of postwar Japan. The team was led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
Because of his experience with foreign currency trading, Mr. Benplat was named chief of the foreign exchange operation in the early phase of the United States occupation of Japan after its surrender in 1945.
Mustered out of the Army a year later, Mr. Beplat remained in Japan as a civilian but continued to serve the military in Tokyo as the chief of its money and banking branch and as chairman of the foreign exchange committee.
It was in this capacity that Mr. Baplat helped to forge a policy that set the value of the yen at 360 to the dollar, a sharp devaluation from its prewar value of 2.50 to the dollar.
"We wanted the Japanese to be able to export," Mr. Beplat said in a 1986 interview with Forbes magazine. "We wanted them on our side politically, and figured that 90 percent of Japanese exports could sell at a 300 exchange rate, even though some were profitable at 200. But we didn't want to be wrong on such an important matter."
The program worked so well that Japanese exports rose from $1 billion in 1950 to $24 billion by 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon ended the postwar system of fixed exchange rates.
After being appointed a consultant to the State Department in October 1948, Mr. Beplat opened a representative office in Japan for Manufacturers Hanover, the first such postwar office for an American bank.
He remained in that capacity in Tokyo until he returned to the United States in 1954. The next year, he took charge of the bank's banking relations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In 1963 he was named senior vice president. At retirement in 1974, he was senior vice president and deputy general manager of the international division. Manufacturers Hanover later merged with Chemical Banking, which subsequently merged with Chase Manhattan.
Shortly after he left the bank, Mr. Beplat was decorated by the Japanese Government, receiving the Second Order of the Sacred Treasure for his services during the occupation.
From his home in Princeton, N.J., Mr. Beplat used his Asian acquaintances and expertise to consult on international finance and investment after he left Manufacturers Hanover. One of those acquaintances was Ferdinand E. Marcos, the leader of the Philippine Government.
In the mid-1980's, Mr. Beplat's name came up during an investigation by New Jersey officials seeking to untangle the financial web spun in that state by Mr. Marcos.
Mr. Beplat told investigators that Mr. Marcos had asked him to acquire homes in New Jersey for use by the Marcos children while they attended Princeton University. In a deposition, Mr. Beplat said he had been wired almost $500,000 from the Philippine Mission in the final days of the Marcos regime.
Mr. Beplat, who received the Philippine Government's highest civilian award from President Marcos in 1971 for his efforts at financing Philippine infrastructure projects, later served as a consultant to the Philippine Government of President Corazon Aquino.
Mr. Beplat was active in a number of societies promoting business and understanding between Asia and the United States, including the Japan Society, the Ceylon Association and the American-Indonesian Chamber of Commerce.
He is survived by three brothers, James of Cummington, Mass., Raymond of East Northport, N.Y., and Howard of South Jamesport, N.Y., and two sisters, Grace B. King of Slingerlands, N.Y., and Muriel B. Collier of Weems, Va. His wife of 49 years, the former Margaret Mosher, died in 1990.

HEADLINE: Victim Fund Gets Pledges From U.S. And Britain

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
More than 50 years after Hitler's armies plundered Europe of its gold, the United States and Britain today announced modest contributions to a new fund to benefit Holocaust survivors, but many other countries withheld immediate donations.
The fund is supposed to be based on money raised from 5.5 tons of Nazi gold held in the United States and British central banks since World War II. Britain and the United States want the 10 European nations with claims on the gold -- which historians say may include gold stolen from Holocaust victims -- to forego their demands and instead contribute some or all of their share. 
 But, according to Stuart E. Eizenstat, the leader of the American delegation at a 41-nation conference here on Nazi gold, only Argentina and Luxembourg agreed today to make immediate contributions. Other conference participants said that France and the Netherlands -- which both have claims to large parts of the gold, worth some $58 million -- held off from an immediate commitment.
Britain said it would contribute $1.65 million to the fund -- to be held at the United States Federal Reserve -- and the United States said it would make an initial payment of $4 million, rising to $25 million over three years if Congress approved.
The fund, which was to be the centerpiece of this week's gathering, was depicted as a step toward helping some of the estimated 350,000 aging Jews in Eastern and Central Europe who survived the Holocaust only to be deprived of restitution by Communist governments. "I think that the symbolism of the fund is more important than the fund itself," said Elan Steinberg, Executive Director of the World Jewish Congress.
The remaining gold is the last of a stockpile of over 330 tons of gold that the United States, Britain and France seized from Nazi Germany and distributed among European central banks after 1946 in restitution for Nazi looting. The three countries -- grouped in what is called the Tripartite Gold Commission -- always insisted that the bullion did not include gold stolen from individuals, businesses and Holocaust victims.
But at the conference here, Swiss historians and American Jewish groups have put the proportion of this privately owned gold at between 16 and 30 percent of all the gold accumulated by the Third Reich.
The announcement of the fund coincided with what appeared to be a shift by the World Jewish Congress in its campaign for faster restitution efforts from Switzerland -- the recipient of most of the gold shipped out of Nazi Germany.
For two years the World Jewish Congress has pressed Switzerland to atone materially and morally for its wartime relationship with the Nazis and for what it says is Switzerland's postwar indifference to the plight of Holocaust survivors seeking access to deposits in Swiss banks made by relatives who died in death camps.
In response, Switzerland has set up its own $190 million relief fund for Holocaust survivors, promised that a new $4.7 billion foundation could also benefit death-camp survivors and instituted a range of historical and banking inquiries.
Despite those moves, several state and municipal authorities in the United States have imposed economic sanctions on Swiss banks. The New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, has called a meeting of public finance officers for next Monday in New York to consider what to do about dealings with Swiss banks.
But today, in an unusual move, Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, let it be known that he would urge the gathering in New York to impose a moratorium on sanctions -- possibly for three months, American Jewish officials said -- while Swiss efforts to overcome the past were monitored.
Mr. Bronfman told associates that the moratorium would give the Swiss authorities time to consider whether they wanted to negotiate a global settlement of their many disputes with American Jews. At present, Swiss private banks face three class-action suits in New York courts demanding payments totaling $20 billion in compensation for their wartime and postwar behavior.
According to American Jewish officials, Mr. Bronfman has told associates over the past two days that a "global settlement" or "closure" with Switzerland would cost the Swiss "a lot of money." In an interview, Mr. Bronfman declined to specify the kind of settlement he foresaw but insisted that a reference he made at the conference today to a sum of up to $1.6 billion had "nothing to do with our claims."
The Congress's shift seemed to catch Swiss officials off guard. Thomas Borer, the head of the Swiss delegation, said he was "perplexed how you can tell the Swiss that we should pay billions in a final settlement and all will be solved and all the class action suits will be settled."

HEADLINE: Chrysler Reports 4.4% Rise In Auto Sales for November

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation today turned in better-than-expected sales results for November, an increase of 4.4 percent compared with results from the month a year earlier.
"The numbers are stronger than they were hinting at," said David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. "It is the best year-to-year comparison they've had in several months because of the sales of the new Durango and some strong fleet sales." Chrysler has been slowly increasing the production of its new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle for the last two months. 
 "Durango was the difference between this year and last year," said Steven A. Torok, Chrysler's executive director for sales and marketing operations. Chrysler sold 6,522 Durangos last month.
The Toyota Motor Corporation said its sales fell 10.1 percent last month compared with sales from a year ago, mostly because it cannot build its most popular cars and trucks fast enough to meet demand. "Industry sales continue to mirror the economy's growth, boosted in particular by sustained consumer confidence," said Yale Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. "In this environment, our problem has been a shortage of product, especially core products such as the Camry and 4Runner."
The Honda Motor Company said its sales rose 3.7 percent in November, allowing it to reach record sales for 1997 excluding December sales. Honda's redesigned 1998 Accord sedan, along with its small sport utility vehicle, the CR-V, and strong Civic and Acura CL sales propelled the company to the new record. "The response to the new Accords has been phenomenal," said Dick Colliver, executive vice president of the American Honda Motor Company.
For the 12 auto makers reporting results today, combined sales rose 1.4 percent in November compared with figures from a year earlier. All percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 24 selling days last month but 25 in November 1996.
"The month as a whole looks flat versus last year," said Nicholas J. Colas, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Still, he said, the Big Three's auto dealers in particular had hoped to spur sales in November because they have been worried that the growing weakness of the yen will soon allow their Japanese competitors to lure buyers with more attractive rebates and subsidized lease offerings.
"They wanted November to be a very good month, and they were cutting aggressive deals because they expect the Japanese to put on new incentives," Mr. Colas said.
Other auto makers are due to report their sales on Wednesday. The General Motors Corporation is expected to report a sales increase of as much as 14 percent, mainly because it increased rebates in November and because a strike weakened results in November 1996. The Ford Motor Company is expected to report flat sales.
Foreign auto makers reported mixed results today. Nissan said its sales fell 1.9 percent last month compared with those from November 1996; Mitsubishi fell 8.3 percent; Isuzu 12.8 percent, and Land Rover, a unit of BMW A.G., 21.4 percent.
Others posted stronger showings. Subaru said its sales rose 21.4 percent, helped by sales of its popular new Forester sport utility vehicle; Volvo sales rose 8.3 percent; Hyundai 4 percent; Kia 74.5 percent, and Porsche 87.8 percent.
Chrysler's car sales fell 5 percent, while sales of its sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks rose 8.2 percent in November.
Chrysler's sales have been crimped for the last couple of months by a slow production start for its new Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde sedans, analysts said. The problems have prompted several analysts to lower their earnings forecasts in recent weeks, and the consensus among analysts now is that Chrysler will earn $1.15 a share in the fourth quarter, down from $1.51 in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises, but Nasdaq and S.& P. Indexes Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday, after computing companies warned of disappointing profits.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.72 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to 8,018.83. But the Nasdaq composite index, packed with computer shares, dropped 24.35, or 1.5 percent, to 1,606.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index dropped 3.10, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 971.68. 
 Shares of the disk-drive maker Western Digital and the networking equipment manufacturer Cabletron Systems fell after both said fourth-quarter profits would be below forecasts. Altera fell more than 20 percent after it said sales of its specialty semiconductors were slowing.
"The disappointments are much more severe than people expected," said Phil Schettewi, who oversees $4.1 billion as managing director at Loomis, Sayles in Washington.
More such disappointments await investors today. After the stock market closed yesterday, 3Com said it would report quarterly results far below estimates. It also said that it would sharply reduce the inventory of unsold networking products.
In after-hours trading, 3Com shares fell 13.3 percent, to $30.625. A networking rival, Cisco Systems, fell to 85 1/2, from a close of 86 1/2.
Some investors speculated that the warnings signaled slower growth for a range of computer-related companies, as the economic crisis in Asia takes its toll on companies that sell products around the globe.
"The industry is so diverse now," said Mike Driscoll, senior block trader at Hambrecht & Quist in New York. "Still, there's more to follow out of Asia. There's more to come."
Western Digital fell 1 3/4, to 19 3/8, after the company said it would break even in its fiscal second quarter, before a charge three times the amount previously announced. Analysts expected earnings of 25 cents a share. Western Digital blamed price cuts by competitors.
Cabletron Systems Inc. dropped 7 1/2, to 15 11/16, after the maker of computer networking equipment said it expects to report a third-quarter profit of 8 cents to 12 cents a share, below analyst forecasts of 40 cents a share.
Among other issues, Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink company, rose 1 5/16, to 65 7/8, after Douglas Lane, a Merrill Lynch analyst, raised his rating to near-term "accumulate" from near-term "neutral."
"With superior unit growth and strong financials, we view Coca-Cola as a core stock," Mr. Lane wrote.
The mixed performance in stocks came on another quiet day in the bond market. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond edged up 3/32, to 101 10/32. The bond's yield's, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 6.03 percent, from 6.04 percent on Monday.
Bond investors were awaiting Friday's employment report for November and a speech last night by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"The market's looking for something to keep it rallying," said Livingston Douglas, chief investment officer at the Kiewit Investment Management Corporation in Omaha.

HEADLINE: Clinton Gives Hope to Blighted City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Through years of turmoil in its municipal government, which has driven thousands people out of the District of Columbia and annoyed many who stayed, Washington rarely found something to cheer.
Today was different. 
 After five years of virtual isolation from his neighbors, President Clinton met with more than two dozen local leaders, listening to their ideas and offering suggestions for the future. Hours later, he joined 20,000 basketball fans for opening night in a new downtown sports arena, the MCI Center, a nearly $200 million project that is hoped to reawaken the city's moribund commercial district southeast of the White House.
Neither event guaranteed any quick or easy fix to the spectrum of problems plaguing the nation's capital, everything from potholes and poor delivery of services to crumbling school buildings and inadequately trained city workers.
But taken together, they offered the hope that just maybe the worst of the city's ills have passed and that the often-repeated promise of Federal lawmakers, Administration officials and local leaders to turn Washington into a "jewel of a capital" is conceivable after all.
"We hit a few home runs today," Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., said after city officials spent 75 minutes delivering their Christmas list of wants and needs to the President, who had never entertained so large a contingent of officials from the capital. "Now I'm going to the basketball game, and President Clinton is, too."
Before today, smaller groups of District leaders had tramped in and out of the West Wing of the White House with various agendas, and generally emerged with little more than the satisfaction of meeting the President. The result was routinely the same: the District got its annual appropriation, free of the urban policy experiments like public school vouchers, that Republicans often tried attaching to it since winning control of Congress in 1994.
This year, Mr. Clinton also approved a rescue package that turns over to the Federal Government several city functions, like running courts and prisons and paying pension benefits to city employees and most Medicaid benefits. The shift will save the city billions of dollars over the next five years.
But through it all, Mr. Clinton had remained in the background.
Now, as one city official after another said, the President appears prepared to step into a more visible role in Washington's life, starting with a speech planned for Sunday at the Metropolitan Baptist Church. It will be Mr. Clinton's first address to local residents on local issues since he campaigned for President in 1992.
"It is clear we now have an on-going partnership with the city and the White House," said Linda Cropp, chairwoman of the District of Columbia City Council. "It's the first time we have had this kind of relationship."
City officials said they brought up several ways the Federal Government could help the city. For the most part, they said, Mr. Clinton listened and took notes, and then suggested areas in which he felt the Government could help.
The President's ideas included these:
*Drafting legislation to enable the District government to tax income of all who work in Washington, regardless of whether they live in the city.
*Creating partnerships between Federal agencies and their District counterparts, like the Department of Education and the public school system.
*Developing training programs to match under-skilled District workers with high-tech jobs.
Of the three, the tax issue is the thorniest, with Federal lawmakers from the surrounding Congressional districts in Virginia and Maryland steadfastly opposed to shifting their tax revenues to the District.
Andrew F. Brimmer, chairman of Washington's financial control board, said that because of the political opposition, Mr. Clinton "did not respond specifically" to how the shift might be accomplished.
If the meeting today provided a boost to the city's political fortunes, the opening of the MCI Center is hoped to do the same for its economy.
Abandoned by specialty and department stores that moved to the suburbs after the racial rioting of 1968, parts of downtown Washington have become a sea of rutted parking lots, boarded-up buildings and distinctly down-scale shops.
Then two years ago, Abe Pollin, the owner of the region's professional basketball and hockey teams and the building in which they played for 25 years, the US Airways Arena in Landover, Md., a Washington suburb, agreed to build a new arena in downtown Washington.
Completed just in time for tonight's National Basketball Association game between the Washington Wizards (formerly the Bullets) and the Seattle Supersonics, it sits on a five-acre site adjacent to the city's Chinatown and above a subway station served by three lines of the Metro, within blocks of what was once a thriving retail area.
Already, the arena has spurred a wave of new restaurants, bars and shops. But the long-term viability of the surrounding area depends more on the social habits of ticket buyers, and whether they will come early for shopping and stay late for dinner.
With the arena expected to be the site of 250 events a year, city officials say they are convinced the downtown economic retreat will finally turn around.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Criticizes Politics of Small Ideas; White House Fumes

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 2

 BODY:
Staking out what he called a new vision for the Democratic Party, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri tonight portrayed the Clinton Administration and leaders of the party's moderate wing as content to govern with small ideas while neglecting the nation's problems.
In a speech at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, Mr. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, did not name President Clinton. But aides said his remarks were intended to chide Mr. Clinton, particularly for boasting of an economic recovery without addressing a growing gap between the wealthy and the working middle class. 
 "So what prevents us from seizing this decisive moment and addressing the great issues, the great challenges, before us today?" Mr. Gephardt asked in a speech that drew restrained applause from several hundred students and faculty members. "Our people have not failed, but our politics is failing our people. Today, the political process has largely become an echo chamber of petty charges, a parade ground for poll-driven maneuvers. Too often, our leaders seem enamored with small ideas that nibble around the edges of big problems."
Mr. Gephardt sought to distinguish himself as a populist alternative as he prepares to compete with Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000 -- at a time when prominent Democrats have talked openly of the party's difficulty settling on an agenda.
But some White House officials said Mr. Gephardt's remarks could hamper efforts by the White House and Congressional Democrats to devise and announce a 1998 agenda.
"For Congressman Gephardt to attack President Clinton while the President is trying hard to unite this party for the '98 elections can only harm our party and prospects," said Rahm Emanuel, a senior Presidential adviser, after he was read passages of Mr. Gephardt's prepared text. "It sounds like politics over principle, especially given his flip-flops on multiple issues."
Mr. Gephardt made no reference to Attorney General Janet Reno's move today to essentially clear Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore of accusations about their campaign finance practices. But, clearly referring to the fund-raising, he said: "We need a Democratic Party that is a movement for change and a movement for values -- and not a money machine."
For more than a year, Mr. Gephardt has established himself as an alternative voice to Mr. Clinton on such major issues as welfare, the budget, taxes and trade. Tonight, he attempted to present his approach as one comprehensive vision.
"These are certainly not the worst of times," Mr. Gephardt said in what sounded like a retort to Mr. Clinton's frequent recitation of indicators that show a major economic recovery. "But they're also not the best of times. In many ways, they're the most stressed of times."
Mr. Gephardt reserved some pointed comments for a group of moderate Democrats he helped found: the Democratic Leadership Council. Since his failed bid for the Presidential nomination in 1988, Mr. Gephardt has campaigned as a liberal while the President has embraced important elements of the council's agenda. Mr. Gephardt warned that a "principled and pragmatic" approach was no longer driving leaders of moderate Democrats.
"This is a different approach from some who now call themselves New Democrats, but who set their compass only off the direction of others," he said, "who talk about the political center, but fail to understand that if it's only defined by others it lacks core values."
He also said Democrats should not be "a slightly more compassionate version of the other side, or a constantly shifting combination of tactics and momentary calculations."
Responding to Mr. Gephardt's comments, Al From, the organization's president, said: "The D.L.C.'s base is broader today than it was when Gephardt was chairman. I just think he's wrong."
Asked by a student whether he was trying to create a gulf in the party to help him challenge Mr. Gore, Mr. Gephardt told him he was making "assumptions that are horribly premature -- I really mean that."

HEADLINE: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DECISION: THE O'LEARY CASE;
Reno Backs Former Energy Secretary's Denials of Wrongdoing

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Attorney General Janet Reno virtually exonerated former Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary today of accusations that she improperly sought a contribution for a charity in return for a meeting with an Asian business group. But Ms. Reno said the actions of some of Mrs. O'Leary's top aides still needed to be investigated.
In supporting Mrs. O'Leary's repeated denials of any wrongdoing, Ms. Reno portrayed a Cabinet official unaware of what her trusted subordinates were doing, including signing her name. The actions of those subordinates -- unnamed in Ms. Reno's official statement -- will be investigated further by the Justice Department, the Attorney General said. 
 At issue are the circumstances of an October 1995 dinner attended by Johnny Chung, a prominent fund-raiser for the Democratic Party; a donation to Mrs. O'Leary's favorite charity, and the apparent use of Mrs. O'Leary's signature without her knowledge.
Mr. Chung has maintained that he made a $25,000 donation to Africare, Mrs. O'Leary's favorite charity, at the suggestion of an Energy Department employee, to gain an audience for a Chinese energy official with Mrs. O'Leary.
Mrs. O'Leary, who left the Cabinet at the end of Mr. Clinton's first term, has denied soliciting a donation or asking others to solicit one. She has said that her meeting with the Chinese official, Hauren Sheng, was entirely appropriate because he managed his country's petrochemical industry and had met with her before, when she visited China the previous February.
Ms. Reno said today that a review of the chain of events had convinced her that "there is no basis for further investigation of Mrs. O'Leary's role." In declining to name an independent counsel to investigate the former Cabinet member, Ms. Reno seemed to support Mrs. O'Leary, who said she was "relieved but not surprised" by the decision.
But it was clear that the investigation is far from over. In addition to Ms. Reno's pledge that the Justice Department will dig deeper, there was confirmation today from the House Committee on Reform and Oversight that Mrs. O'Leary has been summoned to testify before the panel on Dec. 16.
A committee spokesman, Will Dwyer, said the panel headed by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, will examine among other things the actions of Mrs. O'Leary's top aides.
Ms. Reno said there was no doubt that Mr. Chung had met with Democratic National Committee officials to seek their aid in arranging a meeting between senior Chinese Government officials and Mrs. O'Leary, President Clinton or both. Mr. Chung was then steered to a lobbyist, who in turn put him in touch with a senior Energy Department official.
At that time, Mrs. O'Leary was honorary chairwoman for a dinner to benefit Africare, a relief organization based in Washington, and President Clinton was to attend a reception at the event. Mr. Chung expressed an interest in having the Chinese officials attend the dinner so that they could meet Mr. Clinton.
Ms. Reno said investigators were sure that Mr. Chung had requested a letter signed by Mrs. O'Leary, inviting the delegation to meet with her as well as to attend the dinner. To please Mr. Chung, a senior Energy Department aide and two colleagues faxed an unsigned letter to Mr. Chung, inviting him and the delegation to attend. There was no mention of a donation, the Attorney General said.
Soon thereafter, Mr. Chung requested and got a more formal letter confirming the meeting with Mrs. O'Leary. That letter bore the Secretary's signature -- but a signature executed by a machine of the kind used by public officials whose signature is often required. That letter also carried no mention of the Africare dinner, Ms. Reno said.
At some point, Ms. Reno said, one of the Energy Department employees who had helped to prepare the first letter obtained a $25,000 check, payable to Africare, from Mr. Chung. The donation entitled Mr. Chung and his Chinese guests to attend the reception with the President.
While picking up the check, the Energy Department employee asked a surprised Mr. Chung to give back the first letter that had been faxed to him, Ms. Reno said.
The Attorney General said there was "no evidence whatsoever" that Mrs. O'Leary knew of either letter or the circumstances surrounding the collection and delivery of the $25,000 check and the retrieval of the first letter.
As for the meeting between Mrs. O'Leary and the Chinese energy delegation, Ms. Reno said it was "routine and largely ceremonial."
Ms. Reno noted that Mr. Chung was "the only witness who even suggests that Mrs. O'Leary may have known" of the $25,000 solicitation, and that he has said that his belief that the Secretary had known was based on her signature on the second letter, a signature that Justice Department investigators determined was made by the machine, known as an automatic pen.
The Los Angeles Times has reported that Corlis Moody, long a top O'Leary aide and currently the Energy Department's director of economic impact and diversity, was instrumental in sending both letters to Mr. Chung, and that one of the letters was retrieved after an Energy Department lawyer concluded that there was an appearance of impropriety in the way the invitations were extended by Mrs. O'Leary's aides.
Mr. Dwyer said Ms. Moody's activities will be looked into by the Burton Committee.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Up 6th Month in a Row

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
An important gauge of future economic activity shows the outlook remains bright, suggesting the long expansion that began halfway through the Bush Administration will reach its seventh anniversary in early spring.
Only two postwar expansions have been so long and both by this time were marked by rising inflation, in sharp contrast to the price deceleration that prevails today. 
 In its monthly calculation released today, the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group, said the index of leading indicators advanced two-tenths of 1 percent in October, the sixth consecutive increase and the same as September's.
This gauge, derived mostly from previously published data, is designed to predict cyclical turning points in the economy. But even a change in index direction is not considered meaningful unless it is sizable, persistent and spread among many components. In other words, recession during the first half of 1998 is highly unlikely, analysts said.
"The fundamentals are pretty solid," said Ge Zhou, an economist at Caterpillar Inc., predicting that Asia's economic turmoil would not hurt American growth.
Seven of the 10 component items contributed to the October rise. The main forces were a longer factory work week and increase in the money supply.
Small pluses were higher stock prices, more building permits, rising consumer expectations, higher new orders for nonmilitary capital goods and slightly fewer first-time claims for unemployment insurance.
The largest restraining influence was the interest-rate spread, the difference in the yields on 10-year Treasury bonds and Federal funds, which are overnight loans between banks. The spread, often referred to as the yield curve, is unusually flat now, a situation widely regarded as one of the most reliable predictors of slowing economic activity.
The leading index was also held back by a modest speedup in the time it takes suppliers to deliver orders and by fewer orders to factories for consumer goods.
A separate gauge compiled by the Conference Board, designed to mirror current economic conditions, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in October, the 19th consecutive gain. All three available elements of this coincident index advanced -- the number of employees on nonfarm payrolls, personal income and industrial output.
"The coincident index also suggests that the economy should sail smoothly into 1998," said Mark Vitner, economist at the First Union Bank.
The Conference Board's index of lagging indicators, those that move only after the economy's direction is clear, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent after no change in September.

HEADLINE: From Perestroika to Pizza: Gorbachev Stars in TV Ad

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The last leader of the Soviet Union was unable to prevent the collapse of Communism. So now he has conspicuously taken his place on the winning side.
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 66, has filmed a commercial endorsement for Pizza Hut. 
 Mr. Gorbachev agreed to sit down at a table with his granddaughter in the Moscow outlet of Pizza Hut and pay tribute to capitalism and its greasiest offshoot: American fast food.
Mr. Gorbachev said he was not exactly sure how much he was being paid, but some reports indicate his fee is close to $1 million.
Explaining that he badly needed the money to finance his foundation, a research institute that bears his name, Mr. Gorbachev said in an interview today that he had declined many other offers to endorse products but made an exception for Pizza Hut.
"I thought that it is a people' s matter -- food," he said. "This is why if my name works for the benefit of consumers, to hell with it -- I can risk it."
The script is deferential; indeed, it could be viewed as Mr. Gorbachev's ultimate fantasy. He arrives by limousine at a Pizza Hut and some patrons notice him. An older man grumbles, "Because of him, we have economic confusion." A younger man disagrees, saying, "Because of him we have opportunity." Patrons continue to argue, until an older woman pipes up, "Because of him we have things like Pizza Hut." The patrons, pizza slices aloft, rise and give a standing ovation to their former leader.
Mr. Gorbachev responds with a dignified smile. He does not actually eat a slice of pizza, but sips coffee as he watches his granddaughter dig in happily.
Though the ad was shot in Moscow last Thursday, there are no plans to broadcast it in Russia. Esteemed in the West as the statesman who ended the cold war, Mr. Gorbachev is extremely unpopular in Russia, where he is blamed for allowing the Soviet Union to fall apart and for not having pushed reform of the command economy far enough. When he ran for the presidency last year -- his first campaign for public office -- he won less than 1 percent of the vote. To put it another way, Mr. Gorbachev's endorsement of Pizza Hut could well cause sales in Moscow to drop dramatically.
"Here in Russia, it will be understood one way," Mr. Gorbachev said of the advertisement, which has already been ridiculed in the Russian press. "In other places, it is nothing unusual. I see my colleagues, former presidents, and your Presidents, too, taking part in campaigns."
Actually, Mr. Gorbachev may be breaking new ground for statesmen. Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl have never made commercials. Even in America, where celebrity endorsements are part of the cultural fabric, no former President has taken quite so bold a step. In 1996, George Bush made an unpaid commercial for the Houston Astros, the baseball team, as a favor to its owner, Drayton McLane. His Vice President, Dan Quayle, did a commercial in 1994 for Frito-Lay potato chips and was paid $50,000.
Gerald R. Ford serves on many corporate boards for substantial compensation, but has not made product endorsements. Mostly, those kinds of ads have been picked up by Presidential or Vice-Presidential also-rans, from Bob Dole, who endorsed Dunkin' Donuts and Visa, to Geraldine Ferraro, who made an advertisement in 1984 for Diet Pepsi.
Since leaving the Kremlin, Mr. Gorbachev has marketed himself as a newspaper columnist, memoirist and highly paid speaker and made a cameo appearance in a Wim Wenders art film, improvising a soliloquy on Dostoyevsky.
Mr. Gorbachev has already made an ad for Apple computers in Germany, but said that by starring in the Pizza Hut commercial he was taking a step he had previously considered "unsuitable" for someone of his standing. He complained that the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, had stripped him of much of the office space he was allotted after he resigned from office on Dec. 25, 1991, and had deliberately thwarted his fund-raising efforts.
"I don't get support from the state," he said. "If you look at the foundations in Germany or France, the state finances them, they find sponsors. Here, we don't have any of that. Sponsors can be found. There were some, but on the next day after meeting with me they were summoned to the presidential headquarters to fix their brains."
Executives at Pizza Hut seemed dismayed that Mr. Gorbachev had spoken about his coming cameo so soon, and would not disclose when the ad is expected to run or provide a still from the video. But one company executive explained Pizza Hut's interest in attaching Mr. Gorbachev's name to its pizza this way: "We are constantly striving to take our advertising to a new edge. And we have a new commercial that the whole world will want to watch."
The commercial was created by the BBDO New York advertising agency, which is known for using celebrities in big-budget spots. Among the commercials from BBDO are a 1996 spot for Visa with Mr. Dole and a 1995 Doritos commercial with Mario M. Cuomo and Ann Richards.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Is Lower Still, and Japanese Exports Cheaper

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Waiting for an elevator at the Keidanren, Japan's influential business association, one can hardly underestimate the importance of the dollar-yen exchange rate. A digital display monitor hanging from the ceiling shows just how many yen it would take to buy a dollar at that moment.
And lately, it takes a lot more yen. 
 Despite complaints from Washington about the rising Japanese trade surplus in the last few months, Japanese exports are getting less expensive. The yen reached 128.64 to the dollar today, the highest dollar value since May 1992.. The dollar has risen nearly 11 percent against the yen this year and nearly 61 percent against the Japanese currency since touching a postwar low just under 80 yen in April 1995.
Japan's exports are likely to become even cheaper, according to some economists and currency traders. By some estimates, the dollar could rise as high as 140 yen, a level last reached in June 1991.
The yen's slide today, which reflects the continued weakness of the Japanese financial system, has been unwelcome in Washington because a buildup of Japanese imports could hurt important American industries. The weakening yen also disturbed Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.
"I have been concerned about the recent fluctuation of the yen's exchange rate, and its movement today is unacceptable," Mr. Mitsuzuka said, after the yen fell to a rate of 129.30 to the dollar at one point this morning. He said Japan and the United States were prepared to stem the fall if necessary, and hours later, currency traders seemed to take notice as the yen recovered some ground. In New York the dollar settled at 128.64 yen, down from 128.91 yen there late Monday.
 Mr. Mitsuzuka reiterated his concern on Wednesday morning, declaring that "the excessive decline of the yen is undesirable." The Japanese currency moved barely lower, to a rate of 128.67 to the dollar.
But the likely outlook for the yen is for further erosion. Interest rates in Japan are negligible, the economy is weak, and the banking system is burdened with bad loans. Some investors turn a quick profit by buying yen and quickly selling them for a currency with a higher yield.
"The yen should be weaker," said Kazuteru Hasegawa, head of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of America here. "Japan is obviously one of the Asian countries, so I think what's happened in this region recently is likely to damage the yen."
Indeed the currency weaknesses through much of Asia -- brought on for differing reasons in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea -- have put added pressure on Japan, which relies heavily on exports that compete with goods from some of these countries. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar has risen 61 percent against the Thai baht, nearly 43 percent against the Malaysian ringgit and more than 45 percent against the South Korean won.
Japanese cars, steel and semiconductors, among other things, compete with cars, steel and semiconductors manufactured in those countries, and are looking rather expensive in comparison.
Since the Japanese Government raised taxes last spring, causing already weak consumer demand to slow sharply, the Japanese are more dependent than ever on exports to pull their moribund economy out of its slump. "The Japanese economy is over all stimulated by a weaker yen vis-a-vis the dollar," said Minoru Makihara, president of the Mitsubishi Corporation. "In that sense, and since a trading company's activities are related to the state of the Japanese economy, a weaker yen versus the dollar is not bad news."
At the moment, that would seem to put Japan between a rock and a hard place. If its industries are to stay competitive, the yen must fall. Yet the United States considers any significant decline in the yen unacceptable. "As president of the Japan-America Business Council, I know that despite the strength of the U.S. economy over all, at our next meeting there will be loud voices saying Japan should import more," Mr. Makihara said.
Just in case the message from Washington had not been clear, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers dropped in a couple of weeks ago to see Mr. Mitsuzuka, and since then President Clinton; the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and Thomas S. Foley, the new Ambassador to Japan, have all weighed in sternly on the yen's slide.
But how deep American concerns run is a subject of some debate here. While the exchange rate of the yen is an old bogyman, the United States may be less worried about the yen in particular and more that the recent turmoil in the Asian currency markets will set off a vicious cycle of competitive devaluation in Asia.
Several economists note that with the United States economy poised to hum along at least through next spring and some of the lowest unemployment rates in decades, the Japanese trade surplus is not a hot-button political issue in the United States.
"At the moment, there's only one source of capital for the Democratic Party and that's organized labor," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company here. "So as midterm elections are coming up, you may see Al Gore go out a little to the left and say some tough things about trade.
"But as long as the U. S. economy remains healthy going into the election, which everyone thinks is possible, and unemployment stays low, a tough trade stance isn't going to make much political hay."
In fact, a higher level of imports, along with a stronger dollar, could ease pressure to raise interest rates and mitigate the risk of an increase in inflation, two of the most important elements fueling the American economy.
Plus, a stronger dollar versus the yen makes investment in Japan cheaper for American companies. Every day, American names become more prevalent in Tokyo. Gap Inc. has opened stores in the Hankyu department store. The Starbucks mermaid has begun appearing in tony Tokyo neighborhoods. Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover are capturing increasing amounts of the brokerage business here.
"It's very clear that with the dollar at 135 to 140 yen, increasing the beachhead in the Japanese economy is easier," said Jesper Koll, head of research at J. P. Morgan. "I have no doubt in my mind that certain parts of the American economy -- Detroit, steel -- are going to be noisy, but the new America -- the high-tech industries, the financial services industries -- are going to be delighted."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges More Attention Be Paid to Banks Abroad

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called for increased efforts tonight to shore up banks in developing countries, saying that the current crisis in Asia has shown that global markets will ruthlessly batter weak financial systems.
Mr. Greenspan said institutions like the International Monetary Fund should do more to identify and head off banking problems in developing nations. And he said that governments in those countries should stop shielding banks from the forces of market competition, and in particular should stop directing banks to lend to politically connected borrowers and industries singled out for special treatment. 
 In a speech to the Economic Club of New York and in response to questions afterward, Mr. Greenspan touched only briefly on the domestic economy and made no substantive comments on the outlook for interest rates. He focused instead on the lessons that might be gleaned from the financial instability that has spread across Asia and has unsettled markets worldwide.
In response to questions after the speech, Mr. Greenspan said that even a huge war chest of foreign currency reserves would not be enough to protect a nation in the long run from a battering in the markets if its economy was not sound.
Countries with economic or financial troubles might be able to use such reserves to prop up their currencies for a longer period and delay needed changes to their economic policies, but ultimately they would be defeated by market forces, he said.
"There is no level of reserves that you can achieve which will protect you from a fundamental imbalance with regard to the market," Mr. Greenspan said.
He said that falling asset prices, or deflation, could be a "virulent" problem, but said deflation tends to take place after inflation has pushed prices up sharply, as happened to real estate and other assets in Japan.
"The Japanese experience of recent years clearly exhibits both sides of the equation," he said.
Some of the problems in Japan and in the rest of Asia, Mr. Greenspan said, might have been driven by excess liquidity, or too much money chasing investment opportunities.
But his main theme was that the global markets today offer nations with financial or economic problems no place to hide.
"The accelerated opening up in recent years of product and financial markets worldwide offers enormous benefits to all nations over the long run," Mr. Greenspan said in his speech, repeating his oft-stated belief that free markets are the only proven path to prosperity.
"However," he said, "it has also exposed more quickly and harshly the underlying rigidities of economic systems in which governments -- or governments working with large industrial groups -- exercise substantial influence over resource allocation.
"Such systems can produce vigorous growth for a time when the gap between indigenous applied technologies and world standards is large, such as in the Soviet Union in the 1960's and 1970's and Southeast Asia in the 1980's and 1990's. But as the gap narrows, the ability of these systems to handle their increasingly sophisticated economies declines markedly."
The problems sweeping Asia have their roots in troubled banking systems, first in Thailand and later in Indonesia and South Korea. Those three nations have had to call on the I.M.F. to bail out their economies. Japan is also trying to bring long-brewing problems with its banks under control, although there is no indication that Japan's financial woes will require an international bailout.
Leaders in Asia, Mr. Greenspan said, are now recognizing the problems they face and the "unforgiving nature of the new global market forces."
Those forces, however, will be put to good use if they prompt governments in developing nations to strengthen their banking systems, he said.
Mr. Greenspan dismissed as unfeasible the calls from some Asian leaders, most notably Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, to impose strict controls on activities like currency trading.
Mr. Greenspan gave an upbeat assessment of Japan's efforts to confront the huge pool of bad loans afflicting its financial institutions, saying the Japanese Government "finally seems to be appropriately addressing their problems."
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the I.M.F. and other international institutions could have done a better job of spotting the problems developing in Asia's banking systems over the last few years, but added that it was difficult to get governments to take such politically painful steps as shutting down ailing banks.
"Yes, the potential risks to the banking systems of many Asian countries and the potential contagion effects for their neighbors and other trading partners should have been spotted earlier and addressed," Mr. Greenspan said.
But, he added, "there is significant bias in political systems of all varieties to substitute hope (read, wishful thinking) for possibly difficult pre-emptive policy moves."
In trying to fix the problem, the I.M.F., the World Bank and the governments of the United States and other rich nations should demand that countries in financial trouble take tough steps to buttress their banking systems as well as their economic fundamentals, Mr. Greenspan said. His statement was similar to ones from President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin regarding the terms under which South Korea would get help from the I.M.F. and the United States.
"Assistance without further reform of financial systems and economic policies would be worse than useless since it would foster expectations of being perpetually bailed out," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan did not make specific recommendations about how to improve international surveillance of countries likely to face financial problems, or how to press such nations to make needed policy changes before they face a crisis. But he suggested that failure to do so would lead to ever-larger bills for bailouts.
"Preventive programs should be accelerated sufficiently far in advance of the next crisis to effectively thwart or contain it," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: South Korea Halts Activity At 9 Banks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The Government suspended the operations of nine ailing South Korean financial institutions Tuesday and threatened to shut them down in a move tied to the pending bailout of the nation's economy by the International Monetary Fund.
The relentless uncertainty about the bailout deal and barrage of bad economic news, meanwhile, did further damage to the South Korean stock market today. The market's main index fell nearly 4 percent this morning, as the market seemed headed for its 10th consecutive day of losses. 
 Traders were selling on an announcement that trading in shares in Halla Group, one of South Korea's large industrial conglomerates, had been suspended because the company had defaulted on loans. Seven of South Korea's 40 big conglomerates have tumbled into bankruptcy this year.
Talks between the monetary fund and the Government appeared to be nearing a conclusion and there were widespread expectations that an announcement would be made today. Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F., arrived in Seoul today to carry on the talks.
South Korean officials said Mr. Camdessus had come to complete and announce an agreement.
 However, they had previously announced wrongly that an agreement had been reached, possibly using the announcements as a bargaining ploy. It appears that the I.M.F., as well as the United States, has been pushing for the agreement to include tougher steps by Seoul to overhaul and open up its financial system.
The Ministry of Finance and Economy ordered a halt Tuesday to most of the operations of nine merchant banks and said the banks would be closed unless they can devise a plan to right themselves by March 31. Merchant banks tend to specialize in short-term lending.
What to do about insolvent banks has been a major sticking point in the negotiations over the I.M.F. rescue package.
The I.M.F. is expected to provide tens of billions of dollars to South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy and the biggest victim yet in Asia's financial crisis. The money will be used to help South Korea pay foreign debts and overhaul its financial system.
The I.M.F. has been pushing for rapid closings of insolvent banks, saying that is the best way to quickly restore the health of a financial system hobbled by bad debts. Seoul, worried about rising unemployment, labor unrest and the possibility of runs on banks by frightened depositors, has pushed for allowing the ailing institutions to be revamped or merged with healthier ones.
Trading of shares in eight of the merchant banks that are publicly listed was halted Tuesday on the Korean stock market, as stock prices over all plunged again. The stock exchange's composite index fell 4.1 percent, to 376.87, on Tuesday and the value of the currency, the won, also fell sharply against the dollar, reaching another new low.
While there are some fairly healthy merchant banks among the 30 in South Korea, many have huge bad debts and their plight has contributed to the country's troubles.
Henry G. Morris, research director at Coryo Securities in Seoul, said the potential closing of the merchant banks "is being taken very seriously here because, for their scale, they have provided very sizable credits to Korean business and industry." In particular, he said, the merchant banks are important sources of loans for smaller and midsize businesses.
He said the effects of any merchant bank closings on employment would be small because the average merchant bank employs 100 to 300 people. But the Government is more worried about setting a precedent for the liquidation of commercial banks, which are far larger than merchant banks and employ thousands of people.
News reports here were quoting Finance Ministry officials as saying that commercial banks will not have to be closed under the terms of the agreement with the I.M.F.
Seoul has announced that a deal is at hand twice in the last three days. A Cabinet meeting was scheduled Tuesday morning to endorse an agreement, and the Government even issued a statement in the name of President Kim Young Sam urging citizens to bear the pain gallantly.
A short time later the Government retracted the statement.

From Gorbachev, a Nod To Capitalism -- and Pizza
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, has filmed a commercial endorsement for Pizza Hut, whose sign is shown in Cyrillic. Mr. Gorbachev said he badly needed the money from his endorsement to finance his foundation. He said he was not sure how much he was being paid, but some reports say his fee is close to $1 million. A1 

Reactor Exports Questioned
Canada is aggressively exporting a type of nuclear reactor that has been shut down at several locations in that country. Canada has had its own problems in running the reactors safely, and the countries that are buying them have had little experience regulating -- or even operating -- them. All of that has raised questions about Canada's export policy. A1
 
Helping Russia's Economy
One of Russia's leading economic reformers said he had a plan to shore up Russia's battered economy and get stalled international loans back on track. Anatoly B. Chubais said he had worked out a program, with the help of experts from the International Monetary Fund, that he said would almost certainly persuade the fund to approve the next $780 million installment of its $10 billion loan to Russia. A13
 
Pakistan President Resigns
President Farooq Amhed Leghari of Pakistan resigned, ending a monthlong political crisis. Mr. Leghari said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was responsible for the crisis because of his attacks on Pakistan's Supreme Court, which is hearing contempt and corruption cases against the Prime Minister. But the move added to Mr. Sharif's power. A3
 
No Consensus on Nazi Gold
The United States and Britain announced modest contributions to a new fund to benefit Holocaust survivors, but many other countries withheld immediate donations. The fund is to be based on money raised from Nazi gold held in the United States and British central banks since World War II. Both countries want the 10 European nations with claims on the gold to forgo their demands and instead contribute some or all of their share. A9
 
U.S. Presses NATO on Bosnia
The Clinton Administration, hoping to fight Congressional opposition to a new commitment of American forces in Bosnia, pressed NATO allies to support an international police force that could take over tasks now carried out by NATO troops. A10
 
Death Sentence for 33 Turks
In a sweeping verdict, a Turkish court sentenced 33 people to death for their roles in a 1993 mob attack in which 37 intellectuals were killed at a meeting to discuss ways of promoting secularism. Not all those sentenced were in custody, and commentators said the death sentences would likely be commuted to prison terms. A5

Reno Decides Against Naming Special Counsels
Attorney General Janet Reno rejected the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate fund-raising telephone calls by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, but she indicated that her determinations did not mean that the campaign finance inquiry was officially finished. Ms. Reno also decided not to seek an independent prosecutor to investigate the former Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary. A1
 
Congressional Republicans reacted furiously to the news that the Attorney General had decided not to name an independent prosecutor, accusing her of misreading the law to try to help President Clinton. "There's no question about it, she has changed her standards and changed them for the worst motives to protect the President," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch. A31
 
Meat Irradiation Approved
The Food and Drug Administration approved the irradiation of red meat in a move that could nearly eliminate from the meat supply the bacteria that cause food poisoning. To irradiate, companies would bombard hamburger or sausages, for example, at the end stages of processing. The radiation kills the bacteria by fracturing their genetic material. But it does not make the meat radioactive. A1
 
Town Sees Its Many Sides
After three students were killed by another student on Monday, West Paducah, Ky., is confronting the worst of itself and the best; Benjamin Strong is being credited with talking the 14-year-old student into surrendering. Police were no closer to discovering a motive for the actions of the teen-ager, Michael Carneal. A16
 
49ers Chairman Resigns
Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. resigned as chairman of the San Francisco 49ers football team after it was disclosed that a Federal grand jury in Louisiana may be close to indicting him and the state's former Governor, Edwin E. Edwards, after an investigation of riverboat casino licensing and other business arrangements. Prosecutors have not made clear what they suspect the men to be charged with. A26
 
New Teamsters Monitor Named
The Federal Government named a former prosecutor, Michael G. Cherkasky, to monitor the teamsters' election, a position in which one of his first obligations will be to investigate the finances of James P. Hoffa, the front-runner in the election. Ron Carey, the former union president, filed a lengthy appeal that sought to overturn a decision barring him from re-election. A20
 
Implant Lawsuit Is Narrowed
The first class-action lawsuit in a breast implant case was narrowed by a Louisiana state court to the eight women who filed the original lawsuit, dashing the hopes of 1,800 women to collect damages from the Dow Chemical Company. The judge said the cases of the 1,800 women were too dissimilar to group them all in one lawsuit. A25

Nearly 100 Charged In Tax-Evasion Scheme
The director of New York City's payroll processing department was charged along with nearly 100 current or former city employees in what prosecutors said was a wide-ranging scheme to avoid paying city and state taxes. Only 40 of the city employees were actually arrested, with the others scheduled to turn themselves in today. A1
 
Brawley Sticks to Story
Tawana Brawley, in her first public appearance in New York since her story of rape, abduction and racial hatred polarized the city, told supporters the same thing she did a decade ago: that she had told the truth. A 1988 grand jury report determined that Ms. Brawley had concocted the story that a group of white men in Dutchess County had kidnapped and raped her. Her appearance in Brooklyn came as opening arguments in a defamation lawsuit against her three advisers from a decade ago are expected to begin today. B1
 
Charity to Get $4.5 Million
George Soros, the financier-philanthropist, is to announce today that he is giving the Robin Hood foundation, which helps New York's poor, $4.5 million over the next three years. It would be the largest single donation Robin Hood has received and Mr. Soros's largest single gift to a New York-oriented charity. B11

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Allows Casino On Ship 3 Miles Offshore

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In another twist to the tangled history of gambling cruises from New York City, a judge in Federal District Court has overruled a Goverment decision that blocked the cruises from operating just three miles off the city's shore.
The decision two months ago by the United States Attorney in Brooklyn to force gambling ships at least 12 miles offshore came at the request of city officials who were concerned about the potential proliferation of offshore gambling. The 12-mile limit led a Brooklyn company, Bay Casino, to suspend its gambling cruises from Sheepshead Bay on Oct. 31. 
 The United States Attorney, Zachary W. Carter, based his decision on a law passed by Congress last year that extended the nation's territorial jurisdiction to 12 miles as part of an anticrime and antiterrorism bill.
After some legal parrying, the Government and Bay Casino decided to seek a ruling on the statute in Federal District Court.
In a ruling dated Monday and released yesterday, Judge Allyne R. Ross of Federal District Court in Brooklyn said that the Government's interpretation of what constituted territorial jurisdiction was too broad. "The court must apply the principle of lenity," the judge wrote, "which leads to resolution of ambiguity in favor of Bay Casino."
"The court cannot conclude that Congress's clearly expressed intent to expand Federal criminal jurisdiction was accompanied by a clear intent to amend also the substantive elements of what constitutes a gambling violation," the judge added.
Andrew Stengel, a spokesman for Bay Casino, said, "We're pleased at the outcome, which confirms what we've thought all along."
When Bay Cruises suspended the cruises on its ship, the Liberty I, it said the 12-mile limit was hurting business by requiring that the ship travel farther into choppier waters. Officials at the company were told that a failure to comply with the 12-mile limit could result in a seizure of the ship and other penalties. At the time, the company said that it planned to resume operations in the spring, whether at 3 or at 12 miles.
Mr. Stengel said that company officials would review the judge's ruling before deciding whether it would speed their plans to resume the cruises.
William J. Muller, executive assistant United States attorney in Mr. Carter's office, said his office had no comment on Judge Ross's ruling, pending further review.
Rudy Washington, Deputy Mayor for community development and business services, said he had not seen the decision but would review it with the city's Corporation Counsel. But he reiterated the city's preference for a 12-mile boundary, saying the added distance would limit gambling cruises to established casino operators who were well financed and could afford larger boats.
Gambling industry analysts have suggested that a three-mile limit could have broad ramifications.
James Murren, a gambling analyst with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment bank in Manhattan, said that Judge Ross's ruling could make "a major difference for casino cruises in New York City."
He added: "The difference between 3 miles and 12 miles is like apples and oranges. The small boat that was independently financed was actually doing quite well at 3 miles, and there are many large companies that are very interested in New York as a cruise market."
Last month, the partnership that helped create the nation's most profitable casino, Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, announced that it planned to offer daily gambling cruises out of midtown Manhattan for about 1,000 passengers each trip.
For months in 1996, the owners of Bay Casino, which was then called Bay Cruises, told curious residents and politicians that the pier they were busily renovating on the Sheepshead Bay waterfront would be used for a dinner-and-dancing cruise boat that would bring high-class entertainment to a struggling area.
But then last December, the company announced that the cruises -- once on the high seas and out of New York State jurisdiction -- would, in fact, offer casino gambling, which is unregulated in international waters.
But Brooklyn residents complained about the likelihood of increased traffic and parking problems. And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani worried that casino ships would proliferate, jamming New York's waters. Such an operation, Mr. Giuliani said, would not bring much economic benefit to the city and could be vulnerable to organized crime.
After the Liberty I began operating last December, averaging nearly 200 passengers a trip, city officials said they had received more than two dozen inquiries from other companies that wanted to establish similar cruises.
So the city decided on another tack: asking the United States Attorney's office for an interpretation of maritime law. And in October, the office responded, saying that the boundary for international waters was 12 miles off the coast. In addition, Federal prosecutors said a violation of the requirement could result in as much as two years in prison, fines and seizure of the boat.
Bay Casino complied, ordering its boat to cruise at a distance of 12 miles -- which transformed a 25-minute trip into a much choppier 90-minute one. At first, Bay Casino cut back the number of daily trips from three to two. Later, the company announced that it would suspend the ship's operations until spring, when calmer waters would make the trip much faster.
 Meanwhile, after some legal parrying, the Government and Bay Casino decided to test the statue in Federal District Court.

HEADLINE: Fare Break Is in Works, Official Hints

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A top official of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority indicated last night that the agency was planning to use a surplus in this year's budget to give subway and bus riders a break on fares.
Marc V. Shaw, the agency's executive director, would not provide any details of what sort of fare reduction was in the works. But his comments were the first public indication of how agency officials intended to use the surplus. He said he expected a new fare policy to be approved by the authority's board at its next meeting, on Dec. 18. 
 Since it was disclosed in October that the transit agency was running a large surplus in this year's budget -- the amount stood at $129 million at the end of September -- transit officials have been under intense pressure from politicians, transit advocates and riders to use the money to ease the pain of the 25-cent fare increase in 1995. But until yesterday, top officials of the transportation authority had refused even to acknowledge publicly that a surplus existed, let alone say what they would do with it.
The City Council and the Mayor have called for the authority to offer Metrocard users 12 fares for the price of 10, rather than the 11-for-10 deal the authority already plans to offer in January. The larger discount would effectively roll the $1.50 fare back to $1.25.
Some commuter advocates have called for a monthly transit pass with unlimited bus and subway rides for, say, the price of 40 or 50 tokens. Other suggestions for the surplus have been to increase service or use some of the money to pay off debt, but neither of those options has the political appeal of a fare break.
Mr. Shaw refused last night to discuss specific proposals, saying, "We're still looking at our options." But he said he expected some change in the fare structure to win the approval of the agency's board.
"It's becoming pretty clear that we're going to be doing something at our next board meeting in terms of announcing our fare policy plans for next year," Mr. Shaw said. At the meeting, the board is expected to vote on the 1998 budget for its bus and subway subsidiary, New York City Transit.
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group that has been calling for a fare cut, called Mr. Shaw's statement "an enormous step forward."
"The Mayor, the speaker, advocacy groups have all been saying, they have the money, let's do something good," Mr. Russianoff said. "But the M.T.A. has been saying we'd like to do something good but we don't know if we have the money. Now we're all saying the same thing."
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who was already planning to spend this morning handing out leaflets on the subway urging riders to lobby for rolling the fares back to their 1995 level, was pleased by yesterday's news.
"Reducing fares is the obvious," he said. "Now let's do the really obvious: 12 rides for the price of 10, and the time to do it is now."
The final decision on fares could well involve political as well as fiscal calculations, especially since Gov. George E. Pataki, whose appointees control the authority board, may be challenged by Mr. Vallone in next year's election. Mr. Vallone's staff, which has projected that the surplus could reach $167 million by year's end, has calculated that a 12-for-10 deal would cost the authority about $100 million in lost revenue, which would still be significantly less than the surplus.
The City Council's Transportation Committee, keeping up the pressure on the authority, has scheduled a public hearing on the surplus for tomorrow.
Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who also sits on the authority board, said yesterday that city officials had been meeting with the authority's officials to try to persuade them to offer 12 rides for the price of 10.
"We've been optimistic," Mr. Washington said. "They have not been digging in their heels on this, and there have been plenty of other issues that they have been digging in their heels on."
The transit system's balance sheet was $129 million healthier than expected during the first nine months of this year for three basic reasons.
*Ridership is up -- bus revenue and subway revenue are each running $19 million ahead of projections through September.
*Expenses are down -- fringe benefits, rentals and other expenses are running about $47 million less than expected.
*Tax revenue is up -- the city's economy is booming, and the transportation authority gets part of sales, petroleum and mortgage taxes.
But authority officials had expressed doubt, at least publicly, that the financial picture would stay rosy, and said repeatedly that trends were not strong enough to be the basis of planning.

HEADLINE: In Dark Times, Russia's Economic Chief Looks on Bright Side

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Looking confident and self-possessed, Anatoly B. Chubais, the chief overseer of Russia's economic changes, said today that he had a plan to shore up the country's battered economy and get international loans, currently stalled, back on track.
The Russian stock market has plunged in the last few weeks, a ripple effect of financial turmoil in Asia. Foreign investors, who have lost confidence in emerging markets, have pulled more than $5 billion in securities from Russia in the last month. 
 But Mr. Chubais, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, whose own stock was badly damaged last month by a scandal over a questionable book deal, was also plotting his redemption. In his first interview with Western reporters since the scandal broke, he tried to make it clear that he was still in charge of Russia's fragile finances and a power to be reckoned with.
He said little about the details of the book contract from a publishing house, which is owned by one of the banks that has recently benefited from government sales of state property.
Instead, Mr. Chubais, who calls the scandal a smear campaign, said he was tripped up by bankers and businessmen who are disgruntled by his efforts to curb the favoritism and insider deals that have veined earlier privatization efforts.
But he acknowledged that the scandal -- which resulted in the removal of some of his closest aides and could still lead to his own dismissal once the current economic crisis is past -- has weighed him down.
"I am now told, 'You must pay wage arrears by Jan. 1 -- yes, there is a little financial crisis, so you must overcome it, and besides, we will tie your hands behind your back and we will tie your legs, too.' "
He added: "So it affects me badly. But what can I do?"
Mr. Chubais said that he had worked out a program with the help of experts from the International Monetary Fund and that it would almost certainly persuade the I.M.F to approve the next $780 million installment of its $10 billion loan to Russia soon.
The I.M.F. postponed giving out the money early last month because Russia had failed to raise its targeted tax revenues.
Last week, Russia sent two top officials to Washington to try to obtain more aid to see the country through the current crisis. The meetings were inconclusive, and United States officials pointedly referred Mr. Chubais back to the I.M.F.
But it was not at all clear how much the plan, which Mr. Chubais heralded today as "tough and radical," differs from steps Russia has previously promised to take.
I.M.F. officials arrived in Moscow this week and will work with their Russian counterparts on hammering out ways for Russia to cut its spending more rigorously and to raise revenues. The team is due to leave on Dec. 12.
Most likely, Mr. Chubais is hoping that a new show of determination -- and the country's dire straits -- will persuade the I.M.F. to relent and release the loan by January.
"Traditionally, in times of crises, international financial organizations come forth and help out," he said.
Mr. Chubais said that the Russian Government would continue to defend the ruble, which has lost value since the financial crisis began. But he noted that it would stop intervening to protect interest rates on the treasury bond market.
This would make life easier for the Central Bank, which has been straining to keep the ruble stable, but might create some turmoil in the short run.
"There may be some high and even hysterical splashes," Mr. Chubais said. "But it is clear that in the next few days it will stop somewhere on its new level, which we will start to protect."
Among the unpleasant tasks Mr. Chubais faces in the coming days is a battle with Russia's Communist-led Parliament, which is supposed to begin debate on the 1998 budget on Friday and which has resisted further spending cuts.
The Parliament has been demanding Mr. Chubais's resignation. And, with his reputation tarnished, he will have an uphill battle to bring the Parliament to a budget compromise.
But Mr. Chubais seemed mainly preoccupied by the war he is waging against some of Russia's top bankers and businessmen. He complained that powerful Russian tycoons are unwilling to surrender the kind of crony capitalism he says he is determined to uproot and that they will do anything to stop him.
"What is happening now in reality?" he asked rhetorically. "The members of my team are under round-the-clock surveillance. Telephone conversations are being tapped. My close relatives are being followed, too. My wife's friends are offered any kind of bribes for any kind of compromising material on Chubais. My son is also being constantly followed."
"But so far they haven't started to shoot," he said. "But we will see."

HEADLINE: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DECISION: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Relief for White House

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Perhaps, as she contended, Attorney General Janet Reno did not exonerate anyone today. But politically, she lifted a huge weight off the shoulders of President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
There was no public gloating or popping of champagne corks at the White House after Ms. Reno announced that she would not appoint an independent counsel to look into aspects of the Democrats' fund-raising. Sticking with the measured, detached pose that he has labored to maintain toward the finance scandal, Mr. Clinton released a one-sentence written statement. 
 "The Attorney General made her decision based on a careful review of the law and the facts, and that's as it should be," it read.
But Mr. Gore, who still has elections ahead of him, betrayed a little more excitement, speaking with reporters at an education event in Connecticut. Twice he declared his pleasure at having the subject of fund-raising calls "put behind us." Then he repaired to the First and Last Tavern in Hartford to share a celebratory pizza with Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.
Of course, the campaign finance imbroglio -- the mystery brew of Indonesian businessmen, Chinese connections, Buddhist nuns and teamster stratagems -- is not behind the President and Vice President. But privately, and with good reason, aides to both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have looked forward to Ms. Reno's announcement, which was expected, as the beginning of the end of the Democrats' fund-raising woes.
While "never been indicted" is not an appealing political slogan, both men can now claim that an exhaustive, months-long inquiry -- "thousands of hours of investigation," in Ms. Reno's phrase -- turned up no evidence that they broke the law.
As long as Republicans on Capitol Hill control the most prominent investigations, White House aides believe -- rightly, judging by the experience of the past year -- voters will dismiss the scandal as a strictly political affair. And tonight. the Vice President tried to guide the public to that conclusion.
"Bear in mind that in the days and weeks and months ahead, there will continue to be partisan attacks, politically motivated," he said.
By contrast, an independent counsel, with its appearance of neutrality and green-eyeshades expertise, packs a political wallop that Congressional panels and investigators rarely muster.
Further, as the Clinton Administration has learned to its sadness, such counsels grind inexorably away, year after year, sustaining press interest.
An independent counsel, if appointed, "certainly keeps it alive," said James Carville, who has battled other independent counsels on Mr. Clinton's behalf. "There's the inevitable, 'They're calling this witness,' and, 'They're in this phase.' Even if there's a competent independent counsel, which there hasn't been in a long time, there'd still be leaks."
An independent counsel would almost inevitably gain broad authority to shine bright lights into the crannies of White House policy making, seeking connections to donations. "Having a special counsel opens everything in the White House to scrutiny," said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was chief of staff in President Ronald Reagan's second term, when an independent counsel was digging into the Iran-contra affair.
At a very basic, personal level, Ms. Reno's decision saved both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. "You're looking at probably a million-dollar decision for these guys," said Carter A. Eskew, a Democratic political consultant who sometimes advises Mr. Gore.
But neither man is out of the woods. Continuing finance investigations into lower-level officials like Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt could still lead to the appointment of an independent counsel who would surely take an interest in the White House. It is even possible that the Justice Department's investigation may also still directly implicate Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore.
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who professes some ambivalence about the power of independent counsels, nevertheless maintained that one was inevitable in this case. "And then when it finally happens people will say, 'What took you so long?' " he said.
Perhaps. But a year's investigation by the Justice Department, an inquiry by a Senate committee and a fevered competition among journalists have yet to produce a disclosure that would prompt the Attorney General to appoint a counsel.
As a result, Mr. Gore's staff has been looking ahead to today as a critical date for the Vice President, and they prepared carefully. Shortly after Ms. Reno's announcement, aides to the Vice President passed out a 73-page briefing book to reporters at the White House defending his position on the fund-raising calls.
Mr. Gore's aides had postponed answering most interview requests until after the Attorney General's announcement. But they have planned a series of high-profile appearances for the Vice President in the coming days, to show him absorbed in the people's business. On Wednesday he is to meet with entertainment executives to discuss how the industry can protect children from tobacco.
The fact that the White House let Mr. Gore take the lead role in reacting to Ms. Reno's announcement suggested that Mr. Clinton is also eager to polish the image of his Vice President, whose integrity was questioned for the first time during this scandal.
In reacting to the Attorney General's announcement, Mr. Gore worked straight from Mr. Clinton's script. Beyond arguing that Republican critics were politically motivated, he declared that he and the President "will continue to focus on the priorities of the American people, as we have been doing." He pointed to the low unemployment rate and the balanced budget deal. And he went on to try to change the subject from campaign finance scandals to tightening campaign finance laws.
"The same people who are making the partisan attacks are the ones who are blocking campaign finance reform," he said.
For the last year, that approach has worked better for Mr. Clinton than for Mr. Gore, whose favorable ratings have slipped. In a CBS News Poll last month, 31 percent of respondents said they viewed the Vice President favorably, while 30 percent said they viewed him unfavorably. In the full glow of the inaugural festivities in January, those two numbers were 41 percent and 12 percent.
Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton has cruised along for a year with close to 60 percent of Americans saying they approve of the job he is doing.
It is that consistent public attitude that has persuaded the White House that Mr. Clinton, in the absence of an independent counsel, can withstand the political fallout from Congressional investigations and the press. It is also why they believe he can go about his fund-raising without fear. Indeed, even on the evening before Ms. Reno's announcement, the President attended two finance dinners at hotels here, raising $750,000 for Democrats.
"There is a direct chain of events between your support of our efforts and the things which happen in this country," Mr. Clinton assured one set of dining donors.

In the corporate world of France, with its cozy intertwined shareholdings and classically educated business elite, it took an outsider like Francois Pinault, a school dropout at age 16, to shake things up.
The local version of a corporate raider, Mr. Pinault has made his way as a capitalist without capital, a businessman who aggrandized himself with other people's money, borrowing and buying low and selling high to pay back his debts and still have plenty left over. 
 His knack for finding loopholes in French corporate law has prompted the Government to change the rules for shareholding and takeovers, and his fancy financial footwork has fostered a movement to protect minority shareholder rights. The corporate establishment has blocked his way several times, but his combination of sharp business elbows and deft political influence has made him come out the winner more often than not.
"When you build an empire, you step on toes, so everyone doesn't love you," said Anne Meaux, a close friend whose public relations firm represents Mr. Pinault and many other more traditional captains of French business and industry.
Indeed, Mr. Pinault, 62, has built an empire on both sides of the Atlantic. Those who buy Samsonite luggage, or wear Converse sneakers, or ski at Vail, Colo., or shop the huge Printemps department store here on the fashionable Boulevard Haussmann are all doing business with a holding company, Artemis, that Mr. Pinault controls.
Not satisfied, however, Mr. Pinault (pronounced PEA-no) is now trying to enter the lucrative business of financial services, with thus far unsuccessful bids for large French insurance and financial products companies. In September, for instance, Artemis made a $4.8 billion hostile bid for a venerable conglomerate, Worms & Cie., and the jewel in its crown, the Athena insurance group. Though Mr. Pinault pulled back, he is not one to give up looking for another prize. A successful bid would fulfill a "wish we have to be in financial services and products," said Patricia Barbizet, the managing director of Artemis, "where we feel a lot of restructuring is coming in France and in Europe."
With the European single currency just around the corner, major banks and insurance companies are already engaged in mergers and acquisitions designed to strengthen their positions for the rapid growth expected as the Continent's financial markets merge effectively into one.
For example, the big Allianz insurance group of Germany, No. 2 in Europe after the AXA-Union des Assurances de Paris, is in a fierce bidding war with Assicurazioni Generali of Italy to swallow up Assurances Generale de France.
In such upheaval, there is, of course, no guarantee that Mr. Pinault will get what he wants. His previous efforts to snare a major finance company, Banque Indosuez, and Navigation Mixte, a unit of the Paribas group, failed because of resistance by entrenched shareholders. His bid for Worms was quickly topped by one from the Agnelli clan of Italy together with Assurances Generale de France. Eventually, Mr. Pinault decided the offer was beyond the value of Worms, and withdrew.
It was one of the few times he has not gotten his way. Mr. Pinault started out by quitting school in Brittany to join his father in the family lumber business, which he ultimately inherited and built into a thriving producer of wood and furniture.
In the 1970's, the Government sought to save jobs by offering entrepreneurs like Mr. Pinault chances to acquire failing privately owned companies at fire sale prices, often as little as one franc. Mr. Pinault gradually amassed a fortune by buying up companies this way, then using Government aid to turn them around and sell them at a profit.
By the late 80's, he had graduated to bigger deals using someone else's francs. In 1987, for example, he plunked down $120 million in mostly borrowed money to acquire La Chapelle-d'Arblay, a foundering paper manufacturer based in Normandy, then reaped a profit of $90 million three years later when he sold it. Mr. Pinault is skilled at chopping companies down to their core businesses, lopping off unnecessary jobs and raising productivity by automating.
Along the way, he forged some lasting friendships and business relationships. In the 1970's, he promoted his business in the area around the southern city of Ussel, where a young politician named Jacques Chirac was building a career. Mr. Pinault has remained fast friends with Mr. Chirac, who is now the President of France. At the same time, he formed close ties with Credit Lyonnais, France's largest commercial bank, whose local branch in Brittany served from the start as Mr. Pinault's house bank.
Mr. Pinault has kept his roots in Brittany, where he and his wife, Maryvonne -- he has three children and she has one, all by their first spouses -- keep a sumptuous country home whose grounds are dotted with contemporary sculptures. They also have an apartment in Paris.
Mr. Pinault, who is uncomfortable with the press and declined to be interviewed for this article, has long been involved in distribution, to sell his companies' wood products and furnishings. His jump into the big league came in 1992, when he acquired Au Printemps, the department store group, in a transaction that exemplifies his aggressive style. After selling a hardware chain, Conforama, for $775 million to Printemps, Mr. Pinault used the proceeds to acquire 66 percent of Printemps. Two years later, he took control of France's largest mail-order house, La Redoute, and FNAC, a book and record store chain.
Alain Minc, a leading financial adviser, described the strategy as "a classical one: to go progressively from production to distribution."
"He never made an unsuccessful move," said Mr. Minc, one of an impressive list of advisers Mr. Pinault brought on board over the years to help him with his expansion.
As France moved out of recession of the early 1990's, and as the battered real estate market recovered, his acquisitions proved a gold mine. By selling unwanted units, he got the cash to repay the debt that had financed the buying spree. The latest to go was Prisunic, a down-market mix of five-and-dime stores and food markets that was sold this year. Last year, profits of the Pinault-Printemps Redoute group rose 36 percent, to $355 million, as sales increased 3.6 percent, to $13.8 billion.
For all that, Mr. Pinault's razzle-dazzle had made him the bete noire of French finance. In 1994, the Association for the Defense of Minority Shareholders took him to court over the way he sought to merge his Printemps chain with La Redoute, by offering Redoute stockholders shares in Printemps. It contended that Mr. Pinault stood to acquire roughly $1 billion in capital for heavily indebted Printemps, while the value of the junior investors' shares would be diluted. Two years earlier, the association had cried foul over the way Mr. Pinault acquired Printemps in the first place, by bidding for only 66 percent of its shares. Though the minority holders lost both court battles, they like to think they won the war: French laws were tightened to require investors to bid for all of a takeover target's stock.
Colette Neuville, founder and president of the association, acknowledges with irony that Mr. Pinault, by sniffing out loopholes, has fostered changes in legislation. "I always say," she said, "that the minority shareholders should raise a statue to Pinault." She concedes that Mr. Pinault has not acted outside the law, and his supporters accuse the junior shareholders of shortsightedness. "Five years ago, they complained," Mr. Minc said. "Now they're applauding."
Analysts, in any event, love Mr. Pinault's magic. With the French economy reviving, his stores will benefit from several years of heavy investment in computerization and improved logistics, said Michelle Wolff, an analyst at UBS Securities in Paris, whose recommendation for the group is a buy. "All the main subsidiaries are improving their margins," she said.
Even so, the minority shareholders group is again pursuing a trail that leads to Mr. Pinault. Last year, a furniture company called Dapta-Mallinjoud declared bankruptcy, leaving bearers of $43 million worth of bonds it issued three years earlier with worthless paper. The French authorities found that Dapta's problems began in 1992, when it paid $14 million to acquire three furniture companies -- from Mr. Pinault, through Printemps.
This time, the association is suing not Mr. Pinault, but KPMG, the French unit of the international accounting firm, which audited the numbers used in the bond prospectus. The largest of the three companies acquired from Mr. Pinault had a $19 million gap on its balance sheet and after the purchase was found in a Government report and a court ruling to have regularly overstated the value of its inventories. The suit contends that when Dapta issued its bonds, the discrepancy was already known to management, and that KPMG failed in its oversight duties by not preventing figures based on the false inventory amounts from being used in the prospectus.
Dapta says it was a victim in all this, and KPMG denies wrongdoing. Eventually, the Printemps group compensated Dapta for the $19 million gap. Commenting on the case recently in French newspapers, Serge Weinberg, chief executive of the group, admitted to a "failing in internal control" but attributed it to a "very decentralized structure."
The case is bogged down in a provincial court, and Ms. Neuville accuses Mr. Pinault of bringing his political power to bear. "Pinault is a friend of the President," she said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pinault's investment interest is turning increasingly abroad. Since 1990, the overseas share of Artemis's revenues has grown to about 40 percent, from virtually nothing, largely as a result of acquisitions in the United States.
In 1991, Credit Lyonnais was a partner with the Apollo investment fund of Leon Black, the aggressive former deal maker of Drexel Burnham Lambert, in acquiring at firesale prices, for almost $3 billion, the junk bond portfolio of the failed Executive Life Insurance Company of California. But when Credit Lyonnais learned that United States law does not permit banks to own operating companies acquired in a foreclosure, it sought a buyer.
Enter Mr. Pinault. After borrowing money from Credit Lyonnais, Mr. Pinault took a long shot, paying $1.9 billion for a package of the bonds that was subsequently exchanged for equity, including large chunks of almost two dozen United States companies, from Converse and Florsheim shoes to Samsonite and the ski resort at Vail. When stock prices took off, Mr. Pinault hit the jackpot. According to a recent Goldman, Sachs report, his American investments have yielded an average annual return since 1991 of 40 percent.
The cooperation with Credit Lyonnais has not been all roses. In 1992, the bank took a 25 percent stake in Artemis, and Mr. Pinault is locked in a legal battle over the value of those shares with the Government agency liquidating some of the troubled bank's assets. But he thrives on challenges, and he remains undeterred.
"He's never someone who stops," said Ms. Barbizet of Artemis. "He likes to build things, to create things. He's always moving on."

HEADLINE: CANADIANS EXPORT A TYPE OF REACTOR THEY CLOSED DOWN

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
On the blustery shore of Lake Ontario, in Canada's most heavily populated region, four aging nuclear reactors bedeviled by leaks, failures and operators who sometimes drank beer or smoked marijuana on the job are being shut down because they cannot be safely run by one of the largest utility companies in North America.
At the same time, workers are busy excavating a huge site in China, about 60 miles south of Shanghai, where two Canadian reactors similar to the troubled ones in Canada are being built under Canadian supervision. 
 The four reactors on Lake Ontario, along with three more farther north on the edge of Lake Huron, are being mothballed because their operator -- Ontario Hydro -- acknowledged last summer that it does not have the money or the proper management to run them safely.
The basic design of the Canadian reactors is unique. Although they are simpler than American-type reactors to build, experts now agree that they are far more complex to keep running safely. Maintaining the units has put enormous demands on Canadian operators with solid technical backgrounds and access to the latest equipment and designs.
However, for the last 40 years, the same type of Canadian-designed and built reactors has been sold to countries around the world, including Romania, India and Argentina, that have far less money or technical expertise than Canada and already are struggling to keep the reactors safe. And because the reactors are unlike any others, the number of qualified operators and knowledgeable inspectors is limited.
The closing of 7 of Ontario Hydro's 19 operating reactors has underscored the difficulties that Canada itself has had in keeping the reactors running safely. It has also raised questions about Canada's policy of aggressively exporting them to countries with limited experience in regulating -- and in some cases simply operating -- nuclear reactors.
Since the dawn of the nuclear age, Canada has determinedly tried to use the power of the atom to demonstrate Canadian technological know-how and economic independence. Even the name of the reactor -- Candu, for Canadian Deuterium Uranium -- was meant to suggest Canadian resourcefulness.
Since 1952, according to one estimate, Canada's nuclear industry has received more than $10 billion in Government subsidies. It sold 11 reactors overseas, including the 2 to China.
But Canada has repeatedly been scolded by its own citizens and other nations for selling reactors to authoritarian governments in Argentina, Pakistan and Romania. In 1974, India exploded a nuclear device it admitted had been made with plutonium from a reactor purchased from Canada.
Yet the Canadians continue to circle the globe trying to peddle the same reactors that have proved so difficult to manage in their own backyard. One of three bids opened by the Turkish Government in October came from Canada. And Canadian officials continue trying to sell more to Hungary, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, not to mention repeat sales to China, South Korea and Romania.
"All this has to do with a very deeply rooted historic question of technological prestige that has its roots in the nuclear weapons programs of the Second World War," said David H. Martin, research director for Nuclear Awareness Project, an environmental group in Ottawa. "Our nuclear research effort was a way to try to rearrange the world's picture of Canada."
The Government defends the program, saying that each export sale creates thousands of jobs at home. But critics charge that the Government's obsession with the reactor blinded it to the project's serious shortcomings.
Canada's nuclear program began in the early days of World War II. Supplies of heavy water -- in which hydrogen atoms have been replaced by deuterium for use in nuclear experiments -- were brought from Norway to Paris and then, when the Nazis occupied France, to England and later to Montreal.
Canada played a minor part in the Allied effort to build the first atomic bomb. But, intent on demonstrating its economic independence, the country set out to exploit its head start with heavy water.
A crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., was formed in 1952 to market the Canadian design. One of the strongest selling points was the Candu reactor's unique ability to be refueled while operating. This helped the reactors achieve industry-leading performance in their early years.
The reactor's reliance on heavy water also made it a formidable producer of plutonium, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. And the plutonium can be extracted without shutting down the unit, and thus in comparative secrecy.
The first exports were to India, which assured Canada that the reactors would be used only for peaceful purposes. But in 1974, India exploded its first nuclear device. Although Canada was not alone in selling nuclear technology, it received stinging rebukes from Western leaders for being naive about atomic power.
"Canada sinned in that area but the excuse always was that we sin because everybody else sins," said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto historian who wrote a history of Canada's nuclear efforts.
Offering favorable loans and sometimes questionable fees, Canada sold reactors to Argentina's military government, Pakistan and several of South Korea's rulers. Romania's dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, ordered five, but built only one.
The $3 billion deal with China last year ended a long period without sales, but there was little rejoicing in Canada. Environmental groups criticized the deal while human rights activists opposed doing any business with China.
But then Ontario Hydro's reports last summer about conditions at its reactors in Canada raised questions about the ability of other countries to maintain the complex units.
Officials with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a division of the United Nations headquartered in Vienna, said they had not received reports of serious safety problems at any of the Candu sites. They have scheduled a thorough inspection of Argentina's reactors for the coming months.
But most of the countries that have bought Candu reactors do not have independent nuclear regulators. Local reports suggest there have been mishaps with alarming regularity. The reactor in Argentina is regularly shut down to repair leaking pipes, and heavy water leaks at the reactor in South Korea have occurred so often that the operator, Korea Electric Power Corporation, has ordered plant workers to wear masks packed with ice to block fumes.
"What you see in Canada is something that could happen not only in countries that run into financial difficulties but even in countries that don't encounter such difficulties," said Zigmung Domaratzki, deputy director general for nuclear safety at International Atomic Energy Agency and former director general of reactor regulation at Canada's Atomic Energy Control Board. "It certainly raises questions."
An engineer with Ontario Hydro who spoke on condition of anonymity said running the utility's 20 Candu reactors turned out to far more complex than expected. In the 1980's, the four oldest reactors at the Pickering station on Lake Ontario had to be repaired at huge expense. There was a long list of spills, leaks, and non-functioning valves.
Attitudes slid as well. A job at Ontario Hydro came to be known by workers as "hide and seek for a thousand dollars a week," because they spent so much time goofing off. Operators who were diligent about maintenance and repairs became reluctant to report technical problems.
"The shift supervisor made me feel like I was doing something wrong," said an engineer who once tried to report a minor infraction. "He told me, 'That's another nail in our coffin.' "
In 1984, 6 Candu reactors were among the top 25 performers in the world, according to Nucleonics Weekly, a trade publication. In the latest performance survey last February, only 2 made the top 50 list.
That decline was noticed by the Atomic Energy Control Board, Canada's regulatory body. Citing a long list of problems, the board last year took the unusual step of renewing Hydro's nuclear license for only six months instead of two years.
Ontario Hydro executives heeded the warning. They ordered an extensive internal evaluation headed by an American nuclear expert, G. Carl Andognini.
The report, issued in August, included a terrifying list of mishaps and examples of sloppy management. The utility's nuclear plants were portrayed as dispirited places where rusting pipes were simply painted over and control room supervisors idled away their time playing computer games. Cigarette butts, empty beer bottles and marijuana were found in secure radiation areas.
"I don't think anybody understood the extent to which our management had sunk," Ontario Hydro's chairman, William Farlinger, said after the results were disclosed. He called the utility's nuclear unit, "some sort of special nuclear cult."
The board almost immediately approved a recovery plan to shut down 7 plants and spend around $8 billion improving the remaining 12. Mr. Farlinger insisted that the plants were safe. The problem was not with the reactors, he said, but the people who ran them.
But a section of the 15-volume study gives a different view.
"While no single observation or finding represents by itself a serious safety concern, the number and variety of the findings, when diagnosed from both a cumulative and an extent of condition perspective, may indicate some reduction of Ontario Hydro Nuclear's barriers that constitute the defense-in-depth approach to safe operation," the report said.
"What they're saying is that it may not be safe," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "With as many problems as they reported, I don't think you can say definitively that it is safe."
The seven reactors will be "laid up" indefinitely -- that is, they can be restarted someday, although that seems doubtful. But hedging in this way allows the utility to delay the brutal cost of decommissioning the plant, which is a good thing in Ontario Hydro's case.
The company has been adding fees to consumers' bills to cover the decommissioning. But the $2 billion clean-up fund is empty now because the company used the money to reduce its more than $30 billion debt.
 The article also referred incorrectly to the nuclear reactor used by India to produce material for an atomic explosion in 1974. The Indian reactor was a Canadian-made heavy water research reactor called Cirus, not the later Candu model.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 3 described safety concerns about Canadian-made nuclear power plants sold abroad. It included an estimate that Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., the manufacturer of a power plant type known as Candu, had received $10 billion in Canadian Government subsidies since 1952. The article should have pointed out that the estimate was made by an antinuclear group and that the company says it has received less than $4 billion.

HEADLINE: Long Island Economy Is Thriving, Economists Say

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Dec. 3

 BODY:
The Long Island economy is booming, with shoppers spending, builders building and businesses hiring, according to year-end reports by local economists.
"At long last, the Island's economy is now back to where it was in the heydays of the mid-1980's, with one major plus," Dr. Irwin L. Kellner, the former chief economist for Chase Manhattan's Regional Bank, told a group of business executives today at Hofstra University in Hempstead. "It's not a one-trick pony, dependent on only one industry, defense." 
 He said there has been an increase in tourism and financial services and growing diversity in areas like technology, biotechnology, telecommunications and filmmaking.
"I think we're in great shape here and safely out of the woods," said Dr. Kellner, who holds the August B. Weller Distinguished Chair of Economics at Hofstra.
Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group, was even more optimistic.
"Long Island's economic recovery has finally caught fire," Dr. Kamer said in her year-end regional review.
She said that Nassau and Suffolk Counties had 1,123,000 nonfarm jobs in September, up 22,500 from September 1996. The service industry alone added 9,800 jobs, she said.
And while an estimated 37,000 people have entered the labor force since May, there has been no increase in the unemployment rate because many of them were able to find jobs, she said in her report.
In his speech, Dr. Kellner noted Nassau County's 3.5 percent unemployment rate and Suffolk County's 4 percent rate. "A growing number of manufacturing jobs offered opportunities to many people who perhaps don't have a higher education but who have physical skills," he said.
"On the other hand, there are some continuing shortages of people for jobs such as programmers and computer operators, machinists and even accountants," he said.
Consumer spending, meanwhile, has led to a 5.5 percent increase over last year in sales tax revenues in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties, easing the pressure to increase property taxes, Dr. Kellner said.
"And when you consider that prices are up 2 percent, if that much, you're talking about real goods being moved off the shelves and out of warehouses to the tune of 3 to 4 percent over a year ago," he said.
Builders constructed more than 5,500 new residential units this year and could be expected to do the same next year, he said, even though there is little available space.
"There has been a sharp increase in the number of senior citizen assisted-living units being built here," he said. "We're on the cutting edge in this area, adding to the economy not only in terms of building, but in wages and other spinoff effects."
Because the area has an aging population, he said, "this is something that I think will provide at least a modest push to the Long Island economy."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN SOUTH KOREA: THE U.S. ROLE;
Washington to Directly Contribute $5 Billion, at the Low End of Expectations

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it would make as much as $5 billion available for the international bailout of South Korea, hoping to stabilize a country where the United States has considerable economic and security interests.
The direct financing would back up $35 billion being provided through three international institutions to which the United States is the largest contributor: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 
 The $5 billion commitment -- at the low end of what reports from South Korea had suggested Washington would contribute -- compares with $10 billion being offered for the South Korean package by Japan, and with the $3 billion in backup funds offered by the United States last month to Indonesia, whose economy is far smaller than South Korea's.
The offer reflected a strategy adopted two weeks ago by the United States and many big Asian nations of calling on the I.M.F. and other international organizations to take the lead in dealing with financially troubled nations, but encouraging other governments with a stake in the region to offer supplemental aid when needed.
"We have a vital national economic and security interest in helping Korea restore market stability as soon as possible," Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said.
The American aid will be made available through a special fund under the Treasury Department's control, and does not require any Congressional authorization. Administration officials said they kept Congressional leaders informed about the situation, and said there were no signs the plan would run into serious opposition from Republican leaders.
But some Democrats and Republicans expressed misgivings, and said that when Congress reconvened next month they would raise questions about the Administration's request for even more funds for the I.M.F.
"It's very bad policy," said Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, who has long argued that international bailouts put taxpayer money at risk and threaten the American economy by weakening the dollar and stimulating inflation, all to insulate banks and other investors from losses. "With the exception of some bankers from Houston, I never hear from anyone who wants to sacrifice taxpayer dollars to go over there to bail someone out," Mr. Paul said today.
Democratic critics want to tie international bailouts and other financial aid to human rights issues and improved conditions for workers.
Administration officials defended both the I.M.F. package with South Korea and the American backup fund as effective ways to impose sweeping changes on the South Korean financial and economic systems. And they said that the last such American financing package -- a key element in the bailout of Mexico three years ago -- was fully repaid, with interest, helping close off the crisis there.
Officials said the United States agreed to provide additional financing only after determining that the I.M.F. package was tough enough on the Koreans to restore market confidence in their economy while reassuring American taxpayers that the Treasury Department was not throwing good money after bad.
A senior Treasury official said today that American aid would be released to South Korea only to fill any gaps in that country's financing needs between the release of I.M.F. installments. The American money would be provided for 60-day periods, with the possibility of extensions if needed. And it would be released only if Seoul continues to meet all the requirements of the I.M.F. program and if the Treasury Department thinks it will be repaid.
The money would come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a $40 billion pool administered by the Treasury Department and used at the discretion of the President. It was set up in the 1930'ss to give the Government ammunition to defend the dollar's value. It has been used increasingly, though, in maintaining the stability of global markets by helping beleaguered nations restore confidence in their currencies.
There have been periodic attempts by Congress to restrict the stabilization fund. Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, is currently pushing for legislation that would require that any disbursement of more than $250 million receive Congressional approval.
Mr. Faircloth said he would demand that the Administration accept such a restriction in return for Congressional approval of Mr. Clinton's request for $3.5 billion to bolster the I.M.F.'s finances. The Administration's request for that money was blocked last month by anti-abortion Republicans, who demanded restrictions on American support for international family planning programs in return for new I.M.F. support.
"I believe Robert Rubin needs to stop using the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a personal piggy bank for international bailouts," Mr. Faircloth said.
But Administration officials said that the problems in South Korea could impress on members of Congress the need to strengthen the I.M.F. The Administration won support on that today from four senior Republicans on the House Banking Committee, including the chairman, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa.
They sent a letter to Republican leaders urging them to support the additional funds for the I.M.F. and also for the United Nations, saying that the ability to halt global financial crises was in America's interest.
"With the financial future of Asia uncertain and the possibility of a full bailout of South Korea looming, a depleted I.M.F. may not be able to respond to a currency crisis that could have grave consequences in the United States," said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, the author of the letter.

HEADLINE: U.N. Troops to Leave Haiti As Feeble as They Found It

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 3

 BODY:
When 20,000 American troops landed here in September 1994 to restore the elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power after three years of military dictatorship, they were greeted rapturously. To the average Haitian, the arrival of soldiers and a phalanx of donors promising aid seemed to signal the dawn of a new era of political stability and economic growth.
But now the United Nations mandate that made the intervention possible has been allowed to expire, a casualty of international exasperation with a lack of progress here. And when the 1,400 Canadian and Pakistani peacekeepers who are the last remnants of that military force begin withdrawing from Haiti on Thursday, they will be leaving behind a country nearly as poor, prostrate and paralyzed as when they stepped in to help. 
 For six months, ever since Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned, bitterly declaring that "in this country, power is a disease," Haiti has been without a functioning government.
One attempt to name his successor quickly fell victim to the dispute between factions of the Lavalas coalition that originally supported Mr. Aristide, and a second is now stalled in Parliament with no date set to begin discussing the nomination, much less vote on it.
Because of the political impasse, no budget can be passed, the decay of road, telephone, electricity and water systems is accelerating and more than $1 billion in foreign assistance remains unspent.
As a result, more than half the working population is estimated to be without jobs, the cost of living is rising precipitously and frustration with President Rene Preval and his caretaker Cabinet is growing among the populace and international aid donors.
"There isn't a functioning state right now, and the country cannot wait for one to appear or be built up," Enrique ter Horst, the departing director of the United Nations mission, warned in an interview here today. Haiti also runs the risk, he added, that the international community might "become despondent when the patient clearly has not left the intensive-care ward."
Many Haitians fear that without a foreign military and diplomatic presence to referee internal disputes, the situation can only grow worse.
One manifestation of the crisis particularly alarming to the United States was the interception just off Miami on Nov. 20 of a rickety fishing boat with 417 Haitians on board. Thousands of such "boat people" tried to flee to Florida in 1993 and 1994, at the height of the military repression here, but the group returned by the Coast Guard last month was the largest in two years.
Elected with a resounding majority in December 1990, Mr. Aristide, a populist former priest and spellbinding orator, took office in February 1991, but was overthrown in a coup seven months later. He spent the next three years in exile, as the United States sought to negotiate his return amid mounting violence. But Washington's patience eventually ran out, and President Clinton, in what was hailed as one of the major foreign policy triumphs of his first term, elected to use force to restore him to office.
With the Clinton Administration's prestige still very much at stake here, American policy makers have generally expressed optimism in their public statements about the direction of events, pointing to slow but steady progress in what they call "nation building."
But in a new essay titled "Haiti: Will Things Fall Apart?," Donald E. Schulz, an analyst of Haitian affairs at the United States Army War College, strikes a cautionary tone. "National unity has dissipated" in recent months and the country is "slowly drifting toward chaos," he says.
Foreign officials here, however, continue to maintain there is no cause for panic. "The international community is not abandoning Haiti," Brig. Gen. Robin Gagnon, the Canadian commander of the United Nations troops, said in an interview here just hours before his departure. "There is no more role for the military to play, but we will continue to provide resources."
The backbone of that diminished presence is a 300 member multinational police force that will continue to work with the two-year-old Haitian National Police, widely criticized for incompetence and corruption. But that mandate is scheduled to expire in a year, when Haiti must again hold congressional and mayoral elections, and their ability to shape events here now is clearly more limited than in the past.
Furthermore, nearly half that police presence is to consist of a primarily Argentine "self-defense unit" whose main function, as one foreign official here delicately put it, is to "extricate" the rest of the United Nations force should Haiti once again descend into violence. The team was created, diplomats here said, at the insistence of the same countries that claim the Haitian National Police is now capable of maintaining public order here.
For its part, the United States will continue to maintain a 500-member military "support group" for the foreseeable future. Ostensibly, the unit is here to build roads, bridges and the like, but as one diplomat here put it, its presence is also Washington's way of "sending a signal to any potential troublemaker that 'we are interested and hands off.' "
With the United Nations already having one foot out the door, the political squabbling took an even nastier turn last month with the arrest by the Haitian National Police of Leon Jeune, who served as head of the interim police force after Mr. Aristide was restored to power in 1994. Mr. Jeune, 61, later had a falling out with Mr. Aristide and in 1995 ran for President against his handpicked candidate, Mr. Preval.
Mr. Jeune's wife has complained that the Haitian police SWAT team that made the arrest beat her husband and would have killed him had a United Nations police adviser not intervened. Though a judge ordered Mr. Jeune's release on Nov. 27, he was still being held today.
The Jeune case indicates "there is a macabre plan being formulated by forces within the Lavalas movement that do not support democracy," said Pierre-Paul Marsan, a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
Robert Manuel, Secretary of State for Public Security, denied that Mr. Jeune had been mistreated and attributed his arrest to involvement in a conspiracy to destabilize the state and overthrow Mr. Preval.
"We are living in a moment when many demons have been set loose," Mr. Manuel said, warning of "plots that have both a national and international dimension" and involve "all sorts of old interests who are against democracy."
United Nations officials were openly skeptical of that scenario. "From our intelligence network, there was no indication whatsoever of a plot being prepared," General Gagnon said. "Either we were blind, or it was nothing, and since we have a good network, I do not believe we were blind."

HEADLINE: In a Stakeout, Police Capture A Rape Suspect

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Bronx detectives called him the Cardboard Man, a rapist who struck at least 10 times in the last two years, always placing a piece of cardboard on the ground before assaulting his victims. The attacks struck fear into several Bronx neighborhoods, but the suspect always eluded capture.
On Tuesday night, however, two police officers from the 46th Precinct were staking out a small park at Mosholu Parkway and Gun Hill Road -- where the rapist had struck three weeks ago -- when they spotted a man who matched the description of the suspect and watched him sit down near a piece of cardboard. 
 "We observed him walking into the park with a bag," Officer Adam Sager, 27, said yesterday. "We saw him sitting in a dark and secluded spot, which was consistent with the areas where he had struck before."
Officer Sager and his partner, Officer Alex Golematis, 33, who have been working on the case for 10 months, took the man into custody for questioning. There, the police said, the man, Andres Martinez, 56, confessed to several rapes and revealed the contents of his bag: his trademark mask, a black curly wig and a knife.
He was charged yesterday with six counts of rape, two counts of attempted rape and five counts of sodomy, as well as robbery, assault and weapons possession, the police said.
Mr. Martinez's victims ranged in age from 12 to 48, the police said, and he struck mostly in the Morris Heights and Mount Eden neighborhoods. On at least two occasions, he committed rapes within a block of his home, at 1419 Jessup Avenue, the police said. Mr. Martinez, a married man with children, is unemployed. He is also wanted for questioning by the Massachusetts authorities, who are investigating a half-dozen crimes in Holyoke, Mass., dating from 1983.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds Wages Still Contained

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Even as more employers are driven to extraordinary lengths to find qualified people to fill jobs, the bulk of the American work force is still not winning sizable wage increases, a Federal Reserve survey showed today.
As a result, inflationary pressures remain largely in check, a situation buttressed by financial disruption in Asia that is curbing demand for this country's products while spurring imports of cheaper foreign goods. 
 This double-barreled force for containing prices, and its implications for slower growth, was seen by analysts as further reducing the possibility that the inflation-wary Fed would need to raise interest rates.
"Tight labor markets but still no sign of a breakout in inflation," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, of today's report covering developments through Nov. 24. "And, already, there were some reports of slower orders from Asia."
In a survey of conditions prepared by its 12 district banks for a Dec. 16 policy meeting, the Fed found "a continued moderate pace of economic growth" but with activity restrained by labor shortages, rail bottlenecks and weaker export markets.
Other concessions to employees in the tight labor market include bonuses, discounts, flexibility on hours and workplace rules and the conversion of part-time jobs to full time.
The survey also found that business travel and tourism continued to boom along the East Coast, with Boston and New York reporting a shortage of hotel rooms and rising rates, especially in Manhattan. The survey found that commercial landlords had greater leverage to raise rents.
Central Ohio had an especially severe shortage of seasonal workers but the Cleveland Fed also cited a falloff in Asian orders for equipment to manufacture semiconductors.
Banks in various districts reported a surge of mortgage refinancing, with rates of consumer delinquency "little changed, on balance."
In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell unexpectedly by 1.7 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 797,000, down from September's revised rate of 811,000. The department originally estimated the September sales rate at 800,000. Though the declines were widespread, it still left home sales at relatively high levels.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Business as Usual, With a Few Distant Clouds"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- The economy remained robust, with retailers citing high demand and gas and oil develop-ment at a decade-high level.
 
Chicago -- Winter's arrival brought an increase in retail sales. Labor markets were tight. Low mortgage rates encouraged construction.
 
Cleveland -- As the economy continued to expand, construction remained active. The labor market tightened further,
 
Boston -- Although sales and revenue remained healthy, retailers and manu-facturers predicted a slowdown,
 
New York -- With the economy rolling at a steady rate, prices, wages and retail activity all increased moderately.
 
Philadelphia -- Manufacturing, retail sales and general economic conditions improved modestly in November.
 
Richmond -- After a September lull, manufacturing, retail sales and prices all reported continued growth. Manufacturing continued to expand at a healthy pace.
 
Atlanta -- Moderate expansion continued in retail, while manufacturing, construction and home sales stood pat.
 
St. Louis -- Growth in sales and employment helped the economy expand at a moderate pace. Tight labor markets persisted.
 
Kansas City -- Moderate growth continued in most economic sectors, although energy activity slowed. The job market remained tight.
 
Dallas -- Economic expansion slowed slightly, starting in late October. Although mostly sanguine, some surveyed had concerns about future demand from Asia.
 
San Francisco -- Economic development accelerated further. Technology companies reported operations at or near capacity, and service providers reported growth at a rapid pace.

HEADLINE: The South Korean Bailout

 BODY:
With South Korea's plummeting currency and rising bankruptcies threatening to spread financial turmoil to Japan, Russia and beyond, Washington wisely added up to $5 billion of its own to yesterday's international bailout of Korea. The $55 billion package, put together by the International Monetary Fund, is large enough to stanch further contagion and presumably comes with strict conditions calculated to keep South Korea out of trouble.
Unfortunately, the details of the deal are secret, and may remain so at the discretion of the Koreans. The secrecy has already bred suspicion that the monetary fund has cracked down needlessly hard. Some initial reports, for instance, suggest that it has forced South Korea to cut its projected growth rate in half, as if slow growth were itself a virtue. More likely, the fund recognized that interest rates have to rise in Korea to stop the widespread flight from its currency. Higher rates, in turn, discourage investment and slow the economy. The fund probably insisted that Korea let these necessary corrections run their course. 
 The monetary fund would be mistaken to push down much harder. Unlike Thailand earlier this year and Mexico in 1995, South Korea is not running large fiscal deficits or trade imbalances. It does not have to rein in reckless policies. South Korea's problem is almost entirely in its private sector, specifically banks that have borrowed abroad to make loans, under political pressure, to government-coddled conglomerates. The system has unraveled as financial turmoil in other parts of Asia has cut purchases of Korea's exports. As the export-dependent and heavily indebted conglomerates stumbled, depositors and foreign lenders became alarmed and withdrew their money. Even good banks have been forced to dump assets in a desperate attempt to pay off frightened depositors and foreign creditors. Korea is suffering a self-fueling crisis of confidence that threatens to bury its banks and their customers.
After prolonged negotiations, the monetary fund got South Korea to agree to close insolvent banks and, like America in the 1980's, use public money to help solvent banks get through this difficult period. The longer-term answer is to free Korean companies to seek loans from abroad and, even better, equity from foreign shareholders. That way financial calculation can replace cronyism.
It is hard to justify the tradition of secrecy in monetary fund bailouts when tens of billions of dollars are involved, all of it raised in one way or another from taxpayers in America and other nations. The potential embarrassment to South Korea of disclosing the terms of this package is easily outweighed by the need to know what the fund has extracted for its investment. If the terms are tough but reasonable, South Korea, with a well-trained work force and robust rates of saving and investment, should soon return to rapid growth.

HEADLINE: Mr. Gore's Mission in Kyoto

 BODY:
It may require a near-miracle for the 150-plus nations now meeting in Kyoto, Japan, to produce, in six days, a comprehensive treaty on global warming. The issue is complex, the disagreements wide. But anyone who has taken the trouble to cut through the diplomatic posturing knows there is room for compromise. At the very least, the negotiators can produce a broad memorandum of understanding that kicks the process forward and provides a firm basis for detailed negotiations.
Failure to do so would be costly. If the world is shown to be incapable of a collective response to a collective problem, whatever sense of urgency the general public has about climate change could evaporate. Failure would also slow the search for technologies that could reduce the world's dependence on coal and other fossil fuels that contribute to the rise in atmospheric temperatures. 
 Fear of failure is essentially what drove President Clinton to send Al Gore to Kyoto next week. The Vice President's ostensible mission is to prevent the American position from being shouted down by the Europeans, who think it is too weak. Yet there are some countries, oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and coal-dependent nations like Australia, that want no agreement. Mr. Gore's real mission is to lure both sides to a workable middle ground. That will mean adjustments in everyone's position on two highly contentious issues.
Targets and Timetables. Mr. Clinton wants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels somewhere between 2008 and 2012, and cut them by unspecified amounts thereafter. The Europeans want to cut emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010, a goal Mr. Clinton regards as incompatible with economic growth. But surely there is room for compromise here, either by picking an arithmetic middle ground, or -- instead of insisting on a one-size-fits-all formula -- by setting different targets for different countries, tailored to their economic and social profiles.
Developing Countries. The developing countries argue that they need more time to grow and cannot be forced to cut their fossil-fuel emissions. The United States Senate, however, has told Mr. Clinton it will not ratify a treaty that does not include developing countries, and nearly everyone agrees that unless these countries sign on at some point, any agreement will be worthless. The answer here could be to require the developing countries to sign the treaty but allow them to negotiate timetables and targets down the road. Another answer could lie in a novel proposal, offered by the Americans, under which rich countries would subsidize cleaner technologies in poorer countries.
Kyoto may yet produce a treaty. But even if it does not, it will not have been a failure if it moves everyone to common ground.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Cheap imports may hurt labor, but avoid a world recession.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH the cold war over, President Clinton has often explained, the fundamental challenges to the only remaining superpower have become economic rather than military.
This economics-as-war metaphor falsely implies natural conflict -- that their gain is our loss. And it is prone to be misinterpreted as justifying trade protectionism, that trade surpluses are good, while trade deficits are bad. 
 Yet, in the end, Mr. Clinton may be proved right. With the financial crisis gripping Asia and Europe sitting on the sidelines, America's global leadership is indeed being tested. But the challenge to the White House is to turn conventional economic nationalism on its head. To save the world from a serious recession, Washington will have to accept large and rapidly growing trade deficits for the next few years.
Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines -- and this week, South Korea -- are committed to financial reforms in return for a $100 billion-plus bailout led by the International Monetary Fund. But this money is no gift: it will take the form of loans that must be repaid with interest at market rates.
How will these economies meet their debt payments? And how will they sell the torrent of goods they must produce to rekindle economic growth?
They can't look to demand at home. Governments won't be buying much: the I.M.F. loans require fiscal austerity. Nor will businesses: besieged banks will be under orders to lend only to the most creditworthy. Nor consumers: with corporate downsizing the order of the day, workers will be in no mood to buy new cars and appliances.
China can't help. While the Chinese economy is an important customer for South Korea, Beijing is in no mood to increase imports. Indeed, the real worry is that China will react to slowing demand for its own goods abroad by devaluing the yuan -- and in the process increase the deflationary pressure on other low-wage Asian economies.
And if China can't help, Japan won't. With the Japanese banking system in shambles and the economy already of the verge of recession, imports from the rest of Asia are likely to fall. Fiscal stimulus -- tax cuts or spending increases -- might stem the decline. But Tokyo is committed to cutting, not increasing, its budget deficit. And "if you're a pessimist like me," said Rudi Dornbusch, an economist at M.I.T., "you'd expect them to raise taxes to pay for the bailout of their banks."
Far from being part of the solution, Japan is well on the way to becoming part of the problem. The depreciating yen -- now 60 percent below the 1995 peak against the dollar -- will make Japanese exports less expensive, crowding out sales from high-wage Asian economies including South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
What about the European Community? The major European economies are clipping right along, and might be expected to suck in part of the Asian surplus as they grow. But Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, argues that on the eve of adopting a common currency, Europe is unlikely to carry its weight in the Asian rescue.
To qualify for monetary union, he notes, all the Continental economies are hewing to tight budgets. And once monetary union is achieved, the new European central bank will probably keep an extra-tight rein on the common money supply to prove its credibility.
In fact, if economic growth falters, the Europeans will not be averse to their own currency depreciation, which would help exporters and take the pressure off industries that must compete with imports. "Depreciation would square the circle" for a newly formed monetary union lacking other means to stimulate domestic demand, Mr. Eichengreen concludes.
That leaves America, which, in theory, is well positioned to serve as the locomotive of global expansion. The Federal Reserve would undoubtedly welcome a gain in the exchange rate of the dollar and an accompanying $50 billion to $100 billion surge in cheap, high-quality Asian imports that reduced inflationary pressures on the fast-revving domestic economy.
But it wouldn't please organized labor, which senses that the time may have finally arrived to demand higher wages. And it wouldn't please Detroit, which is squeezed between an increasingly restive union and vast overcapacity in the global auto industry.
The big question, then, is whether Washington can temper its inclination to protect labor and business from the fallout from Asia. If it doesn't, Asia's problems could spread to Latin America and Eastern Europe -- and, arguably, the rest of the world. "This deflation thing could be big, if it really gets going," Mr. Dornbusch said.

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Lead Stocks Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
A recovery in technology issues led a late rally in stocks yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from a 56-point drop to close higher for the fourth consecutive session. The Dow gained 13.18 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 8,032.01. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.09, or a half of 1 percent, to 976.77, less than 7 points from its Oct. 7 closing high. Western Atlas, which does seismic surveys, was the top gainer, rising 4 1/8, or 6 percent, to 71 1/2. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, filled with computer shares, rose 8.76, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,615.13. The index recovered from a 15-point loss prompted by 3Com Corporation's warning late Tuesday that profits would be disappointing because of slower sales in Asia.
While 3Com fell 3/8 yesterday, to 34 15/16, other networkers, including Cisco Systems and Bay Networks, turned losses into gains by the end of the day. Cisco rose 13/32, to 86 29/32, and Bay Networks rose 1 3/16, to 28 15/16. National Semiconductor, a 3Com supplier, dropped 1 5/8, to 30 11/16.
Treasury prices were also higher, after comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and a Fed report reinforced expectations that interest rates would remain steady.
In speeches Tuesday night and yesterday, Mr. Greenspan focused on Asia's financial turmoil and made little mention of the United States economy. That persuaded investors that the central bank was not poised to increase the cost of borrowing to curb inflation, now running at the slowest pace in 10 years.
"It's not anything that Greenspan said last night -- it's what he didn't say," said Patrick Dimick, a bond analyst at UBS Securities. "There was some relief that his speech was so nonthreatening to the Treasury market."
Further, the Fed reported yesterday in its periodic survey of business conditions, known as the beige book, that Asia's economic woes were starting to slow United States exports.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, to 101 18/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.03 percent.
Among individual stocks yesterday, those of telephone companies surged, including AT&T, up 13/16, to 57 1/8, and regional carriers BellSouth, up 2 7/8, to 56 13/16, Ameritech, up 3, to 80 1/16, and Bell Atlantic, up 13/16, to 89 1/2.
AT&T rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that the telecommunications giant's new chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong, will sell assets and discontinue operations to prepare the company for competition in the long-distance market. The article also said Mr. Armstrong was interested in renewing merger talks with SBC Communications. SBC rose 2 1/2, to 74 15/16.
H. J. Heinz rose 2 5/8, to 55 1/4, after the ketchup and cat food company said Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, chief executive since 1979, would resign. He will be replaced by William Johnson, president and heir apparent, effective April 30.
The BB&T Corporation rose 8 15/16, to 65, a record. The bank, based in Salem, N.C., was scheduled to be added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index after the close of trading. Money managers who track the index's performance are buying the stock.
The CBS Corporation lost 1 3/4, to 30 1/8, after its rating was cut to "neutral" from "outperform" by a Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company analyst Frank Bodenchak.
While an admirer of CBS, which owns the CBS network and changed its name from Westinghouse Electric on Monday, Mr. Bodenchak said he regarded the stock as too expensive.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Japan Grew 0.8% in Quarter, Suggesting a Flat '97 Economy

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In the latest indication Japan is edging toward full recession, the Government said Wednesday that economic growth totaled less than 1 percent for the third quarter and that the economy would have trouble growing more than 1 percent for the year.
The figures released by the Economic Planning Agency were far weaker than expected. They also showed that the Japanese economy, the world's second largest, had begun to feel direct pain in the third quarter from the financial crisis afflicting much of Asia, with plunging currency values and rising debts causing imports from Japan to fall. 
 The Economic Planning Agency said that the gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of goods and services, increased eight-tenths of 1 percent in the three-month period ending on Sept. 30, compared with the previous three months.
While higher private consumption and capital spending contributed to the slight growth in the quarter, housing and public spending remained weak, underscoring rising public uncertainty over the economy.
The trade surplus fell for the first time in 11 quarters due to weak demand from Southeast Asia.
"The feeling that I have at this moment is that it will be pretty difficult for growth to reach 1 percent or more for the fiscal year," Shimpei Nukaya, Vice Minister of the Economic Planning Agency, said at a news conference. The Government had predicted that the economy would grow by 1.9 percent for 1997.
Many economists had forecast 1.3 percent growth for the quarter and saw Wednesday's figures as a harbinger of a recession in the coming year unless the Government acted quickly to invigorate the economy.
"If the Government does not take new fiscal measures to shore up the economy, there will be serious ramifications," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers here.
The weak third-quarter data followed an alarming second-quarter decline of 11.2 percent on an annual basis, attributed mainly to the effects of a sharp increase in the sales tax that took effect on April 1. That was the largest contraction since the sharp rise in oil prices in 1973-74.
Many economists said they now predicted no growth for the year.
The economic figures represented just the latest blow for Japan, which has been struggling with a frail banking system burdened by bad real estate loans, rising unemployment, an anemic stock market and fear about the fallout from economic crises in much of Asia.
The uncertainty over Japan's economy contributed to another plunge in Tokyo stocks. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 324.78 points, or 1.92 percent, on Wednesday, closing at 16,585.51. In early trading this morning, the Nikkei was down modestly. dropping 84.71 points, or one-half of 1 percent, to 16,500.80.
The Japanese yen eased against the dollar on Wednesday, settling in New York at 128.78, compared with 128.64 late Tuesday. Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.7720 from 1.7782 on Tuesday.
Economists have called on Japan to undertake expansion policies like income-and corporate-tax cuts and works projects, but they acknowledge that such steps will be hard under fiscal austerity measures adopted by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto with a view toward modernizing the securities markets.

Record $55 Billion Bailout Set for South Korea
After days of tense negotiations, South Korea formally agreed to stringent terms for an unprecedented economic rescue that will extend $55 billion in loans to the world's 11th largest economy, hobbled by unpaid debts. Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary, the leader of the bailout, called the plan "a strong economic program that provides for a decisive and welcome response to the country's present financial difficulties."
But the bailout is likely to result in severe cuts in public spending and other austerity moves that could triple the unemployment rate, cause a surge in bankruptcies and create other hardships on South Koreans. Page A1. 

The Clinton Administration will make up to $5 billion available for the bailout but the bulk of the package will be provided through the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. D6.
 
Asia aid packages, already totaling nearly $100 billion, are prompting many economists and investment bankers to argue anew that bailouts, even when they accomplish their goals, set a bad precedent. By making lenders whole, critics say, such rescues merely encourage more careless lending and fresh crises. News Analysis. D6.
 
Few Workers Win Big Wage Gains
The bulk of the American work force is still not winning sizable wage increases, a Federal Reserve survey shows, even as employers are driven to extraordinary lengths to find qualified hires. As a result, inflationary pressures remain largely in check and further reduce the possibility that the Fed will raise interest rates at its Dec. 16 policymaking meeting, economists said. D3.
 
Trucks Gaining on Cars
American families bought more sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups than cars last month, the first time these so-called light trucks have surpassed cars in retail sales since the end of World War II. D4.

Auto makers enjoyed a 3.8 percent gain in sales in November, industry figures show. Strong demand for trucks propelled the sales. Auto makers offered generous rebates and discounted finance rates in November. D4.
 
Stocks Rise on Technology Rally
A recovery in technology stocks led a late rally, propelling the Nasdaq composite index up 8.76 points to 1,615.13. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its fourth straight gain, 13.18 points to 8,032.01. D19.
 
Full Recession Feared in Japan
Japan's economy grew less than expected in the third quarter after a sharp drop in the second quarter, the Japanese Government said in a report that suggested the world's second largest economy may be headed for a full recession. The main weaknesses were sluggish consumer spending and diminished exports due to lowered demand from the troubled economies of Southeast Asia. D9.
 
Canadians to Buy Sears Tower
Trizec Hahn, a rapidly growing Canadian real estate company, is acquiring effective control of the 110-story Sears Tower, North America's tallest skyscraper, for $70 million and assuming a $734 million mortgage. It is also paying $40 million for full ownership of an adjacent 1,100-car garage, a site for potential future development. D2.
 
Union Pacific's Claims Questioned
Union Pacific's assertions that it has unclogged the congestion choking rail shipments across the western United States were met with skepticism from the head of the Surface Transportation Board, Linda Morgan, who cited users' comments. The regulatory agency is expected to decide today whether to extend an order requiring Union Pacific to cooperate with competitors in Texas. D4.
 
Copper Futures at 4-Year Low
Copper prices tumbled as weak demand from Asia and rising output pushed stockpiles close to 20-month highs. Copper for March delivery fell 1.55 cents, to 81.85 cents a pound, the lowest since Jan. 12, 1994. D9.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN SOUTH KOREA: THE BAILOUT;
PACKAGE OF LOANS WORTH $55 BILLION IS SET FOR KOREA

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 3

 BODY:
South Korea formally agreed today to terms for the largest international economic rescue ever -- a $55 billion loan package that will revamp the country's financial system, likely creating substantial hardship for the nation's citizens in the process and slowing the pace of one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
Government officials and private analysts predicted that the severe cuts in public spending and other austerity moves would cause unemployment to double or even triple in a land where lifetime employment has long been taken for granted. Bankruptcies, already running at a high rate, are expected to skyrocket. Some economists said it would be two years or more before the economy recovered. 
 "I have come here to beg the forgiveness of the Korean people," Lim Chang Yuel, the Minister of Finance and Economy, said in a nationally televised speech tonight. "Please understand the necessity of the economic pain we must bear and overcome."
 The battered South Korean stock market surged 6 percent by midday Thursday in reaction to the bailout package, signaling investor optimism that it would succeed.
The agreement came about after several days of tense negotiations in which the reluctance of the Korean Government to swallow both its pride and some distasteful economic medicine seemed to draw out the discussions. Under the terms of the deal, the International Monetary Fund, the leader of the bailout, will provide South Korea with $21 billion in credits. The World Bank promised to provide $10 billion and the Asian Development Bank $4 billion.
The United States and several other nations agreed to provide $20 billion more as a "second line of defense" if the initial money from the international organizations proves insufficient. Some $5 billion will come from the United States, $10 billion from Japan and the rest from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and possibly other nations.
The money will initially be used to help shore up South Korea's nearly depleted foreign currency reserves. That should help stanch the rapid devaluation of the Korean won and allow the nation to pay off foreign debt. Some $66 billion is due within a year, and about $20 billion of that is due by the end of this year.
The money will also be used to help restore the health of the financial system, which has been weakened by haphazard lending to the country's supercorporations, huge industrial conglomerates that were nurtured by the Government as the engine for the country's remarkable growth.
In return for the money, Seoul must cut public spending, open its market more to foreign goods and investors and curb the ability of the conglomerates to expand.
For a nation that grew from an impoverished backwater to the world's 11th-largest economy, it marked the humbling end of the economic miracle and the beginning of a period of what President Kim Young Sam has described as "bone-carving pain." It was only last year that South Korea proudly joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of advanced nations.
Michel Camdessus (pronounced Cam-da-SOO), the managing director of the I.M.F., who arrived here this morning to complete the deal, called it "a strong economic program that provides for a decisive and welcome response to the country's present financial difficulties."
South Korea is the latest and largest "Asian tiger" to fall victim this year to sharp devaluations of its currency and soaring debts. The amount of money available to Korea is larger than the $17 billion offered to Thailand, the nearly $40 billion promised to Indonesia in recent months and the $48 billion offered to Mexico three years ago. Mr. Camdessus said he hoped the loans to South Korea would help stabilize the region.
The Clinton Administration applauded the plan for one of its key Asian allies. "We have a vital national economic and security interest in helping Korea to restore market stability as soon as possible," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a statement. The United States, the largest shareholder in the I.M.F., played a big role in pushing Seoul to adopt stern reforms.
Under terms of the bailout, the South Korean Government agreed to stop pressuring banks to make loans to troubled or politically connected companies.
South Korea also agreed to take steps to attract more foreign investment, including allowing companies to raise money abroad through debt issues. American officials also said they were hopeful that United States and other foreign banks would acquire South Korean banks.
Among the other elements of the proposal is a requirement that South Korea drop some of its trade barriers and that the Government press for legislation making the central bank independent of Government control.
"The program's policy commitments will bring about very substantial changes in the Korean financial sector, which in turn has the potential to open up the Korean economy," another Treasury official said.
The $5 billion United States contribution will come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a pool of money that the President can use at his discretion to maintain stability in currency markets. Use of the fund does not require approval by Congress, where there is some resistance to international bailouts.
The package still needs formal approval by the I.M.F. executive board, which is expected as early as Thursday. Until then, full terms of the agreement were not being released.
Because South Korea will hold elections on Dec. 18 and Mr. Kim is constitutionally barred from running again, Mr. Camdessus took the unusual step of seeking pledges from South Korea's three presidential candidates that they would honor the agreement. The candidates gave their promises, some reluctantly.
The Korean stock market, after plunging early in the day, rallied at the end of trading to close up 0.65 percent, ending nine days of consecutive decline.
The rally was fueled by reports that the I.M.F. agreement would raise the percentage of a Korean company's stock that could be owned by foreigners to 50 percent from 26 percent immediately and to 55 percent next year. That portends an influx of foreign money into the stock market.
With the new austerity program, many economists predict unemployment, now at 2.5 percent, will double or even triple as huge layoffs mark a nation in which lifetime employment is considered a right.
Lee Jeong Ja, head of research for the Seoul branch of HSBC James Capel, a securities firm, said she would not be surprised to see as many as one-fourth of the more than 700 companies listed on Korea's stock exchange go bankrupt. She said the economic downturn would last two years, but other analysts said it would be longer.
"I would say we're not going to see any return to growth over 5 percent for the next few years," said Eugene Ha, head of research at J. Henry Schroder in Seoul. South Korea is expected to grow about 6 percent this year, but the target for next year under the plan is about half that.
In addition to bemoaning the pain, there was also some anger here that the nation had surrendered control of its economy.
"With the complete opening of Korea's financial market, foreign capital will virtually be in control of the profits and management of Korean companies," an announcer on the state-owned Korean Broadcasting System said tonight. He also warned, "U.S. automobiles and Japanese products are expected to pour into Korea."
But any long-term gains for the United States and other nations from market openings in the package will be at least partly offset by South Korea's economic slowdown, which will cut its imports. Many civic groups are starting frugality campaigns, urging consumers to help save the economy by not buying foreign products because they contribute to the nation's trade deficit.
In some cases, the I.M.F. package will give the South Korean Government the cover to make reforms that special interests in the country had prevented thus far.
President Kim, for instance, came into office pledging to pare down the industrial conglomerates but has been unsuccessful.
The huge conglomerates, known as chaebols, have enjoyed ready access to bank loans because they were favored by the Government. With ready credit, they expanded haphazardly into numerous industries and developing markets worldwide. The result was a buildup of huge debts.
Now, many of those diversification attempts are failing, and chaebols are falling like dominoes. Seven of the top 40 have become insolvent this year. The Halla Group today barely avoided becoming the eighth when creditors agreed to postpone a deadline for debt repayment.
The I.M.F. agreement would limit the ability of one unit of a chaebol to guarantee the debts of another subsidiary, according to Korean media reports. This should help slow their expansion.
South Korea had announced several times this week that it had an agreement with the I.M.F., only to retract the statement later.
Officials said that the I.M.F., in part prodded by Washington, added more demands for market-opening measures and structural reforms. A big sticking point was over whether failing banks should be liquidated or allowed to reorganize. Korean officials say liquidation of commercial banks will not be required.

HEADLINE: Crusader and Pragmatist: The Two Chris Smiths

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In the trophy case in Representative Christopher H. Smith's Capitol Hill office sits a photograph of Wei Jingsheng, the Chinese dissident. The coffee table is littered with press releases about flood control programs and health clinics back home. On his desk rests a signed book of Richard Gere photographs from Tibet ("A celebrity who really cares," Mr. Smith says).
There is little here to tell a visitor that this place belongs to one of Congress's most fervent -- critics say obsessive -- opponents of abortion. And that is just how Mr. Smith wants it. 
 "High profile doesn't mean it is all you do," the nine-term Republican from central New Jersey said of his abortion fights. "Nobody should ever be a single-issue politician."
His comments, and his office decor, reflect the difficult political balancing act Mr. Smith struggles to maintain each day. In Washington, he is best known as a relentlessly effective floor leader in the fight to outlaw abortion, a battle that routinely allies him with Congress's most conservative members against most of his New Jersey colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike.
But beyond the Beltway, the Republican Congressman cuts a more complex figure, one not easily explained with conventional labels. To human rights activists, he is a vocal advocate for political freedoms abroad. To union organizers, he has become a surprisingly reliable friend. And to many voters back home, he has been a dependable defender of popular Government programs, from Medicare to Social Security to veterans' benefits.
Still, he is often labeled an ideological conservative. As a result, Mr. Smith is continually struggling to maintain credibility with the Northeastern moderates who are his natural allies on many issues, but who find his no-holds-barred anti-abortion tactics abhorrent.
Those tactics came into sharp relief last month in the final days of the Congressional session. As other members were making preparations to leave town, Mr. Smith led a move to hold up American payments to the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund as a way to force action on anti-abortion legislation. When the Clinton Administration refused to deal, the Republican leadership, at Mr. Smith's urging, blocked the payments, disrupting White House foreign policy plans as crises were developing in Iraq and Asia.
The maneuver infuriated leaders from just about every patch of the global political spectrum, including United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, Senator Jesse A. Helms and President Clinton, whose spokesman called it "bone-headed." The pressure on Mr. Smith to back down was intense, the lobbying, including from members of his own party, furious. None of it seemed to faze the 44-year-old Congressman.
"It only makes me more determined," he said. "I can't say it's been just another day at the office. But I'm getting used to this sort of thing."
For Mr. Smith, such battles have become a way of life. A devout Catholic who often quotes scripture to explain his political philosophy, he says his religion is the unifying force behind his diverse views, from opposing abortion and the death penalty to supporting human rights in other nations.
As a freshman at Trenton State College, he formed a chapter of New Jersey Right to Life after seeing a news story about a fetus that had survived an abortion. After graduation, he went to work for the group as executive director. At age 27, he won what even he called a fluke election, defeating a powerful incumbent Congressman, Frank Thompson Jr., who had been recently indicted on -- and was later convicted of -- fraud charges in the Abscam scandal.
Ever since, he has been associated almost exclusively in Washington with fighting abortion, which he equates with murder, even genocide. He has been co-chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus for 15 years.
Last year, no less a conservative than House Speaker Newt Gingrich punished him for backing an anti-abortion candidate against an incumbent Republican, Representative Sue W. Kelly of New York State, an abortion-rights supporter. On the other hand, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the dean of anti-abortion congressmen, calls him "heroic."
"For the most part in Congress, the name of the game is compromise," said Jo Blum, vice president for government relations with the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League in Washington. "But Chris Smith is not one to compromise."
Yet Mr. Smith is also walking proof that the abortion issue is not in itself enough to sustain a congressional career. Friends and critics alike describe him as deeply complex, capable of teaming up with the conservative Westerners on abortion one moment, then working with Northeastern liberals to preserve wetlands or increase the minimum wage the next. Even White House officials say he has been very helpful on immigration and refugee issues.
"There are two Chris Smiths," said Brian M. Hughes, a Democrat who ran against Mr. Smith in 1992. "There is one in Washington where abortion is his primary issue. Then there is the one in New Jersey, who is for economic development, fighting for veterans, fighting for Social Security. You wouldn't think he spent any time on the abortion issue."
"He's never walked away from the issue," Mr. Hughes added, "but he doesn't highlight it the way he does in Washington."
In part, pure political survival dictates Mr. Smith's voting record. His district wraps like a belt across New Jersey's waist, from Democratic Trenton, with its many unionized government workers, through a band of blue-collar towns to the shore, with its large bloc of retiree voters. Not surprisingly, Mr. Smith has repeatedly bucked his party's leadership and opposed efforts to cut programs cherished by the elderly, like Medicare, or to restrict union rights.
"When you take a look at his voting record, from building trades to public sector unions, he's been there for us," said Chuck Loveless, director of legislation for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union.
But even some allies wonder whether his uncompromising style on abortion can be self-defeating. An official with an international human rights group described Mr. Smith as a "prince" who had used his position as chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights to press for political freedoms in other countries.
But the same official, speaking on condition of anonymity, lamented that Mr. Smith's anti-abortion guerrilla tactics had undermined his standing among moderates and liberals in Congress. On human rights issues, the official said: "Chris is truly a leader and one of the best ones we've got. I'm just concerned that his natural allies in Congress think of him as a one-issue person. And he's not."
Indeed, his position on abortion constantly infuriates moderates in his own party. For example, he refused to campaign for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman this year because of her strong support for abortion rights, prompting Hazel Gluck, a leading Whitman supporter, to call him "an extremist."
But Mr. Smith routinely angers conservatives, as well. Just as he was winning plaudits from conservatives for blocking payments to the United Nations, he was fighting Republican free-trade advocates by opposing so-called "fast track" legislation, which would have expanded the President's powers to negotiate trade agreements. He was one of only six Republicans to vote against reducing Medicare spending in 1995. And an anti-immigration group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, has attacked him for his efforts to open American borders to more political refugees.
Even Senator Helms, the rock-ribbed anti-abortion conservative from North Carolina, was incensed at Mr. Smith for blocking the United Nations payments, which were linked to legislation Mr. Helms had meticulously negotiated to reorganize the State Department.
Mr. Smith, who was born in Rahway, said his support for labor comes from his father, a teamster turned sporting goods wholesaler who was laid off from a job driving for Borden's Food in Newark when Mr. Smith was 14. "When plant-closing legislation became an issue in Congress, it really brought back some vivid memories," he said.
But he says his activist streak comes from his grandfather, a Montclair lawyer who, for no charge, helped Chinese immigrants move their families out of Communist China. "He opened my eyes," Mr. Smith said. "I learned you can live out the Gospel by tangibly helping people."
He met his wife, Marie, at Trenton State where they were both active in Right to Life. They have four children, ages 10 to 19, and live in the northern Virginia suburbs so that he can spend more time with them -- an issue that has occasionally been raised in campaigns against him. "I love New Jersey, but while I'm on assignment, I'm not going to jeopardize my family life," he said.
The Democrats have repeatedly run abortion rights supporters against Mr. Smith, thinking the issue would work against him among New Jersey's relatively moderate voters, who polls show generally support abortion rights. The strategy has failed miserably: he has won re-election with more than 60 percent of the vote most times. Last year, the Democrats reversed field, choosing an anti-abortion conservative. He, too, lost by a wide margin.
With such stalwart support back home, Mr. Smith says he feels even greater freedom to push his anti-abortion agenda in Washington, a role he likens to the crusade of the 19th century abolitionists. And he says he has no intention of backing down in the standoff over payments to the United Nations, an issue sure to return next year.
"With abortion and the violence inherent in it, there is a meanness," he said, eyes blazing. "It is a national blind spot that will be removed."

HEADLINE: Judge Splits on Issues and Money in G.E. Executive's Divorce Case

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 3

 BODY:
In a high-stakes divorce case closely watched in corporate suites around the country, a Connecticut judge today awarded the wife of a top General Electric executive half of their cash, stocks and other hard assets, plus a part of his stock options and future pension benefits. According to his lawyers, the award is worth about $20 million. In an estate valued by her side at as much as $130 million, that would be far less than the 50 percent she had claimed for contributing to his success. 
 The ruling today, dissolving the marriage of Gary C. Wendt, 55, the chief executive of the GE Capital Corporation, General Electric's most profitable subsidiary, and Lorna J. Wendt, 54, had been awaited by many people as a possible verdict on how much a stay-at-home spouse contributes economically to a marriage. But the judge, Kevin Tierney of the Superior Court in Stamford, did not give his reasoning in outlining the complicated settlement.
In the case, Mrs. Wendt presented herself as someone who had helped put her husband through Harvard Business School, gave up her career as a music teacher to rear two daughters, created an elegant home, gave dinner parties for his clients and co-workers, accompanied him on business trips and provided daily support -- all of which contributed to his success.
The case is also important because it deals with how assets like stock options should be valued in a divorce settlement -- an issue with a growing number of couples as executive pay has soared, fueled by the more common use of stock options and deferred compensation.
Both sides said they were happy, to some extent, with the ruling today. "One point we were trying to make is that these valuable future assets are marital property, subject to division," said Arnold Rutkin, a lawyer for Mrs. Wendt. He said the award was worth more than $20 million -- Mr. Wendt's figure -- but he could not yet tell how much more. He added: "We are not happy with the amount, but we definitely made the point. Some of the boys in the board rooms will be really unhappy when they read this."
In a statement, Mr. Wendt said, "Despite the extensive publicity to the contrary generated by Mrs. Wendt, the principal issue in this case was not the relative contribution of the nonworking spouse versus the working spouse, but rather the division of future earnings after the nonworking spouse has been generously rewarded."
Neither side ruled out an appeal.
Judge Tierney said he would give his reasoning in a 450-page document, a draft of which he waved before Mrs. Wendt, various lawyers and about 30 reporters who had crowded into a small courtroom here. Mr. Wendt, who was delivering a speech in New Jersey, was not among them.
The Wendts, high school sweethearts in tiny Rio, Wis., married soon after they graduated from college in 1965. Mrs. Wendt said that when Mr. Wendt told her he wanted a divorce in 1995, she was shocked that he offered her a settlement worth about $10 million. She felt entitled to half, including his stock options, restricted stock holdings, deferred compensation and pension benefits. Her side valued the estate at $100 million, a number that may now be as high as $130 million as the stock market has rallied.
Mr. Wendt's side argued that assets like the stock options, which have a future value, should not be part of the tally because they would be contingent on his performance after the divorce and on his continued employment at General Electric until his retirement. In the last year, his side said, the estate's total value has grown from around $25 million to perhaps $45 million.
In the settlement, Judge Tierney struck a course that bowed to Mrs. Wendt's reasoning but delivered a result closer to Mr. Wendt's view. In addition to homes in Stamford and Florida worth about $2.8 million, he gave Mrs. Wendt half the cash, stock and bond holdings, worth $7.9 million; alimony of $252,000 a year, and an annual cash payment equal to half the projected dividends from 199,000 shares of restricted stock. Mr. Wendt gets to keep the stock, but the judge also awarded Mrs. Wendt half the value of his qualified pension plan and about 28 percent of his long-term performance award -- neither of which will be available until the future. Mrs. Wendt will also get private club memberships in Connecticut and Florida and a Macy's credit card entitling the holder to a 45 percent lifetime discount.
Mr. Wendt will keep all of his supplemental pension plan, his 401(k) retirement plan, all deferred compensation and various properties.
As in most other states, divorce law in Connecticut calls for equitable, not equal, distribution of a couple's assets, leaving the judge to consider the length of the marriage, the contributions each partner made, fault, need and other circumstances in dividing the pot.
In equitable distribution states, judges have tended to mandate a 50-50 split only if the assets are worth less than $10 million to $15 million. Anything beyond that goes to the breadwinner, usually the husband.
Courts have differed on whether to divide assets that were accumulated during a marriage but with value that will be realized in the future. The New York State Court of Appeals recently reversed a lower court's conclusion that stock options granted during a marriage are entirely marital property, calling for a time-based formula to determine who is entitled to what. The ruling agreed with an influential decision by the Colorado Supreme Court, which held that options granted during a marriage for past service are marital property, while those granted for services after a divorce are not.
Mrs. Wendt recently started the Foundation for Equality in Marriage to advocate that marriage is a partnership of equals. Through it, she hopes to make the case that society should view both monetary and nonmonetary contributions to a marriage with equal weight. In a statement issued before the ruling, Mrs. Wendt said, "My new career will be devoted to raising these topics and convincing the courts to examine the value of the parent's love versus a spouse's paycheck."

U.N. Forces To Leave Haiti
When the 1,400 Canadian and Pakistani peacekeepers who are the last remnants of the United Nations military force in Haiti begin withdrawing this week, they will be leaving behind a country nearly as poor, prostrate and paralyzed as when they stepped in to help. A political impasse means no budget can be passed, and as a result, the decay of infrastructure is accelerating and half the population is jobless. A1
 
Past Italian Leader Convicted
A former Italian Prime Minister and media magnate was convicted on charges he falsified the price of a film company bought by his company in order to set up a slush fund. Silvio Berlusconi was sentenced to 16 months in jail, but will probably not serve time. The conviction was the first verdict in a series of court cases faced by Mr. Berlusconi and his associates on charges including bribery and illegal slush funds. A9
 
New French Bill Introduced
An image of the painter Paul Cezanne graces France's new 100-franc bill -- the last new French bill before bills of Europe's common currency, the euro, are expected to replace France's currency in 2002. The new bill will go into circulation on Dec. 15, Bank of France officials said. Cezanne replaces Eugene Delacroix, who was on the old bill. (AP)
 
British Diplomats Go to Beijing
British diplomats met with Chinese officials in Beijing this week, for the first time since Britain returned Hong Kong to China, and raised issues of democracy and human rights. In the past Britain has regularly criticized China for dismantling all of the territory's democratic institutions, but the leader of the British delegation refrained from harsh criticism at the meeting.

Jerry Richardson told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he killed Stompie on Ms. Madikizela-Mandela's orders with garden shears, after days of beating him. A13
 
U.K. Bans Certain Beef Cuts
The British Government responded to a new report warning that so-called mad cow disease might be carried by beef bones and bone marrow by banning the sale of most cuts of beef on the bone, including ribs, T-bone steaks and oxtails.

Clinton Seeks to Ignite A 'Conversation' on Race
President Clinton, with an edgy impatience behind his folksy demeanor, struggled to strike some sparks in his "national conversation" on race, challenging participants in a televised town hall meeting in Akron, Ohio, to defend their views of affirmative action and to propose specific steps to bring the races together. A1
 
 
Akron, the site of the President's first town meeting on race, has been undertaking the kind of racial dialogue Mr. Clinton has said he would like to foster nationally. But Akron's "Coming Together Project" has not necessarily grappled with difficult issues like racial stereotypes, crime, housing or education. Nor has the dialogue produced much change in public policy. A26
 
Same-Sex Harassment Argued
The Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to sexual harassment cases among members of the same sex.

HEADLINE: For Europe, Greenhouse-Gas Issue Is How Much to Cut

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany

 BODY:
High-pressure steam heat has always been the life-force of BASF A.G.'s giant chemical complex here, where one street is named Ammonia and another is named after a catastrophic explosion that killed scores of workers in the 1920's.
The old power plant still burns coal by the bargeload, pumping high-pressure steam to heat reactions for making plastics and fibers and spewing about four million tons of "greenhouse" gases into the atmosphere every year. Until recently, this complex burned so much coal that the company owned its own mines. 
 Yet as American and European negotiators battle in Kyoto, Japan, over a proposed treaty to reduce the output of greenhouse gases implicated in global warming, this complex marks a fairly typical example of how the two sides often seem to be on different planets.
While American industry has warned that mandatory reductions would lead to factory shutdowns and hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, BASF executives say they are not worried.
Regardless of what is decided in Kyoto, BASF executives predict, this complex will emit 25 percent less carbon dioxide in the year 2000 than it did in 1990, well ahead of the ambitious goals advocated by the European Union. "The goals are absolutely achievable," said Max Dietrich Kley, BASF's managing director in charge of financial affairs.
Europe already releases less than half the volume per person of greenhouse gases as the United States. And it is urging a 15 percent cut in the industrialized world's discharges from 1990 levels, compared to the Clinton Administration's call for "stabilizing" emissions at those rates.
Compared to American business groups, European industry has been more receptive to the costly cleanup. Manufacturing groups are pursuing their own ambitious clean-air commitments. The debate here is not about whether to make steep reductions in carbon dioxide output, but how steep those reductions should be.
By any measure, Europe will have a hard time meeting its own ambitious goals. Pollution from cars and trucks is soaring, as traffic volume increases far more rapidly than automobile efficiency. Manufacturing executives warn that even big improvements in efficiency will be diluted by growth in overall production. And European industry has been fighting various proposals for stiff new "carbon" taxes that are tied to the use of fossil fuels. Thus far they have not gone anywhere.
"We are very skeptical about the European goals," said Joachim Hein, head of environmental policy at the German Federation of Industry, which has pledged steep voluntary reductions. "It's easy to put more burdens on industry, but the problem is much more multi-faceted than that. What we are saying is that industry will do its best."
Critics note that Europe has benefited from a few one-time historical events. The reunification of Germany in 1990 led to a huge reduction in emissions, because the former East Germany's bankrupt and filthy factories and power plants were quickly demolished. Between 1990 and 1995, carbon dioxide output in eastern Germany plunged by nearly half, to 172 million tons from 305 million.
Britain got a similar boost when the Government abandoned protections for domestic coal producers, which sparked a rapid shift to cleaner natural gas.
Part of what makes Europe look "greener," moreover, is nuclear power, considered an environmental villain in North America. Nuclear power supplies 75 percent of the electricity in France, 50 percent in Sweden and 30 percent in Germany, compared with 20 percent in the United States.
As Europe's economy picks up, some energy-conservation projections are already falling by the wayside. The Netherlands Federation of Industry, for example, committed itself to improve energy efficiency by 2 percent a year. But Dutch carbon dioxide emissions actually grew slightly last year, largely because of increased economic growth.
"What we have done so far is follow a 'no-regrets' policy," said Wiel Klerken, director of environmental issues at the Dutch trade association. "In other words, these are measures that are good anyway, even if there was not a CO2 problem, because you save money. But when you come to 15 percent reductions, you come into the area of 'regrets policy,' and so we think the current goals are too ambitious."
Nor have European countries entirely figured out how to distribute the burden of making changes. Under the European Union's so-called "bubble" concept, Germany agreed to assume a huge share of the total European burden -- a 25 percent cut in emissions by 2010. The bargain would allow poorer countries like Portugal and Ireland to increase emissions as much as 30 percent.
The problem is that even if each country met its obligations, which is far from assured, emissions of greenhouse gases across Europe would fall by only 10 percent, and national leaders would still need to search for more cuts.
By any measure, the efforts within Europe far outpace anything even contemplated in the United States. The German Federation of Industry, the umbrella association that covers manufacturers of everything from cars to steel to chemicals, recently released audited results showing a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990.
But those gains are in danger of being undermined by some of the same trends as in the United States: faster growth in manufacturing and an intensified love affair with cars. Officials at the German industrial federation emphasize that the demolition of old East German factories and power plants is complete. And while existing factories will inevitably become more efficient, those advances will also be diluted by continued growth in production.
Pollution from cars and trucks is even more threatening. While cars are generally much smaller than those in the United States, they are getting bigger, heavier and more numerous. The number of privately owned cars in the former East Germany is expected to double between 1990 and 2005, and the number of commercial vehicles to increase six-fold in the same period.
Car and truck traffic is already the second-biggest source of carbon dioxide after power plants in the European Union, and officials predict traffic-related emissions will soar 39 percent by the year 2010 if current policies remain in place.
Yet thus far, European Union proposals for "carbon taxes" on gasoline have gone nowhere, and many experts worry that introducing them would jeopardize national competitiveness if other industrial countries refuse to follow suit.
To some extent, European countries are victims of their own energy thrift. Energy prices here are far higher than those in the United States, and mandatory conservation measures are far more widespread. That makes further choices more difficult and more expensive.
Buildings, for example, are already being constructed according to far stricter energy-efficiency standards than in the United States. The next big round of improvements can only come from renovating old buildings -- an expensive job that governments cannot simply order property owners to carry out.
"Buildings will be a major challenge," said Alfred Voss, head of the Institute for Energy Economics and Rational Energy Use at the University of Stuttgart. Homeowners often have little incentive to invest in more efficient boilers or thermal windows, because the costs are high and the payoff can take years. Commercial landlords are often resistant as well, especially if tenants pick up the costs of heating and electricity.
Europe has nothing to apologize to the rest of the world about, of course. Compared with efforts being made almost anywhere else, European companies are models of environmental enlightenment.
The biggest single element reducing carbon dioxide emissions here in Ludwigshafen, for example, is a one-month-old "co-generation" plant that produces both electricity and high-pressure steam heat. It will burn natural gas, which emits one-half as much carbon-dioxide as a coal-fired power plant, to produce all the steam heat that BASF needs. Excess steam pressure will be used to run electric turbines. BASF can buy whatever electricity it wants, and the rest will be fed into the public electricity grid. Overall, company executives say, the new plant produces heat and electricity at about 88 percent efficiency, more than double that of the old coal plant.
Other co-generation ventures are underway elsewhere. Hoechst A.G., the chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate, is underwriting an 800-megawatt plant in Frankfurt.
BASF is also systematically slashed its reliance on fossil fuels by re-cycling heat from one process to another. The complex here at Ludwigshafen relies on coal or gas for only 25 percent of the energy it uses, down from 75 percent 20 years ago. And deeper reductions are on the way. The company's newest plant, in Antwerp, relies on fossil fuels for only 5 percent of its total energy use.
BASF is not just trying to be a good world citizen. Its main motivation is to save money -- and in that, it exemplifies Europe's pervasive culture of energy conservation.
German energy prices are among the highest in the world, in part because the Government protected domestic coal producers for decades. European gasoline costs between $3 and $4 a gallon, roughly three times higher than American prices. Yet, the political debate is not whether to lower the huge fuel taxes that are responsible, but whether to raise them.
Electricity and heat costs are often higher, especially in countries like Germany that have been protecting domestic coal producers. For that reason, few protest the stringent energy-efficiency standards for new buildings here in Germany. Also largely for that reason, air conditioning is almost non-existent in homes and is absent from many office buildings. Lights in public hallways are designed to switch off when people leave. And thanks in part to shorter distances within Europe, trains remain a far more important mode of passenger transportation than airplanes, which consume much more energy.
Political support for deep reductions in greenhouse emissions has been strong across Europe. Even Great Britain, which often displays American-style hostility to regulation, has supported tough action on greenhouse gases under both Conservative and Labor governments.
"In Europe, there is a perception that energy is expensive and will continue to be expensive in the future, while Americans have a perception that energy is cheap and will continue to be cheap," said Lee Solsbery, director of energy and environmental issues at the International Energy Agency in Paris.
The key challenge, said Professor Voss of the University of Stuttgart, will be to come up with policies that promote deeper reductions and yet do not jeopardize economic growth. "If you are going to make real progress, you have to treat economic and environmental goals. The danger is that people will not do that, which could mean that you reach neither goal."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;
U.S. Banks Still Face Risk, But Bailout Eases Pressure

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
South Korea's rescue package orchestrated by the International Monetary Fund removes an enormous weight from some of the largest American banks, which could have suffered heavy losses if borrowers had failed to repay loans.
But it is premature to consider the banks protected from the economic turmoil in Asia, particularly with serious issues unresolved in Japan. 
 "The I.M.F. package plugs one of the holes in the dam, but it doesn't mean the pressure on the dam has completely ebbed," said Gene Frieda, an analyst with the Institute for Development of Economic Analysis in New York, which advises financial institutions. "A bailout is not a bailout if they don't implement the reforms that go along with it."
Mr. Frieda said that the bailout, which now totals $57 billion, might not be enough to repair the financial damage in South Korea and that tens of billions of dollars in more aid might be needed. Nonetheless, the agreement offered a strong vote of confidence in the South Korean economy and touched off a sharp rally in some large bank stocks yesterday.
"I think it's a benefit that the South Koreans are doing this because it contains the financial epidemic," said Raphael Soifer, a bank analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
United States banks have $20.2 billion worth of "cross border" exposure to South Korea, which includes loans, currency transactions and derivatives contracts, according to figures compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel, a group comprising the largest United States banking regulators. The largest piece of that belongs to the six huge money-center banks, which jointly carry about $14.5 billion in cross-border exposure: the Chase Manhattan Corporation, Citicorp, the BankAmerica Corporation, J. P. Morgan & Company, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation and the First Chicago NBD Corporation.
Citicorp and BankAmerica, respectively, have $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion in cross-border exposure, but none of the others offered similar detail. Chase Manhattan's exposure is at least as large as BankAmerica's, while First Chicago's is much less, according to people close to the banks.
The six big banks declined to comment or said appropriate executives were unavailable to comment on the I.M.F. agreement.
Mr. Soifer said that even with the bailout package, some of the big banks might be forced to write off bad loans. When Latin American countries suffered a debt crisis in the 1980's, United States banks wrote off as much as 35 percent of their loans after debt was restructured.
But the vast majority of restructured debt in Latin America was issued by local governments, whereas much of the South Korean debt is corporate and therefore may be likelier to be repaid.
Indeed, some analysts think few, if any, American banks will face write-offs in South Korea.
"The fact of the bailout would suggest that all of these credits aren't as bad as they could have been," said David Berry, a bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "I don't think the banks will have to write off anything."
Mr. Berry said that except for Citicorp, the big banks had less than 10 percent of their assets in Asia. He said that Citicorp had 20 percent there but that fears about its exposure were overblown, partly because Asia's crisis is far less severe than the Latin American crisis.

HEADLINE: Rights Group Assails U.S. on Land Mines and Ties With China

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration was accused of arrogance and "active obstruction" today in its policies toward international human rights in the annual report of Human Rights Watch.
In a survey of 65 nations, the United States Government received some particularly strong criticism from the private human rights group on issues ranging from the global attempt to destroy land mines to the interplay of economic and human rights values in relations with China. 
 "Many Western countries seemed more concerned with striking business deals than protecting human rights," Kenneth Roth, executive director of the group, declared in making public the 465-page survey of government repression in the world. "The fundamental principle that human rights apply to all nations without exception -- the universality of human rights -- came under sustained attack in 1997."
He called for an end to "hostage politique" in China relations: "bargaining for the release of single individuals without changing the underlying structure that allows the Chinese Government to detain thousands of others in jail and to make new arrests."
Human Rights Watch said the year was also notable for the emergence of a fresh twist on repression in Central Africa with the slogan of "African solutions to African problems" used as a "thin cover" for abusing citizens.
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Congo (the former Zaire) were singled out, with European and North American governments accused of being eager to build ties with a new generation of African leaders who allegedly fail to rein in their security forces' resort to repression.
In addition, the group described the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as "increasingly crippled by its own indifference to the human rights record of its membership." This is a "charade," Mr. Roth said, that has left the United Nations "enfeebled" in defending human rights as an issue that this year cost the lives of 15 rights monitors, all but one of them perishing in either Colombia or Rwanda.
The criticism of the Clinton Administration was focused on its refusal to sign the treaty banning land mines and its reservations toward plans for an International Criminal Court and the proposed world ban on "child soldiers" below the age of 18.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, described as "obviously ridiculous" the charge that the Government "actively obstructed" any move to strengthen the International Criminal Court in its proposed role of deterring despots. He also said there was "no question" the United States was a world leader in fighting the land mine problem, despite some reservations about the new treaty.
"I think that if you look around the world and you ask the people of the world which nation they look to as the beacon for human rights, democracy and freedom, there's no question the answer will be the United States," Mr. Rubin said.
But Mr. Roth contended there was "a troubling arrogance" in Washington toward international human rights law, with the Government wary of treaty provisions that might touch on domestic rights abuses.
On China, he said Beijing was the greatest beneficiary of "selective commitment" to human rights by world powers eying the huge China market.

HEADLINE: Spouses as Shareholders

 BODY:
Lorna Wendt did not get 50 percent of the assets in her marriage to Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital Corporation, which she argued was as much economic enterprise as marital relationship. But she did not do badly either. A Connecticut judge awarded Mrs. Wendt a settlement worth $20 million or more from a family fortune that her experts say is worth at least $100 million. The case raises the question of what a marital partnership means.
The Wendts represent a new corporate elite that now enjoys a level of personal wealth unimaginable in decades past, much of it in stock options, pensions and other forms of deferred compensation. Some of the complexity of the Wendt case revolves around dividing these non-cash assets. But that issue is not novel, and courts routinely place values on future pension benefits and even professional degrees for property division purposes. 
 The crux of the case was about how to apportion success. Mrs. Wendt maintained that her 31-year performance as corporate wife -- raising two children, maintaining a gracious home, entertaining Mr. Wendt's business associates -- contributed to a joint economic operation that entitled her to a 50-50 split of the assets.
Some legal experts say that Mrs. Wendt would have gotten half the assets if the family fortune were, say, $5 million. That is because divorce settlements are often intended to provide non-working spouses with sufficient financial resources to live in their accustomed manner.
The size of the Wendt estate makes that worry unimportant. Though less than half the estate, $20 million is a grand sum. But as a matter of principle, should she be entitled to half the marital property? In the 11 community-property states, such as California, the answer is yes. But the law in Connecticut, like New York, calls for "equitable distribution" of assets, a standard that allows a judge to weigh individual needs, the length of the marriage and contributions made during the marriage.
Artists and professional athletes, for example, can argue that their earning power is based on unique talents that have nothing to do with their marriages. Some wage earners might even argue that stay-at-home spouses too shy to socialize were actually a drag on their financial well-being. Mr. Wendt simply argued that Mrs. Wendt was not responsible for his business success. Yet her presence must have affected his life and business performance to some degree. The judge's award recognizes that contribution.

HEADLINE: Productivity Strong, Although Revised

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Worker productivity during the third quarter grew more slowly than previously estimated but still increased at the best rate in five years, the Labor Department said today.
Productivity -- a measure of the time, effort and cost of providing goods and services -- rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent. That was down from the estimate on Nov. 13 of 4.5 percent but was the highest rate since the 1992 fourth quarter. 
 In the second quarter, productivity rose at a 2.4 percent pace.
Today's report showed that unit labor costs fell two-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, compared with the initial estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent. Hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.9 percent, down from the initial estimate of 2.1 percent. Hours worked fell one-tenth of 1 percent, unchanged from the initial estimate.
Separately, the Labor Department said that the number of first-time claims filed for state unemployment benefits fell by 3,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 303,000. The drop was the second consecutive weekly decline.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, fell to 314,000 last week from 317,250 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Memo From Moscow;
When Yeltsin Talks, Nobody Listens (Aides Hope)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 4

 BODY:
First, he named Japan as one of the world's nuclear superpowers. The Japanese have no nukes. Then he stunned his aides at a meeting in Stockholm by announcing -- without a word to any of them -- that Russia would disarm unilaterally. There are no such plans.
Then, as his senior generals gasped, President Boris N. Yeltsin told an astonished crowd this week that he would cut Russian troop strength in the Baltic region by 40 percent. That was a few hours after he confused Norway with Sweden when talking about a major oil deal that Russia is desperate to conclude. 
 His press secretary and defense chief spent the rest of the day issuing urgent denials of almost everything Mr. Yeltsin had said.
"We don't take what he says all that seriously," a senior American diplomatic official conceded today, after the latest round of public gaffes. "We have come to learn that lots of times he just says what's on his mind at the moment. And his mind changes rather quickly."
It is normal for people under pressure to make mistakes. But with Mr. Yeltsin there is a growing feeling here that perhaps it has become a little too normal.
And Mr. Yeltsin is not any old leader: he runs one of the biggest nuclear powers on earth. And he runs it like a semi-democratic czar. With no legislature that can really challenge him, he rules essentially by decree.
There is no apparent successor to the President, who is 66. Whatever movement Russia has made toward democracy and a free market -- and that progress is debated always -- Mr. Yeltsin remains enigmatic, inconsistent, contradictory and overwhelmingly powerful.
"He is like a little boy," said Dmitri V. Trenin, a military specialist based here for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"He always wants to stun the world, attract the most attention. He will say anything to get attention. And when he speaks like this, peopledo listen."
The Swedes certainly did, although perhaps not the way a publicist would want. The day Mr. Yeltsin got to Stockholm, the leading Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, felt compelled to announce the arrival of the Russian delegation with the headline "Moscow Circus Arrives in Provinces." And not without reason.
After all, this is a President who just this year told a captivated world at a NATO summit meeting that he would remove nuclear warheads from Russian missiles. No, he didn't mean that.
In Ukraine this year, Mr. Yeltsin made a big gesture of removing sales taxes between the Slavic states whose people are friendly but whose Governments are often at odds. Mr. Yeltsin's Finance Ministry -- already under severe international pressure to collect more taxes and become more fiscally responsible -- went absolutely nuts over that one.
"Something seems to happen to him when he goes overseas," said Pavel Voshchanov, one of Mr. Yeltsin's more critical former press secretaries. "He loses control there. It has always been the case. When he is here he is shown just as Mao was with his own people. Doors open, he comes out, says something that is rehearsed and then he leaves. A Czar need do no more. But in other countries they have other rules. It can't be good for Russia to see him this way."
Actually, most people here don't seem to blame Mr. Yeltsin for his gaffes. Perhaps that is because there is so much else to blame him for. A year ago he was so sick -- many thought near death -- that his recovery had been seen with great relief in Russia and in the West. For a while.
But today, the country is buffeted by a growing financial crisis. His Western-oriented reform leader, Anatoly B. Chubais, has been tainted as corrupt and partisan. Foreign investors are pulling their money out of the market -- mostly in response to fears about emerging markets in Asia that have nothing to do with Russia -- but it has still crippled the treasury. An economy that seemed on the verge of a rebound once again seems as if it might plummet.
"How long do we need it?" Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, Mr. Yeltsin's former national security adviser and now an archenemy, asked today. "How long do we need such a man sending us toward our doom before he finally resigns?"
It is a question that few others have asked. It is not that Mr. Yeltsin is so popular -- he is deeply unpopular according to every poll taken in the last year. Yet, few alternatives to the President have emerged during his six years in power -- in part, of course, because he has done all he could to defeat opposition voices.
Mr. Yeltsin does not appear to be ill, and his aides say he has greatly cut back on drinking since his heart bypass operation a year ago.
Much of what he said this week, in fact, means nothing. A 40 percent reduction in the army is significant. But earlier this year he called for such a cut, campaigned for it on radio, and insisted that it begin at once.
"Don't go trying to figure him out," said Vera Kuznetsova, a political reporter for Izvestia who covers Mr. Yeltsin and has written about him for years. "Nobody ever has. Even his daughter had no idea what he was talking about in Sweden."
Mr. Yeltsin's daughter Tatanya Dyachenko is one of his chief aides.
Early in Mr. Yeltsin's second term, his press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, expounded grandly on plans for the President to travel to many parts of the world he had never seen. South America was mentioned; more trips to the United States and Canada were considered. Africa and the Middle East were, too.
Mr. Yastrzhembsky was mute this week about Mr. Yeltsin's future travel plans. Looking like a man who just wanted to get his President home while he still had his feet out of his mouth, Mr. Yastrzhembsky could only shake his head and laugh.
"The President has opened a new window for journalists on the diplomatic negotiating process," he said. "Now I have to go."

HEADLINE: Another Year, Another Bundle;
Billions in Bonuses Are Expected to Fall on Wall Street

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
As the year draws to a close, Christmas and Hanukkah do not seem to be foremost in the thoughts of people on Wall Street. They are jousting over money, their own money.
For December is the time when most firms and big money managers bestow the bonuses that make up the bulk of their senior executives' compensation -- often 90 percent or more. 
 And this bonus season promises to be a rich one. With sharply rising stock markets and hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of takeovers, 1997 has been one of the most prosperous years ever on Wall Street, even compared with the two fat years that preceded it.
At Goldman, Sachs & Company, the firm's 190 partners will make a minimum of about $4 million each, with star performers and top managers snagging as much as $25 million, according to recruiting specialists who often work with the firm's executives. On Goldman's next layer, some 215 managing directors will take home an average of $1.5 million apiece, while the rest of the payroll, more than 10,000 other employees, must content themselves with comparative pennies for their bonuses, anywhere from a few thousand dollars to perhaps $100,000 or so. Goldman would not comment on compensation but confirmed the number of employees and managing directors.
Over all, bonuses for Wall Street's top bankers and traders are expected to rise an average of 20 percent to 30 percent, senior bankers and recruitment consultants say. Top executives with skills in high demand -- like equity analysts, merger bankers, high-yield-bond specialists, managers of new stock offerings and technology gurus -- may do even better.
P. Clarke Murphy of Russell Reynolds Associates, executive recruiters, said bonus increases for bankers who manage "products like high-yield bonds will be in excess of 50 percent." Their average bonus may jump to perhaps $1.5 million from $1 million a year ago -- a rise, in Wall Street slang, to "a bar and a half" from "a bar."
The common wisdom on Wall Street is that more than 1,000 people in the business will get bonuses of more than $1 million this year.
On Wall Street's upper tier, base pay is almost an afterthought -- perhaps $200,000 a year; the real money is in bonuses. And the firms expected to pay out the biggest ones are those that are particularly successful in areas now in vogue. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover are all well known, as is Goldman, for their equity analysis, merger advice, stock offerings and junk-bond businesses.
In the days before Christmas, Donaldson -- whose profits for the first three quarters exceeded its profits for all of 1996 -- is expected to inform its executives of bonus increases of 25 percent or more, bankers and recruiters say. Joe L. Roby, the president and chief operating officer, made a total of $33.2 million last year, although Donaldson officers are quick to point out that some of this represented the receipt of restricted stock accumulated in earlier years.
Of course, some professionals in the securities industry will get small bonuses, or none at all. These are the unlucky executives in sectors that have fared poorly in recent months -- emerging markets, say, or Asian equities. Executives at Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong investment bank, for example, expect little or no bonus after the debacle in Asian markets that prompted the bank to dismiss 275 of its workers in late November, just days after Zurich Group, the big Swiss insurer, stepped in to buy 24.1 percent of the firm for about $200 million.
At the other end of the bonus spectrum, successful managers at hedge funds -- those little-regulated pools of investment capital like Tiger Management and the Quantum Fund and other investments managed by George Soros -- will outdo even their successful Wall Street colleagues. These funds, named for the hedging techniques they use to maximize returns, do not have all the considerable operating expenses of a huge Wall Street firm, where a year's bill for computer hardware and software alone can run to hundreds of millions of dollars.
"The big hedge funds will dwarf the main Wall Street firms," said Alan M. Johnson, a recruitment and pay consultant, who added that Julian H. Robertson Jr., the proprietor of Tiger, "must be making $300 million or $400 million this year." (A Robertson spokesman declined to comment.)
The Government certainly expects a bonanza. Using tax prepayments and other data, the office of the New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, predicts that the city's securities industry will increase bonus payments by 15 percent over last year, to a total of about $10.8 billion. Past predictions from the comptroller's office have been conservative; last year, it forecast a 30 percent increase, while bonuses actually ballooned by more than 50 percent over 1995.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. McCall welcomed the prospective income for the local economy, but cautioned that New York could not count on such bounty, which could disappear as soon as Wall Street had a bad year.
The next few weeks will tell how much that income will be this year. In December, most of the country's biggest securities firms tell their executives what their 1997 bonuses will be. Bonus checks do not generally go out, though, until late in the month, or even in January. Merrill Lynch tells its executives in the last week of January.
Mergers like the recently completed union of Salomon and Smith Barney make the bonus round trickier than usual. Wall Street bosses have to reconcile the different cultures and payment practices of different firms, always aware that competitors and headhunters hover nearby, eager to try to tempt away the talented with better offers.
That strategy apparently worked for Lehman, which just hired Diane B. Glossman and Michael Plodwick, both well-regarded Salomon bank analysts, despite the high bonuses that Salomon's bosses had promised. Lehman guaranteed the newcomers multiyear pay packages, bankers say, and matched their expected 1997 bonuses.
Not everyone on Wall Street benefits from all this largess. Generally, it is only senior executives, the top caste in Wall Street's hierarchy, who get the outsize checks. At some firms, junior employees get annual bonus payments out of a pool, but the amount is rarely more than 15 percent or 20 percent of their salary.
The vast sums that the bosses pocket certainly help to stoke the markets for sleek cars, fancy homes and other goodies that always tempt the rich. "The joke is you can't buy much of a house in Greenwich for $3 million," said Mr. Johnson, the recruitment consultant. "I guess by the end of this year it will be $4.5 million." Mr. Johnson's firm, Johnson Associates Inc., gives compensation advice to financial powerhouses like Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs and J. P. Morgan.
Now, though, Wall Streeters are generally much less ostentatious with their windfalls than they were in the 1980's. These days they tend to stash their bonuses with money managers, reminding themselves that these good years may not last much longer -- or perhaps that they may not be able to stand the pace too many more years.
Of course, more money means more quarreling, seasoned Wall Streeters warn.
"Relatively few people are made very happy, even if their bonuses are very large," said Roy C. Smith, a former partner at Goldman, Sachs who now teaches at New York University's Stern School of Business. Describing bonus time as "one of the least pleasant parts of the business," Mr. Smith said it takes up "about two months of management time, and is probably more comparable to dealing with free agents in athletics."
It is hard to feel sorry for Wall Street's bonus babies. Moreover, the increasing proportions of Wall Street firms' net revenues that go to pay -- some 50 to 60 percent -- "makes it extremely difficult to produce acceptable returns on capital in this business," Mr. Smith said.
It has been known to baffle those outside Wall Street. Some of the nation's most successful executives, like Warren E. Buffett, the renowned Omaha investor, and John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company, have left Wall Street shaking their heads at the way top executives insist on monumental bonuses. Mr. Buffett sold his controlling stake in Salomon this year after several unsuccessful attempts to rein in pay, and Mr. Welch sold most of the assets of G.E.'s Kidder, Peabody subsidiary to Paine Webber in 1994.
"The amounts now have grown so staggering that some firms may just get forced out of the business," Mr. Johnson said. He expects that foreign firms, following the lead of Barclays and NatWest of Britain, which are selling chunks of their investment banking businesses, will continue to leave Wall Street as compensation keeps soaring.
Wall Street has also taken to awarding executives, as part of their bonuses, huge amounts of stock options and restricted stock -- often representing more than half their total pay. On the surface, this is an effort to align the interests of management more closely with those of shareholders. The trouble is, critics contend, so much profit is paid out that there is precious little left for the outside stockholder. "Many of these formulas will not lead to long-term profitability," Mr. Johnson said.
One early hint of the richness of this year's bonus round came from the Bear Stearns Companies, which gives out its bonuses after the end of its fiscal year in June. This summer, it paid $87 million to its top five officers, with the chief executive, James E. Cayne, getting $23.2 million, more than half of it in restricted stock. Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman, got $20.7 million, including $14 million in cash.
In truth, the bonus game has a lot of theater to it. Executives tend to lobby their bosses furiously in the weeks before they are told the magic numbers.
"There's a certain animal character to this," said Mr. Smith, who used to run Goldman's investment banking business in Europe. "You have to growl and roar and be fierce."
The perceived need to pay ever-larger bonuses to superstars means there is greater pressure on less-stellar executives. Over the last decade, some firms have become more aggressive at this. Goldman, for example, has made partners "go limited" and has even forced a few out of the partnership. Goldman spokesmen, who refuse to discuss specific cases, tend to explain such moves as changes in partners' personal priorities.
In the last couple of years, Ernest S. Liu and Carl G. Palmstierna, among others, stepped down from Goldman partnerships yet remained at the firm, Goldman colleagues said. They added that Mr. Liu wanted a less pressured life. An assistant at Mr. Palmstierna's old office at Goldman said he had left the company but could not say where he could be reached.
"This has been going on a while," one senior Goldman alumnus said. "In part it's a natural pruning of the bush."

After the third great year in a row for financial markets, many of Wall Street's top executives and deal makers are anticipating multimillion-dollar bonuses that are expected to top last year's record total. As usual, star performers will do best, while the rank and file get more modest amounts. Here are the annual bonus totals for Wall Street securities firms, and a look at the bonus breakdown at one firm.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Market Brings a Lift to a Town-House Development in Queens

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A town-house community in an affluent section of Queens that struggled to get started during the recession has received a lift from New York City's strengthening housing market.
Six years ago, there were no buyers for the first units in the community, Oak Park at Douglaston, and the recession dried up the financing to complete the project. 
 Now, all 121 of the one-, two- and three-bedroom homes in the project's first phase have been built and sold, and the developer has started work on 92 units in the project's second phase. Sales prices have increased four times since 1995: they range from $215,000 to $415,000 for the 1,137- to 2,281-square-foot units, said John P. McInerney, vice president at the DeMatteis Organizations, the company based in Uniondale, N.Y., that is developing the project on Douglaston Parkway, just south of 244th Street.
Real estate experts say that the project's changing fortunes demonstrate how the housing markets around New York City have improved in a sort of rolling wave that started in Manhattan and then spread to other boroughs.
"It is definitely good news," Rita E. Scheiner, president of the Oak Park condominium board, said. "All homeowners are happy to see that the value of their property is increasing."
The improvement in the housing market began with the rental market, said Jeffrey E. Levine, a past president of the Queens County Builders and Contractors Association. Rents increased, he said, and that, in turn, set the stage for new rental construction. But higher rents also provided people with an incentive to buy, said Mr. Levine, who also heads his own development company in Douglaston.
Now sales prices are also rising. Through September, the average sales price for existing single-family detached homes in Douglaston was $347,200, up from $283,400 in the same period last year. In all of Queens, the average sales price of one-family homes, including town houses, was $173,881 as of the third quarter, up from $164,860 from the same time last year, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.
Getting Oak Park to this point, however, was a long, bumpy journey. The project took shape on land that was part of a 27 1/2-acre tract formerly occupied by Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception, a four-year liberal arts school that trained men for the priesthood. The school closed in 1988 because of declining enrollment and the owner, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, sold the 14 1/2 undeveloped acres of the campus for $10 million to the DeMatteis Organizations the same year.
The money from the sale enabled the diocese to renovate the college's main building, a 250,000-square-foot center for academics, administration and student housing, into a diocesan center, said the Rev. Michael J. Hardiman, the center's director. The center includes office space for the diocese, a home for retired priests and a dormitory for students studying for the priesthood. Those students attend St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens, for their academic training and then go on to the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.
DeMatteis, judging the site's setting well suited for housing, spent two years gaining local approvals for its town-house project.
The development is close to the Douglaston Golf Course, Alley Pond Park and Little Neck Bay. The Cross Island and Grand Central Parkways and the Long Island Expressway also are nearby.
But by the middle of 1991, when the first 40 units were complete, the recession had driven most buyers away, leaving the units to languish on the market unsold. At the same time, Crossland Savings Bank, which held a construction loan on the project, failed and was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The following year, the DeMatteis Organizations bought the mortgage on the Oak Park site, as well as on two undeveloped parcels elsewhere on Long Island, for $20 million. To stimulate sales, Mr. McInerney said, his company reduced the asking prices of the town houses by up to 20 percent, to $194,000 for the smallest unit, and $310,000 for the largest. It also offered other incentives, like one year of free maintenance, and sold all 40 units by 1993.
In 1995, as the housing market stirred back to life, he said, his company secured financing from Grand Pacific Finance Corporation in Flushing. It built the remaining 81 units in the first phase and started construction on the 92 in the second phase last April. Contracts have been signed on 56 units since May.
The design of the project has remained relatively unchanged. But its scale was reduced by 10 units in the second phase to its current size to make room for a second recreational area, including an outdoor pool, a children's play area and a clubhouse.
The new houses, like the existing ones, are to be traditional in design and built in clusters, with 8 to 16 units each. Three models, from single-story to three-story units, are being offered and most will have a one- or two-car garage. The monthly maintenance fee ranges from $195 to $391, and there is a New York City tax abatement on property taxes for the first 11 years: with the abatement, for example, taxes on a one-bedroom unit are $408 a year; without the abatement it would be $1,620 a year.
Mr. McInerney said buyers will start moving into the first 10 homes of the second phase in June, with all 92 units expected to be ready for occupancy by the spring of 1999.

HEADLINE: In West Bank, 'Time' for Settlements Is Clearly Not 'Out'

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: OFRA, West Bank, Dec. 4

 BODY:
If there is any serious talk of a "timeout" in settlement construction, it sure hasn't reached Ofra. On one hillside, 27 houses stand in various stages of completion, while bulldozers shift boulders on another hill to make room for 24 more.
Outside their settlement, Ofra residents have moved mobile homes onto another hilltop. Despite a national strike that paralyzed all such work elsewhere in Israel, private electricians were busy stringing wire to the outpost. 
 Similar activity can be seen in many other settlements, where construction that was frozen under the former Labor Government has resumed under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition.
According to Peace Now, a left-wing Israeli organization that closely monitors settlement activity, 4,714 housing units are now under construction in 61 of the 140 West Bank settlements. The organization also said the Government had put out tenders for the construction of 26 housing units in a small Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, marking the first construction there since the last Likud Government in 1992.
"Time out?" declared Yona Hoffman, the head of the 1,860-member Jewish settlement five miles northeast of Ramallah, as talk turned to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's suggestion that Israel take a pause in settlement construction to break the deadlock in peace negotiations with the Palestinians. "It would be a disaster! Let her freeze construction in her own United States. I sure hope if she demands this, that Bibi will give a good answer."
"Bibi" -- Mr. Netanyahu -- is to meet Ms. Albright on Friday in Paris, where she is likely to press him for progress on the requirements Washington has laid out for resuming the peace talks. They include a "significant and credible" further withdrawal in the West Bank and a timeout in settlement expansion.
On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet voted to approve a withdrawal in principle, but declared that it would set the time and scope only after Mr. Netanyahu presented a plan for the final agreement in the West Bank.
On the settlements, Mr. Netanyahu has insisted that the construction is only "natural growth," and that no new settlements are being built. The exception is the new Jewish housing project at Har Homa, in southeastern Jerusalem, which is not regarded as a "settlement" by the Government since it does not regard East Jerusalem as occupied territory.
In fact, preparatory work on Har Homa has been completed, and the Government has yet to put out tenders for construction. Some right-wing politicians have asserted that Mr. Netanyahu is deliberately delaying the next stage in a gesture to Ms. Albright, but the Prime Minister has made no such claim.
It is generally accepted among Israelis of both left and right that Mr. Netanyahu is constrained from building settlements by the outcry this would provoke in the West -- not to mention the fury and possibly the violence of the Palestinians, to whom the heavily guarded enclaves of red-roofed houses scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip stand as a permanent reminder of Jewish designs on lands they consider theirs.
But Peace Now recently asserted that the settlers had found a new way to claim territory in the West Bank, by building five new industrial zones deep inside the territory. On the bypass road around Ramallah, near Ofra, bulldozers were working on the first of the zones, and Mossi Raz, the head of the settlement watch team at Peace Now, said that four others already had formal approval, and that one was pending.
Pinchas Wallerstein, head of Yesha, the main settlers' association, said that the zones were projects approved already under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor Government, and that they would provide work also for Palestinians.
But Mr. Raz argued that the industrial zones were a means of occupying strategic territory without the full Government approval required for a new settlement. "We see the industrial areas as a way to bypass settlement construction," he said.
Khalil Tufakji, head of the geographic department at Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in East Jerusalem, said, "They build to make facts on the ground."
According to Mr. Tufakji, several settlements, Ofra among them, have quietly planted mobile homes on nearby hilltops to stake out areas that will remain under Israeli jurisdiction in any future deal. The hill seized by the Ofra residents, he said, would move the settlement's boundaries closer to a military listening post, and thus give the settlement added insurance against being isolated or even handed over to Palestinian control.
For the settlers, this "battle of the hills" is an integral part of what they perceive as a sacred struggle against "the Arabs" for the biblical Land of Israel.
"What's the meaning of a 'slow down' in settlement construction -- to clear this land of Jews?" Mr. Wallerstein demanded. "No one talks of freezing construction in Arab villages. They grow, they build up neighborhoods."
On the political front, the settlement debate is mired in endless disputes over legality and history. The settlers insist that most of their current construction was approved under the last Labor Government, and does not violate the Oslo agreements.
That may be so, retort Israelis to the left, but the difference is in strategy and motive. The Labor Government allowed expansion of settlements in three blocks Mr. Rabin regarded as strategic for Israeli security -- one east of Tel Aviv, another around Jerusalem and the third in the Gush Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem. But he froze construction in what he called "political settlements," those whose main evident purpose was to secure West Bank territory.
Mr. Rabin also stripped almost all settlements of special economic status as development areas, which gave settlers various economic benefits including subsidies for housing and education. On Sept. 2, the Government restored most settlements to the status of an "area of national priority."
Another argument against permitting housing construction in the settlements is that there are already enough vacant houses and apartments in the West Bank to absorb natural growth. A United States report last year created a stir with the claim that a quarter of the housing was vacant.
According to Peace Now, the real figure is closer to 12 percent. According to the organization's figures, there are 3,183 vacant housing units in the West Bank, even while 4,714 new ones are being built.
"In 1996, the natural growth was 4,700 births, but the number of settlers increased by 13,000, or about 9.4 percent," Mr. Raz said. "So about two-thirds of the growth was 'unnatural.' We know that 12 percent of the flats are empty. So if they were only worried about natural growth, they could stop building for four years."
Mr. Wallerstein rejected such arguments, noting first that the growth rate was the same under the past Government, and second that the vacancies were not necessarily in settlements where there was a demand for housing, but usually in isolated settlements.
"It's like saying there are vacancies in Utah if you want to live in Manhattan," he said, noting that houses in Ofra, for instance, sold immediately at prices up to $120,000.
But even as he watched the bulldozers and the workers erecting dozens of new houses, Mr. Hoffman, the head of the Ofra settlers, insisted that he was not satisfied with Mr. Netanyahu.
"We expected a Prime Minister openly for settlements, who would build thousands of new units here after four years in which we couldn't build," he said, expressing the universal nostalgia among settlers for the days before 1992 when Ariel Sharon was Housing Minister and lavished vast Government spending on building up the settlements.
The main problem was the American pressure, he insisted. "I hope Netanyahu is strong enough to take the pressure," he said, "but I'm not sure he is."

Executives Upbeat About New Jersey

BYLINE: BY ALAN FEUER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
In a survey released yesterday, small-business owners in New Jersey said they were optimistic about the state economy, with more than half of them saying they expected sales and profits to rise next year.
The results of the survey, conducted for the 39th year in a row by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a trade group, were compiled from 1,160 responses to questionnaires mailed to more than 15,000 member companies. 
 Seventy-seven percent of the business owners said the state economy is expanding, up from 58 percent last year. Only 9 percent said the state was in a recession, down from 26 percent last year, said Joseph E. Gonzalez, the association's president.
More than a third of the respondents expected that the economy would improve in the first six months of 1998, and about 40 percent said prospects in their own industries should improve. Roughly a third predicted that employment would rise.
The survey also showed concern about the state's increasing labor shortage. "Our member companies reported having the greatest difficulty since 1989 in filling professional, technical, managerial and other high-skilled jobs," Mr. Gonzalez said.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City and State Battling on Crowded Schools

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 3

 BODY:
When H. Benjamin Williams became the Superintendent of Schools here last spring, he expected to contend with crumbling buildings, jam-packed classrooms and some of the lowest-achieving students in New Jersey.
But Mr. Williams said he never imagined that his most formidable problem would be the New Jersey Department of Education. For most of his short tenure, the Superintendent has been battling the State Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, over his plan to put a middle school in a vacant high school building. 
 The state, which over eight years has seized control of schools in Newark, Jersey City and Paterson, has taken preliminary steps toward a takeover of the Atlantic City district, based on its financial problems and low test scores. So Mr. Williams, a former assistant superintendent in Paterson, already faced heavy monitoring, which he said frustrated him.
In an interview this week, Mr. Williams said that the fierce conflict raised important questions not only about state intervention in local affairs, but about the differing interests of the downtrodden residents of Atlantic City and the politicians who want to lure casinos to town. Mr. Williams, who is black, even suggested that the battle was fueled by racism, since Mr. Klagholz and others who have denounced his plan are white.
Mr. Klagholz has denied the allegations of racism, saying that he wants only to make sure that the students are safe and that the financially strapped district does not waste money.
At issue is Mr. Williams's decision to move 1,800 children in fifth through eighth grades to the Albany Avenue School, which has stood empty since a new high school opened three years ago. State education officials initially fought the plan, saying it would be too disruptive and expensive, but then relented just before school began.
But after the school was plagued by violence this fall, Mr. Klagholz again stepped in and ordered Mr. Williams to return the 500 youngest students to their neighborhood elementary schools. In an even more unusual move, the Superintendent refused.
In a hearing scheduled for Friday morning, a Superior Court judge will decide whether to enforce Mr. Klagholz's order to remove fifth-grade students from the Albany Avenue School. Mr. Williams says that if the judge sides with the state, he will appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court and, if necessary, the United States Supreme Court.
"This district has been subject to a degree of political intrusion that I've never experienced in all my years of public education," said Mr. Williams, who came to Atlantic City last March from Paterson. "What we are seeing played out is a game of power and process."
A spokesman for Mr. Klagholz said that Mr. Williams was the only one playing a game, noting that 150 students at the Albany Avenue School had been suspended and 40 arrested since September.
"We are extremely upset that the Superintendent continues to play Russian roulette with the safety of the Albany Avenue students," the spokesman, Peter Peretzman, said. "His behavior is unconscionable and clearly in this case, he is not abiding by the law."
Mr. Peretzman and other state officials said they never considered the school, a brick behemoth built in 1920, appropriate for young students because of its size and multiple entrances. State officials proposed trailers as a short-term solution to overcrowding since the city is hoping to build six new elementary schools in the next decade. When Mr. Williams refused to use trailers, they gave in to make sure children could start school on time.
But the state did not give in completely, refusing to approve Atlantic City's school construction plans until Mr. Williams closes down the Albany Avenue School. Mr. Klagholz also sent an auditor to monitor the district's spending. That further incensed Mr. Williams, who was already angry that Mr. Klagholz had cut $1.3 million from his 1997-98 budget.
The showdown began in earnest in October, when Mr. Klagholz discovered that Albany Avenue students were being suspended and even arrested almost daily for fighting. The school adopted a strict disciplinary policy and increased security around Halloween. But on the day that state inspectors visited the building to see whether the violence had ebbed, one eight grader slashed another with a box cutter.
Two days later, on Nov. 19, Mr. Klagholz ordered Mr. Williams to send the 500 fifth-graders back to elementary schools by Dec. 1. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman -- who typically is even more loath to interfere in local school districts than Mr. Klagholz -- has publicly urged the Superintendent to follow the order.
Mr. Williams, who has the support of the school board and the leader of the local teachers' union, has repeatedly said that there is more to the drama than meets the eye. He and the school board president, Marven Hill, say that Mayor James F. Whelan and state officials want to get students out of the old high school building so they can sell it to Mirage Resorts, which is building a $750 million casino complex here.
Mayor Whelan said that he did offer the Albany Avenue School to Mirage, which thought it would be an ideal place to train 1,900 Atlantic City residents for jobs at its hotels and casinos. But Richard Bronson, director of Mirage's Atlantic City operations, said the company had no interest in the building as long as it was needed as a school.
"I'll find another facility, it's no big deal," he said. "Atlantic City is not at a loss for having vacant buildings."
But the fact that Mayor Whelan offered the building to casino executives when the city had overcrowded schools suggests that he and other local politicians are more interested in promoting economic development than in improving education, Mr. Williams said. His accusations have touched an especially delicate nerve in some neighborhoods here, where the mostly black residents have long accused the city and the state of putting the casinos' needs ahead of theirs.
"There's thought out there that people don't want housing and schools to be built in Atlantic City, that it should be a resort and not a place for families," Mr. Hill said. "The casinos and the common people can live side by side, but the politicians are making problems."
Adding to the tensions are the community's fears about a possible takeover of the school district. Mr. Williams has said that Mr. Klagholz was fighting his middle school plan to speed up the takeover process, which he and Mr. Hill said they would resist. Many residents of Newark, Paterson and Jersey City have resented state intervention, saying that the state does not understand their schools' needs and rarely seeks their input.
Mr. Williams said in an interview that after spending five years in Paterson's state-operated schools, he believed that takeovers did not work. Mr. Hill said many school officials, parents and teachers resented what they felt was the the arrogance of state officials who thought they knew how to solve Atlantic City's problems. "It's not the monitoring we mind, it's the attitude," Mr. Hill said bitterly. "They're making problems for the children of the Atlantic City, just like they did in Newark and the other places. We feel we are on the right track."
Mr. Peretzman, the Commissioner's spokesman, said that while the school district has proved "unwilling and unable" to improve, there are no plans for a takeover.
Mr. Williams said that dozens of parents and teachers had rallied around him. But a cluster of students waiting for the bus outside the Albany Avenue School today said that fifth-graders did not belong at the school because it was too big and dangerous. They said that fights still broke out daily, that strangers walked in off the street and that older students sneaked to the cavernous basement, where they smoked marijuana and had sex.
"If you bump into someone, they take it the wrong way and get violent," said Marques Johnson, 13, a wide-eyed eighth grader who said his younger sister attended fifth grade at the school. "My grandmother kept my little sister out all week. She didn't want her baby getting hurt."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Koreans Not Rushing to Shake the Hand Holding the Bailout Check

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Even though the United States has pledged $5 billion as part of the International Monetary Fund plan to help South Korea rebuild its economy, many Koreans are not exactly grateful.
Instead, many see the United States as the puppeteer behind the I.M.F., using the international organization to impose conditions that will open South Korean markets and benefit American companies. They see Japan, which is pledging $10 billion, as doing the same thing. 
 "It is very disconcerting that the United States and Japan demanded unbearable market-opening measures as conditions of financial support," Dong-A Ilbo, a daily newspaper, said in an editorial today. "It is not wise for our friendly relations to use such a crisis situation for selfish benefit."
An article in Joongang Ilbo, another major newspaper, was published with the headline "Korean Businesses Revolt Against U.S. Conspiracy to Strip Korean Companies of Power." It said the bailout agreement was designed to disband the big Korean conglomerates, which compete with American and Japanese companies in electronics, automobiles and other industries.
Despite such resentment, the stock market here welcomed the agreement, rising 7 percent and shrugging off, at least for a day, concerns that the rescue will result in slower growth and more corporate failures. The Korean won, which has been in free fall lately, also gained strength against the dollar.
 The stock market continued its rally on Friday, rising an additional 7.56 percent by the midday recess.
The flare-up of anti-Americanism is a potential irritant in the sometimes testy relations between Washington and Seoul. And it is the first challenge for Stephen Bosworth, the new United States Ambassador to South Korea, who arrived here Sunday night, a week earlier than planned, just as Seoul's negotiations with the I.M.F. were entering the final chaotic stages.
A South Korean Government official said, however, that while public sentiment might turn anti-American, relations between the two Governments would not be affected.
Some of the finger-pointing at the United States and Japan is merely an attempt to find a scapegoat for a humbling experience, some analysts say. The bailout is seen here by many as a loss of economic sovereignty -- an emotional issue for Koreans, who have spent much of their history trying to avoid being dominated by bigger powers like Japan and China and who are still smarting from having their country divided after World War II.
Many South Koreans despise the Japanese, their former colonizers, and have an ambivalent attitude toward the United States, which helps protect South Korea from North Korea but sometimes sets the agenda on South Korean foreign policy. And Korea is not alone. Many countries see the I.M.F. as a tool of the United States to spread its free-market philosophy.
The terms of the bailout have still not been made public, and even its overall dimensions are not entirely certain. The South Korean Government said that the deal arranged by the I.M.F. now totaled $57 billion, up from $55 billion, because Italy had agreed to participate and three other countries had increased their pledges.
However, the agreement, which was officially approved by the I.M.F. executive board today, has been widely reported to contain terms that seem to some Koreans to have little to do with rescuing a debt-laden financial system. A ban on the imports of Japanese cars and other products -- which Korea justifies because it has a huge trade deficit with Japan -- is to be lifted, Korean officials said. There is also reportedly a measure to streamline imports of all cars, though an American diplomat here said that he was not aware of any such measure.
In 1996, only 10,000 of the 1.6 million vehicles sold in South Korea were imports, according to the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, a percentage that makes Japan look wide open by comparison.
But a senior United States diplomat said Washington "did not ever put its bilateral trade agenda on the table," though it contributed to the plan as the I.M.F.'s largest shareholder. "We were not bashful about making our view known in specific instances, but this is not a U.S.-designed program," he said.
Parts of the agreement will benefit American and Japanese companies, even if they are primarily designed to help the Korean economy. Stemming the steep slide of the won, for example, would make Korean exports less competitive. Allowing foreign companies to buy Korean financial institutions will inject more capital into the ailing financial system, but it will also help foreign companies expand here. Rumors are already circulating that Citicorp is interested in acquiring a local bank.
Breaking up the close cooperation by the Government, the banks and the industrial conglomerates is necessary because that system led to the investment in unprofitable ventures that contributed to the debt problem. But stemming investment will also help Korea's competitors.
Some United States companies do not support the bailout. Micron Technology Inc., a semiconductor company, argues that American tax dollars should not support Korean chip makers that flood the world with chips, lowering prices and profits.
Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said he had similar concerns.
"We're not against the bailout," he said. But he added, "We know the bailout must include real obligations to change the way the Koreans are doing business."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton Interview: Taxes, Budget, Rights Nominee

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President Clinton conducted today by reporters from The New York Times from a transcript supplied by the White House:
Q. Earlier this week you had a discussion with Chairman Archer, about taxes I presume. Are we going to be hearing something from you about some sort of change, reform, reduction in the tax code, and for what purpose? 
A. He asked me if I would meet with him. I met with him about a year ago, and we talked about his ideas about the tax code. And he wanted to bring a gentleman in who was an expert in, you know, basically his idea that we ought to have some sort of national sales tax. And I said I would be glad to talk to him, and I had a fascinating hour's conversation with him.
I have drawn no conclusion yet about what I would be for, but let me say, my objectives on taxes are -- and my questions about all tax reform is: Is it fair to average American taxpayers? Is it realistic that you can implement the proposal, whatever it is? Will it be good for the economy as a whole? Will it support our continuing growth of our economy? And will it be simpler? Can we do that?
Now, since we've been here, we've done a lot of work to make it easier for people to interact with the tax code. More than half the taxpayers now fill out that simplest little form. Millions of people can file electronically who couldn't before. We've done what we could to really improve the system as it is, based on progressive income taxation.
So at the end of the year, every year, we do this. We're open to new ideas, and I wanted to listen, but I didn't draw any conclusion from it and I haven't reached a decision yet about what, if anything else, I might recommend in this area. . . .
Q. But can we expect to see some form of tax reform or tax relief in the next budget in the State of the Union?
A. No, I wouldn't say -- I don't think I should give you any false expectations there. I can't say yes, I can't say no. I wouldn't rule out the fact that I might find something that I think would work, but I don't have an idea on the griddle as you are doing this interview.
But one thing, let me say, I have a different view about this than some people do. We do not have a surplus now. We do not have a surplus now. We have a deficit now. It's a tiny one, and it's less than 10 percent of what it was when I took office, but the people who say we have a surplus, I think it's very important that we understand what they're saying. They're saying that the deficit has gone down more rapidly than it was predicted to go down when we signed --- when I signed the balanced-budget bill and when it passed back last summer.
Therefore, some people think that we should go back to the curve that we predicted last summer and spend all the money between where we are now and where we were then. I think that is a questionable course. I hope that we can continue to grow at 3 percent a year -- and private sector growth has been over 3.5 percent a year since I've been President. I hope we can continue to do that. But I think that it is not prudent for us to go spending a lot of money that we haven't really realized yet. So I think we have to be very careful -- this so-called spending the surplus -- it is not a surplus that is being spent, it is the difference between the projected deficit line today and the one that existed last summer.
And if we hold tight and save all of that money or most of that money, and show some discipline here, we might get a balanced budget a lot quicker than they thought, and then we can decide what to do. But I think we need to be somewhat careful before we just go spend all this money that hasn't materialized.
Q. Have you had any success in converting anyone in the Senate on Bill Lann Lee?
A. No, but I think it's a real mistake. I think they made a real mistake on that. And I still don't even know -- you know, I've had a pretty good working relationship and a very candid relationship with both Senator Lott and Senator Hatch, and I must say, I'm just -- I'm really disappointed. I just don't -- I just think it was a mistake, and I don't even think it makes political sense for them.
This guy, his life story, his life's work, he made it unambiguously clear that he was going to enforce the law as it is written and interpreted by the Supreme Court; that he would recuse if the specific California issue came up. I mean, this is a -- they just didn't make much of a case for being against this guy. It looked to me like whoever was in this kind of conservative bloc there just decided he was going to take the fall. And I think it's a terrible mistake. I think he's a very able, good man.
Q. Are you going to recess-appoint him?
A.I'm not prepared to make a statement on that one way or the other yet.

HEADLINE: With the Federal Deficit Falling, The President Weighs a Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was weighing a tax cut as part of next year's budget proposal but warned against the temptation of spending a budget surplus that does not yet exist.
Mr. Clinton set guidelines for fairness and economic soundness that any tax cut would have to meet to win his support. His staff members suggested that Republican proposals for a national sales tax or flat income tax fell short of the President's standards. 
 Mr. Clinton has been meeting with Republican leaders as well as his own staff to explore proposals ranging from a comprehensive overhaul of the American tax system to targeted tax incentives designed to advance his policy goals, including programs for workers and communities damaged by foreign trade.
The President said he would consider proposing a tax-cutting measure next year if he were persuaded that it was fair to average taxpayers, good for the economy and would lead to a simpler Federal tax code. But he said he had not decided on whether to propose a tax cut or what one might look like.
The President reviewed the past year and looked ahead to the remainder of his term in a 30-minute interview in his office this afternoon with The New York Times. Mr. Clinton glanced occasionally at a page of handwritten talking points. Excerpts, Page A28.
The President also gave a strong signal that he was prepared to flout Senate Republican objections and use his Constitutional power to appoint Bill Lann Lee as the Justice Department's top civil rights officer while the Senate is in recess.
The President said he was "really disappointed" by the Senate's refusal last month to confirm Mr. Lee, a California civil rights lawyer of Asian descent.
"I think they made a terrible mistake," Mr. Clinton said. "I don't even think it makes political sense for them." He repeated his determination to see Mr. Lee placed in the Justice Department post by any means necessary.
A senior White House aide said Mr. Lee was willing to accept a so-called recess appointment that would give him the job for the next year while the White House continued to lobby for his confirmation. The aide said Mr. Clinton was ready to make the appointment as early as next week if he could not win a commitment from Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, to bring Mr. Lee's nomination up for a yes-or-no vote when the Senate returned in January.
The Senate left town last month without acting on Mr. Lee's nomination after Republicans declared his views on affirmative-action programs to be unacceptable. Senior Republican leaders in the Senate have warned that a recess appointment would profoundly damage relations between Congress and the White House and make it virtually impossible for Mr. Lee to carry out his duties.
Mr. Clinton also spoke publicly for the first time about the dissent by Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to the decision this week by Attorney General Janet Reno not to seek an independent counsel to investigate fund-raising telephone calls by the President and Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Freeh's objections to curtailing the fund-raising investigation would not undercut the Attorney General's credibility. "She did what she had to do based on her reading of the law," Mr. Clinton said. "And everybody knows that she is an independent-minded person."
The President said he hoped that removing the threat of a years-long independent counsel investigation would move Congress to act on campaign finance legislation.
Mr. Clinton spoke at some length about the possibility of a tax cut as part of his budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning next September. He said he met for more than an hour this week with Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, to discuss what form an Administration tax plan might take.
Mr. Archer made his case for replacing the current complex, progressive income tax code with a national sales tax that would eliminate virtually all of the Internal Revenue Service's tax-collection duties. Mr. Clinton was noncommittal about Mr. Archer's proposal, saying, "I have drawn no conclusion yet about what I'd be for."
The President said he did not want to raise "false expectations" about a sweeping revision of the nation's tax-collection system. But it appeared clear that neither Mr. Archer's sales tax proposal, nor other Republicans' calls for a single-rate flat tax would satisfy Mr. Clinton's criteria for changing the current tax system.
Mr. Clinton said any tax plan must answer four questions: "Is it fair to average American taxpayers? Is it realistic that you can implement the proposal, whatever it is? Will it be good for the economy as a whole; will it support our continuing growth of the economy? And will it be simpler?"
White House officials have said a national sales tax and a flat tax would satisfy the fourth condition but fall far short on the others.
The result is more likely to be a modest tinkering with the tax code to finance some of the President's pet projects and those -- like aid for trade-affected communities -- that can win him votes for other priorities, like renewal of "fast track" trade-negotiating authority.
But, Mr. Clinton said, "we should be open to ideas and listen to arguments."
Republicans plan to use tax revision as a centerpiece of their political agenda next year, hoping to appeal to taxpayers with proposals that go much further than anything the Administration is willing to accept.
An aide to Mr. Archer said the Congressman was encouraged by his meeting with the President, calling it an exercise in bridge-building between two politicians who remained far apart on their approaches to taxation. He said Mr. Archer still believed that radical change of the United States tax code must await the election of a Republican President.
Mr. Clinton also sought to dampen speculation about a substantial Administration tax-relief plan by noting that the Federal budget is not yet in balance, despite a sharp drop in the deficit in the last year.
The Federal budget deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $22.6 billion, the lowest figure in a quarter-century. If the economy remains strong, many analysts say, the budget could show a surplus in the next several years.
Many members of Congress are agitating for large tax cuts or new spending programs because they believe the Federal budget problem has been solved. Some Administration officials are arguing that Mr. Clinton should propose new spending on programs that have long been his priorities: health care, worker training, education, child care and the environment.
But Mr. Clinton said such plans represented a "questionable course" because the projected surplus had not yet materialized.
"I think that it is not very prudent for us to go spending a lot of money that we haven't realized yet," the President said. "If we hold tight and save all of that money or most of that money, and show some discipline here, we might get a balanced budget a lot quicker than they thought, and then we can decide what to do."

HEADLINE: Gore Refuses to Concede Fund-Raising Mistakes

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In his first extensive interview about the fund-raising storm that has enveloped him for nearly a year, a defiant Vice President Al Gore today refused to concede that he had made any mistakes in how he raised money or how he handled the political accusations against him.
Casting the furor in partisan terms, Mr. Gore asserted that "the Republican Party is bound and determined to prevent change" in campaign financing. 
 And he said it was unfair for people to dwell on the months of scorching publicity about his appearance at a Buddhist temple, fund-raising solicitations from the White House and his legalistic defense of himself at a news conference in March.
"A snapshot does not have as much accuracy as a moving picture," Mr. Gore said. "Perspective is very important in politics. At the beginning of January in 1997, we had a high deficit, higher unemployment, less people with health insurance."
Many of the closest advisers to Mr. Gore have said he regrets some aspects of how he reacted to the campaign finance accusations. The advisers, inside and outside the White House, also described the accusations as the most severe political crisis of Mr. Gore's career -- one that had upset his carefully planned efforts toward the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.
But Mr. Gore said he was not distracted by the drumbeat against him. Asked repeatedly whether he had made mistakes -- in raising money or in reacting politically -- he did not answer. The closest he came to acknowledging that it had been a difficult year was when Mr. Gore referred to "adversity."
"This has been a great learning experience, really and truly," he said in the interview with The New York Times, in his White House office. "I think that you learn more from adversity than you do from the success. I think growth comes more easily and naturally when you learn how to move past the difficult moments. I think this past year really has been a great year for the country."
For months, Mr. Gore declined requests for interviews. His aides said he was waiting for the Dec. 2 deadline for Attorney General Janet Reno to announce whether she would seek an independent counsel to investigate telephone calls by President Clinton and Mr. Gore. Ms. Reno declined to appoint a counsel, but she said the Justice Department's inquiry into campaign finance practices in the 1996 campaign was not over.
In the interview, Mr. Gore was clearly seeking to move beyond the accusations about his conduct. Asked about the controversy over Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had made clear his disagreement with Ms. Reno's decision, Mr. Gore said:
"I haven't heard such comments. The only comments I heard were perfectly proper, and I've had a productive, appropriate working relationship with him. But this was Attorney General Reno's decision."
Mr. Gore did not say he had regrets about the March news conference, for which he has been lampooned for repeatedly defending his phone calls from the White House by saying there was "no controlling legal authority" on whether they were permissible. Today, he said of the event: "There were misunderstandings that came out. But the full and independent review confirms the essential elements of what I said."
Mr. Gore also defended some of his closest advisers who have been accused of using their connections to him to lobby the Government in exchange for lucrative fees. Asked about Peter S. Knight, one of Mr. Gore's closest friends who has come under scrutiny for his lobbying, the Vice President said:
"Peter is one of the most honorable, honest men I have ever known in my life. The partisan attack against him has hit way wide of their intended mark. He's a great friend."
Among other things, Republicans accuse Mr. Knight of using his 20-year friendship with the Vice President to help a Massachusetts company win Government contracts and a visit from Mr. Gore.
Mr. Gore said he did not feel responsible for friends who had been pulled into the inquiries.
"Everybody who gets involved in national politics," he said, "understands that the partisanship is higher now than a few years ago."
The Vice President struggled for an answer when asked several times whether he had learned any lessons from this year, or whether he would do anything differently in how he raised money. He asserted that the attacks on his integrity had not exacted any personal toll on him.
"Putting things in perspective involves understanding part of the attacks are part of the American political system," he said. "It's always better to see them in perspective and not as a personal matter. That's an important lesson to learn. It was reinforced periodically this year."
Throughout the interview, Mr. Gore adhered to generalities, declining even to describe what he disliked about the existing system of raising money for campaigns. Asked about what some lawmakers consider an unseemly process, Mr. Gore said, "The American people are right to demand change, and we agree that sweeping campaign finance reform is needed." He then said the Republicans were "content with the current system."
Determined not to be engaged on the subject, Mr. Gore responded to some questions by referring to the news conference he held eight months ago -- saying his perspective had not changed.
Asked whether he would be more cautious in raising money, he said it was "premature to speculate" about his political ambitions.
He was far more interested in talking about matters like global warming and the humming economy.
Charles Burson, counsel to Mr. Gore, said in an interview that the Vice President was bracing for more accusations from Republicans.
"They're going to keep attacking him," Mr. Burson said. "They're going to keep dredging up the Buddhist temple. You just got to deal with it because it's going to keep coming. I don't see it letting up."
But Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, offered a bright outlook for Mr. Gore today.
"My bet is Al Gore will be the nominee," Mr. Reed told reporters. "I think relatively handily."

Europeans Move to Banish All Tobacco Ads by 2006
Europe's health ministers agreed to prohibit all forms of tobacco advertising during the next nine years, going far beyond restrictions now in force in the United States. 
 The agreement, coming atop an existing ban on broadcast ads, would banish the Marlboro man and all other cigarette brand symbols from billboards, print media, clothing and eventually would even outlaw cigarette company sponsorship of sports or cultural events. The accord is a big defeat for tobacco companies, notably Philip Morris, the largest cigarette seller in Europe. Page A1.
 
Subpoenas were issued by a Congressman to force four cigarette makers to divulge hundreds of internal documents that an official has said may show an industry conspiracy to hide the health dangers of tobacco. A26.
 
Union Pacific Order Is Extended
Federal regulators extended an emergency order that Union Pacific open some track to competitors to help ease traffic congestion on its railroad system, the nation's largest. Union Pacific had argued the backlog could be eliminated, but shippers told regulators that problems still remained. D4.
 
Shoppers Still Want Bargains
November sales results from major retailers show American consumers remain mostly interested in things offered cheaply, upholding a sentiment that has prevailed during the holiday selling season for the past few years. For the most part, merchants that specialize in discount goods fared better than competitors last month. D6.
 
Third-quarter worker productivity grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate, slower than the 4.5 percent previously estimated but still the best gain in five years. D3.

Wells Fargo Shares Surge
Shares of Wells Fargo & Company soared after its chief executive said he would be willing to entertain a takeover bid if the price was right. Analysts said the bank might sell for as much as $40 billion, and speculated on possible buyers, including Norwest, U.S. Bancorp and Nationsbank. D2.
 
Mass Layoffs at Singer
Hurt by Southeast Asia's weakened economies, the Singer Company said it would close some factories and dismiss nearly 6,000 workers, or 28 percent of the sewing machine company's labor force. D4.
 
Fallout From Sunbeam Deal
Three months after he approved an endorsement agreement with the Sunbeam Corporation, the chief executive of the American Medical Association resigned. The official, Dr. P. John Seward, said the endorsement contract, which drew sharp criticism, "was a serious mistake." A24.

West Bank Building Goes On
Though the United States has suggested a "timeout" in building settlements in the West Bank, the construction continues at a brisk pace. The Israeli Cabinet voted last week to approve a withdrawal from the West Bank, but declared it would set the time and scope only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented his plans for a final political agreement there.

India Calls New Elections
President K. R. Narayanan ended weeks of political squabbling by setting new elections for February, three years early. The move ended 18 months of fragile coalition government. Mr. Narayanan called the election after concluding that Prime Minister I. K. Gujral's coalition, which resigned last week, could not be reconstituted with a parliamentary majority. A11
 
Push for Nazi Compensation
At the close of a conference on Nazi gold, the United States tried to increase pressure to have compensation paid within the next two years to hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors.

French Court Frees American
A trans-Atlantic legal storm erupted when a French court refused to extradite Ira Einhorn to the United States to carry out a life sentence for bludgeoning his girlfriend to death in Philadelphia in 1977. Mr. Einhorn, who was tried in absentia in 1993, was set free by a French court, which said it made its decision because he would not be guaranteed a retrial in the United States. In France, a defendant tried in absentia has the automatic right to a retrial once arrested. A7

Clinton Weighs Tax Cut, But Insists on 'Fairness'
President Clinton, in an interview with The New York Times, said he is weighing a tax cut as part of next year's budget proposal, but warned against the temptation of spending a budget surplus that does not yet exist. He set a series of tests that any tax cut would have to meet to win his support -- tests for fairness and economic soundness that his staff suggested key Republican proposals for a national sales tax or 'flat' income tax do not meet.

Tobacco Data Subpoenaed
Congressman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a staunch tobacco industry ally, said he had issued subpoenas to force four major cigarette producers to divulge hundreds of secret internal documents that a court official has found contain potential evidence of a crime or fraud.

Folic Acid Recommended
Adding even a small amount of folic acid to women's diets in their childbearing years should reduce brain and spinal cord birth defects sharply, a study suggests.

NINE WEST SAYS EARNINGS WILL FALL SHORT OF FORECASTS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Nine West Group Inc. said late yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings would be 35 to 40 cents a share, well below analysts' forecasts. Nine West, which is based in Stamford, Conn., makes and sells women's shoes and accessories. It was expected to earn 56 cents a share in the quarter ending Jan. 31, according to analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International Inc. Earnings of Nine West have been reduced by its mistiming of fashion footwear trends, weak demand for products, shipping problems and weakness in the Asian economy, where it operates stores. The company also said third-quarter earnings fell 2 percent to $34.6 million, or 95 cents a share, for the quarter ended Nov. 1, from $35.3 million, or 96 cents, in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Gas Taxes Curb Pollution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Nov. 30 front-page article on pollution and light trucks faults the auto industry for making inefficient, high-emission products, but Detroit is only providing what customers want. Even the paragons of efficiency, the Japanese auto producers, have been rushing to introduce light trucks to maintain their position in the United States market.
Customers can buy large numbers of trucks because the cost of gasoline in the United States is a negligible part of operating the vehicle. In Europe and Japan, where gasoline costs $3 to $5 a gallon, light trucks are not popular, fuel efficiency is higher and emission levels are lower. 
 If the Government and the press are serious about fuel efficiency and emissions, they should be proposing a substantial gas tax which, by the way, has been proposed in the past by the United States auto industry itself.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
A City Built on Four Wheels and a Full Tank

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
I remember Detroit during its days of glory in the late 1940's, when the assembly lines were churning out the cars the country had gone without all during the war. It was a proud, self-confident city.
My father took me there to watch the Tigers' great lefthander, Hal Newhouser. We would stay at the Statler or the Book-Cadillac, a pair of swell big-city hotels, shop for my mother at Hudson's, one of the nation's premier department stores, and eat dinner at Lester Gruber's London Chop House, a clublike restaurant that served better food and wine than any club I know of. 
 All gone now, except Hudson's, and it's in the suburbs, along with its customers. The rivers of asphalt that Detroit laid down to handle the cars it built -- the expressways named for industry titans like Edsel Ford and Walter P. Reuther -- turned out to be exit ramps for the bulk of the city's white population. Detroit was left with a rotting core surrounded by prosperous suburbs, a kind of Los Angeles with snow.
The Hideaway Report, a newsletter for moneyed tourists, reported last year that its readers considered Detroit the world's least appealing destination.
Pity. Cultural riches abound, survivors of those distant days before the 1967 riots and the 1973 oil shock. The Detroit Institute of Arts is the nation's fifth-largest art museum and one of its most comprehensive. An excellent, innovative Museum of African-American History opened just last spring.
The Detroit Symphony Orchestra has one of the most venturesome conductors of the day, Naeme Jarve, and the Detroit Opera, housed in a splendid hall, brings singers of the caliber of Maria Ewing and Ruth Ann Swenson here. The Cranbrook Art School, which produced atavars of modern American design like Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia and Florence Knoll, is close by.
Detroit was founded by the French as a fur-trading post. It sits on the narrow Detroit River, which along with Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River links Lake Erie to Lake Huron. The name means "strait" in French, and French names also survive in the city's street grid -- Gratiot, Livernois, Beaubien.
 
Bouncing Back Again
Now Detroit is on its fourth or fifth comeback attempt. General Motors is moving its headquarters into the Renaissance Center, a relic of failed earlier comebacks. The football Lions are headed back downtown from exurban Pontiac, to play in a new stadium near a new ballpark for the Tigers. For the first time in decades, property values are rising, and licenses have been granted for three casinos meant to make Detroit the Atlantic City of the Midwest.
"This time it will work," said Max M. Fisher, who has helped to finance Republican campaigns in city, state and nation for 40 years. "Times are good, the auto plants are humming and we have a Mayor who gets people together."
Well, maybe. Nobody doubts the political skills of Mayor Dennis Archer, who has just won another term. There is plenty of loose change out in the suburbs; a restaurant called Tribute, in Farmington Hills, which is open only for dinner, and only Tuesdays through Saturdays, sells $70,000 worth of wine a week.
But the clean-up job is enormous. Drive out Cass Avenue on the west flank of downtown; once you leave the marble-clad Ameritech headquarters with its vivid Alexander Calder stabile, you pass block after block of empty, weed-infested lots and boarded-up buildings, bleak as Bucharest. And as David Adamany, outgoing president of Wayne State University, said the other day, "The level of public conflict in Detroit is destructively high, between the city and the suburbs, along racial lines, management versus labor, public officials versus public workers."
 
Automobilia
Cars define Detroit. So begin with a trip to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, which celebrates not only cars, but also the culture they spawned. A 1931 Bugatti Royale is on display, and a gangster's 1929 Packard speedster, and they will soon be joined by Old 16, the Locomobile that in 1908 became the first American car to win a major race; a gas station, diner and motel room stand nearby.
Improbably, the museum also houses fine collections of American glass, silver and clocks. The adjacent Greenfield Village groups historical buildings Ford brought here, including the laboratory of Thomas A. Edison and the Wright Brothers' cycle shop. The place is done up at Christmas with a lavish hand.
The Automotive Hall of Fame, just down the road, honors industry leaders. It is worth visiting just to see the orange and sunflower-yellow 1931 Cord roadster with white sidewalls, which has never been matched for rakish glamour.
Almost at the start, Henry Ford paid a revolutionary $5 a day, and workers came from around the world to earn his wages. They came from the South, too, and many were black; one family brought with them a young son named Joe Louis Barrow, who dropped his last name and won worldwide acclaim as heavyweight champion. His status as a local hero is confirmed in the name of the Joe Louis Arena and in the many-times-life-size statue of his right forearm and fist downtown.
In the 1960's, a producer named Berry Gordy Jr. created the phenomenally popular Motown sound with the help of performers like the Supremes, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson. He started his record company in a house he called Hitsville, U.S.A., near the General Motors headquarters. It is now the Motown Historical Museum.
 
From Slavery to Outer Space
Detroit is nearly 80 percent black, so it is an ideal site for the 120,000-square-foot Museum of African-American History, which tells its often appalling story soberly and effectively. Powerful exhibits designed by Ralph Applebaum, who created the displays at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, range from slave manacles to a space suit worn by the first black female astronaut. Recordings of New Orleans jazz and bop, films of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Barbara Jordan at the peak of their oratorical form, and historical photographs round out the collection.
A false dichotomy has been set up by some critics between the Institute of Arts and the Museum of African-American History, which are only two blocks apart. One is pictured as white and elitist, the other as black and populist. But in fact they are up to completely different things. One takes an encyclopedic approach to the fine and decorative arts (not excepting works by such leading black artists as Romare Bearden), while the other includes art as one element in its story.
On the Sunday when I was there, the crowd at the Institute of Arts was predominantly black, while the visitors at the African-American museum were mostly white and Asian. Go figure.
Despite cutbacks in Government financing that permit it to open only 27 hours a week, despite the loss of a talented director to the Frick Collection in Manhattan, the institute looks surprisingly spiffy. Its collections are dotted with masterpieces too numerous to mention, but I was struck, in meandering through its rooms, by the richness of the colors in many of its best works: an icily white Meissen crane by Kaendler, three glowing predella panels by Sassetta, Bruegel's exuberant "Wedding Dance," a self-portrait in blue and gold by van Gogh, a view of the Mexican volcano Cotopaxi erupting through a fiery sky by Frederic Edwin Church, a pulsating scene in the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem by Reginald Marsh, and one of Emil Nolde's many "Sunflowers."
Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist, supplied the museum's centerpiece, a series of frescoes on the walls of a central courtyard. Those on the two long walls show a Model-T assembly line and engine-block plant. They are unabashed hymns to the dignity of working men of all races, many of whom are shown wearing fedoras as they toil.
 
Notable Architecture
Plenty of out-of-town architectural stars worked here, from H. H. Richardson to Cass Gilbert to Frank Lloyd Wright. But the architect-in-chief of Detroit's Golden Age was Albert Kahn, a German-born immigrant (no relation of Louis I. Kahn, the Philadelphia architect of a later day, who came from Estonia). He built mansions for industrialists in Grosse Pointe (including a Cotswold-style spread for Edsel Ford at 1100 Lake Shore Road, which is open to visitors), libraries for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the immense River Rouge plant for Henry Ford.
His Fisher Building, in the midtown district known as the New Center, is an Art Deco masterpiece. An arched hallway three stories high cuts through it, punctuated by eight massive cylindrical chandeliers. (An Art Deco gem by other hands is the Guardian Building at 500 Griswold Street, decorated with patterns of gaily colored, locally made Pewabic tiles.)
Kahn also built a house called Cranbrook in Bloomfield Hills, north of the city, for George G. Booth, owner of The Detroit News, who converted his estate into an educational complex including boarding schools for boys and girls and an art school. Eliel Saarinen, a Finnish architect who had placed second in the international competition in 1922 for the Tribune Tower in Chicago, designed the campus and headed the art school.
The peristyle at the art school, a severe, unornamented sandstone gate with a fountain by the Swedish modernist Carl Milles, now houses a small museum that mounts temporary shows as well as a permanent exhibition of works by Saarinen, his son, Eero, and other eminent students. It is a dictionary of American taste, circa 1965, with Eero's pedestal chairs and the Eames's bent plywood ones.
During the warmer months, the house Eliel built for himself and his family on the Cranbrook grounds in a refined Deco style is open to the public.
A drive of only about 20 minutes brings you to the G.M. Technical Center, one of Eero's masterworks along with the CBS Building in Manhattan and Dulles International Airport near Washington. It is one of the projects studied by every would-be architect in the United States.
Like the automobile itself, the long, low buildings are constructed primarily of glass, steel and aluminum, but the end walls are made of glazed bricks in vivid colors -- royal blue, yellow, red. They are grouped (at Twelve Mile and Mound Roads in Warren) around a lake in which fountains play out a computerized "ballet" devised by Calder. A three-legged stainless-steel water tower stands like an exclamation mark above this remarkable ensemble.
 
Attractions And Events
 
Here is information about places mentioned in the article about Detroit and other sites:
 
Where to Stay
 
RIVER PLACE, in a redeveloped area just east of downtown known as Rivertown, is much the pleasantest place to stay anywhere near the center, at least until General Motors has shaken up the grim, silolike Westin, whose truly abysmal service makes it the weakest link in that chain. River Place, built in 1902, has 108 large, modern, individually decorated rooms, half with views of the water, plus an indoor pool and two tennis courts. 1000 River Place, (800) 890-9505. Daily weekend room rates, $99 to $149.
THE RITZ-CARLTON, is the top luxury hotel in the Detroit area with all the usual Ritz amenities: chandeliers, antiques and acres of marble. Rooms are a bit small, but prices are gentler than at most of the group's properties. The food is good and the service near-perfect. Fairlane Plaza, 300 Town Center Drive, Dearborn, (800) 241-3333. Weekend room rates, $155 to $180 a night.
THE DEARBORN INN is a Georgian-style alternative on the west side, next to Greenfield Village and close to Ford headquarters. Built by Henry Ford in 1931 in mellow red brick, it was tastefully restored a few years ago by Marriott. A solicitous staff helps make it a good choice for families. 20301 Oakwood Boulevard, Dearborn, (313) 271-2700. Weekend room rates, $79 to $89 a night.
THE TOWNSEND HOTEL is my own favorite, a snug little gem with a wood-burning fireplace in the lobby and charmingly decorated rooms and suites. Tucked into the shopping district of Birmingham, a smart suburb north of town, it is not far from the Cranbrook Art School. At full tilt, it sometimes seems just the slightest bit understaffed. 100 Townsend Street, Birmingham, (800) 548-4172. Weekend room rates, $169 to $240 a night.
 
Where to Eat
 
TRIBUTE may be the best restaurant between New York and Chicago; it is certainly the finest in Detroit. In the far northwest suburbs, right at a freeway exit, it is the creation of an inventive chef, Takashi Yagihashi, and an ebullient, pony-tailed maitre d'hotel, Mickey Bakst. One night recently, the menu ranged from risotto with white truffles to bracingly fresh sashimi to perfectly judged New Zealand venison. The room sparkles with colored glass and the glass-walled wine cellar sparkles with the best of France, the Napa, Oregon, Italy and Australia. 31425 West Twelve Mile Road, Farmington Hills, (248) 848-9393.
FORTE. Wackily shaped mirrors and yards of velvet give Keith Famie's new brasserie a distinctive personality, as does the noisy, well-heeled crowd. The chef is a magpie, drawing inspiration from a multitude of sources. He imports rice from Valencia for his paellas, bakes his pizzas in a proper Neapolitan oven and pairs his lamb chops with a Gorgonzola and potato pie. My pick: real osso bucco with saffron risotto and porcini mushrooms enriched and enlivened with balsamic vinegar. If there are a lot of you, ask for the appetizer assortment served in an antique silver bain-marie. (201 South Woodward Avenue, Birmingham, (248) 594-7300.
FIVE LAKES GRILL. Brian Polcyn used to run the Pike Street Grill in Pontiac, but the commute wore him down. So he retreated to the village of Milford, northwest of town, where he and his family have lived for years, and started the Five Lakes Grill. The decor is spare, the furniture plain, the service Midwest-sweet and the cooking deft (sauteed Great Lakes pickerel, smoke-roasted pork loin, Amish chicken breast stuffed with pecans and spinach). (424 North Main Street, Milford, (248) 684-7455.
THE RATTLESNAKE CLUB. Detroit's best-known chef, Jimmy Schmidt, has stretched himself thin since he started opening casual joints in the suburbs. On its good nights, the Rattlesnake Club, his original restaurant, serves excellent New American food, including skillfully handled freshwater fish like perch and whitefish. The wines are well selected. But bad nights -- kitchen misfiring, waiters disorganized -- come dishearteningly often, especially since there are so few other first-rate options close to downtown. 300 Stroh River Place, (313) 567-4400.
MON JIN LAU is much loved by local chefs for its inventive pan-Asian fare, like chili-pepper squid and Mongolian rack of lamb. Situated in Troy, land of K-Mart and used-car lots, it is an excellent choice on Sunday night, when many area restaurants are closed. 1515 East Maple Road, Troy, (248) 689-2332.
ZINGERMAN'S, the deli of my dreams, is unmatched outside New York. You can choose whitefish salad on onion rye, pastrami sandwiched between potato pancakes, silky chopped liver, corned beef (the real thing! in the Midwest!) or brisket with schmalz. To go: home-baked breads, mustards, oils, jams and the best selection of English farmhouse cheeses this side of Cheddar. 422 Detroit Street, Ann Arbor, (313) 663-3354.

HEADLINE: Heroin and Red Herrings

BYLINE: By Michael Massing; Michael Massing writes frequently about the drug problem in America.

 BODY:
The recent deaths of 10 young people in Plano, Tex., who had overdosed on heroin seems further evidence that more members of the middle class are using the drug.
A booming Dallas suburb with a median household income of more than $50,000, Plano is the last place where one would expect to find an heroin epidemic, least of all among people as young as these victims, one of whom was only 14. 
 The news about Plano is only the latest of many alarming accounts of heroin's growing hold on affluent Americans. We have read newspaper articles and seen television news programs about strung-out stockbrokers and models, movie stars and rock musicians.
There is no doubt that the drug's use has increased in areas like Hollywood, the East Village and Wall Street. Supplies of heroin are up, in a form pure enough to snort rather than inject. This has heightened the narcotic's allure for some Americans, especially those too young to remember the heroin epidemic of the late 1960's. Yet the amount of attention these well-heeled junkies have received is out of all proportion to their actual number.
None of the leading drug surveys bear out the claims of a new wave of middle-class heroin use. The 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that just 0.2 percent of the more than 18,000 people polled had used the drug in the preceding year. A mere 0.1 percent had used it in the past month.
And according to the University of Michigan's annual survey of high school students, just 1 percent of all the country's 12th graders questioned in 1996 said they had used the drug in the past year. It's true that in the last few years that number has gone up, but this is hardly the stuff of a national crisis.
The uproar over middle-class heroin use overlooks those with the real heroin problem, addicts in the inner city. This population of hard-core users, numbering about three million, constitute our nation's true drug problem.
Longtime users who have burned out on cocaine and crack have been turning to heroin and its more mellow high. Many add it to crack and smoke it in a pipe; others mix heroin and cocaine together and inject it in a potent cocktail called a speedball.
Since many of these users are homeless, unemployed and emotionally disturbed, they tend not to show up in national surveys. Unfortunately, policy makers are oblivious to them as well. Current drug policy has become almost completely irrelevant to what is going on in the street. The Clinton Administration's latest initiative, unveiled with great fanfare earlier this year, is a $195 million television advertising campaign aimed at keeping young people off drugs. While such a campaign probably won't hurt, it will do little to help chronic, longtime users, most of whom are adults.
That money would be much better spent on new treatment slots at rehabilitation centers, many of which have long waiting lists. Addicts don't vote, however, and so politicians have little incentive to help them.
And, while we broadcast public service announcements on television, heroin, crack and cocaine will continue to afflict those in the inner city. The effects can be seen in the many children who are abused by drug users, addicts who get H.I.V. from dirty needles and the street people who overdose. These are the real-life victims of heroin -- even if they don't make the nightly news.

HEADLINE: A New Journal: A Digest That Feeds on Digests

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Caught the article about Heidegger's craving in Diacritic's special fall issue about addiction? How about that piece on Dutch Domestic Realism in the spring issue of Representations? Or Critical Inquiry's page-turner on the trauma of Dada montage?
Welcome to the world of scholarly and ideas journals, where a typical cover line could be "Blankness as a Signifier" and a healthy circulation is around 2,000 (F.Y.I., Better Homes and Gardens' circulation is 7.6 million). 
 Little known outside the contemplative campuses of academia, many of these journals explore topics that can intimidate even the most formidable of intellects: structuralism, post-structuralism, post-modernism, post-colonialism. Despite their seeming obscurity, such journals have played an important role in the development of scholarly movements that have influenced what generations of students are taught and in fierce intellectual debates that have reverberated through American society, for example, the culture wars and feminist legal theory.
"Work that looks like it's being done in an ivory tower actually can have very far reaching consequences for the way that cultures grapple with their own meanings," Stephen Greenblatt, a co-editor of Representations who teaches English at Harvard University, said in an interview. "Intellectuals often tell themselves that it basically doesn't matter. But in fact, it's a lie."
The field is jam-packed, with publications ranging from such new titles as Doubletake to established periodicals like Partisan Review. In addition to political journals, literary journals, scientific journals, there are journals that deal with fine arts, race, law; journals that grew out of a particular ideology or theoretical school and others that are affiliated with universities or associations.
Now the sociologist Daniel Bell has taken the next step: creating a journal for the journals. On Monday he plans to publish the first issue of the Newsletter of the Committee on Intellectual Correspondence, a twice-yearly, 32-page publication that uses summaries and excerpts from articles drawn from publications in Europe and Japan as well as the United States.
While academic journals typically speak to their own rarefied constituencies (be it the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology or the Journal of Hispanic/Latino Theology), Mr. Bell is hoping disparate journals will now speak more directly to one another across cultural boundaries.
"If you asked American writers who they read in Germany or France or Italy -- other than one or two names -- they'd draw a blank," said Mr. Bell, a professor of social science at Harvard University and author of the provocative books "The End of Ideology" and "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism."
"There is a great degree of specialization in academic life," he continued. "People are involved in their own fields. "
The newsletter is sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Bell is a scholar in residence, the Suntory Foundation in Osaka, Japan, and the Institute of Advanced Studies in Berlin.
Some 60 publications, ranging from better-known magazines like The Nation to more obscure scholarly periodicals like the Tocqueville Review, have agreed to participate.
In the 17th century, the growth of an increasingly educated public hungry for reading material gave rise to idea journals, according to Alan Charles Kors, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in 17th- and 18th-century European intellectual life.
With the explosion in book publishing, Mr. Kors explained, people turned to journals to keep up with current intellectual thought. "The feeling was, you can't read it all but you've got to be able to talk about it," he said. "Learned journals, by their reviews, let you talk as if you had read a book. They also let you know what was worth reading."
In the United States, many academic journals grew out of scholarly associations like the American Economics Association, Mr. Bell said. Although several current publications cut across academic disciplines, they are often identified with specific scholarly movements. Founded 26 years ago and published by the Johns Hopkins University Press, for example, Diacritics became the home of deconstruction (the theory that no text can have a fixed, coherent meaning; for more, look it up) and was one of the first to publish articles about and by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida.
The journal Representations, published by the University of California Press, has become known for promoting the New Historicism, a cultural approach to history that examines influences on everything from books, paintings and battles to kitchen tools. Mr. Greenblatt said he started the magazine in 1983 to make contact with a broader circle of people and ideas.
"I found that some of the most interesting conversations I was having were with people outside my own field," Mr. Greenblatt said. "I began to realize that the group of people I talked to constituted a kind of intellectual community, though not a community that had taken shape as such."
A recent article in Representations looked at the relationship between Western mountain climbers and Sherpas in the Himalayas through two different scholarly lenses. Sherry B. Ortner, a professor of anthropology, first applied the perspective of Orientalism, which explores how European cultures dominate non-Western societies, to mountaineers who risked the lives of Sherpas because they defined them "as not caring about life." Then she used a cultural approach to explain that Sherpas care deeply about death but handle their grief in ways that are unfamiliar to outsiders.
In one of his own articles, Mr. Greenblatt examined the idea that in Shakespeare's plays, fantasy has the power to kill: people are not only murdered, they can be wished dead. In "Henry IV, Part II," for example, Prince Hal thinks his father has died of natural causes and takes his crown, only to then have King Henry awaken. "I never thought to hear you speak again," Prince Hal says. The King replies, "Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought."
The journal Critical Inquiry, started in 1974, prides itself on avoiding ideological labels. "We refuse to be identified with a school or a movement or a particular methodology or discipline," said the journal's editor, W. J. T. Mitchell, a professor of English and art history at the University of Chicago.
Recently the journal's editors had such a heated debate over an essay submitted for consideration called "Who Killed Feminist Criticism?" that they decided to publish it. The article suggested that attacks on feminist criticism for being too white and too Western undermined the movement. "One of our measures of whether something is worth publishing is if it produces a real argument among ourselves," Mr. Mitchell said.
While these journals may create a stir among those who read them, rarely do the editors hear about it. Richard Klein, a co-editor of Diacritics, said he could not recall ever receiving a letter from a reader. "It's very rare that one gets very much feedback," he said.
This has spurred academic journals to make more of an effort to expand their audiences. The journal Transitions, for example, published by Duke University Press, does not include footnotes. Started by the Ugandan intellectual Rajat Neogy in 1961 and revived in 1991 by the Harvard professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Kwame Anthony Appiah, Transition publishes the work of journalists and essayists as well as academics. "Transition has tried to get beyond theory," said Michael Colin Vazquez, the journal's executive editor, "to write for a more popular audience." The cover of the 1996 winter issue featured a photo of Miss Italy in a bathing suit with her crown and scepter.
It is precisely to create a wider, more inviting intellectual community that Mr. Bell started his new consortium of journals. "We wish," Mr. Bell said in the newsletter's introduction, "to retake the common terrain."

HEADLINE: Barney's May Get New Bidder, DFS, as Business Strengthens

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The DFS Group, the world's largest chain of duty-free shops, is preparing to make a bid for Barney's Inc., the New York luxury retailer now in bankruptcy, executives involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
An offer, should one materialize, would come on the heels of strong sales and better cost controls at Barney's and would recast the entire bankrupcty bidding process, which has so far been dominated by Dickson Concepts Inc. of Hong Kong. In August, that company offered to buy Barney's for $205 million and a 49 percent equity stake. 
 The creditors committee is not entirely pleased with that bid -- it has argued that the company is worth more, and is also having trouble carving up the spoils with the Isetan Company of Japan, a former partner of Barney's with which it is embroiled in litigation.
It is not hard to figure DFS's desire for Barney's.
LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods company, acquired 58.75 percent of DFS for $2.47 billion in 1996 and now holds 61.25 percent. DFS's latest store concept, Galleria, has several possible synergies with Barney's.
The Galleria stores, large specialty retail shops in major cities in the Far East as well as in San Francisco, carry many of the same tony suppliers as Barney's, including Giorgio Armani, Chanel, Hermes and Gucci. In the last few years, the company has invested $300 million in those stores and views them as its largest growth vehicle.
Further, LVMH owns several fashion companies, including Christian Dior, Givenchy, Celine and Louis Vuitton, and would welcome another outlet that it controls to sell them through. LVMH also recently acquired Sephora, a French chain of perfume stores, and plans to expand that chain rapidly, offering further possible economies of scale with suppliers.
Perhaps just as important, Isetan, the former Barney's partner and the largest creditor in the bankruptcy, carries many of the LVMH products in its own retail stores in Asia. It appears that a friendly relationship between the two, which is crucial to having the deal done, already exists.
And DFS is run by Myron E. Ullman 3d, which may provide a key to DFS's intensified interest in Barney's, which it first looked at well over a year ago. Mr. Ullman has a long relationship with Thomas C. Shull, who was named president and chief operating officer of Barney's in September. Mr. Ullman was chief executive of Macy's before it was acquired by Federated Department Stores; Mr. Shull was the retail chain's senior vice president for corporate planning. The two were White House Fellows from 1981 to 1982. Both worked at Sanger Harris, a former Federated unit, before it was sold to the May Department Store Company.
Mr. Shull is credited among people involved with the bankruptcy for the recent turn of fortunes for Barney's: Sales in stores open at least one year during the first quarter ended Nov. 1 were $91.4 million, an 11.5 percent increase from the corresponding period last year, and the company is expected to turn a strong profit before taxes this quarter.
If there is an offer from DFS, it will certainly put Dickson Poon, the chairman of Dickson Concepts, in the position of deciding whether he thinks the company is worth getting into a bidding war over. At this point, if he is outbid and chooses to walk away, he will have to be reimbursed $1.5 million in a breakup fee and exit unscathed.
Creditors have estimated that earnings before interest and taxes at Barney's this year could be as high as $17 million, compared with a loss of about $2 million on the same basis last year. DFS would have to pay about 19 times those pretax earnings to beat out Mr. Poon -- a valuation that may be too steep.
Still, while DFS may be quite hungry for the company, Bernard Arnault, the fiercely competitive chief executive of LVMH, must give any bid the final blessing, and he is not fond of overpaying for anything.

HEADLINE: A Good Fit Is Starting to Pinch;
Nine West Tries to Fend Off Investigations and Debt

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Jerome Fisher and Vincent Camuto founded their shoe company in 1977 on a simple but brilliant idea: spot the hottest designs on the fashion runways and quickly make the shoes affordable for the middle-class masses by manufacturing them in Brazil.
The strategy seems to have paid off handsomely for the two men and their company, which was named for its first location, at 9 West 57th Street in Manhattan. The company, now known as Nine West Group, says that one of every five pairs of shoes that American women buy comes from Nine West. In shopping malls across the nation, women with $50 to $80 to spend on a pair of shoes can hardly miss one of the company's 13 brands, from the classy Enzo Angiolini to the comfortable Easy Spirit. 
 But now there are signs of trouble -- everything from investigations by two Government agencies to mounting debts and slower sales. The company's stock, recently a darling among Wall Street's retail stocks, has fallen 45 percent in price from this year's high of $52.75. It closed yesterday at $29 a share, up 50 cents. Much of the drop came after management said in May that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been inquiring for at least six months about possible accounting irregularities concerning its wholesale revenues. Company officials first disclosed the inquiry in a paragraph deep inside a routine public filing. Stunned shareholders wondered why the company had not been more up front about the investigation.
Just when stockholders were beginning to believe management's repeated assurances that the S.E.C. would find little amiss, the shoe company announced last month that the agency was widening its investigation to look at the company's imports from Brazil. The company also reported that customs officials were making a separate inquiry into the Brazilian imports.
Even before the investigations hit, there were problems. Company officials had publicly boasted of double-digit gains in sales. Most of that growth, however, comes from acquisitions and new stores. Take those figures out of the picture, and sales at stores that have been open for several months are falling. For the third quarter, those same-store sales were down 3 percent from a year ago.
The Oppenheimer Total Return Fund decided to sell its 5 percent stake in Nine West about six months ago, after the company's storerooms were left filled with boxes of open-toe shoes that had languished during the snowy spring, said Bruce Bartlett, who manages the fund.
"It looks like an inexpensive stock," Mr. Bartlett said, noting that shares now sell for about 11 times this year's earnings. "But we question the direction of the earnings."
The company, nearly debt free in 1994, borrowed deeply in 1995 when it paid $600 million for the footwear divisions of the U.S. Shoe Corporation. Now it must warn investors in S.E.C. filings that interest expense is eating into its cash and that the high debt could upset its expansion plans.
If anything, the company should be sitting pretty, with 60 percent of its goods coming from Brazil, whose currency has weakened against the dollar. Instead, management warned yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings would be 40 percent lower than expected.
The two founders declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement to shareholders, Mr. Fisher, the chairman, blamed fashion faux pas in part for the disappointing year. He said the company was also facing "shipping challenges" in its accessories division.
"We have taken action by critically evaluating every aspect of our business," Mr. Fisher's statement added. For one thing, the company vowed this week to lower the price of certain shoes by as much as 5 to 8 percent.
Despite selling most of the company to the public in 1993, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto -- who describe themselves as experts in shoes, rather than finance -- are still very much in charge, judging from comments by people inside and outside the company.
Some experts on corporate practice question whether some things would be different if outside shareholders had more sway. Specifically, they find fault with the company's small board, with a chief financial officer who comes straight out of the company's accounting firm and with the company's leasing office space from its two founders.
Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto, the chief executive officer, occupy two seats on the company's five-member board. John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University, said that public companies similar to the billion-dollar Nine West often had boards of 12 directors or more, with 80 percent of the members coming from outside.
The other three directors are C. Gerald Goldsmith, an investment consultant from Palm Beach, Fla.; Henry W. Pascarella, a lawyer in Greenwich, Conn., and Salvatore M. Salibello, a partner at the small accounting firm of Salibello & Broder in New York.
The board, which ordinarily meets only four times a year, has been kind to top management. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto each received $1.8 million in salary and bonus last year. The two have also found another way to make money from Nine West: by sharing a 15.5 percent stake in a partnership that owns the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn. The company is relocating to White Plains but must continue to pay rent -- now more than $2 million a year -- on the Stamford building until 2002, unless it can find someone to sublet it.
At least two family members also work for the company. Mr. Fisher's son, Marc, earned $982,808 last year as president of a division that sells shoes under other companies' names. The chairman's daughter, Jodi, also works at the company, fielding calls from reporters.
Mr. Galvin, the chief financial officer, is a former partner in Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, which has long audited the company's books. He was hired after he advised Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto on the U.S. Shoe acquisition.
It is legal for companies to hire former auditors. But Mr. Galvin's prior employment at Deloitte raises ticklish questions about the independence of the accounting firm before and after he was hired, and about whether a pending job offer could have influenced Deloitte's reading of the Nine West books. Even now, his intimate knowledge of Deloitte's auditing procedures and his relationship with various professionals could make it harder for the firm to conduct its audit.
A Deloitte spokeswoman said the firm would not comment on a client matter.
Mr. Coffee, the law professor, said, "All of this company's watchdogs look a bit tame." He added that the small corporate board and the founders' ownership in the real estate partnership, which would likely be unacceptable at other public companies, seemed to be characteristic of "a somewhat dysfunctional company that has not yet made the leap from a private company to truly public company."
But Mr. Galvin said the company believed that the board was large enough to give its public shareholders a strong voice. He said outside consultants with expertise in corporate compensation had determined that Marc Fisher's salary was appropriate. And he said that while he had worked on the audit of the company while he was at Deloitte, he was not the partner in charge of the audit. He said the entire board -- not just Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto -- had approved his hiring.
In an interview, Mr. Pascarella, the board member from Greenwich, said he was comfortable with the company's management and its response to the investigations. In addition to holding a special board meeting with management this fall, he said the three outside directors had met privately with their own counsel and with representatives of Deloitte to discuss the S.E.C. inquiry. He also said he was confident with management's assurances that the problems were not material.
That said, the scrutiny is proving painful for a company that was always at its best taking on the industry. Now, it has grown so much that it is the industry.
"The founders were very great entrepreneurs," said Faye I. Landes, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc. "But this is now a very big and complicated company." She is not recommending the stock to clients.
The company became more complex with the U.S. Shoe purchase, which doubled the number of its retail stores. Some U.S. Shoe brands were losing money, but Nine West management thought it could turn them around by manufacturing overseas. This year, it closed three Midwest shoe factories that had been operated by U.S. Shoe, so that it could buy even more shoes from Brazil. The company laid off more than 1,000 workers in Kentucky and Indiana, including 300 in Vanceburg, Ky., where the unemployment rate was already more than 10 percent.
Now, S.E.C. investigators are looking at the way Nine West recorded wholesale revenues at some of the former U.S. Shoe divisions, in the seven months from the acquisition through the fiscal year ending Feb. 1, 1996, according to Nine West news releases. The company says it records revenues when the shoes are shipped to wholesale customers, who resell the shoes through noncompany outlets like department stores.
The S.E.C., as is its policy, will not confirm an inquiry or comment on whether one has begun. While it is not clear what the S.E.C. may suspect, some other companies have run into problems with the agency when they overstated sales by shipping products that they knew would be quickly returned or by parking goods marked "sold" in warehouses.
Given management's assurances that the problems were confined to certain brands and involved a limited period, investors were rolling with the punches until the company disclosed on Nov. 6 that the S.E.C. had widened its investigation to look at the way the company was importing shoes from Brazil. "Many people felt misled," said one analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Management said this was very narrow and confined, but it's not."
The company said in its Nov. 6 salvo that it had received an S.E.C. subpoena on Oct. 29 for documents relating to shoes bought from Brazil since 1994, including information on the prices and customs duties paid for those shoes.
Mr. Galvin said he continued to believe that any findings by the investigators would not hurt Nine West financially. He also said that he thought the accounting policies were appropriate and that the company had made no changes to policies or practices since the S.E.C. began asking questions last fall. But such assurances ring hollow to some analysts, who say revisions by the company have forced them to lower their earnings estimates time and again.
"It is still unclear why they are having such a hard time making these estimates," said Ms. Landes of Smith Barney. "It is hard for me not to think that they are sitting in meetings with lawyers much of the time."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photo: "Under Scrutiny"
A year ago, the company that markets one of every five pairs of women's shoes sold in the United States was riding high. Nine West Group's stock was trading at more than $50 a share and its products were selling briskly. But recently things have gone downhill, amid mounting debts, slower sales and disclosures of two Government investigations.
 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Critics find fault with the company's small board, a chief financial officer who comes straight out of the company's accounting firm, and the fact that the company leases office space from its two founders.
 
CUSTOMS SERVICE
In addition to the S.E.C., the Customs Service has started its own investigation to determine whether the company paid proper import duties.
 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION -- The S.E.C. is examining whether Nine West overstated revenues by counting goods that were shipped to distributors but not necessarily sold, and whether it correctly valued imports from Brazil, where it makes 60 percent of its shoes.

HEADLINE: Split Over Poorer Countries' Role Puts Cloud on Global-Warming Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Elements of a possible agreement on cutting industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping waste gases have begun to emerge from intensive negotiations here, and today it was widely believed that the countries could reach agreement on this central issue next week.
But there was little apparent movement on a second key issue, that of the immediate role to be played by developing countries in controlling the gases, and that issue continued to threaten the overall prospects for the success of the talks. It also raised the possibility that while some sort of agreement might be achieved, the United States might find it unacceptable and refuse to sign what would be called the Kyoto Protocol. 
 As the 10-day session on what to do about global warming reached its halfway mark, attention turned to the expected arrival on Monday of Vice President Al Gore and high-level ministers from more than 150 countries, marking the start of the talks' decisive final three days.
Awaiting them will probably be the rough ingredients of an agreement on targets, timetables and structures for cutting rich nations' emissions of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases that scientists say are warming the atmosphere. "I think the elements are there," said Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the talks.
Pieces of an agreement "are beginning to take shape," said Melinda Kimble, a senior State Department official who has led the United States delegation in the early phase of the Kyoto discussions. "We need to tweak them a little more to get them to fit together."
One emerging element is called differentiation, an arrangement whereby countries would adopt different levels of emissions reductions, tailored to their particular national circumstances. Differentiation presents a way around an impasse over a uniform, flat-rate reduction target for everyone. The United States said for the first time on Monday that it would consider the differentiation approach.
Initially, the Americans proposed a one-size-fits-all target of cutting average emissions levels in the period 2008 through 2012 back to 1990 levels. The Europeans proposed a flat-rate reduction of 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Both sets of targets and timetables would be legally binding, and both remain formally on the table at least for now.
A number of countries, including the United States, argue that the range of differentiation should be kept narrow. One way to achieve this would be simply to set a target range for reductions -- say, between 5 and 10 percent, or zero to 5 percent, below 1990 levels. Another way would be to adopt stringent objective criteria, based on countries' varying economic profiles.
A key holdout on differentiation has been the European Union. Many other delegations find this stance unfair, since the European group proposes a form of differentiation for itself. Under what is called the European "bubble" proposal, Europe as a whole would be bound to a firm target. But some countries would be allowed to fall short of the target -- in one case, by 40 percent -- while others make up by exceeding it.
The Europeans have been under intense pressure from the Japanese and the Americans to justify the bubble concept. Europe, in fact, has appeared on the defensive over the issue this week, and some insiders say the pressure on the bubble is a tactic to help extract concessions from the Europeans on other issues, including differentiation for all countries and emissions trading, a mechanism heavily favored by the United States.
In emissions trading, a country or industrial company would be able to meet its emissions reduction target by cutting emissions itself or by buying reductions from another country or company that achieved excess cuts, or both.
Proponents of this approach argue that it provides an incentive for companies and countries that find it relatively easy to cut emissions to go further than required and then profit by selling the excess to companies that find it harder or more costly to reduce emissions on their own. The proponents say this approach achieves reductions most efficiently and cheaply.
The Americans say that market-based, cost-saving mechanisms like trading are essential to any long-term system for emissions reduction, and that at this early stage of a decades-long process such structural matters are as important as the reduction targets themselves.
Meanwhile, the developing countries are continuing to insist that they will take on no further obligations -- beyond a general one requiring them to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases -- until the rich nations act. But unless they do, some key United States senators say, the Senate is unlikely to ratify any agreement emerging from Kyoto.
The senators, in fact, have become more than shadow players in the talks. Several are observers here and have had discussions with a number of delegates. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said here yesterday that he believed the Senate would approve an agreement "if it feels like all countries are reasonably and responsibly sharing in the solution."
No one expects the developing countries to take on the same commitments as the rich nations, and a number of possible options for strengthening developing countries' participation are being considered. One would be a legally binding commitment to limit the growth of developing-country emissions -- though not reduce them outright -- after about 2010.
A proposal to begin talks next year leading to such commitments for all but the poorest countries by 2014 was offered formally tonight by New Zealand with American backing, and it ignited fierce opposition. The chairman of the developing country caucus, Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, said his group would simply refuse to take part in the preparatory talks.
Another option would be to allow developing countries to take on legally binding commitments voluntarily, as their economies grew and matured.
A third option would be what is called "joint implementation." In this arrangement, highly favored by the United States, a business or government in a rich country finances or provides the technology for a specific emissions reduction project in a developing country -- a more efficient, emissions-saving power plant, for instance. The donor country or company would share credit for any emission reductions.
More than two dozen experimental pilot projects are now under way.
A fourth option, proposed by Brazil and favored by the developing countries as a group, would require rich countries that fail to meet targets to pay into a fund that would finance the adoption of greenhouse-friendly energy technologies by developing countries.
Voluntary solutions might not be acceptable to the Senate, Senator Baucus said. Senator Chuck Hagel, a conservative Nebraska Republican who heads a key committee, emphatically agreed and said that new developing-country commitments must begin at the same time as those of the rich nations.
Some environmentalists here are urging the United States delegation to ignore the Senate and go for the best agreement possible. Ratification does not have to come immediately, they say, and in the meantime the United States can proceed with its own domestic emissions reduction program, as President Clinton has said it would do if no satisfactory agreement is reached here. Then, at some future date, the United States might ratify the treaty.
Other interested parties, like Kevin Fay, who heads a moderate business group called the International Climate Change Partnership, say it would be better to put off discussions beyond Kyoto if it looks like no agreement acceptable to the Senate is possible. To do otherwise, he said, risks poisoning efforts to get Congress to approve funds for the domestic emissions-reduction programs.
Not everyone is gloomy about the developing-country issue. Mr. Estrada had this to say: "The only thing the developing countries are waiting for is for the developed countries to make commitments. The moment we have that, everything else will fall into place."

HEADLINE: Markets Feel Minor Impact From Job Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets broke with convention yesterday, as they both shrugged off unexpectedly strong November employment data.
Buoyed by vibrant growth and an inflow of money from foreign investors, the stock market ran its recent rally to six sessions and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks surged to its first new high since the market plunge seven weeks ago. Bond prices, which fell sharply after the Labor Department announced nonfarm payroll jobs jumped 404,000 last month, managed to rebound by the end of the day to erase most losses. 
 For much of this year, good economic news has pushed bond prices lower, as traders and investors worried about rising inflation and an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. Stock prices usually followed suit, though a robust economy should be good for corporate earnings.
But the financial turmoil in Asia seemed to have changed the equation.
The optimistic interpretations of the strong jobs report that let the stock market rally and the bond market rebound seem based on a newly optimistic view of Asia. A month ago, Asian financial shocks were causing stocks to plunge and many investors to seek a haven in the bond market.
Now, many investors appear to think the bailouts by the International Monetary Fund are containing the problems and that the drag on the American economy from any slowdown in Asia will actually be a benefit, especially because it could keep the Fed from raising rates.
"The late rally in bonds is related to people who feel that the employment data is old news," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "It may be the best number on employment we are going to see for a long time because Asia will slow down growth."
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, said stock investors were looking through the strong jobs data and seeing the economy slowing in 1998. "And the odds of the Fed tightening, even with these jobs numbers, is not very high," he said. The Fed's policy-making committee meets on Dec. 16.
Stephen D. Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, added, "Investors seem to be convinced that we can have more of the same: moderate growth, low inflation and the Fed not tightening."
In this equation, the biggest question remains moderate growth. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the 12 months ending in September, well above the Fed's goal of 2 to 2.5 percent. If the Asian drag does not slow the pace enough by February, when the Fed meets again on interest rates, the central bank may decide to raise them.
The S.& P. 500 rose 10.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to 983.79, just eclipsing the previous high of 983.12 on Oct. 7. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 98.97 points, or 1.2 percent, to 8,149.13, just 110 points from its high of 8,259.31 reached on Aug. 6.
Mr. Pradilla argued that a strong lift for the stock market was coming from oversees investors and from Americans who had invested abroad. "People will not be buying India, Malaysia and Thailand for some time," he said.
The price of the 30-year bond plunged 1 16/32 after the release of the employment report but rebounded to end down just 1 6/32 at 100 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, surged to 6.16 percent before falling back to 6.08 percent, up from 6.05 percent. On Thursday, the yield had dipped below 6 percent for the first time since January 1996.

HEADLINE: Report Finds Persistent Health Ills Among Young Blacks

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
A group of black academics and community leaders said yesterday that despite the citywide economic progress in recent years, the social and economic conditions among the city's blacks, especially black children and teen-agers, still lag behind those of other groups.
The Urban Issues Group, a New York policy research institute focusing on issues concerning black people in the city, said that its compilation of Federal, state and city data showed that black infants still have the highest rate of mortality in the city, at 13 deaths per 1,000 live births, a rate nearly twice of that of the white infants. 
 "Black children are still faced with tremendous problems in this city compared to the children of other ethnic groups," said Dr. June Jackson Christmas, the executive director of the Urban Issues Group and a former New York City Mental Health Commissioner. "We believe that we've got to challenge New Yorkers of all backgrounds to do something active to help the welfare of black children."
Black infants, she said, are more than twice as likely to be born with low birth weight than the white infants, a condition she said could lead to developmental problems and affect the children's future. Health experts have linked infant mortality to late or inadequate prenatal care, and Dr. Christmas said that pregnant black teen-agers in New York often receive inadequate care.
Dr. Christmas also said that black youths are more likely to drop out of high school and to die from violent crimes and AIDS-related illnesses than members of other ethnic groups in the city. Black teen-agers, she said, also continue to have a higher rate of unemployment compared with their white counterparts. Those with jobs generally earned less than the white youths.
Participants said that recent budget cuts in social services have made it more difficult for them to continue providing services to the needy families in their neighborhoods. Willie Wren, the president and chief executive officer of the Miracle Makers, a family and children services center in Bedford-Stuyvesant, said his agency has already laid off 30 workers and will lay off 7 more by next February, when the city's Department of Health will stop financing a meal program for AIDS patients.
Fred Winters, a spokesman for the Department of Health, said the patients will be fed by other nonprofit agencies. He said his agency has not cut financing to black neighborhoods in the last two years.
The report showed that of the 78 children 12 and younger who were suffering from AIDS in 1995, 48 were black, and of the 77 AIDS-related deaths in 1993 among children of up to 14 years old, 42 were black. In 1993, when 39 whites between 15 and 24 died as a result of homicide, 368 blacks did.

HEADLINE: JOB GROWTH IN U.S. POSTS HUGE JUMP; WAGES ALSO CLIMB

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The American economy showed surprising strength last month by creating 404,000 new jobs, as the unemployment rate edged down to another 24-year low and wages surged, the Government reported today.
Yet the jump in jobs and wages comes with little sign of inflation. And the recent economic troubles in Asia will probably mean lower-cost imports into the United States, putting further downward pressure on consumer prices. 
 So, at least for the moment, the traditional worry that more jobs and higher wages will surely bring inflation and higher interest rates is being set aside.
For once, what was good for workers was also seen as good for Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.97 points, to 8,149.13. Bond prices plunged early in the day but recovered somewhat. The yield on the 30-year Treasury ended the day up three-hundredths of a percentage point at 6.08 percent.
Looking at the jobs report, economists and analysts saw evidence of optimism for household incomes, corporate profits and even holiday retail sales.
"We're in the best of all possible worlds," exulted President Clinton's chief economic adviser, Janet L. Yellen. "This was just stunning job growth."
The addition of more than 400,000 jobs was twice what had been forecast by most economists. The jobless rate declined by one-tenth of a percentage point from October, to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest since October 1973 -- before the Arab oil embargo. Without signs of inflation reviving, economists say, there seems to be scant threat to the current economic expansion, which is now almost seven years old.
Hourly earnings did climb a hefty 7 cents, which analysts said would encourage holiday shopping, but this was not thought likely to overly concern the Federal Reserve, which meets Dec. 16 for the year's final deliberations on monetary policy.
Over the latest 12 months, earnings rose 4.1 percent. Using the most recent monthly measure of consumer prices, the real gain in wages -- that is, adjusted for inflation -- is running at 2 percent, the highest in two decades, according to David Wyss, director of research at DRI/ McGraw-Hill, a research firm.
Analysts generally agree that the economy has been growing too fast over the last year to keep inflation at bay for long. But they say the turmoil in Asia will serve as a brake on the American economy, with the Asian nations tightening their belts and buying fewer goods from America, perhaps knocking half a percentage point from growth in total output.
So, the troubles in Asia, economists say, may slow the American economy enough that the Federal Reserve will not have to cool off the economy with higher interest rates.
At the same time, most economists agree with the Administration's contention that the economy is plenty strong enough to cope with the expected falloff in demand for American goods from Asia.
"We're well positioned to absorb repercussions from the Asian situation," Ms. Yellen said in an interview.
From around the country, employers and workers attested to the booming labor market, reflected in the third-biggest monthly increase in payrolls this decade.
John Stollenwerk, president of the Allen-Edmonds Shoe Corporation in Wisconsin, said he snapped up seamstresses and other workers when a company in Milwaukee closed down. "We sought these stitchers the way the crusaders sought the Holy Grail," he said.
One of the employees, Maria Gonzalez, said simply, "They hired me quick."
Today's report showed that Hispanic workers have benefited particularly from the labor shortage, which is most pronounced in the Midwest. The unemployment rate for Hispanic workers tumbled to 6.9 percent in November from 8 percent in October and is now at its lowest since this rate was first calculated in the early 1970's.
Another record was set as the proportion of the working-age population with jobs -- the so-called employment-population ratio -- rose three-tenths of a point, to 64 percent.
In contrast to some months when big swings in payrolls are attributed to things like strikes or storms, the November figures did not reflect any special circumstances, Labor Department officials said.
"A booming November employment report," was how James McCormick, an economist at J. P. Morgan, described the situation to clients. "The message is that the economy is still strong, the labor market is getting increasingly tight and wages are accelerating."
By region, the shift was greatest in the West, where the jobless rate fell four-tenths of a point, to 5 percent. Elsewhere, unemployment was only slightly lower or unchanged -- with the Northeast at 5.1 percent in November, the Midwest at 4.2 percent and the South at 4.5 percent.
Not only did payrolls swell by 404,000 last month, the growth for September and October was also revised up a combined 34,000, to bring the three-month average to a staggering 330,000. The gains were heaviest in services and retail trade, but factories added 44,000 jobs, the third big increase in four months, and construction jobs jumped 29,000, despite unusually cold weather.
Retailers, facing a shrinking labor pool, were nonetheless able to recruit workers for the holiday season. Department stores put 31,000 more people on payrolls. Restaurants and bars hired 30,000 more people, the first big increase since July.
Despite the stock market's slide in late October, the finance industry added 15,000 workers last month.
Some 671,000 more people had jobs last month than in October, enough, when combined with a 453,000 expansion of the labor force, to trim the nation's unemployment rate one-tenth of a point. This matched the 4.6 percent last posted in October 1973; the rate has not been lower since a 4.4 percent reading in March 1970.
"The tailwinds behind the U.S. economy are strong," concluded Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. But, he said, "powerful headwinds" loom, especially the Asian crisis, which he expects will hold growth in the American economy in the first half of 1998 to a 2 percent rate, barely half that of the latest 12 months.

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits 5 1/2-Year High Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar jumped yesterday after a surprisingly strong United States employment report, hitting a five-and-a-half-year high against the yen and overcoming warnings that Japan might act to curb further weakness in its currency.
The rise put the dollar in New York above 130 yen for the first time since May 1992. 
 Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka of Japan briefly interrupted the rally in Asian trading, saying in a Tokyo news conference that Japan was prepared to deal with excessive yen weakness in a "timely and appropriate way."
Unconfirmed reports that Japan quietly used money from its foreign exchange reserves to make dollars available to Japanese banks also briefly checked the advance. Some troubled Japanese banks are having difficulty borrowing dollars cheaply in international money markets.
But more investors flocked to the dollar after the Labor Department said payrolls surged 404,000 in November -- nearly twice the expected rise. The dollar also got support from a rally in United States stocks.
 "The dollar has been doing very well and stocks are up," said Doug Lee, an assistant vice president at Sakura Bank Ltd.
In New York trading, the dollar settled at 130.20 yen, up from 129.39 yen on Thursday. The dollar also rose to 1.7830 marks from 1.7715 marks. The pound fell to $1.6573 from $1.6669.

HEADLINE: Partisanship Imperils Advisory Panel on Medicare

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Medicare is such a hot political potato that politicians here realized long ago that using normal legislative procedures, they would never be able to agree on measures to make the program financially secure for baby boomers when they retire.
So they took a traditional Washington escape route. They voted last summer to create a commission to tell them what hard choices to make. 
 But there are strong signals that this approach will not work either, from the partisanship that infects most things here to the natural unwillingess to take political risks. The commission, even though President Clinton filled it out by naming his appointees today, has a task ahead that is all but insurmountable.
The problem is that beginning in the second decade of the next century, there will be many more retirees and many fewer workers paying taxes to support the retirees' health insurance under Medicare. Any long-term solution is bound to have unpleasant aspects: higher taxes on the working-age population, more out-of-pocket costs to retirees, fewer Government-paid medical services for the elderly, restrictions on who is eligible for the program, or some combination of those steps.
"We have an obligation to strengthen it for the next century, to insure that it is as strong for our children as it has been for our parents," the President said today.
In that vein, provision was made in the Balanced Budget Act that Congress adopted and Mr. Clinton signed last summer for an advisory commission, the members to be appointed by the President and Congressional leaders by Dec. 1, to study the program and recommend changes.
The notion was that if a commission of experts could lay out for the public the dire situation facing Medicare when the baby boomers begin to retire, that would provide the cover politicians would need to make difficult choices and cast tough votes.
Now, prospects have dimmed that the commission will be able to set aside partisan differences and resolve how to change the health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled.
First, Mr. Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress found themselves unable to agree on who should become chairman of the commission. The President initially decided to miss the Dec. 1 deadline for picking members and wait to name the four members of the 17-member panel he is allotted until he could announce a chairman. But with the chairmanship still unresolved, he went ahead and named his appointees anyway.
Commission chairmen are generally the ones responsible for whether an advisory panel succeeds or fails. They choose the staff and set the tone for the panel's work.
Then Speaker Newt Gingrich's office said on Monday that he had required his four appointees to pledge in advance that they would not accept a tax increase as a solution to Medicare's fiscal problems.
Most authorities on health policy assume that taxpayers, beneficiaries and health-care providers will all have to contribute eventually to making the Medicare system sound. The Speaker's stricture severely limits the options available to the commission members.
That was the point made by Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, who was approached by Mr. Gingrich about becoming a commission member and declined because he could not take the no-tax pledge.
In an interview later, Mr. Deets said: "The commission should look for all possible solutions. It's too early to take anything off the table. I hope the commission will approach its work with an explorer's mentality, not a crusader's mentality."
Mr. Clinton had a similar response. A tax increase may not be needed, he told reporters on Tuesday, but he added, "I hate to see the commissioners themselves have their hands tied at the outset."
Mr. Gingrich's strong stand against increased taxes had the additional effect of anointing the commission with a distinctly partisan oil.
Republicans have made it clear that they intend to make their opposition to taxes in all forms the cornerstone of their Congressional campaigns next year. The implication of the Speaker's position is that Democrats will be forced to defend themselves at every turn if they do not explicitly reject higher taxes to bolster the Medicare system.
Of course, this is not the first time that politicians have used Medicare for political advantage. For more than 30 years, Democrats have reminded voters in election after election that most Republicans voted in 1965 against the establishment of Medicare.
A repeated theme in the President's re-election campaign last year was his accusation that Republicans were out to gut the program.
But the history of Federal advisory commissions on politically sensitive topics is that the only ones that succeed are the ones that set partisanship aside.
That was the case with the National Commission on Social Security Reform, a panel headed by Alan Greenspan, then a Wall Street economist and now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. With support from Democrats and Republicans, the Greenspan commission voted in 1983 to recommend a package of Social Security benefit cuts and tax increases. Congress enacted the recommendations almost intact.
By contrast, the National Economic Commission, which was supposed to find ways to lower the Federal deficit at the beginning of the Bush Administration, split along party lines and was never able to agree on a set of recommendations.
Rank partisanship is not the only reason to doubt that the Medicare commission will resolve the problem of how to pay for the program after the baby boomers retire.
No one doubts that a serious problem exists. Even if the rise in medical costs could somehow be restrained, the demographics demand change. There are now almost four workers paying taxes for each retiree on Medicare. By 2015, the ratio will fall to about 3 to 1, and by 2050, there will be only two workers per retiree.
But the crisis in Medicare is years away, and politicians almost never make difficult choices unless their backs are against the wall.
In the case of Medicare, Congress adjusted the program this year to stave off insolvency until at least 2007 (the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office) and perhaps 2010 (the estimate of the Clinton Administration's health care actuaries) or even 2015 (the latest Office of Management and Budget estimate). That was plainly responsible in the short term, but by making a long-term solution more difficult, it was perhaps irresponsible in the long run.
The crunch is "at least four election cycles" away, said Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, an authority on health care financing.
"For a Congress in which over half of the members were not on Capitol Hill four elections ago, that is a political lifetime," Mr. Reischauer added. "The Medicare problem will become someone else's problem."

HEADLINE: 16 Evicted as City Closes Building It Calls a Firetrap

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
The Brooklyn building was a hunting ground for rats, not to mention dangerous -- the stairs were rotting, the wiring exposed, the fire escape a ladder to nowhere. But for 15 adults and one child it was still home, something they now lack after being abruptly evicted by the city this week.
The residents of 477 Park Avenue, a single-room-occupancy building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, were evacuated by the Fire Department on Wednesday and Thursday after inspectors determined that the building had been illegally converted and was a firetrap. 
 "They did the right thing by closing it," said Nestor Collazo, 42, an unemployed handyman who lived in a tiny room on the ground floor. "But we ended up on the street."
Along with many of the other tenants, Mr. Collazo returned yesterday to collect some of his possessions. He grabbed his best clothes and an iron, bidding farewell to a room so small he had to stack two night stands on top of a dresser and a television still on top of that.
The upheaval began Wednesday night, when the Fire Department responded to a call of a kitchen fire. Richard Cruz, 32, another tenant, said small fires were an almost monthly occurrence, but that this time several high-ranking fire officials came to inspect the building.
Fire officials determined on Wednesday that the building had been illegally converted into 11 units, with several tenants sharing kitchens and bathrooms, said Chief Brian Dixon, a department spokesman. Mr. Collazo, who shared a toilet with another tenant, said he used a hose in the unlit basement to shower.
On Wednesday, five tenants were evacuated, Mr. Dixon said, and the Department of Buildings was called in. The next day, fire officials re-evaluated the building, determined that in the case of a fire, tenants could be trapped in the back courtyard, and decided to remove the rest of the tenants. Most of those evicted are now staying with friends or relatives; the Red Cross provided rooms at a motel in Queens for five adults and one child.
Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, said that while complaints about illegal conversions were common, the city rarely evicts tenants; rather, it usually gives landlords the opportunity to bring buildings into compliance.
Some housing experts and advocates for the poor have accused the city of turning a blind eye to overcrowded and unsafe dwellings, because they absorb many low-income residents who might otherwise be homeless.
At 477 Park Avenue, Mr. Birkhahn said, the lack of a secondary exit in case of a fire posed an "imminent danger" to tenants. "It was a real firetrap," he said, adding that the Buildings Department had received only one complaint about the building, in 1994, related to an exterior scaffolding.
Mr. Birkhahn said the landlord, Shulem Goldenberg, will have to appear before the city's Environmental Control Board, which will assess a fine for any building code violations. He said the landlord must bring the building into compliance with the law before tenants can return.
Those unable or unwilling to return will be placed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in shelters or new housing.
In the basement of the building, a tangled mass of electrical wiring lay a few feet from a storeroom stuffed with mattresses. There were other hazards: tenants said they would disinfect kitchen tables before eating because rats had crawled over them; a piece of ceiling had collapsed in one bathroom, cracked windows had been repaired with tape.
The building, along with one at 466 Park Avenue, was bought by Mr. Goldenberg, of Brooklyn, from Victor and Marcus Melendez in 1996, according to property records. Mr. Goldenberg also purchased a dilapidated multifamily residence around the corner on Bedford Avenue, records show.
Reached by phone, Mr. Goldenberg said he was in a rush and refused to answer questions. But Victor Melendez, who owns the bodega, Iris Grocery, across the street, said that when he owned the building, "the Fire Department used to come, the inspectors used to come, they never said anything."
Residents at 477 Park said they paid anywhere from $160 to $400 a month for apartments in a range of sizes.
Mr. Cruz, who lived in an illegal extension at the building's rear, said he was eating dinner on Thursday night when he was handed a pink eviction notice. "It was like, boom, they said get out, just like that," he said. "Our Christmas gift was getting thrown out."
Several tenants pinned their notices to a Christmas tree inside the building before leaving.

HEADLINE: Kodak Is Loser In Trade Ruling On Fuji Dispute

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization stunned the United States and the Eastman Kodak Company yesterday by vindicating Japan in a protracted dispute over whether the Japanese unfairly protect their photographic film market.
The ruling by a tribunal of the organization sided completely with Japan and a Kodak rival, the Fuji Photo Film Company, and marked an embarrassing failure for the Clinton Administration, which had portrayed the dispute as a challenge to what it contended was a basic problem with the Japanese economic system. The tribunal's ruling also confronted the Administration with the politically ticklish problem of whether to punish Japan with sanctions anyway to help Kodak do business there. 
 For supporters of Kodak, doing nothing could send a message of United States weakness just as more American companies complain about an inability to penetrate the domestic market of the world's second-biggest economy. But any unilateral punishment would not only risk aggravating already-frayed United States-Japanese trade relations but would also smack of hypocrisy, since Washington had agreed to abide by the panel's findings. Indeed, the Americans pushed hard for the creation of such an arbitration process when 118 nations created the trade organization four years ago. Until yesterday the United States had won all seven rulings in trade grievances it had brought before the trade group.
The findings, delivered by a tribunal of officials from Brazil, Switzerland and New Zealand, are preliminary and subject to review. But it was considered unlikely such a complete rejection of the American arguments would be changed. All 21 points in the United States filing were dismissed.
The panel's report is confidential and sent only to the parties directly involved, but officials from Fuji, Kodak and the United States Government described its contents.
"The panel's findings simply do not address market realities," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. "Even within Japan, it is common knowledge that Japan's market is overregulated, its distribution system is closed and exclusionary business practices are prevalent."
The United States had contended that the structure of large sectors of the Japanese economy violated rules negotiated in 1993 by members of the trade organization.
In its filing, the United States had argued that years of regulations and Government guidance had produced such close ties between film manufacturers and distributors in Japan that foreigners had little chance of success. In Fuji's case, the Americans argued, the company enjoyed exclusive relationships with Japanese film distributors serving more than half the domestic market, largely because the Government had let such relationships flourish.
But the tribunal decided that the Japanese Government's actions, some of which took place 30 years ago, did not amount to restrictions on international trade.
The decision was also a setback for Kodak, the Rochester-based photography giant that has been struggling with losses in other businesses and has been locked in a struggle with Fuji for dominance of the world's film markets. George M. C. Fisher, the company's chairman and chief executive, called the panel's findings "totally unacceptable."
Kodak contended that it had been stymied for years in efforts to expand its 10 percent share of the huge Japanese film market, while Fuji has been capturing a rising share of the United States film market.
But most analysts said yesterday's decision would not wound Kodak. "Kodak is finally getting its consumer marketing act together at home, and that will have a far greater impact on its performance than any W.T.O. decision," said Ulysses Yannas, a securities analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman & Reid.
Most analysts also noted that Japanese consumers were very loyal to Fuji, just as American consumers had shown a distinct preference for their own home brand, Kodak. "Maybe the Japanese market is somewhat restricted, but Japanese consumers just aren't clamoring to buy Kodak film," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Kodak had argued that Japanese restrictions gave Fuji a protected profit sanctuary in Japan, and thus an ample source of cash to subsidize its expansion elsewhere. But most analysts discounted that argument, noting that effectively, if not by Government decree, Kodak had the same type of profit opportunities here. Indeed, despite Fuji's inroads in the United States, Kodak still commands 70 percent of its home film market -- the same percentage Fuji commands in Japan.
But perhaps most important to Wall Street, few analysts accept that Kodak's well-publicized financial woes have much to do with its inability to penetrate the Japanese market.
"No W.T.O. action can change the realities that Kodak's core businesses are under siege while its digital endeavors have failed to establish a beachhead," said John P. Gavin of American Express Financial Advisors.
The international tribunal's decision is politically awkward for the Clinton Administration partly because it comes at a time of domestic discontent with free trade policies. President Clinton failed to persuade Congress a month ago to adopt legislation renewing the Administration's ability to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could adopt or defeat but not amend.
At the same time, the soaring value of the American dollar is producing a widening trade deficit and posing a serious competitive threat to big industries like auto manufacturing.
Both Ms. Barshefsky and Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, pointed out in separate public statements about the trade panel's findings that American options included invoking Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows the President to impose sanctions on countries that restrict American exports.
But for all the tough words, there was little enthusiasm in Washington for a move to impose sanctions.
A senior Administration official pointed out that before becoming final, the text of the panel's ruling must go through a two-month review in Geneva, the trade organization's headquarters.
While the review process is largely a formality, it does give the Administration time to determine what to do next, and possibly seek a settlement with Japan.
If no settlement is reached, the Administration could still appeal the tribunal's decision to the World Trade Organization's appellate division, as Japan and the European Community have already done when they have lost cases to the United States.
The main political pressure on the Clinton Administration during the photographic film dispute has come from Kodak and from New York's Congressional delegation. But Kodak and New York's Senators, while bitterly critical of the tribunal's decision, stopped short yesterday of asking the Administration to impose sanctions on Japan.
Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, issued a joint statement contending that the Japanese market remained closed to Kodak, but called for the Administration to file an appeal with the trade organization. Japan's Government did not comment on the trade panel's findings because it had not seen them. But Minoru Ohnishi, Fuji's chairman and chief executive, praised the findings, saying the panel had "proved its mettle by ruling on the facts."

HEADLINE: As Older Cuban Exiles Die, Young Pragmatists Emerge

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 5

 BODY:
At least once a week as he has done for the past 36 years, Andres Nazario-Sargen, head of the Cuban exile organization Alpha 66, goes to a paramilitary training camp where members dress in camouflage and train with semiautomatic weapons for the day Cuba erupts into armed insurrection against Fidel Castro.
"Gradual change is only in the minds of people who are used to democracy, but that concept is not in Fidel like it wasn't in Hitler," said Mr. Nazario-Sargen, 78, who fought alongside Mr. Castro in the Cuban revolution but now denounces him as "a Hitler-style totalitarian." 
 Mr. Nazario-Sargen represents the unyielding anti-Castro sentiments of the generation of Cuban exiles who lived in pre-revolutionary Cuba as adults and are still fighting to oust Mr. Castro nearly 40 years after he came to power, these days mostly through political pressure rather than violence.
But the death last week of one of this generation's youngest and most prominent members, Jorge Mas Canosa, was a reminder that many of the older Cuban exiles are dying without achieving their political goal, and that younger generations may seek a way to change the government in Cuba through a more pragmatic path than their elders.
This Saturday, Miami's exile organizations plan a march here to reaffirm "our intransigent opposition to Castro's dictatorship," after Mr. Mas's death and on the eve of a cruise trip to Cuba by American Roman Catholics, including Cuban exiles, to see Pope John Paul II when he visits the island, for the first time, in January. But the passage of time is giving that opposition a softer edge. Indeed, while political pressures among the Cubans in the United States work toward the unified hard-line stance symbolized by Mr. Mas, polls have shown a steady generational shift toward a less confrontational position.
A benchmark poll by Florida International University taken every two years found last June that a strong majority still favored the American embargo on trade with Cuba, believed that the American law penalizing foreign companies doing business with Cuba was a good tool to bring about change and supported military action, either by the United States Government or exile groups.
But the poll also found that an increasing number of Cuban-Americans favor negotiations with the Cuban Government: 48 percent, compared with 36 percent in a similar poll in 1991.
The moderate views are mostly found among younger Cuban-Americans and those who arrived in the United States since 1980 and still have family ties to the island. Seventy-seven percent of those ages 18 to 29 favor establishing a dialogue with Cuba, compared with 36 percent among those 65 and older. Among Cubans who arrived in this decade, the poll found that 74 percent favored a dialogue, compared with 38 percent among those who left the island in the 1960's.
Some younger Cuban-Americans are willing to voice sentiments that would have seemed heretical just a few years ago.
Frances Morales, a 31-year-old language teacher born here of Cuban parents, for example, supports negotiations with the Cuban Government to steer Cuba toward democracy. Ms. Morales is sharply critical of what she sees as the counterproductive, confrontational attitude of many of her elders.
"It's ridiculous," she said. "How many years has it been? If something doesn't work, you have to do something about it. You got to be intelligent."
Ms. Morales, who visited Cuba for the first time three years ago to take medicines to relatives, said the experience made it clear to her that more creative approaches to dealing with Cuba were needed.
The passage of time has also tried the patience of many older Cubans, partly because many are pessimistic about change any time soon. The poll in June found that only 36 percent of Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County said they thought that major political change would take place in Cuba within five years, compared with 77 percent in the same poll six years earlier; 17 percent said they thought positive change might never come.
"His excuse all along has been to blame the United States" for Cuba's problems, said Dan Molina, 50, referring to President Castro.
Three years ago, Mr. Molina, a distributor of television sports programs, joined Cuban Change, an organization that seeks normal relations between Cuba and the United States.
"Without an embargo, he has no excuse," Mr. Molina said. "What is he going to tell people? He'd have to adapt or fall apart."
Despite such moderate views, the political agenda that prevails in exile circles is still that of those whose property in Cuba was confiscated and who were forced into exile, of the veterans of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and other paramilitary missions, of the politically imprisoned and the most damaged. It is their pain that silences others who may object to the lack of open political debate about Cuba here or even the playing of music from Cuba on the radio.
In no small measure, some experts on Cuban-American affairs say, Mr. Mas's Cuban American National Foundation solidified this position since its founding in 1981 by gaining unusual political influence here and in Washington.
"That was part of the brilliance of Mas Canosa; they established the moral definition of what it is to be a good Cuban-American," said Guillermo J. Grenier, one of the principal researchers of the Florida International University poll and himself a 45-year-old Cuban-American who left the island as a child. "That's to be anti-Castro, not to be tolerant of views that are supportive in any way of the Castro regime, and to be vigilant and become a watchdog to protect what it meant to be Cuban."
For the older generations, those in their late 50's and older, the death of Mr. Mas at 58 was a particularly harsh blow. Nonetheless, many in the exile leadership say they feel strengthened rather than demoralized.
"Everybody is very saddened" by Mr. Mas's death, said Luis Botifol, 89, a retired banker who helped create the Cuban American National Foundation, which Mr. Mas headed. "But I haven't found anyone destroyed or disillusioned."
Nobody seems to be reassessing strategy. Exiles like Mr. Nazario-Sargen dismiss any negotiation with Mr. Castro as futile because, they say, they know the man, and some insist they are closer to victory. Faulting the Soviet Union's economic support of Cuba and the United States' policy against military intervention for the longevity of Mr. Castro's rule, exiles lately take solace in the fresh signs of internal restlessness in Cuba, in the resurgence of the Roman Catholic faith in the island, and, of course, in the inevitability of Mr. Castro's own death.
Organizers of this weekend's "Patriotic Reaffirmation March" say the event, planned before Mr. Mas died, is also meant to counter any efforts in Congress or elsewhere to use his death to re-examine current policy.
In fact, there are powerful younger keepers of the conservative flame, including Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republican Cuban-Americans from Florida.
Mr. Diaz-Balart, 43, said any change in American policy, like lifting the trade sanctions, depended on Cuba's willingness to meet three conditions: legalizing all political activity, releasing political prisoners and holding free elections.
"What are the other alternatives?" he said. "The clearest voice against dialogue is Castro's. He's made it very clear that he will not democratize and that he'll die in power."
But while few expect a radical change in American policy toward Cuba for now, even some staunch anti-Castro Cuban-Americans say a subtle erosion of the hard line is likely as conservatives like Mr. Mas die, leading to more debate and a more tolerant political environment here. The same generational shifts, some say, will lead to more political openness and improvement in human rights in Cuba.
"As you get away from 1959, you tend to be more moderate and rational, less passionate and traumatized," said Miguel Gonzalez-Pando, 56, the director of the Cuban Living History Project at Florida International University who served two years in Cuban prisons for his participation in the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, two years after Mr. Castro seized power.
Mr. Gonzalez-Pando said he now advocated respect for all alternatives to deal with Cuba because "nobody has a crystal ball."
In Miami, older exile leaders like Mr. Nazario-Sargen say they realize that democracy in Cuba may not occur in their lifetime. Mr. Nazario-Sargen dreams of building a political party in a new Cuba, and he at first laughed, saying, "I'm going to be in Cuba many years."
But then he said that even if that was not to be, "I'm satisfied because I have done everything I could for my country."
"I have successors," he said. "We're all one generation. The generation of freedom."

HEADLINE: How a Fierce Backlash Saved The 'Made in U.S.A.' Label

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. wanted to sell more sneakers to Americans who coveted the "Made in U.S.A." label. Trouble was, many of the shoes New Balance made at its factories in this country used outer soles from China.
So when the Federal Trade Commission accused the company in 1994 of violating the rarely enforced, half-century-old standard, New Balance mobilized the Congressional delegations of Maine and Massachusetts, where the company employs 1,300 workers, and waged a campaign for more flexible standards on products originating in the United States. 
 After an extensive two-year review, the commission looked kindly on the request, and last May it proposed relaxed standards. It seemed as if New Balance and other big companies that import a lot of components or goods had won a ringing victory for the increasingly global marketplace.
"It was time to update the standard," said Donna Ruane, a spokeswoman for New Balance, based in Brighton, Mass.
Not yet it isn't.
In a stunning retreat, the commission announced on Monday that it was abandoning its proposal after an avalanche of criticism from organized labor, state officials, consumer groups, more than 250 members of Congress and a large chunk of the nation's small businesses.
The ferocity of the response -- part grass roots, part high technology -- shocked the commission. Populist radio talk-show hosts like Oliver L. North pilloried the idea and urged their listeners to call the commission in protest. Tens of thousands of angry people flooded Capitol Hill offices with postcards.
And a coalition coordinating the opposition posted a web site on the Internet (http://www.usamade.org) to keep its members informed.
"I was pretty surprised," said Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, which wrote the proposed guidelines. "There were days when I said to my staff, 'Where are all the people who wanted this to happen?' "
What started out as an effort to recognize the reality of American commerce in the global bazaar had unexpectedly turned into an often-times emotional referendum on product quality, truth in labeling, the power of unions and old-fashioned patriotism.
"The F.T.C. tried to do the best they could, but they got creamed on this one," said Maury Lane, a spokesman for Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee and a leading opponent of proposed guidelines. "They totally misjudged public sentiment."
At the heart of the matter is what Americans expected from a product labeled "Made in U.S.A." The debate shifted along with the political tides during weeks of lobbying this summer and fall.
But in the end, the public comments to the commission overwhelmingly insisted that the label mean just what it says.
"When I see that label, it's like seeing a flag -- it's patriotism, it's job security," said Charles E. Mercer, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s union label and service trades department. "It means everything America stands for."
Indeed, the decision was an important triumph for organized labor, which argued that loosening the standard requiring products to be "all or virtually all" made in the United States would encourage American companies to build even more factories abroad, ultimately eroding wages and living standards in the United States.
People on both sides of the debate said the issue tapped the same vein of economic anxiety and uneasiness that fueled the successful effort last month to derail President Clinton's request for "fast-track" authority to negotiate international treaties.
Up until last May, however, there were few signs of the firestorm to come.
By then. some 150 companies from a wide array of industries had weighed in, as did 26 members of Congress. They were evenly divided over whether to modify the World War II-era "Made in U.S.A." standards, which was often interpreted to mean 98 percent of a good's value.
After holding workshops, conducting public opinion surveys and consulting numerous experts, the commission concluded that most Americans valued the "Made in U.S.A." label. But it also recognized that in today's marketplace, few products are made with all-American parts and labor.
So the commission suggested changing the 50-year-old standard of "all or virtually all" to "substantially all." Goods with as little as 75 percent of their manufacturing costs, but still assembled in the United States, would be entitled to bear the "Made in U.S.A." label. The new standards would not apply to automobiles, textile, woolen or fur industries, which are regulated by individual laws.
"I thought we came up with something very reasonable," said Ms. Bernstein, the consumer protection bureau's director.
When the commission unveiled the proposed guidelines in 16 pages of regulations on May 5, the response from Capitol Hill was less than deafening.
The commission delivered copies of the guidelines and a press statement to all 535 members of Congress, and invited them to a special briefing a week later.
A total of 7 Senate staff members and 10 House aides showed up.
But opposition was building momentum. On May 15, Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Bob Franks, Republican of New Jersey, along with 13 other House members introduced a nonbinding resolution opposing the proposed guidelines.
"The bottom line is this: the agency charged with upholding truth in advertising is attempting to pull a fast one on America's consumers," Mr. Franks said at the time. "The label that represents pride in American workmanship could soon become a Government-sanctioned tool of commercial hucksters."
A group of consumer advocates, labor unions, agriculture associations and small businesses soon formed the Made in USA Coalition, an umbrella organization run by three lobbyists from WinCapitol Inc., a public affairs firm in Washington.
The coalition updated the web site, bought advertisementsin two Capitol Hill newspapers, organized a high-volume fax campaign and coordinated the efforts of the alliance.
Among the most vocal opponents of the guidelines were small family-owned hand-tool and tile-making companies, many of whom faced stiff competition from foreign companies or American companies that imported foreign parts.
"American tools have always been recognized around the world as having superior design, engineering and overall quality," said Harry McCarty, president of Baltimore Tool Works Inc., which makes chisels, wrecking bars and other tools.
"I was offended by the deceptive description that a product could be labeled 'Made in U.S.A.,' but have components from somewhere else, Mr. McCarthy added."
Darlene Adkins, vice president of the National Consumers League, a 10,000-member advocacy group, said, "The 'Made in U.S.A.' label is even more valuable than it was 50 years ago because we are living in an increasingly global marketplace, and consumers want to support American jobs and manufacturing."
By late summer, senior commission lawyers and aides feared that they were being swept up in an increasingly emotional issue. More than 150 Republicans and Democrats had signed the House resolution.
On Sept. 11, the Senate opened a second front in the lobbying war when Mr. Hollings and Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who is a member of the Commerce Committee, introduced a nonbinding resolution supporting the existing standards. The guidelines' fate was sealed when Senator Trent Lott of Missippi, the majority leader, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, joined the Senate resolution.
"If a product says 'Made in the U.S.A.,' it should really mean it, and that brought together people from diverse political and economic perspectives," Mr. Abraham, who sparred with the commission earlier this year over a hospital merger in Michigan, said in an interview today.
Conspicuous by its absence was any well-organized campaign by companies that supported the proposed changes, including shoe wear and bicycle companies, to counteract the opponents.
Just as big business bore some of the blame for failing to rally round Mr. Clinton's "fast-track" authority, this time around corporations that stood to benefit from the commission's proposals were silent.
"Where industry failed is that companies tried to do everything through trade associations and didn't step forward themselves," said Jason B. Clawson, a lobbyist in Washington for many companies that favored the changes.
But most of the biggest trade associations, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, took no position on the proposed changes, because their members were badly divided on the issue.
Nor did the White House weigh in one way or the other. "I never got a single call or comment from anyone in the Administration," said Robert Pitofsky, the commission chairman.
In the end, the opponents just outlobbied the supporters of the guidelines. "It's a complicated issue and we tried," said Ms. Bernstein, a 30-year veteran of Washington's regulatory wars. "But we just didn't communicate the proposal well enough."

2 Queens Men Arrested In Massage Parlor Holdup

DATELINE: LYNDHURST

 BODY:
Tipped off by an employee of a methadone clinic who had seen a television news report about a series of robberies at New Jersey massage parlors, police detectives in Manhattan arrested two men yesterday and charged them in one of the holdups, the authorities said.
Daniel T. Solla, 33, and George Rivera, 25, both of Queens, were charged with robbing a Lyndhurst massage parlor on Sept. 29, said William H. Schmidt, the Bergen County Prosecutor. He said they are suspects in another holdup in Lyndhurst and three others in Passaic and Lodi. 
 Mr. Solla, who is unemployed, was arrested by detectives from the 13th Precinct at a Manhattan methadone clinic after an employee recognized him from a Dec. 1 report on Fox 5 News, said Officer Kathleen Kelly, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department. Mr. Rivera, who works for a construction company in Watchung, was later arrested at home, Officer Kelly said.

HEADLINE: Editors' Choice

 BODY:
On the 1997 list of best books of the year, chosen by the editors of the Book Review, are five novels, one volume of stories (more or less), two biographies, one history, one volume of science and one true account of a tragic adventure. Of the fiction writers -- four men and two women -- only one, an Englishwoman who began writing novels 20 years ago, when she was 60, has never appeared on this list before. Of the nonfiction authors -- two women and three men -- only one has appeared on the best books list before. In a year that was not notable for translation of new work, eight of the 11 authors are Americans and three are British.
Three of the novels on the list are concerned with American history, and three of the nonfiction volumes are about people who, whatever else they did, were writers (one novel is also about a writer). What is more striking is that no nonfiction work here is longer than either of the two biggest novels. In recent years one has come to expect biographies to outweigh any other genre, but this year's biographies were both written by British authors, who respect relative brevity more than we do -- even when, as this year, both biographers used a kind of enveloping method, fusing the lives of their subjects with the history of their periods to give a deeper perspective. Those two big novels, the longest books on the list, both by men, count 827 and 773 pages; the two shortest volumes (226 and 236 pages) are also fiction, both by women. 
 For the first time in at least 15 years the boss commanded that the discussions the editors conduct before they vote be presided over by civility. They were, so there is nothing to be said about them. Perhaps civility inspired generosity, for this year's group of the chosen, longer than last year's, was selected from 11 works of fiction and 13 of nonfiction nominated by individual editors throughout the year -- the shortest roster of nominees in a decade.
Certain types of books, like letters and diaries, are not eligible, even though this year's letters included those between Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder, between Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford, and a selection by Marianne Moore, and among the diaries was that of Alec Guinness.
The best books are taken from among those reviewed here since last year's Holiday Books issue, and the summaries given below are generally based on those reviews. And the best books are not included among the Notable Books of the Year, the listings of which begin on page 58.
 
AMERICAN PASTORAL
By Philip Roth.
Houghton Mifflin Company.
This novel is a lament for the death of the dream of assimilation that was precious to the children of Jewish immigrants of Philip Roth's generation. Nathan Zuckerman returns to New Jersey for a high school reunion and meets again his boyhood hero, Swede Levov, the admirable athlete who dutifully took over the family business, married a beauty queen and grew rich. But after Swede dies, Zuckerman undertakes an imaginative investigation into this success story and finds disaster. Swede's only daughter at 16 had joined the Weathermen, planted bombs in public buildings, lived destitute in hiding for years, became a radical devotee of an Oriental religion and finally returned to New Jersey, where Swede has a shocking meeting with her shortly before his death. What this beautifully elaborated tale dwells on is the deaths she caused, the damage she spread through her family, and on an insistent question: how is it possible that these good parents could raise this dislocated person? A hint of an answer is heard in an apparently innocent little contest, when the girl was very young, between Swede's father and his wife's Roman Catholic mother for the soul of their granddaughter. The themes the old people sound reverberate in virtually every conversation among other characters here, exchanges that have nothing to do with religion but ask just as pointedly how much we can share without losing our souls. Thus the tone of this allegory -- a remarkable mixture of rage and elegy.
 
AMERICAN SCRIPTURE
Making the Declaration of Independence.
By Pauline Maier.
Alfred A. Knopf.
Most historians have treated the Declaration of Independence as a central document of the Age of Enlightenment, a product of the natural rights philosophy of John Locke and other British theorists. And most people see Thomas Jefferson as its author, a claim Jefferson made the year he died. Now, with good-humored feistiness and some mockery of official pieties, Pauline Maier presents the Declaration as the embodiment of the American mind and colonial experience rather than as the work of Jefferson or the progeny of any philosophy. The big deal in 1776, she argues persuasively, was the popular decision to get out of the British Empire; independence was a necessity, not a philosophical choice. With striking originality, she sets the famous document in the context of 90 local declarations of independence issued beforehand by colonies, cities, towns and grand juries; the people had declared independence before the Continental Congress did. She shows Jefferson cobbling together his draft from his own preamble to the Virginia Constitution and George Mason's early version of Virginia's Declaration of Rights (which said all men are created equal). And she reproduces the editing done in two days by the Congress, so we can watch the delegates shortening and improving Jefferson's draft. The July 4 document, virtually ignored for a generation after it appeared, became the great American scripture only after it was enlisted as a weapon in partisan political battles of the early 19th century.
 
THE BLUE FLOWER
By Penelope Fitzgerald.
Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin Company.
Penelope Fitzgerald's early novels were comedies of contemporary British eccentricities so sharp that she got a reputation as an almost disreputably enjoyable author. As she moved on to stories about other countries and other eras, her habitual insight and authority carried over naturally into these more historically complicated settings. Her new novel makes the greatest leap of all; it is her most recondite and challenging book, and as authentic a piece of imagination as one can find about a writer -- in this case the great German Romantic Novalis (1772-1801). Here he is a philosophy student in the 1790's, his mind exploding with ideas and his heart falling captive to a spirited teen-age girl. There is no better introduction than this novel to the intellectual exaltation of the Romantic era, its political ferment, its uncertain morals, its innocence and refusal of limits. It is also a wholly convincing evocation of that notoriously difficult matter, genius; its presence in Novalis and his siblings fairly crackles in these quiet pages. The book also reaches far beyond its story, becoming an interrogation of life, experience, human horizons and love (its reminders of what it feels like to be in love the first time are luminous). As always, Fitzgerald's economy is next to miraculous, and the language is an enchantment: without a hint of mimicry, she uses virtually undetectable shifts in emphasis and phrasing to conjure up the tone of the German of 18th-century Saxony; it rings true.
 
HUXLEY
From Devil's Disciple to Evolution's High Priest.
By Adrian Desmond.
Addison-Wesley.
This racy biography of Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95) is a portrait of the modern age being born. Huxley was a superb scientist and Adrian Desmond writes about science as lucidly as anyone can, but Huxley was also the great apostle of Darwinism, and Desmond vividly sketches his ferocious assaults on the structures of Victorian society -- religion, class, education -- as he molded Darwin's scientific revolution into a social engine to overthrow the old order. The man and the historical transformation are one in this intensely dramatic, amusing account. It does not try to make either the man or his age too coherent; Huxley was a bizarre, intricate character, and there was a sense of chaos -- the reader can feel it -- as the established regime crumbled and Huxley's version of evolution became the ideology of the new industrial order. He was the most contentious man alive; he was also prodigiously energetic and cunning. To see the rise of science, and the middle class, amid such political tumult is to gain a new insight into history. He created the idea of "the scientist" as the idol of the new age. He coined the word "agnostic" and proudly applied it to himself. Gifted publicist and social engineer that he was, he sold the world on the ideals of skepticism, experimental openness, objectivity and undogmatic clarity. The idea of being lofty, above politics and wholly objective may have been absurd in Huxley's case, but it was seductive enough to change the entire outlook of later generations.
 
INTO THIN AIR
A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster.
By Jon Krakauer.
Villard Books.
Until May 1996, 630 people had climbed Mount Everest and 144 had died on it. That spring at least 30 expeditions of tourists made the climb. On May 10 a rogue storm blew up, and eight people in three separate expeditions approaching or leaving the summit died. Jon Krakauer, a 42-year-old writer, was with one team, assigned by Outside magazine to report on the commercialization of Everest. Although 12 people died altogether in 1996, he says, a record, 84 made it to the top, so it was a safer-than-average year. Krakauer explains the economic incentives for experienced climbers to lead groups of amateurs up the mountain, the even greater incentive for Nepal to license the trips and the total lack of incentive to limit the numbers risking their lives. When things go wrong in the death zone, the last 2,000 feet, and eventually they do, even the world's best guides cannot save the tourists, or themselves. But his book does more than report on lethal tourism. He wrote it to "purge Everest from my life." It didn't. It may put Everest ineradicably into your mind. This deftly constructed tale lets you sense the excruciating torture of climbing five miles high, the exhilarating and terrifying disorientation of oxygen starvation, the capricious moods of wind and snow, the strange seductiveness of death at odd moments. His re-creation of the storm that killed his companions swirls around the reader like the gale itself and gives this appalling struggle with death a horrifying intimacy.
 
MASON & DIXON
By Thomas Pynchon.
Henry Holt & Company.
Thomas Pynchon's finest novel is a book of heart, fire and genius. Its structure is classic comedy: the astronomer Charles Mason, as straight man, and the surveyor Jeremiah Dixon, to whom the madcap is just a reflex, bumble along in the mid-18th century drawing the line that separated Pennsylvania from Maryland and West Virginia, the North from the South. The narrator says history needs tending by fabulists, counterfeiters and cranks, and Pynchon gleefully joins the company. The story of this map-making becomes an investigation into the order of the universe, aiming to convince us that reason is inadequate to penetrate the world's mysteries. The book's abundant humor balances on the thin edge of anachronism; history, myth, anecdote and hyperbole are perfect equals. The style is bumptiously Fieldingesque, but subversively pumped up with allusions not only to yesterday and today but to Pynchon's other novels and many 20th-century masters of fiction; the allusiveness and self-awareness are a good part of the fun. The robust characters -- merchants, prostitutes, barmen, Indians, caffeine addicts, a talking dog, cabalists, sailors, poets, clerics, along with historical icons like Washington, Franklin, the Penns and Baltimores -- wrestle with a reader's understanding. As for Mason and Dixon: they are Pynchon's deepest creations; we know them from youth to death and, for all their confusion, surliness, resentment and loneliness, they inspire sympathy, perhaps even affection.
 
THE PUTTERMESSER PAPERS
By Cynthia Ozick.
Alfred A. Knopf.
Fiction, schmiction -- Cynthia Ozick is a literary centaur, half-scholar, half-artist, who loves a fantasy landscape with infinite allegorical possibilities, and she cheerfully leaves it to the reader to fill in the blanks when she feels like popping out of her story into commentary. What holds these five pieces together is simply Ruth Puttermesser (the word means butter knife, and the book ends with a funny, poignant poem about love and butter knives), a New York Jew whose mental life is richer than all the financial markets and political offices she floats through and who has to wait for heaven to realize her best dreams and worst apprehensions. Along the way she creates a female golem who makes Puttermesser Mayor of New York but who also grows gigantic and has to be unmade when her sexual appetites exhaust the Mayor's entire administration. Next Puttermesser and a new lover take on the roles of George Eliot and her lover, George Henry Lewes -- a caper that allows Puttermesser to deliver some brilliant literary insights, including a few into the work of Ozick. After an interlude with Puttermesser's Russian cousin -- a breathtaking sendup of Upper West Side intellectuals and their critics -- Puttermesser is in Paradise, married, with a son, and grown woefully wise about heaven. These papers can hardly be said to have a beginning or end, but when they stop, one is surprised to feel so deeply possessed by the painfully comic spirit of Puttermesser.
 
TOWARD THE END OF TIME
By John Updike.
Alfred A. Knopf.
From Word 1 John Updike undermines readers' -- and critics' -- logical assumptions in this novel, for the text is the journal of a 66-year-old man, Ben Turnbull, who at the end of his own time seems freed of time. His journal reveals not only the world but the wanderings of his wits. So what if a woman turns into a deer his wife had wanted him to kill? So what if he jumps from a United States in the next century, disintegrating after a war with China, to ancient Egypt, or to virtual reality? So what if characters appear and disappear like phantoms in a dream? Our sense of logic rises from time, and here time is drizzling into a black hole. Turnbull's journal is like "Walden" gone haywire; Ben is brilliantly observant of nature, but if Thoreau's gaze is innocent, Ben's is a gritty-eyed squint. And unlike Thoreau, Ben has women: a wife (the unvoiced struggle as each watches for the other to croak first is an entrancing game); a middle-class slut, or a deer, who inspires lust, guilt and longing for lost youth as they rollick through contortions of very Updikean sex; and a barely nubile gang moll who brings back to Ben his prepubertal self. No matter; soon enough time melts Ben's potency to ooze, and he is as ruthless in describing decay as he was in depicting his sexual romps and obsessions. Indeed, if Ben's ruthlessness is evenhanded, so is his alarming intelligence; it falls on every scene, person, object and thought in the book, giving it an eerie ambiance.
 
UNDERWORLD
By Don DeLillo.
Scribner.
Don DeLillo has always been a harshly original writer, rich in dangerous alienation, with great gifts of eye, ear, nose, palate and fingertip. But his reputation was cult-borne. With "Underworld" he fills the sky. In this novel he diagnoses the debilitation of the cold war, by probing into how people rearranged their lives around the moral void of an absurdity, mutually assured destruction. From its opening, at one of baseball's greatest games, to its inspired epilogue in a Central Asian institution filled with radiation-misshapen humans, it surges with magisterial confidence through half a century. But its true locations -- test sites -- are not on maps, and its characters live, psychologically, downwind from them. Here bland, hopeful American life glows with the sick light of betrayal, innocence abused; everyone's better feelings take a beating, and ambient moral fear pinches everyone -- not only his invented characters but a host of cultural heroes who appear, from J. Edgar Hoover to Lenny Bruce. The protagonist is an entrepreneur of waste; the novel bursts with witty and dramatic conjurings of garbage, voidance, slag. The dialogue is a rockingly comic attack on our mental excreta: the distortions and sound bites of the television age. DeLillo was absent from his fiction before, an unbodied intelligence, but here is an undertow of personal pain he has never touched. This is his most demanding novel and yet his most transparent, giving the reader the privileged intimacy that comes from seeing a writer whole.
 
VIRGINIA WOOLF
By Hermione Lee.
Alfred A. Knopf.
Virginia Woolf said a biographer had to be like the miner's canary, "testing the atmosphere, detecting falsity, unreality and the presence of obsolete conventions." She might have been writing about Hermione Lee. This exceptionally well-researched, beautifully written and graceful life rescues Woolf from her iconic standing and restores her to human dimensions. Among the obsolete conventions Lee avoids are the politicized agendas of the academy and jargon-ridden psychoanalytic speculations. Without special pleading -- Woolf's faults are in full view -- she maintains a real modesty in the face of the irreducible nature of the writer, but she is capable of shrewd psychological conjecture about Woolf's intellectual and imaginative growth. She vividly re-creates the world Woolf was born into in 1882, a maze of formalities and reticences, and then leads us through changes that, slow in coming but shocking in effect, made all that seem light-years away by the time Woolf was 50. She convinces us that Woolf, contrary to previous assumptions, reveled in a deep intimacy with her husband, Leonard. Finally, she makes a persuasive case for the underlying sanity of this woman as she battled her own madness and shows the brilliant literary uses she made of her instability; as Woolf said, her madness kept her sane. In the end, without being told so by Lee, the reader is pretty sure to conclude that Woolf was personally heroic in life and that, against all odds, she had become a great writer.
 
THE WHOLE SHEBANG
A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report.
By Timothy Ferris.
Simon & Schuster.
The whimsical title refers to what cosmologists do. They are trying to account not for the physics or chemistry or any one aspect of the universe, but for the composition, history, appearance and operation of the whole thing. As Timothy Ferris -- an admirably knowledgeable journalist and a great guide for ordinary readers -- says, this is a big order. So is his book. The sweep is vast: in eight chapters he canvasses the theory of the Big Bang, the dynamism of the universe, the shape of space, the origins of the chemical elements, the debate over the dark matter that makes up most of the universe, the mystery of the clumping together of stars and galaxies, the search for a Darwinian explanation of the history of the universe and the hope of finding one unified theory to explain everything. Then he gets to the really big stuff: the inflation of the universe and what that implies, where it all came from, how quantum mechanics works and why it suggests there may be many universes, and how humanity, the source of all these theories, fits into a scientific explanation of the whole shebang. Ferris's theorists are not just thinking machines; some are as strange and unyielding as the universe they study. He has a gift for making readers understand not only what the scientists know but how they know it. Finally, as in no previous book of his, Ferris sticks his neck out here, showcasing at least one theory that cannot be tested for years.

THE BLUE LANTERN
 And Other Stories.
 By Victor Pelevin.
 Translated by Andrew Bromfield.
 179 pp. New York:
 New Directions. $22.95. 
 Does the world exist? Could its reality be something entirely different from what our experience has led us to believe? Do I really want to eat that chicken?
There is nothing particularly Russian about these questions, except perhaps the last one. Doubt about physical reality has become integral to a worldwide contemporary culture that has built very nearly concrete alternate realities out of electronic impulses. If anything, it verges on cliche. The way Viktor Pelevin makes his existential inquiry fresh and relevant is by bringing to it his Russian, post-Soviet experience of the world.
Soviet society was disconnected from reality in a particular way, by ideology and propaganda. When these props were removed, Russians found themselves adrift in another universe, one in which new laws of physics (or at least economics) held sway, history had been rewritten once again and the old verities were radioactive trash. These days, an overlay of Western advertising and imagery has descended upon the land, especially in boomtown Moscow, creating yet another weird simulacrum. For a writer keen on the disjunction between the actual and the virtual, current Russian circumstance is a bonanza.
Born in Moscow in 1962, Pelevin is best known in the West for his short satirical novel, "Omon Ra," which is based on the conceit that the Soviet Union's spectacular success in using robotic spacecraft early in the space age was a fraud. The sputniks and luniks were in fact operated by pilots hidden away inside the vessels, doomed never to return. As Omon, Pelevin's kamikaze cosmonaut, soars into the higher reaches of space and the Soviet space program, he discovers new frauds and new spheres of official reality.
In "The Blue Lantern and Other Stories," Pelevin continues to gnaw at our confidence in conventional reality, like a dog worrying a bone. Nearly every story in this collection contains an ongoing dialogue about the nature of reality -- between two Moscow prostitutes, between two cocaine-snorting soldiers in revolutionary Petrograd and, in a story called "Hermit and Six-Toes," between two truth seekers who, in the end, turn out to be chickens plotting their escape from the Lunacharsky Broiler Combine.
American readers will note a strong resemblance between Pelevin and Philip K. Dick, who often placed his characters in situations in which they were unsure whether they were awake or dreaming, alive or android. Russians are more likely to read Pelevin alongside Andrei Platonov. In Platonov's novel "The Foundation Pit," completed in 1930, workers debate the nature of the universe as they dig the foundation for some vast Soviet building. Like Platonov, Pelevin understands that beyond the narrative screen of language is another reality that we can't quite get at.
Pelevin, however, is a whole lot funnier than Platonov, who suffered obscurity and repression under Stalin. But then Pelevin lives in much more amusing times -- darkly amusing as they may be. In "Mid-Game," the prostitute Lyusa, working the Moscow hotels in the most impoverished years of perestroika, translates the inscription on an American five-dollar bill, "legal tender," as "legitimate affection." In "News From Nepal," a "rationalization engineer" in a trolley garage is having a bad day at work, made all the worse when she discovers that she and her colleagues are dead:
"Shushpanov was trying to plug the bullet-hole in his temple with the top of a pen, Karyaev was trying to straighten the bones of his smashed skull, Shuvalov was combing his forelock over a blue mark left by lightning, and even Kostya, obviously recalling something from a brochure on drowning, was giving himself artificial respiration."
And it is the chickens who treat us to a lengthy philosophical discussion about the oblong white spheres from which they emerge and which, paradoxically, also emerge from them -- as well as the 70 worlds, the Wall of the World, the Decisive Stage, Shop Number One and love. Prophets to the other chickens, Hermit and Six-Toes exhort what is literally their flock to exercise and fast, in order to put off being slaughtered and frozen. "Those of you who from this day forth until the very Day of Judgment shall fast, shall be born again. Oh, Lord! And now arise and sin no more!"
Anyone who has ever contemplated a Russian factory chicken, in all its scrawny, blue-skinned glory, can imagine the number of them who found religion in vain.
From the evidence of Andrew Bromfield's translation, Pelevin does not appear to be as great a stylist as Platonov. (Neither was Dick.) But Bromfield, who also translated "Omon Ra," successfully captures Pelevin's irony and black humor and has found a fluid, contemporaneous English that suits the stories' post-Soviet outlook. Bromfield exists, I'm sure of it. As for Pelevin, his stories' sheer loopiness suggests that he is simply a figment of the reader's imagination.

COMANCHE MOON
 By Larry McMurtry.
 752 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $28.50. 
 In the years since Larry McMurtry's first novel, "Horseman, Pass By," was made into the movie "Hud," he has created a body of work almost as large and cinematically picturesque as the Texas landscape that is his favorite setting. And he doesn't look to be quitting any time soon: his latest book (which is being billed as the final volume in his enormously popular "Lonesome Dove" series) is a colorful adventure that fills the gap between the green days of Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, seen as young Texas Rangers in the novel "Dead Man's Walk," and their sunset years, depicted in the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Lonesome Dove."
"Comanche Moon" finds the affable McCrae and taciturn Call at the height of their powers -- and they need to be. Led by Capt. Inish Scull, a Harvard scholar who "saw no reason to be teaching military history when he could go out in the field and make it," the rangers are still facing the formidable opponent they first encountered in "Dead Man's Walk," a fierce Comanche named Buffalo Hump.
The decade from the late 1850's to the late 1860's, when the novel takes place, is a period of relentless white settlement interrupted by the four-year hiatus of the Civil War, and as it proceeds Buffalo Hump sees his future all too clearly. The buffaloes are vanishing as quickly as the whites are multiplying, and noble warriors are reluctantly moving to the reservations. But Buffalo Hump believes that a great Comanche war chief does not go gently. Rather, "since the white men were there in his land, his country, he meant to live off their animals." He has little patience with chiefs who talk of treaties or hotheaded warriors who fight without respecting the old ways, including his own son, Blue Duck, whom he expels from the tribe. As a final hurrah, Buffalo Hump mounts a sweeping campaign of slaughter from Austin to the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Raid of 1856.
Blue Duck survives to become the murdering renegade of "Lonesome Dove," but in "Comanche Moon" his lust for atrocity is anticipated by the bandit Ahumado, the Black Vaquero, who lurks south of the Rio Grande and alternates his mode of torturing captives: skinning them alive or tossing them into a pit of rattlers and scorpions or setting them atop sharpened tree trunks and watching them slowly descend. But for McCrae and Call, these physical dangers are easier to cope with than the dangers posed by their ungovernable emotions -- notably their love for two very different women.
McCrae proposed to Clara Forsythe on the day he met her, "but she had hesitated then" and years later she is still hesitating: "Though Gus moved her in ways no other man ever had or, she feared, ever would, something in her still refused." Clara simply can't imagine happiness with a man suffering from such wanderlust, so she slips away and marries a dull but safe Nebraskan. Unlike McCrae, Call seems incapable of passion for anything -- except maybe his rifle. The lovely prostitute Maggie Tilton worships him and even bears him a son, but despite the affection he holds for her, Call finds it impossible to acknowledge her devotion.
In "Comanche Moon," McMurtry has created a sprawling, picaresque novel that, like the history of the West itself, leaves more than a few loose ends. Some characters' fates we can only surmise. Others await resolution in "Lonesome Dove." As usual, though, the characters are the novel's strength. McMurtry's rangers are heroic because of their vulnerabilities, not despite them. Except for Scull, who declaims Xenophon in Greek, and McCrae, who'd been a college man until it wore off, these are mostly men of few words. McMurtry's women are more effusive; they love abundantly, but they are also pragmatists. His Comanches are respected, not romanticized. When Buffalo Hump rides off to die, he is grateful for "the knowledge that in the years of his youth and manhood he had drawn the lifeblood of so many enemies."
McMurtry's novels often have titles that hint of a wistful twilight: "The Evening Star," "The Last Picture Show," "Leaving Cheyenne." Here the wistfulness lies in a West he is savoring even as it is disappearing. Like the Comanches, McCrae and Call know that their time is nearly gone. After all, pacifying the frontier is a job whose ultimate goal is to render them unemployed. In the heroic time of "Comanche Moon," these men set out to tame the West; just a few years later, in the 1880's of "Lonesome Dove," they will finally be tamed themselves.

HEADLINE: HOTEL CHECK-IN;
What's in a Brand?

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE; BETSY WADE writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
A COMPANY in Parsippany, N.J., called HFS Incorporated has its signs on 5,550 hotels in the United States. But you don't see "HFS" over the door. The signs bear more familiar names: Howard Johnson, Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8, Travelodge, Knights Inn, Villager Lodge and Wingate Inn. And in these and other properties around the world, HFS owns not a single registration desk, not one HoJo ice bucket, not even an imprinted ballpoint pen. HFS was formerly known as Hospitality Franchise Systems Inc., and it is the largest lodging franchiser in the world.
Biggest, and growing. One of its brands, Super 8, opens a new motel every 2.5 days. Like all the other components of HFS, it does not own, manage or operate any hotels bearing its name. 
 "The consumer often does not know that the company whose name is on the door does not own the real estate," says Chuck Ross, a vice president of Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which tracks changes for the travel industry.
Hotels, like fast food, are advertised, and chosen, based on those names, which are intended to telegraph certain information: the level of comfort and service, price range, convenience, security. The big names may offer frequent-guest programs tied in with airlines. And while staying at a name-brand hotel can assure travelers of some standards, the control a chain has over individual properties can be quite minimal.
In Silver Spring, Md., Choice Hotels International franchises of seven brand names used by 2,843 hotels in the United States. Since October, when Choice was spun off by Sunburst Hospitality, the real-estate company that owns 75 properties, Choice has done nothing but license the names Sleep Inn, Comfort Inn and Comfort Suites, Quality Inn and Quality Suites, Clarion Inn, Clarion Hotel and Clarion Resort, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn and Mainstay Suites.
Among other major franchising companies are Hilton, Holiday Hospitality, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites (both Promus companies), ITT Sheraton, about to become part of Starwood Lodging Trust, and Radisson Hospitality. Best Western, one of the oldest brand names in the United States, with a board elected from among its members, is an association of independently owned hotels.
To confuse the issue further, some of these big franchising companies manage some of the hotels that bear their names. Still other famous names -- Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons among them -- are primarily management companies. Inter-Continental does some of both. A few companies, often small ones like Chalet Susse International, own the places with their names.
The franchise evolution dumbfounds Anthony G. Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management of Florida International University in Miami. "Forget Ramada Inn!" he cried. "There is no Ramada Inn company. There is no such thing anymore. Let the buyer beware: Do not put your full faith and confidence in a sign."
At more and more hotels these days, one company owns the name and nothing else, a second company or real estate investment group owns land and buildings and still another operates the hotel -- and none of these, to use Mr. Marshall's example, is the Ramada Inn company. The Ramada Inn name is in the sole custody of an HFS division, Ramada Franchise Systems Inc.
John Russell, the chairman and chief executive officer of HFS Hospitality, which comprises the giant company's eight hotel brands, said: "By the year 2000, about 50 cents of every dollar will come through a franchise company. That is a huge increase from the 15 cents that franchises represented six or seven years ago."
Samuel F. Pryor 3d, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, said that about two years ago he was on the road half the business days of the year. His schedule is easier now, he said, but in any event his hotels are virtually always familiar names, although he notes that lawyers on their clients' business pick places that the clients consider appropriate. "They stay in first-class hotels," Mr. Pryor said, "we stay in first-class hotels." His firm, like many, has a travel department, and it also has rules that favor established names.
Frequent guest programs also tend to channel business travelers into established brand names. Mark Benerofe, vice president for programming for Sony, is on the road so much that he asked for reservations for the Westin Copley Place in Boston for all Tuesdays in the next three months. He said Boston was so overbooked he was wait-listed for five nights. His company authorizes use of both Westins and Ritz-Carltons, but as a Gold member of the Westin's Premier frequent-guest program, he has a vision of a reward trip to the Far East, "if I ever get the time."
His current complaint about Westin, a management company, is that it has not yet put his personal preferences -- for a nonsmoking room, for instance -- into the computer system the front desk uses at an individual hotel. He took one complaint to Westin headquarters in Seattle, but found no great response.
As for consistency, a main attraction for many travelers, Mr. Marshall says it is possible for franchisers like HFS, Choice or any other to set good safety and cleanliness standards as a condition of permitting use of the name and providing reservation services. "But the level of franchiser control that is spelled out in the contract," he said, "is usually as low as possible, and just enough so the sign can be pulled off the property if the owners fail or default."
From the traveler's standpoint, safety considerations should come first. Almost all franchisers require smoke detectors in bedrooms, even in towns where local fire codes do not. In new buildings, most franchisers require that the detectors be wired into the building power supply so they are not disabled by dead or missing batteries. Hotels higher than three stories that want to meet Government standards for its employees have sprinkers in the bedrooms, too. Where new hotels are being built, sprinklers are usually part of the required construction.
The other area in which franchisers often make a security requirement is electronic keys, and most franchisers are moving in this direction in their higher- or medium-priced properties. These safety essentials may never appear in an independent lodging place if no local code requires them.
When a brand name is new, and the franchiser requires the franchisee to build a new property to get the name, the franchiser may set the design of the building, lobby, rooms and even the showers. This is the case with Sleep Inns.
The franchise situation can become a problem for the consumer when it's necessary to get hold of someone who can fix a problem or authorize a refund. The question that often arises in a theft, for instance, is whether a franchiser will make amends for failed security. Mr. Marshall says that the franchiser usually leaves the owner or operator to cope with the complaint under local innkeeper-liability laws. Such laws are in place to protect the property owner, the theory being that no one would open an inn if he or she had to compensate guests for every theft on the premises. These laws are usually posted on the back of the hotel door.
The experience of a reader from Stowe, Vt., Frank Calderon, shows how far a franchiser may back away from the problems of the hotel itself. On a business trip in April, Mr. Calderon was waiting for his room at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Madrid, when a suitcase containing his heart medicine was stolen from the lobby. Frustrated in his attempts to deal with the hotel, in June he sent to Thomas R. Oliver, the chairman and chief executive officer of what is now Holiday Hospitality, a copy of his complaint. The response he got, from Wendy Olson, an assistant in the guest relations department in Salt Lake City, said:
"The hotel in question is a franchised property. Holiday Inn Worldwide does not own, operate, manage or control the day-to-day operations of franchised Holiday Inn hotels, such as this one. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, the owner is responsible for all claims relating to the operation of the hotel . . .
"We are concerned with the operation of properties carrying our name. Your comments will be taken into consideration in Holiday Inn Worldwide's evaluation of guest satisfaction at this hotel. However, due to the nature of your disagreement with his property, it falls beyond our sphere of jurisdiction to render action."
Mr. Calderon's dispute with the hotel continues, with the core of the issue whether the hotel had taken control of the suitcase at the time the bag was stolen or whether it was still in the owner's custody.
What franchisers do provide, typically, are buying services for furniture and equipment that meet their specifications; brand-name advertising and promotion programs such as movie tie-ins; central telephone reservations systems; wholesale purchasing of towels and similar items, and staff training. Last year Super 8 created a training program for its owners and managers called the University of the Pineapple, a reference to an old hospitality symbol.
The promise of consistency is what makes the franchising system work. How does a franchiser keep the name bright and worth the price when it cannot, or does not want to, get in there and vacuum the rug or replace the plumbing? A clause in its contract allows withdrawal of the brand name. When complaints mount, or company inspectors find things not plumped up and shiny, or royalties are not paid on time, the franchiser puts the property into technical default. Then comes a "curing period," when the owner or manager is given time to come up to standards. If that does not happen, the sign comes down and the franchiser stops taking reservations for the property.
If a customer calls and asks for a reservation for a particular Quality Inn in Someplace, Iowa, and the contract there has been canceled, "we just tell them there is no Quality Inn in Someplace," said Betsy Bromberg O'Rourke, senior vice president for marketing services at Choice Hotels International. The reverse can happen when a traveler calls a local number, expecting to hear "Quality Inn, how may I direct your call?" and gets the news when a voice says, "Moderne Manor, how may I . . . ?"
The physical sign belongs not to the franchiser, but to the owner or operator, so when a property is "terminated," in the franchise companies' language, and the operator refuses to take the sign off, the franchiser may have to go to court. This usually takes 90 days, Ms. O'Rourke said. If the sign stays on in this period, she said, Choice headquarters makes good on any guarantees that the brand name advertises. Most other companies interviewed said the same.
SMITH TRAVEL RESEARCH says that 5 to 10 percent of the properties in a particular brand are culled each year for not meeting standards. Ms. O'Rourke said 5 percent was the overall figure for Choice brands, but Econo Lodge was closer to 7 percent. Mr. Russell at HFS put his overall figure at 7 percent last year: out of 5,400 hotels, 378 hotels (representing 32,000 rooms) were terminated.
The principal reasons for terminations were failure to send the money in and failure to meet the standards; Mr. Russell said most were a combination of the two.
Hampton Inns, another big franchiser, got considerable publicity when it began its 100 percent satisfaction guarantee in 1989, but other franchise companies say that almost all properties must make full refunds for real dissatisfaction. Many even have an official policy. This means that all travelers have in effect been appointed inspectors for the franchisers. The number of refunds that must be given at a particular place are collated and tracked and the total becomes part of the property's record. Not incidentally, this data base enables a franchiser to keep track of fraud -- customers who complain regularly as a way of staying free.
Wherever a satisfaction guarantee is offered, and a guest cannot get it from the front desk, a letter should be sent to the franchise company at the address given on the opinion card in the room. The companies probably talk a better game than they deliver, but there is no reason to give up after one pass if the problem was serious.
The company now called Holiday Hospitality began life in 1952 as Holiday Inns, then as now a franchise company. It is owned by Bass, a British company. The new Holiday Hospitality chief, Mr. Oliver, in office nine months, said the company was mandating an expensive overhaul of all its 2,350 properties because many looked old. "Everything tends to run down," Mr. Oliver said. "We need to maintain health and fitness."
He estimated that the 5 percent termination rate at Holiday properties would rise because some owners would not want to spend the money to renovate. As many travelers realize, hotels that lose one brand name may find a new one lower on the price-amenities scale. In the hotel trade, this is called a soft landing, and many clusters of brand names maintain an inexpensive group for this purpose.
As for taking the sign down, few events can match the Ritz-Carlton dust-up earlier this year. Ritz-Carlton is not a franchiser but a hotel-management company of which 49 percent is owned by Marriott International. That's only the beginning of the list of the cast of characters. Just after midnight of Aug. 1, four hotels, in New York, Washington, Houston and Aspen, Colo., out of the 24 in the group, lost their names. Ritz-Carlton, which had been managing them, had been in a dispute with an investment firm owned by Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim al-Ibrahim, a Saudi. The investment firm controls the holding companies that own the four hotels. The holding companies in 1995 accused Ritz-Carlton of mismanagement, and Ritz-Carlton has said that the holding companies owe $4 million in fees. When the contract expired, Ritz-Carlton lowered its flag.
Two weeks later, ITT Sheraton, a Boston company that franchises 213 of the 439 hotels with its name, got one-year contracts to manage the nameless luxury properties. Sheraton placed the hotels in its high-priced Luxury Collection, where they were listed, in late November, as "ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection Hotel-Aspen-Washington-New York City-Houston." Stacked above such syllable-sparse names as St. Regis and Carlton, they do stick out, as Lisa Dickason of Sheraton said. But that won't last. "We hired a naming company," she said.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Despite Rise in Rates, Hotels Are Filling Fast

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
TRAVELERS who keep up with lodging trends know that New York hotels have essentially been full most of this year and last, but they are sometimes surprised to learn that hotel rooms are scarce in many other cities. "The occupancy rate is so high in Boston that many Boston-bound travelers are staying in Providence and driving the 45 minutes to conduct their business," said Brenda D. Farrell, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Wales University, which runs a hotel school in Providence, R.I.
Much the same is true in most regions of the country, where the combination of business and leisure travelers, with a huge assist from international visitors, is filling hotels not just in traditional tourist cities but in nearby cities and states as well. Moreover, most categories of hotels are benefiting from the growing tendency of business travelers to stay over on weekends -- either to obtain air fares that are often two-thirds less with a Saturday-night stay, or because they have their families join them on weekends. 
 Yet while budget and economy hotels benefited from the nationwide demand for rooms, the clear-cut winners this year are luxury hotels, whose 75.7 percent occupancy rate led every other category by a wide margin. Upscale hotels, one step below luxury, which also have restaurants, room service and an array of amenities, were the runner-up with 69.4 percent occupancy. "This is the total reverse of a decade ago, when the budget and economy hotels had the highest occupancies," said Chuck Ross, a vice president of Smith Travel Research.
Because of such demand, the average room rate in the United States rose 6 percent to $74.96 through September of this year, the latest month for which figures are available, compared with the same period last year. Among the cities with the biggest hikes were New York (the highest at 12.9 percent), San Francisco, Orlando, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia.
Nationwide occupancy during the first nine months of 1997 actually decreased .9 percent from the same period last year, to 66.5, according to Smith Travel Research. But without the rate increases and a 3 percent growth in the number of rooms, occupancy so far this year conceivably would have surpassed last year's record nine-month occupancy of 66.9 percent.
However, as many travelers have discovered, while hotel owners pray for a full house, demand for rooms has emboldened many of them to raise rates even if it means lower occupancies -- a far cry from the early 1990's, when a sputtering economy forced many hotels to lower rates so far that owners could barely service their debt, much less earn a profit.
In some cities, lackluster performance resulted from the addition of smaller, limited-service hotels with more rooms to fill. That appears to be the case in Dallas, where occupancy dropped 3.7 percent as the construction of predominantly budget and economy hotels led to an 8 percent increase in available rooms. In Atlanta, new limited-service hotels built in anticipation of the 1996 Olympic Summer Games yielded a 10.3 percent increase in available rooms, which now appears to have contributed to the city's occupancy rate tumbling 6.1 percent. Room rates have fallen 7.7 percent to $76.99.
Atlanta has also had trouble cashing in on the worldwide exposure from the Olympics (when room rates averaging more than $115 a night also led to lower than expected occupancy). By contrast, although hotel occupancy in New Orleans dipped .3 percent through the first nine months of this year, in the face of a 2.3 percent gain in available rooms, room rates grew 8.2 percent, to a hefty $104. As P.K.F. Consulting noted in September, the ability of hotels in New Orleans to charge premium prices during the Super Bowl -- which took place last January -- has lasted throughout the year.
Washington's hotel market remains an anomaly, largely because its results include hotels in nearby Virginia and Maryland -- convenient locations to which many travelers turn for lower room rates. Over all, however, the region racked up a 72.3 occupancy rate this year, a gain of 3.1 percent over 1996, and room rates rose 5.8 percent to $99.64. The Clinton inauguration last January helped, but a bigger factor was that the number of new rooms grew only a minuscule .8 percent during the nine months.
For all Smith Travel's diligence, however, its data have a notable (although deliberate) omission -- Las Vegas, the biggest hotel market of all, with more than 100,000 rooms. It is not included, Smith Travel said, "because of the unique nature of the attractions of that city and the reliance on gaming." But Kevin Bagger, senior research analyst at the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said the city's occupancy rate through August of this year was 88.2 percent -- down 3.6 percent from the same period last year. Not to worry. During that 12 months, room supply grew about 10 percent to 103,916, but when 26 new gates open next summer at McCarran International Airport, said Mr. Bagger, "it should help fill most of those rooms also."

Our Pious Press

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
My text this sunday is the "Unsecular Media," a good book by Mark Silk that inspires thought if not yet faith. It sets you thinking about the saintly role that religion has acquired in our allegedly irreligious media. And it leaves you hopeful that Silk's critique may yet embolden journalists to explore religious faith and institutions with greater sophistication, the way they cover theory and practice in politics, science and economics.
Silk, a historian of religion and an occasional journalist, heads the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College. His 1995 treatise was cast as a defense of the media against the charge that they are run by "secular humanists" hostile to all faiths. But his main message was that journalists mostly see religion as it sees itself. He found us so intimidated by the subject that we dare to discuss religion only in the vocabulary of mainstream religious values. 
 As Silk recounts, some of the first newspapers in the American Colonies were indeed iconoclastic about the clerical establishment -- as well as their governments. And in the mid-19th century, James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald set the standard for mass-circulation dailies by freely covering clerical sin, exposing conflict over church properties and intruding into previously closed ecclesiastical policy debates. And the very appearance a century ago of successful Sunday papers like this one became a symbol of journalism's sacrilege. In the words of one New York minister, the Sunday paper "not only employs a large number of persons for its sale upon God's holy day but it furnishes secular reading to divert the mind from the holy themes especially appropriate to the Sabbath."
After a marked decline early in this century, reporting on religion once again increased, but it returned in notably timid, sentimental and pious forms. Even when the news concerned clerical hypocrisy or other churchly wrongdoing, the press accepted the mainstream churches' definitions of themselves, hewing to story lines that are rooted in religious doctrine.
All too often, what passes for religious coverage is a ritual celebration of papal tours or holiday ceremonies. Only a few of the conventional Saturday "church" pages venture deeply into the realm of beliefs and dogma. Mostly, Silk found, religion writing holds to a predictable pattern of safe topics: the good works that churches do; their tolerance of other mainstream religions; the hypocrisy of religionists who betray their professed beliefs; the false prophets in unconventional cults like Heaven's Gate; the validation of once-alien faiths like Islam, and the recurrent cycles of religious decline and revival.
The media, in short, love to dwell on the feel-good stuff about religions and to pounce on the pious phonies who steal from the collection basket, cavort with prostitutes or pretend to be Jesus. But only rarely do we follow the trails of doctrine by which different religions inspire political action in society. We cover the formal legal scrapes about the "separation" of church and state but shy from the moral and ideological influences of the clergy and lay religious leaders.
Taking their lead from the established religions, the media are often too quick to demonize the "cults" of unconventional sects and movements. They forget that all too recently even Mormons were thought to be following a false prophet and Roman Catholics were openly scorned for betraying American interests to the Pope's. Faiths like the Unification Church or Branch Davidians are rarely examined for the essence of their appeal to their followers; instead they are rapidly denounced for "brainwashing" their faithful. Yet the reports of miracles and supernatural visions in the more established ministries cause even the most skeptical reporters and editors to wax poetic and suspend their disbelief.
Now that television has awakened to the entertainment value of angels and other Heavenly servants, the same sentimental cliches appear in prime-time dramas. Even the best of these, ABC's "Nothing Sacred," dwells mainly on the healing powers of handsome priests who rush among urban emergencies. A recent episode championed the gift of tongues against the villainous atheism of a skeptical psychiatrist.
You would think that such a program's worshipful respect for religious experience could not possibly provoke significant objection. But American society has grown so unaccustomed to honest examination of religion that a lay league of protesting Catholics was able to frighten a slew of commercial sponsors away from "Nothing Sacred." They took offense at the program's suggestion that priests sometimes experience sexual temptation and that some Catholics tolerate abortion. Even if the program survives, it will not grow braver.
The paradox of such sensitivities is that they drive religion out of our public debates. The media's prescriptions for a healthy society come almost exclusively from contending physicians, politicians and advertising agencies. Their recipes for the good life come more from cooks than clerics.
Is it too much to expect serious newspapers and television magazines to broaden their approach to religious issues and institutions? Besides exploring the ethics of law, medicine and business, why not debate the multiple sources of our ethics? Why not track the teachings and, yes, the lobbying of our many religions on such issues as assisted suicide and euthanasia, marriage and divorce, social welfare, immigration, feminism and environmentalism? What do religions have to teach us about our quests to prolong life and to locate extraterrestrial life, about how to ration medical care and welfare?
There is obviously a certain news value in the commonplace accounts of the number of Americans who regularly attend a church or religious school and the delicious diversity of those institutions. But those reports should be only the beginning of media efforts to discern how and where we Americans acquire our moral teachings, our shifting sense of what is right and wrong in human transactions. Different religions are, by definition, different views of the world, and they are often usefully divisive as well as cohesive. It is merely pious coverage that is truly irreverent.

HEADLINE: Faith Is a Hands-On Proposition;
Deputizing the Flock

BYLINE: By Laurie Goodstein; Laurie Goodstein is a religion correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
It is a Wednesday night at Canaan Missionary Baptist Church in Louisville, Ky., and every room in the sprawling building is alive with activity. Sitting in the pews, 520 people are studying Matthew 28. In the recreation hall, 57 children in the youth choir are rehearsing. Downstairs, a class for new members is led in prayer by a seasoned church member who joined all of nine months before.
And down the hall, toddlers are singing to the tune of "Frere Jacques": "I am special, I am special. Look at me." 
 The church's pastor is not here tonight. The Rev. Walter Malone Jr., an intense man with a speaking style as deliberate as a hike up Mount McKinley, is on his way to Israel for a 10-day tour for African-American clergy. Malone is the reason many say they were drawn to this church, but his absence doesn't stop them from coming. They come to worship, they come to socialize and they come because there is work to be done.
Canaan Baptist makes ministers of its members. The church expects its men and women -- mostly African-American, from all over the city -- to pitch in and build up both the church and its community, in the struggling west end of Louisville. There is a mission to match every talent: a sports ministry, a youth ministry, a men's ministry, a food pantry and, as of 1992, a nonprofit Community Development Corporation. And everyone is asked to be a "prayer partner," expected to pair up with another member of the congregation and look after that person's spiritual, physical and emotional health.
"The key is," says Eugene McCormick, the church's administrative assistant, "once they come in, you've got to get them involved. You don't do that, you lose them." McCormick, a layman himself, helps teach the Wednesday-night Bible study in the pastor's absence. "The Bible says we are a kingdom of priests. We can all be ministers."
It used to be that virtually the only way laypeople could serve in their church was to volunteer as ushers, Sunday school teachers or deacons, positions usually reserved for men and women of especially upright reputation. For most people, church was something that happened on Sundays.
Talk to ministers and congregations across the country now, and you will find that churches that ask little of their flocks are withering on the vine. The churches that demand a lot -- in time, in tithes, in commitment -- are the ones attracting a growing, and younger, membership. This may sound surprising in an era when people complain about working longer hours and having less free time, but it makes sense. On average, Americans move more than 10 times in their lives, and many find themselves shopping for a new church -- and applying the same smart-consumer mentality they use to choose a new car or a college: what features does this product offer me? They want to know, is there a day-care center? A singles ministry? A senior outreach program? Do I feel comfortable there? Even the oldest and largest churches can't hire a staff big enough to minister to so many different needs, so they turn to their members to magnify the reach of the church.
Leaving the Canaan Baptist new-members' meeting on a recent evening, Niesha Stubbins said that she and her fiance had joined the church after hearing Malone preach that life is like a basketball game. "He was saying, 'You've got to get in the game -- you can't sit it out,' " said Stubbins, an 18-year-old nurse's aide. "That made sense to me."
Ministers like Malone who preach a gospel of individual empowerment and community self-reliance are in step with their times. "While we are on the way to heaven, we have to have some bacon and eggs on the journey," Malone says. "God wants us to experience life at its best. Every person needs to have the opportunity to experience what it means to be truly human. We have to help build people's lives individually so people can live with a sense of vision in their lives, a sense of purpose."
Malone, 42, sees himself as a "spiritual heir" to the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. A lean 6 feet 4 inches, he wears a goatee and a baseball cap that says "JC" -- as in Jesus Christ. He founded Canaan Baptist 14 years ago with 97 members. Now it has 2,429.
Not long ago, four members sat in the nearly bare offices of the church's Community Development Corporation and described how Canaan Baptist had drawn them in. They liked the rollicking choir and the unpretentious warmth of a place where strangers greeted one another with full hugs. But what really won their allegiance, they said, was the church's appeal to reach out to the people Jesus called "the least of these."
Having grown up of modest means in Olive Branch, Miss., Shirley Gettis recalled that "my mother took everybody in. Everyone poor, drunk, down on their luck. I never really used that experience till I came to Canaan. We get out and feed the hungry and take them clothes and visit the sick."
And Canaan Baptist's Community Development Corporation moves beyond the realm of charity to the poor. It relies on volunteers, mostly from the church, to teach courses in job preparation, entrepreneurship, home ownership and computer skills. It has built three houses for low-income, first-time home buyers and is building four more. It has begun teaching classes for neighborhood children in dance and drama.
Sherri Franklin left her job as a graphic designer to join the development corporation three months ago "to do something more meaningful," she says. Franklin remembers that the first time she called Canaan Baptist for directions about five years ago, Malone himself answered the phone; after that morning's services, he sought her out and told her that the church needed her. "No other pastor had ever taken the time to tell me why I should join their church," Franklin says.
Malone expects not merely time from his flock but also money. Members are asked to donate 10 percent of their income, and they are also expected to give $12 a week toward a Dare to Dream fund to expand the church's activities, and $7 a week for the development corporation. Last year, church members raised $86,053 for the corporation and $20,000 more for educational scholarships, divided among 10 students from the congregation. For many Canaan Baptist members, such obligations are difficult to meet. The congregation is a home to students and truck drivers as well as professionals, and many people hold more than one job. There are homemakers, grandparents raising grandchildren and the unemployed. There are, as Malone says, the working poor "and the just po'."
"He has high expectations," says Saundra Calvin, one of Canaan's founding members and now the executive director of the development corporation. "Every time he asked, I know I didn't have the money, but I gave and got back double."
On a cold fall evening before Malone left for Israel, I rode with him as he steered his Mercedes slowly around the perimeter of his newest and most ambitious project: the 22-acre compound across town that his church just bought from Southeast Christian Church to hold its expanding congregation.
"All this is our property," Malone said. Except for the tall cross on the roof, the new church that Canaan Baptist will be moving into late next year has the look of a modern shopping mall, with more than 50 classrooms, a fellowship hall and a 2,500-seat sanctuary clustered like an island in a sea of blacktop.
Yet it isn't clear what the future may hold for Canaan Baptist. For all Malone's emphasis on sharing leadership, most congregation members I spoke to said they were stunned when he announced one Sunday last year that their church had bought the Southeast Christian property -- in a white, middle-class part of town. Some members were skeptical about the financial risk. Others were chagrined that the church seemed to be abandoning the hard-bitten west side with which it was so identified.
Malone responded to the concerns by pledging to keep the development corporation running in the west-end location. And the initial surprise has given way to an instinct to pull together. In the church's lobby, a red fund-raising "thermometer" shows nearly $600,000 raised toward the cost of the move; and Wednesday night's Bible study closed, as usual, with a parade of lay leaders stepping to the pulpit to plead for volunteers for the basketball and cheerleading ministry and ticket buyers for the development corporation's annual banquet.
Saundra Calvin told the churchgoers that she knew the $35 price was steep. "But God has blessed all of us in some way, and the Lord truly, truly, truly has His hands on Canaan," she said. "The Bible says, from those to whom much is given, much is required."

HEADLINE: Young Artists Finding Island Fuels Creative Juices

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS BRAFF 

 BODY:
WE used to think that all ambitious and talented young artists trying to launch their careers set up studios in the cosmopolitan city center, yet an increasing number seem to be deciding that Long Island has advantages that outweigh the city's promise. Their reasoning often involves space, nature, light, life style, serenity, economics and, not infrequently, the Island's special geography.
A variety of thoughts about their Long Island studio locations emerges from conversations with more than a dozen artists, all in their 20's and 30's, who have been receiving recognition for significant work. Those who chose the East End became increasingly conscious of the historically important artists who established studios in the area. Every one couples his ideas about locale with a firm determination to make his mark, and most feel that the region's characteristics provide the needed psychological and physical setting. 
 Referring to the shore, for example, Michael Rosch, a 37-year-old Bridgehampton artist, explained, "I like being on the coast, for that edge helps me know where I am and gives me a sense of relationship to the globe." Born in Yonkers, Mr. Rosch first came to know the area as a Southampton College student.
It is the openness of the landscape that is important to Hilary Helfant, 34, of Bridgehampton, who feels her evocative abstract surface configurations derive from nature. Ms. Helfant grew up in Great Neck and first visited the East End on family excursions as a child. Since completing graduate work at Hunter College, she has shown in galleries in New York, Long Island and Europe.
Sally Egbert, 38, of East Hampton also acknowledges the role landscape has in her abstract canvases and speaks enthusiastically about the linear structures she discovers in bare tree limbs.
Ms. Egbert, whose recent canvases are on view in "New Possibilities," which runs through Friday at the Staller Center on the State University campus in Stony Brook, has also shown nationally and internationally and has received major grants, including one from the New York State Council on the Arts. She moved east from the Brooklyn studio she had following college upstate. A native of Bay Shore, she said she always knew she loved water and the flat terrain.
Serenity is a reason many cite for their choice of Long Island studios. "Time is more abstract and I can get more out of a day," observed Ms. Egbert.
Deborah Fisher, 27, of Stony Brook, whose imaginative mixed-media objects and sculptures can be wonderfully contemplative, feels the pace on Long Island suits her creative temperament. After completing studies at the Maryland Institute, College of Art, she returned to set-up a studio-residence in Stony Brook, where she grew up. Currently the recipient of a New York Foundation for the Arts grant, Ms. Fisher has been exhibiting her sometimes metaphysical, sometimes metaphorical pieces throughout the country.
Hilarie Fuchs, 32, who makes somewhat ritualistic, shrinelike sculptures, is conscious of the way the trees and greenery provide a calming balance to her physical involvement in welding and grinding. She chose a Northport studio and a return to Floral Park, where she was born, after trying to work in loft space in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.
Those who had New York studios before choosing Long Island were uncomfortable with the quality of life and its effect on their work. Ms. Egbert speaks of hearing gunshots. Kathleen Kucka, 35, a Port Jefferson resident who attended Cooper Union and grew up in New York, where she frequently exhibits, observed, "I had no idea what it would be like to hear the sound of Canada geese outside my window instead of backed-up traffic." Many others mention the economic pressures they experienced trying to meet the living costs while also devoting their time to art.
After 10 years in Manhattan, Chicago-born Tom Wasik, 39, moved to Sag Harbor, where the available light, space and seemingly fluid time are more conducive to furthering the Asian spiritual qualities, theoretical issues and language-based ideas that appear in his recent paintings. Examples from this series have been included in five East End exhibitions this year. Other pieces have been shown across the country and in Europe during the past decade.
"The city is restrictive and claustrophobic, in spite of its museums and its vitality," Mr. Wasik noted.
Certainly the great yearning to control distractions contributed to decisions to relocate. "I wanted to see what would happen with the work under more isolated circumstances," commented Florida-born, New England-raised Peter Buchman, 37, who, after 13 years in New York, now creates his sizable collages in East Hampton. These are pieces laced with ironic, frequently well-researched observations of American society. Mr. Buchman had a one-man exhibition at the Delaware Art Museum last year.
For those who were raised on Long Island, relocation to the New York art world would seem to be a significant career consideration. James Fischetti, 31, who has spent his entire life in Islip, thought he was ready for the city after a decade of exhibition success but reconsidered, believing that in Suffolk he could better concentrate on his experiments in photography and his large, ambitious and bold painting projects that result from examinations of the world's religions.
Currently he is absorbed in studying African cultures. He also feels that on Long Island he will have a chance to develop workshops, expand his ideas about education through art, and perhaps make a difference.
While no one came to Long Island for exhibition opportunities, the artists inevitably form opinions about the region's art spaces. "Long Island galleries gave me a nice leg up," observed Gregory Corn, who has special praise for the staff at the Islip Art Museum for their openness to his thoughts for a creative, innovative installation. As he discussed his forthcoming exhibition in SoHo, Mr. Corn remarked about the pleasure of having easy access to New York while still staying with the bay and open spaces he has long favored.
Mr. Buchman feels that artists can use the Island's gallery structure for their career goals and Mr. Rosch agrees that "the area's galleries do a good job."
Mr. Wasik has found the Long Island galleries are more accessible. "With less competition for their time, it is easier to meet and discuss the work in a relaxed way," he said.
It seems to be the conceptual, and perhaps younger artists who feel that the right opportunities for solo exhibitions will most likely come from New York. Matthew Satz, 26, who was born in Brooklyn, went to school in Massachusetts and now paints in East Hampton. He thinks it is more probable that he will find connections in the metropolitan area for his sharp, satirical explorations of touchy aspects of contemporary American society. Nevertheless, in recent months he has had one solo show on Long Island and has been invited to participate in a number of group exhibitions.
A talented conceptual photographer working in Port Jefferson, Jennifer Shea, 26, whose local recognitions include the award of excellence at the Firehouse Gallery's juried exhibition, also plans to eventually try New York as a venue for her psychologically penetrating, satirical interpretations of female roles and her thematic series of images that create connections between physical obsessions, sexuality and sensuality. Born in New York, Ms. Shea grew up in Detroit but moved to Long Island as a C. W. Post student.
Concerns as to whether distance hurts relationships with the New York art world are logical, yet this has not become a problem for most of those surveyed. Ms. Egbert, Ms. Fuchs and Ms. Helfant were all in SoHo shows recently, and Ms. Kucka had made strong gallery connections in New York before relocating.
Following his move to East Hampton from his native New York City a decade ago, Robert Harms, 35, showed his vigorous, nature-inspired abstractions extensively on Long Island, but is now represented by a SoHo gallery.
Mr. Harms's experiences here over the years reinforce observations others readily offer about friendships, sense of community and support systems. Some speak of discovering mentors. "People are easier to access because there exists a certain tranquillity here," noted Mr. Satz.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
In Boom Times, Restaurants Offer Luxury

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
THE stock market is booming and so is the Long Island restaurant scene. The improved business climate has encouraged local restaurateurs to take a plunge back into palatial luxury dining spots that have a French rather than Italian spin and stress elegance and excellence rather than economy. The first of them, the magnificent chateau-like Louis XVI on the Great South Bay in Patchogue, opened recently to raves from critics and diners alike. Now comes Enoteca.
It is an upscale contemporary French-American restaurant, scheduled to open the week of Dec. 15 at 146 Birch Hill Road in Locust Valley (671-9486). This 95-seat luxury spot, where Sapore di Medittereno had been, boasts a fast-rising, French-trained 27-year-old executive chef, two wine lists offering 400 selections and a menu with an eclectic array of dishes that display worldwide influences and French techniques. 
 The new restaurant also has a glassed-in wine cellar that is thermally cooled by a waterfall, Reidel glassware, Limoges china, Oneida sterling silverware, an impressive wine wall and a large round table with a huge floral arrangement.
Albert Melera, the Buenos Aires-born kitchen commander, received his training at the Cordon Bleu School in Paris, was a sous chef at Restaurant Raphael in Manhattan and Giorgio's Mediterranean Grill in Hollywood, Fla., and saw service at Restaurant Bouley in the city, as well as at Le Grand Vefour, a Michelin two-star restaurant in Paris.
His French-American menu features Spanish, light Asian, Middle Eastern and North African-influenced dishes, including Thai-spiced rare yellow fin tuna ($26), paella marinera ($24) and cardomon-anise seared muscovy duck breast ($28). Appetizers are priced from $9 to $12, pastas $16 to $18 and made-on-the-premises desserts $6 to $8.
Fabio Machado and Piero Casalicchio of the Pomodoro restaurant group and Patrick Bruno, a restaurateur who has been associated with them in the past, are the owners of the new enterprise, and Roland Stefan is the interior decorator.
Asian restaurants are also upgrading. The Bombay Cafe, described as a "fancy Indian restaurant" by its owner, Sewa Arora, has been open for about three weeks at 1610 Old Country Road in Westbury (222-1689). Mr. Arora once owned the modestly priced Jhoola Indian restaurants throughout the Island.Entrees range from $8.50 for vegetarian dishes to $23 for shrimp tandoori.
Among the specials from the tandoor oven are whole trout and cornish hen. The focal point of the 70-seat spot, which Mr. Arora says is "opulent," is a 30 by 7 foot ceramic tile mural that was painted by a leading Indian artist. The chefs at the Bombay Cafe came to the Island from India and Bangladesh.
 
Potpourri
The second edition of Great Restaurants of Long Island, a glossy magazine that features pictures, menus and write-ups of most of Long Island's leading restaurants, is available at local bookstores and supermarkets. The 180-page book, published by Morris Sendor, an art director and graphic designer, contains descriptions of 130 restaurants, 8 vineyards and a brewery. It sells for $3, and is available at bookstores, supermarkets and from advertisers who are participating in the magazine.
Ken Lammer, who for the last few years was the chef and owner of the well-received Ken's Place in Sea Cliff, is opening a restaurant called K.P.N.Y. (Ken's Place New York) in Manhattan.
Mr. Lammer, who closed his local spot in August, and his partner, Peter Speranza, plan to open at 557 Hudson Street on Dec. 15.
Mr. Lammer will introduce his New York City balanced health cuisine menu to Island diners at a $50 buffet dinner, music and dance event at the Light Works in Glen Cove on Friday. The four-hour event, with entertainment, will begin at 7 P.M. Reservations can be made by calling 671-3978.
The Catfish Cafe, 172 Merrick Road, Lynbrook (599-0627), is offering a traditional Louisiana crawfish boil every Friday night. It consists of cornbread, whole crawfish, mussels, potatoes, corn and andouille sausage steamed in a spicy broth, for $15.95.
Cornucopia, at 360 Glen Cove Avenue in Glen Head (759-4100), has a $12.95 twilight menu that is served from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 7 P.M. The three-course meal includes main courses like Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy and oven-roasted salmon in a lemon white wine sauce.
The new menu at Cafe Samovar, the Russian-American restaurant at 2455 Long Beach Road, Oceanside (764-7676), features a number of low-fat choices along with its traditional Russian specialties.
Among them are stuffed grape leaves with garlic yogurt sauce ($5.25), a tomato and onion swirl topped with a balsamic vinegar and olive oil ($4.25), shrimp Black Sea, or grilled and marinated jumbo shrimp, with grilled vegetables ($14.95) and trout Odessa, broiled in olive oil, served with garlic and dill sauce ($13.95).
Gisela's, at 32 Railroad Avenue in Glen Head (656-0374), has introduced a $14.95 sunset dinner served Sunday through Friday from 6:30 to 10 P.M. It includes a choice of red or white house wine, salad or soup, entree, dessert and beverage. Among the seven main courses are chicken Della Casa, grilled salmon Napolitano and roasted duck in an orange sauce.
During its holiday special sale, the Lenz Winery on Route 25, Main Road, in Peconic is featuring wines that consistently compared favorably with the best from France and California in blind tastings.
Among the offerings are Lenz 1995 cabernet sauvignon estate bottled ($24.99) that beat a 1993 Chateau Latour at $217 a bottle. It was also rated only four points behind the 1993 Opus One ($90). A Lenz 1994 estate bottled merlot ($29.99) topped a 1992 Chateau Petrus by one point. A Petrus 1993 beat a Lenz 1994 by eight-tenths of a point. Petrus costs $300 a bottle.
The independently held tastings occurred last summer, in San Francisco, at Postrio Restaurant in Union Square, the summer of 1996 at the Tribeca Grill in Manhattan and earlier this year at Ross's Northfork Restaurant in Greenport.
The Single Gourmet (674-6186) is holding three events in December: An Indian buffet featuring an 18-course buffet dinner at Jewel of India in Syosset on Wednesday, a Japanese dinner featuring a combination of traditional sushi dishes and more modern tempura and teriyaki dishes at Hokkaido Japanese Restaurant in Albertson on Dec. 16 and its annual holiday dinner dance party featuring a five-course continental wine dinner with live music for dancing and gifts to celebrate the season at Chateau Briand in Carle Place on Dec. 29.

Infrastructure Aid Stirs Interest in Industrial Parks

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THREE years ago a developer for Nestle Foods who was seeking a site for a distribution center looked at a 54-acre industrially zoned tract in Killingly, off Interstate 395.
"We made it through the second cut in the site-selection process, but then it never progressed," said R. Thomas Homan, the Town Manager. "So we knew the site was attractive. It just wasn't getting the interest it should because the infrastructure wasn't there." 
 Now, under a joint state and local government program known as Smart Parks, $8 million in road and utility improvements are under way at five public and private industrial parks totaling almost 500 acres in Killingly and the neighboring Town of Putnam and new interest has been generated.
"As soon as people recognized that we were running utilities in there, voila, in comes Staples," said John E. Burke, the Town Council chairman. "That's not a coincidence. Obviously, they were waiting for the utilities."
Staples, the office-supply company, has completed construction of a $21 million, 326,000-square-foot regional distribution center on the site Nestle passed over. It will be opened early next year.
Putnam's economic development director, Elizabeth T. Murphy, said that her town was also starting to see some results from the state-local initiative, which requires localities to put up 15 percent of the funds needed for improvements.
"Three companies just moved in, and another expanded, all within the last year or so and I think Smart Parks was a major reason for most of them," Ms. Murphy said. "Another advantage is the price -- about $28,500 an acre for industrially zoned land. It's not only very affordable, but Interstate 395 makes it accessible to areas that are much more expensive. You can do business here as easily as in some areas that would cost you a lot more."
State Senator Donald E. Williams Jr., Democrat of Thompson, one of the sponsors of the Smart Parks program, said the regional collaboration on the parks helped win state financing for the initiative. He said the program could help turn around an area that has never recovered from the collapse of manufacturing in the 60's and 70's.
Smart Parks began in 1996, initially with a $2.5 million grant from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development for utility-line improvements to the Northeast Alliance, an economic development organization whose members are 10 towns in northeastern Connecticut.
"Northeastern Connecticut has traditionally lagged behind the rest of the state economically," said Senator Williams. "We've been putting the building blocks in place to change that. Now, as we see the state and New England moving slowly forward in terms of their economy, hopefully northeastern Connecticut is poised to take advantage of that."
The latest statistics at the state's Department of Labor put unemployment in northeastern Connecticut at 7.2 percent, almost two points higher than the 5.3 percent state average. The average manufacturing wage in the area is $478.55 a week, the lowest in the state, and about 26 percent less than in Hartford, an hour west.
The poor economy of the region is one of the reasons the General Assembly approved in 1994 the state's first multitown enterprise zone stretching along the I-395 corridor and taking in eight towns -- Griswold, Lisbon, Putnam, Killingly, Plainfield, Sprague, Sterling and Thompson. (A second one, including Ansonia, Derby, Seymour, Naugatuck and Beacon Falls, was approved in 1995 along the Route 8 corridor.)
All the industrial parks affected by the Smart Parks initiative will qualify for the special benefits of an enterprise zone, including a five-year, 80 percent abatement of property taxes, a 10-year, 25 percent state corporate tax credit and job-training grants.
The Smart Parks project has focused on Tracy Road in Killingly, which turns into Park Road in Putnam. The road gives access to three public and two private industrial parks.
Sewer and water lines, electrical upgrades and some telephone cable improvements have already been completed. A new water tower was constructed and the water lines from both towns were connected -- although they operate separate systems -- to provide the maximum water pressure.
THE original state plan for Tracy Road improvements called for the infrastructure changes to be limited to the part of the road in Killingly. Killingly argued that the work should continue into the Putnam parks to improve access for both.
"What's unique about this project is that it started as a regional project," Senator Williams said. "This was not a situation where one town took the lead and another town joined in late. Oftentimes you see competition or even hostility between towns when it comes to economic development. This was, right from the start, a cooperative venture by the two towns' officials."
"Towns like Thompson, Putnam, Killingly and Plainfield all share a common heritage as former textile mill towns," he continued. "They're all located along the Interstate 395 corridor and the Providence & Worcester rail line. They share many interests, so I think it's natural that the towns link up the way they have."
Local officials said there was a recognition that fighting over what town would attract the next company was not a good strategy.
"We're more likely to attract the attention of corporate decision-makers if we can put out an entire inventory of industrial sites," said Ms. Murphy, the Putnam official.
"With Smart Parks, people are starting to see that it's to everyone's advantage to cooperate," said Elsie Bisset, the economic development coordinator in Killingly. "People are going to live in our town and work in Putnam, or live in Putnam and work here. Obviously, if you have a business in one town it's going to benefit all the towns."
Ms. Bisset said the parks had been particularly attractive to distribution centers. Besides Staples, there are two major sites in the privately owned Killingly Oaks industrial park, developed in 1989 -- the 450,000-square-foot Brooks Pharmacy distribution center and United Natural Foods, which has an addition under construction that will bring its total to 250,000 square feet.
The first phase of the town-owned Killingly Industrial Park has already attracted 13 companies employing more than 2,000 employees, including a bottling plant, a plastics manufacturer, a mattress factory and a cosmetics concern. That park, which has been under development since 1981, has only one six-acre site left.
But an expansion is planned on 110 acres adjacent to the park. The town has received a $109,000 planning grant from the state to do a survey and evaluation, and U.S. Generating, a private power generating company, has already taken an option on 38 acres to build a 500- to 810-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant, she said.
"Under the current law they would have to sell power wholesale," said Ms. Bisset, explaining how the plant could help the park. "But if electric utilities are deregulated as expected they would go into the retail business, and could sell directly to the companies in the industrial park. It could mean lower rates, which would make the park very attractive to a lot of high-technology companies."
"Warehouse distribution is good because it pays high taxes," she continued, "but it doesn't create a lot of high-paying jobs. And that's why we want to get some more high-technology companies into the parks. As a region, we're targeting photonics, plastics, and agri-tech firms and we'd like to see more back-office operations in the industrial parks to give us a mix."
It's a strategy that has also been adopted by Putnam, said Ms. Murphy.
"We're subdividing some of the land left in our industrial park into two-acre parcels so smaller companies with good growth potential can find a place to start doing business," Ms. Murphy said. "If you have three of these companies and even one of them takes off, it can really make a difference in the local economy. And if the two next to it go out of business, the one that does make it can expand."

HEADLINE: New Effort To Combat Student Use Of Alcohol

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE rallying cry among young drinkers used to be a rousing "Party Hearty!" Increasingly, it is now a sobering "Party Hardly," especially after the alcohol-related death of a Port Chester college student earlier this year, the suspension of high school athletes in Harrison and Peekskill this fall and recent drinking fatalities at college campuses nationwide.
"There has to be a better way," said a worried Shannon Fogarty, president of the Greek Council at Iona College, which represents 14 sororities and fraternities on the New Rochelle campus. "We've got to change things." 
 In Westchester and the rest of the country, college and high school students -- along with their teachers, guidance counselors and deans -- are taking a fresh look at an old problem. The recent spate of alcohol-related incidents and fresh data on student alcohol use is presenting an increasingly ugly picture.
Last spring, the body of 20-year-old Patrick McNeill was found in New York Harbor. A lawsuit filed by his parents in State Supreme Court in White Plains contends that the Dapper Dog bar in Manhattan illegally served alcohol to the Fordham University student until he could no longer stand and that his drunken condition was the reason he fell into the harbor and drowned.
In Harrison, 13 football players and a tennis player at the high school were suspended this fall after some admitted drinking at a Yonkers bar, Dicey Reilly's. Besides being under age, the students violated school policy prohibiting varsity athletes from drinking or using drugs.
Also this fall, the Peekskill Red Devils were forced to forfeit their high school homecoming game against Somers when seven players were suspended. The players were among a group of students discovered drinking in a park before morning classes.
In another recent incident, Police Chief Russell J. Beckley of Mount Pleasant said a 19-year-old female student at Pace University passed out in a dorm, apparently after spending a Saturday night drinking illegally at a Sleepy Hollow bar. The under-age drinker was taken to a hospital where she was treated for alcohol poisoning and later released.
There have been other cases: inOneonta, N.Y., a 22-year-old student at Hartwick College became drunk last May at a fraternity party, fell into a nearby river and died; in Boston this fall, an 18-year-old freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology drank heavily at a fraternity party, lost consciousness and died, and was found to have a blood alcohol level of .41, more than five times the legal driving limit; at Louisiana State University this fall, a 20-year-old fraternity pledge died and a dozen members fell ill from drinking at an off-campus party.
Those are examples in a string of similar incidents in recent years, stretching from North Carolina to California. About 4,000 Americans die every year from alcohol poisoning, many of them college students, said Sally Linowski-Damon, a University of Massachusetts health educator.
The following sets of statistics also indicate the breadth of the problem: A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that 44 percent of all American college students who were surveyed engaged in binge drinking -- taking five drinks in succession for men, four for women; Studies of alcohol use among teen-agers in high school show that 70.6 percent used alcohol in 1995-96 and in grades 6 through 8, 44.5 percent, reported Andrew Bearman, a spokesman for the National Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education of Atlanta.
"Alcohol is the king drug," said Dr. Patricia Singleton, a Mount Kisco psychologist who specializes in chemical and alcohol addictions. "It dwarfs the problems of cocaine and heroin." Alcohol problems often begin in early adolescence when all youngsters come under harsh group pressures and some develop anxiety and depression, she said.
While there are some indications that drug use may be leveling off among high school students, the use of liquor and cigarettes appears to be increasing. The State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services said that 8 of 10 secondary school students have tried alcohol, and nearly half of those are regular drinkers.
In Harrison, Ronald D. Valenti, Superintendent of Schools, said it was "a daily battle, very much an uphill battle" to control alcohol abuse among students.
He said the recent suspension of the athletes sent "a message not just for one game, but for life, that their behavior has consequences. Winning or losing a game or the section was secondary to that lesson."
Stacey Benjamin, a counselor with Student Assistance Services at Harrison High School, said that drinking among teen-agers cuts across all socio-economic lines, while the more expensive drugs like cocaine and heroin tend to be used more by wealthier youths.
Compounding the alcohol abuse problem is the fact that at both college and high school levels, under-age drinkers find many bars willing to serve them.
At Manhattanville College in Purchase, Mary Corrarino, the vice president of student affairs and development, said that two White Plains bars, Iguanawana and Flamingos, formerly the Top Shelf Pub, hired students to inundate the campus with fliers advertising the bars and appealing to both legal-age drinkers and those who are under age.
Mark Rosato, owner of Flamingos, said that the bar did not sell alcohol to under-age drinkers and that it no longer tries to attract the college crowd. Kerri Mackin, a bartender at Inguanawana, said that a guard checks identification at the door. On Wednesday nights, however, the bar encourages college students who are at least 21 to come in, he said.
A flier from a Port Chester bar, 7 Willow Street, advertises free beer until midnight and "$1 kamikaze shots all night."
Libby McCaffrey, student government president at Manhattanville, said that for under-age drinkers who want to go to bars, "it's easy to get a false I.D."
Even more of a problem, she said, is the fact that many bartenders are college students themselves and are willing to overlook the drinking age.
In the Patrick McNeill case, the bar served the student even though a bartender who was a suite mate at Fordham knew or should have known that he was under age, said Aldo V. Vitagliano, a lawyer for the McNeills.
"The parents would like to send a message that these establishments that solicit under-age drinkers and let them drink must be held accountable," the lawyer said.
In the case of the Pace University student, the police said she had apparently been drinking at South Paws North, a bar in Sleepy Hollow known by authorities to cater to the college crowd and serve under-age patrons.
Police Detective Frank Corona of Sleepy Hollow said the department had many problems with under-age drinking at the bar, where fighting also broke out routinely. He said the police department had referred the problem to the Westchester District Attorney's office and was cooperating in efforts to crack down on the bar's management.
On Oct. 30, District Attorney Jeanine Pirro reported that an undercover operation had resulted in 44 arrests for selling alcohol to people younger than 21. It was the result of a countywide sting conducted in August and September by the District Attorney's Office and the police departments of New Rochelle, Pelham, Ardsley, Sleepy Hollow, Port Chester, North Castle, Harrison, Mount Kisco and Greenburgh.
Under-age youths acting in an undercover capacity were able to buy alcohol without proof of age in 44 of 100 establishments in the county. In each instance, the sales were witnessed by an investigator from the District Attorney's office, and most were videotaped. In some cases, youths presented driver's licenses marked younger than 21 to store clerks who nevertheless completed the sale.
Selling alcohol to a minor is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or a sentence of up to a year in jail. The New York State Liquor Authority can impose penalties, including fines and suspensions and revocations of sales licenses.
Meanwhile, efforts to alter the "Party Hearty" attitude are growing, Mr. Fogarty at Iona College said.
Knowing that binge drinkers are 11 times more likely to fall behind in school, 10 times more likely to drive after drinking and 7 times more likely to have unprotected sex, according to the State Office of Alcoholism, colleges are toughening their approach to the problem.
Iona has become "basically a dry campus," with alcohol served at some events only by special permission, Paul LaMantia, director of student development, said. The college has also developed a relationship with the nearby Beechmont Tavern, which serves nonalcoholic drinks free to designated drivers and is said to stand by a policy of refusing to serve alcoholic beverages to anyone younger than 21.
At Manhattanville, Ms. Corrarino said the college was considering earlier class times to discourage late-night partying. It will also set aside part of a dormitory next year for students who are recovering alcoholics.
Pace University has set up an alcohol education and rehabilitation program for students with St. Vincent's Hospital-Westchester in Harrison.
"We're looking at ways to change the drinking culture," said Geoffrey J. Harter, dean of students at the Pace campus in Pleasantville. "We want students to believe that they don't have to drink to be cool, that they don't have to get loaded to have fun."
 
Changes in Behavior Can Signal Trouble
HOW do you know if a high school or college student is abusing alcohol? While it is not always easy to spot the problem, there are some behavior changes that could signal trouble, said Dr. Mary Pressman, director of the County Medical Center's day-treatment program for adolescents with substance abuse and emotional problems.
Be alert to irrational outbursts, hypersensitivity, irritability or mood swings, school absenteeism, poor grades and other changes, Dr. Pressman said, adding that adolescents at risk of substance abuse tend to spend their leisure time with older teen-agers and young adults who can provide access to alcohol or drugs.
Other possible indicators of a substance abuse problem: isolation from friends and family, ignoring curfews and sneaking out at night, lying or blaming others for irresponsible actions and theft from family members or stores.
Also watch for selling possessions for money, increased secretiveness about personal problems or activities, erratic eating or sleeping habits, dropping out of sports or other activities, an increased incidence of fighting with peers, decreased attention to personal hygiene and obvious signs of hangover or drug use, including reddened eyes, headaches and blackouts.
Dr. John Wallace, a psychologist and the director of alcohol and substance abuse services at St. Vincent's Hospital-Westchester in Harrison warned that in addition to causing health problems among young adults the heavy use of alcohol can also lead to unprotected sex and sexually transmitted diseases.
Problems of date rape also increase with intoxication, mainly because both parties run the risk of "misreading each other's cues," Dr. Wallace said.
The State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services reported earlier this year that binge drinkers are 7 to 10 times more likely than others to have unprotected sex, to get into trouble with the campus police, to damage property, to be injured and to fall behind in school. About 90 percent of campus rapes and 95 percent of campus violence were committed when alcohol was consumed by the offender or the victim, the office said.
Experts are also seeing a link between heavy drinking and compulsive gambling. "Kids become emboldened when intoxicated and place major bets," Dr. Wallace said, "and then they have no means to pay."
Alcohol was cited in the drownings last spring of Patrick McNeill from Fordham University in the Bronx and a student at Hartwick College in Oneonta. Those who are intoxicated are also more likely to choke on food, and if they vomit after passing out and lying on their backs, they can drown.
Alcohol intoxication can also encourages use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, Dr. Wallace said. While alcohol is a depressant, cocaine acts in the opposite way -- as a stimulant that can cause closed arteries, chest pains and heart attack.
"Also, cocaine users think they can drink more," he warned. "And with pills and tranquilizers flying around at some parties, the synergy of alcohol and drugs can shut down the respiratory centers in the brain. It's a dangerous combination."
The State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services reports that in the state, 15 percent of students in grades 7 through 12 are heavy users of both alcohol and other drugs. Among juniors and seniors, more than 1 in 5 are heavy users of both.
Among college students in the state, 86 percent drink alcoholic beverages, the office said. Marijuana is used by nearly half of the college students in New York. The next most popular substances are hallucinogens like LSD, amphetamines like diet pills and cocaine.
How much alcohol is lethal? It depends on the drinker's body weight and other factors, but just a pint of spirits, when rapidly ingested, can raise the blood alcohol content to 0.35 and above, which is considered lethal range. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: In Middle Age and Suddenly Single

BYLINE: By NANCY RUBIN 

 BODY:
SOME of them married soon after high school or college. Others continued to date for another decade before saying, "I do." Still others ended an early first marriage only to wed again with equally unhappy results. But whatever their particular story, the number of Westchester residents who became divorced in their middle years has been on the rise in the last decade.
Figures from the United States Bureau of the Census indicate that the number of Americans who divorced between the age of 40 and 54 in 1995 represents nearly 14 percent of the population, up from 11 percent a decade ago. While specific figures are not available on the marital status of Westchester residents, a 1995 study by the State Department of Health revealed that 600 cases, or 25 percent of all divorces filed in Westchester County that year, involved couples who had been married 15 to 30 years. 
 Local officials, matrimonial lawyers and behavioral experts attribute much of the midlife divorce phenomenon to the dramatic social and economic changes of the last three decades.
"Women who stayed in marriages before don't feel as compelled to stay now, and much of that has to do with economics," said Camille Murphy, director of the Westchester County Office for Women and President of the National Association of Commissions for Women.
"Today women are better off economically because they are better educated, and thus more marketable for jobs," Ms. Murphy said. "As a result, they just won't tolerate a bad marital situation the way they did years ago."
Other experts attribute the rising midlife divorce rate to expanded expectations. "It's my impression that that upswing in midlife divorce in Westchester has a lot to do with the increased stress in people's lives, and those stresses are enormous," said Mary Kelly, a partner in the White Plains matrimonial law firm of Kelly & Knaplund, which often litigates divorce for couples in their 40's and 50's.
"One source of stress can be the fact that both adults in the family are working and trying to raise children," she said. "Another is the idea we have today that personal happiness is important and not be be deferred. All it takes is for one partner to raise his hand and say, 'This isn't right for me,' to end the marriage."
A matrimonial lawyer, John Bavero of the White Plains firm Berman Bavero Frucco & Gouz, said: "There's also some truth to the idea of the midlife crisis. People who are 45 or 50 have a sense of their lives passing and start focusing on what might make them happy in a new way. If the kids are leaving or have already left for college that's one more tie between the couple that is gone. All these forces come together and often that begins the process that dissolves the marriage."
Despite the perception that there are more divorced people in midlife living in the county today than ever before, many newly single residents contend they are an invisible population.
"It's a completely different experience to be single here in the county." said Leonora Macris of Irvington, who was married 32 years before being divorced. "After all those years, suddenly you're not a pair. In a way it would be easier to be widowed because you'd get more compassion." But Robin Goldstein, a mother of two, said: "It's not that people aren't sympathetic. But often they don't know what to say, so they say nothing. Being single is like being part of an underground population here. When I was married, all my friends were couples. I didn't know anyone who was single or divorced."
Added to the sense of invisibility is economic duress, particularly for divorced women, many of whom remain in the suburbs to provide a safe environment and good schools for their children.
"We see that poverty among many of the women who call our office," said Ms. Murphy of the county's Office for Women. "Often it looks good on the surface. But behind it, behind the house she's still living in, there's poverty. A lot of divorced women are house poor but remain here for the sake of the kids."
National studies indicate that men suffer less economic distress than women after divorce but their finances tend to improve. A study in June 1996 published in the "American Sociological Review" found that a woman's standard of living fell 27 percent after divorce while a man's rose by 10 percent. Nevertheless, suddenly single Westchester men have their own brand of problems.
"Part of the difficulty for men is the displacement that occurs with divorce," Mr. Bavero, the matrimonial lawyer, observed. "Usually they have to find a new residence and create a new household. Secondly, they often have less contact with their young children. Thirdly, they have to deal with the economic obligations they still have to former spouses and children."
Despite those hurdles, many midlife men and women often start dating again, even though the process may be difficult. "When I go to dances, it makes me feel like I'm back in junior high because the men stand on one side and the women on another," a 45-year-old government worker who had been married for two decades said.
Many women find the dating situation is particularly difficult, especially if they are mothers with children still at home.
"Who has time to date?" said Susan Portlock of Chappaqua, a mother of four. "My whole life is still raising kids. The only difference is that I don't have a husband around anymore. And even when men ask me out, I don't really have either the time or energy for a relationship."
Some single women, however, complain that there are no available men. "It's hard to meet professional men here in Westchester because a lot of divorced men move to the city," said a middle-age teacher who attended a program for single people in Elmsford.
Statistically, that may be true. Census Bureau data from 1990 indicates that there were 14,600 divorced men living in Westchester in 1995 compared with 26,003 women. Many psychological and behavioral experts say that many divorced men tend to remain isolated because they do not know how to make appropriate social connections, a skill that was usually left to their wives when they were married.
"The problem is that many men don't know how to network the way women do," said Judith Gilbert Kautto, co-director of the Marital Project for the Center for Family Learning in Rye Brook. "Women pick up the phone; they have friends. But men tend to keep to themselves."
Such was the case for Paul Dengler, a manufacturer's representative from Yonkers. "When you're married, you get into a pattern in which you come home after work and relax and become a couch potato," he said. "Once you're single it becomes important to get out and meet people. But in the beginning it's difficult.
Some men, like Sam Heslowitz, 58, of Yonkers, who had been married 22 years, say that they no longer have the social skills needed to date. "In the beginning you don't know how to behave, how to interact, what to say, how to react," he said. Mr. Heslowitz said he attended a barbecue where he was talking to a single woman who suddenly excused herself to get mustard for her hot dog. "That was the last I saw of her," he said. "Now I can deal with that -- the little hurts that come with dating again. But in the beginning I didn't know how."
Even men who have been single for many years often say that living in the suburbs can be lonely. "At my club it's still difficult because nearly everyone else is married," Peter Price, 46, of Harrison, said. "That makes it more difficult to go to parties and dances unless I invite a date."
Repeatedly, suddenly single middle-age people observe that because Westchester was the traditional bastion of married couples, there are few places to meet other middle-age people. "It's tougher here than in Manhattan or even on Long Island," said Tony Geidel, 45, of White Plains, who is president of the Westchester-based Catholic Singles organization, which he helped found in the 1980's. "There are fewer singles groups in Westchester, fewer places for singles to go at night and a lot of apprehension about who the singles are going to meet if they do go out as individuals." As a result, many single women are cautious about where to meet men.
In response, some singles groups have sprung up in the county for people older than 40. Most of them offer suggestions on how to meet other single people. Among them was Meet Me at the Movies, a monthly Sunday afternoon program that invites singles to attend a film, followed by dinner at a restaurant and a discussion about what they saw. The group, founded several years ago by Carol Sacks of Chappaqua after her divorce, is meant, she said, "as a way to enable single midlifers to meet each other and have a chance to get to know each other by talking about a common experience."
Today Ms. Sacks's mailing list has grown to more than 1,200 from 120. Another group is Westchester Singles, which serves about 3,000 single midlifers a year, many of whom travel from Rockland and Putnam Counties as well as Westchester. On Saturday nights the group sponsors events like dances and discussion groups and demonstrations of yoga and tai chi at the Unitarian Fellowship building in Mount Kisco.
Still other groups, like those started by Marion Smith, an entrepreneur who is host of Singles Tennis parties on Saturday nights at the Rye Racquet Club, find sports are another natural way for singles to socialize. "Playing tennis is an easy way to meet others," said Ms. Smith, who began by being the host of tennis parties in Westchester and the Bronx 20 years ago. "It's a good way to get some exercise, hone your tennis skills and make new friends."
Ms. Smith, who also offers a Sunday night dance and buffet for singles at the Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown, has more than 17,000 Westchester singles on her mailing list. Unlike many of her single clients, Ms. Smith maintains that it is now easier for singles to socialize in Westchester than it was in the past.
One suburban enthusiast is Isabella Deutsch, a divorced businesswoman who lives in Briarcliff Manor and was married for 22 years. "I live part time in New York City, and it's not necessarily easier to meet people there than in suburbia," she said. "In Manhattan your neighbors in your apartment building are polite, but often that's about it. Here when I get home, it's a time for relaxation, for enjoying the outdoors. I can't think of a more beautiful or cultural place to live."
Ms. Deutsch, like many singles who have chosen to live in Westchester, has also discovered that happiness has less to do with location than attitude.
"Being single is a great opportunity to become introduced to all kinds of new interests and develop skills you didn't have time for before," she said. "It's a time to enjoy your life and take a few risks as well. People who are basically positive remain so wherever they live."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Less Density Helps Sell West Orange on 2 Projects

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE future of two of the last large parcels in West Orange, put on hold by the real estate recession of the early 90's, now appears to be set.
Construction is under way on a 100-unit town-house community on a 34-acre site along Eagle Rock Avenue. And by the end of next spring work is expected to start on a mixed-used project comprising 150 town houses, a 100,000-square-foot office building and a 500-seat amphitheater on 50 acres a quarter of a mile away off Interstate 280. 
 A new owner, a partnership of BNE Associates of Livingston and Roseland Property Company of Roseland, is developing both projects, which will replace those conceived in the mid-80's building boom but either never completed or not begun. The current projects also will be built at a substantially lower density than had been proposed forthe earlier ones.
The larger site had been targeted for a 900,000-square-foot office complex and the smaller one was to accommodate two mid-rise residential condominiums with a total of 281 units, as well as 48 town houses. They were to accompany the existing 178-unit, eight-story condominium on the site.
The revision in plans is good news for West Orange, a nearly fully developed township of about 40,000 residents in suburban Essex County.
"The earlier proposals were too dense and would have caused needless congestion," said John F. McKeon, president of the Township Council. "Though we would have preferred to leave the land undeveloped these new proposals are reasonable from an esthetic perspective." They also are sources of revenue, he added.
The revised plan for the two sites demonstrates the changes over the last decade in market conditions, consumer preferences and community views of high-density development. But it also underscores the intricate juggling act towns perform as they search for ways to expand their tax bases and preserve their residents' quality of life.
Getting the projects to this point involved, among other things, the rezoning of the larger site from commercial to its current use and amending the approvals for the town-house development.
Larry Pantirer, a principal of BNE, said he and his partners persisted because "you just don't find that many large sites in the northern part of the state that would allow multifamily housing, and when they come around if you don't take them someone else will."
The projects are advancing at a time when town houses are finding renewed interest from professional couples and empty-nesters who want the maintenance-free life-style such housing offers, residential brokers say. Those are the buyers Mr. Pantirer said he and his partners want to attract.
As of the third quarter the average sale price for existing one-family homes, including town house units, was $192,400, up from $191,600 the same time in 1996, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison. "The demand for well located town houses that are appropriately priced outstrips the supply," said David J. Schoner, vice president of the metropolitan region at the New Homes Division of Coldwell Banker, a brokerage based in Short Hills.
BUT the lack of supply of suitably zoned land will temper the pace of construction of such projects, which, at least for the near term, should help those projects now under way or about to begin. Mr. Schoner added, however, that location was a key ingredient for success. The developer of the two West Orange projects feel location is on their side.
"Almost all of the sales of town houses in West Orange have been to empty-nesters, said Marshall B. Tycher, a Roseland principal. "It is a very good market and there is no longer that much available so we feel very comfortable."
The 50-acre site of the mixed-use project edging a busy interstate includes the township-owned five-acre Crystal Lake and thick trees extending to the Watchung Mountains. For the first half of the century the property was a recreation area, offering boating, fishing and swimming. At one time it also had an amusement park, restaurant and picnic grounds, but over the years they were left to deteriorate.
In the late 80's a joint venture of Trammell Crow of Dallas, one of the nation's largest commercial developers, and Kajima, a development company in Tokyo, planned to turn the site into a 900,000-square-foot office complex. But before they could find a tenant, the recession hit. Trammell Crow lost interest and pulled out and Kajima ultimately put the project on hold.
Last year BNE and Roseland, considering the site better suited for housing, contracted to buy it contingent upon getting it rezoned for 208 town houses and six single-family homes. But the township rejected that proposal. The two sides compromised on the current project and last June the township rezoned the site to accommodate it.
The developer also has agreed to restore the weed-choked lake and set up a $200,000 reserve fund the township can tap to maintain it. They also agreed to make $250,000 in road and traffic improvements, including relocating the main entrance to the site, now at the intersection of Prospect Avenue and the I-280 exit and entry ramps, to a point north of the crossroads. In addition, they will pay a fee on each unit, totaling about $60,000, to West Orange for use in making capital improvements to its schools and build the amphitheater, which they will donate to the township for public use.
"This development is the best use of the site," said Mr. McKeon, the Township Council president. "It gives us the most favorable return on our need for new ratables and does not outweigh what we have to pay out in terms of new municipal services." He estimated that the project, when fully built, would generate about $600,000 in new annual tax revenue.
Of the compromise, Mr. Tycher said: "We are satisfied with our return and with the risk of blending the town houses with this amount of office space."
The project still must receive final site plan approval from the Township Planning Board. As soon as that is obtained, Mr. Tycher said, the site will be cleared and construction is expected to start by spring on all three components of the project.
The project has been designed by the Martin Organization of Philadelphia. As now envisioned, the amphitheater, which will back up onto the lake, and the three-story, 100,000-square-foot office building will sit on either side of the main entrance to the site. The town-house community will front the lake. About 65 percent of the site will remain as open space.
THE traditional style two- and three-bedroom homes will be built in clusters, with an average of six units each, around interior courtyards. The units, each with a 2-car garage, will range in size from 1,900 to 2,300 square feet and in price from $275,000 to $325,000. Monthly maintenance charges have not yet been set. The entire project, estimated to cost $50 million, will take about three years to build.
Meanwhile, work continues at the nearby 100-unit town-house community, called the Villas at Crown View. Its 34-acre site off Eagle Rock Avenue was part of the Orange Quarry that for most of this century was mined for bluestone used for highway construction in the area. It closed in 1983.
Last year the partners bought the site, framed by a ridge climbing to 140 feet, from the Marine Midland Bank in Manhattan, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. The bank had taken over the property, including the existing building, known as Crown View Manor, when the former developer went bankrupt several years ago.
In the intervening years the bank sold the 178 apartments in that building, which sits on eight acres. Mr. Tycher said he and his partners scaled back the project initially to 180 town houses for several reasons. Among them were that they felt town houses would be easier to sell in today's market, that the township and existing residents would be more supportive of a smaller project and that the bank had adjusted the purchase price of the land to reflect the lower density.
Nonetheless, the partners spent about a year and a half negotiating with the township and the Crown View Manor condominium board and agreed to modify the project to its current scale before an agreement was struck. The township approved the project last spring. The town houses, laid out in three-unit clusters, will have 2,050 to 2,450 square feet of living space, two or three bedrooms and a two-car garage. Prices range from $300,000 to $375,000. In the six weeks since sales started 16 of the projected 100 units have been sold.
Mr. Pantirer said that once this project was half completed the partners would begin marketing the remainder, keeping the pace of absorption steady. If the economy remains strong, he said, "we feel the market will stay with us."

HEADLINE: Middle-Aged, Single, Looking for a Life

BYLINE: By NANCY RUBIN 

 BODY:
SOME men and women married soon after high school or college. Others continued to date for another decade before saying "I do." Still others ended an early first marriage only to wed again with equally unhappy results. Whatever their story, the number of Connecticut residents divorced in their middle years has become increasingly visible in the last decade.
Figures from the Federal Bureau of the Census indicate that the number of Americans who divorced between the ages of 40 and 54 in 1995 represented nearly 14 percent of the population, up from 11 percent a decade earlier. While the overall divorce rate in Connecticut has declined slightly since 1992, officials, lawyers and behaviorists attribute much of the rise in mid-life divorce to the social and economic changes of the last three decades. "People are marrying later and having children later and therefore it's not surprising that they're getting divorced later," said Leslie Brett, executive director of the Connecticut Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. 
 While balancing child-rearing and work comes into play as before, the issues around divorce are changing. In the past, disgruntled middle-aged husbands often left their wives for younger women. But today more women are also striking out. "A major contributor to that dissatisfaction," observed Eliot Nerenberg, a West Hartford lawyer and chairman of the family life division of the Connecticut Bar Association, "is the sense in midlife that time is running out." He continued: "In the middle years, many people are beginning to realize their mortality. If they're unhappy, they begin wondering 'Do I want to spend the next 20, 30 or 40 years with this person? I'm middle-aged and I'm still attractive. Maybe I can find somebody better'."
Another factor is the changing view of divorce itself. "There's no stigma to getting divorced today as there used to be," said Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University and the author of "Anatomy of Love: The Natural History of Monogamy, Adultery and Divorce" (Fawcett, 1994). "At the beginning of the century women who were widowed or divorced went to live with their children or parents. But today those who are single in mid-life often look for a new mate."
Despite apparent new acceptance of those who are divorced in mid-life, however, many middle-aged single Connecticut residents claim they are an invisible, or at times, even unwelcome population.
"When you've been married for 20 years the losses you suffer are great," said Marc Berenzweig, a doctor who lives in Greenwich. "You lose your community, your friends, your communal identity, and sometimes even your children. It's very lonely. A newly divorced man is a pariah. No one wants to invite him to a dinner party."
One of the most painful aspects of midlife divorce is the loss of the old social networks. "Some of your friends drop away because they're married and you're not. You don't have that much in common anymore," said Kathy Kurzatkowski of Fairfield.
Some people noted that the isolation they felt after divorce was far worse in Connecticut's exurban communities than in its cities. "I used to live in Weston," recalled Fran Kloss, "and because it was very family-oriented there was nothing there for singles. After my divorce, some friends continued to include me. But unless you connected with a new man very quickly, you become a fifth wheel," she said. Eventually, Ms. Kloss got a teaching job in Milford and moved to Westport -- a community, she said, where "there were many singles and more opportunities to meet them."
Added to invisibility is economic duress -- particularly for divorced women, many of whom remain in suburban or exurban areas to provide safe environments and good schools for their children. "It's absolutely more difficult for women who get divorced economically," said Ms. Brett of the Status of Women commission. "Study after study shows that the standard of living drops for a woman after divorce and the standard rises for men."
Many divorced women "are left with a house that's difficult to afford. As a result there are hidden pockets of poverty everywhere, including Fairfield County," Ms. Brett explained.
A 1989 study jointly published by the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and the Women's Research Institute of Hartford College for Women found that the mean per capita income of Connecticut women following divorce dropped 16 percent while that of divorced men increased by 23 percent. National studies support the finding.
A June 1996 study published in the American Sociological Review indicated that a woman's post-divorce standard of living decreased by 27 percent while that of a divorced man rose by 10 percent.
Several sociological factors contribute to the disparity. To begin with, Ms. Brett said, there is still a 25 percent wage gap between the earnings of men and women. Simultaneously, the vast majority of divorced women retain custody of their children and shoulder a disproportionate share of the child-care expenses.
"At the same time, today's courts try to divide the assets in half in divorce settlements. If you do the math, women and kids come up with fewer resources," said Ms. Brett.
Moreover, many middle-aged and older women today took time out from their jobs to care for children as well as for elderly members of their families. Those lost years in the work force place women at a disadvantage. "While they get child support and alimony for a period of time after divorce, their economic life style changes dramatically," said Mr. Nerenberg, the matrimonial lawyer. "If they've been a homemaker and raised children and go back into the job market when their divorce maintenance ends, they find they can never make up that difference in income."
One of those women is Lynn Barrow, a Newtown mother of three, who has three part-time jobs. "I'm trying to get back into the work force and obtain one good position," she explained. "Now that my teen-agers are more settled from the divorce, I'm trying to get my own career in order."
Some people point out that income discrepancies between middle-aged men and women are only part of the problem both partners face in the post-divorce years.
"Just because the man has a higher standard of living doesn't necessarily mean he's living happily ever after," said Sarah Oldham, a partner in the Westport law firm of Rutkin and Oldham. "Many men feel cut off from the social activities they once enjoyed when they were married, activities that were arranged by their wives. Often, they don't have a ready framework for replacing those networks. They don't know how to get invited to dinner parties or how to host them. And that's especially true in places like Fairfield County, which is very focused on couples and family life."
Others maintain that dating is difficult for middle-aged women. "Middle-aged men have a lot more opportunity to meet women because they can date women from a wide range of ages -- from 30 to 50 if they wish," said Mr. Nerenberg. "But a 45-year-old woman has a limited dating pool, and often goes out with men who are considerably older. That, in turn, leaves her with fewer choices."
Moreover, divorced men tend to remarry more quickly. Many Connecticut men who work in Manhattan return to live in the city, further shrinking available numbers. According to figures from the 1990 Bureau of the Census, there are 105,130 divorced men living in Connecticut compared to 149,093 divorced women.
In several Connecticut communities singles' groups have been created through local churches, community centers and individual enterpreneurs. Westport Singles, established 21 years ago in that community's Unitarian Church, was designed as a meeting place for those who were unattached and reluctant to visit, say, singles bars.
Don Smith, president of the group, said it's "a place to have fun, to talk to people in a friendly way, to mix in a comfortable and casual atmosphere, and where it's possible to meet someone romantically."
The group, which sponsors weekly activities ranging from discussion groups, dances and hikes to gourmet and theater clubs and weekend camping trips, has 800 members on its mailing list. It is still housed in the Unitarian Church but has become a separate entity that offers programs throughout Fairfield County.
Some members, like Helen Baker, a mother of two and a marketing director from Fairfield, said that Westport Singles was a catalyst that enabled her to create a new social life.
"It's a place to make friends and develop relationships and work through the transition from being married to being single again," Ms. Baker said. "Without an organization like this, being divorced here in Connecticut could be very isolating."
Other members, like Dan Castiglia, believe that it is no more challenging to be a single in suburbia than in Manhattan. In fact, it may even be easier.
"It seems to me that it's even more difficult to be single in the city because there most people go to singles bars," he said. "But if you live in Fairfield County you can come here and meet people more casually because there's a natural camaraderie, and one that isn't necessarily geared to romance."
Nevertheless, even as divorced middle-aged people have become more common, Westport Singles' membership has dwindled from its peak in the 1980's of 4,500 to its current membership of just 800, now often divided between a 21 to 35 age category and those who are over 35.
One reason for the shrinkage may be the lessening of that sense of being different.
"Today, it's much easier to be single. Our population here may not be as large as it used to be," said Mr. Smith, "but the overall environment is much friendlier to singles. And it's because we were originally so successful, we've inspired other singles' groups today."
A group specifically designed for single middle-aged men and women is Greenwich-based Capers, a for-profit club created by Jim Godbout in 1990. At the time, Mr. Godbout, a marketing and advertising executive from Ridgefield who had joined several private Fairfield County singles groups after his own divorce, targeted a large population of single adults just entering their middle years.
"To me that was the big market, the big picture," he said. "As a marketing director, demographics was my business. I knew that the yuppies were becoming middle-aged and getting divorced. And not only were they a huge entity with expendable income, they needed ways to meet each other."
To attract that professional population, Mr. Godbout was host to singles' dances in elegant restaurants and yacht clubs. The first, held in October 1990 at the Roger Sherman Inn in New Canaan, attracted 150 people from a 50-person mailing list. Since then, Capers' mailing list has grown to 3,500 names, its parties number 26 a year -- and 175 marriages have resulted.
"What Capers does is require that you dress up," said Sean Sullivan, a partner in the Stamford-based advertising firm of Sullivan & Mulvaney. Two years ago Mr. Sullivan, a father of four who had been divorced for 18 years, met Rita Gilcrest, at a Capers party.
"It was just a matter of timing," he said. "She was just getting ready to leave and I was just arriving. We literally bumped into each other." Within a year they were married.
Some groups that have become regular meeting places for newly single people, however, have evolved by chance. One was the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, which first began holding monthly parties for single people, in 1994.
"The idea at the time was to try to boost membership in the 25-35 age group that didn't seem to be utilizing the museum," said York Baker, special events coordinator for the museum. Although the first party held in February 1994 was canceled because of snow, 100 people made reservations for the second one. To Ms. Baker's surprise, 150 showed up, and in April, 300 attended.
"Gradually, we realized that we were attracting an older crowd, those in their 40's and 50's. I had no awareness that there was such a large and active singles' mid-life population out there," said Ms. Baker.
Ultimately, many divorced middle-agers maintain that singlehood should be celebrated as a life style of its own, rather than perceived as a waiting period between mates. "We don't get an identity from another person, we get it from ourselves," said Marian Bauer, a mother of three and school guidance counselor from Stamford. "It's fun to be single. You meet all kinds of people and have all kinds of experiences. Being single is a time to expand yourself and your own horizons."

HEADLINE: State or Towns: Who's Better at Caring for the Poor?

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE quiet, orderly office of the Department of Social Services in Norwich bears no resemblance to the chaos in the lives of the people who pass through the door seeking help.
Norwich, a flourishing city of textile mills at the turn of the century, joined the rest of New England in losing its manufacturing base in the post-World War II period. The city was hit hard again in the late 1980's, when the state's military industries began laying off workers and its unemployment rate remains consistently higher than elsewhere in the state. 
 Thus the need for a wide-ranging plan from the Social Services Department and its director, Beverly Goulet. The department does a great deal more than issue welfare checks, she says. Its social workers provide the first line of defense against hunger, cold and homelessness. A network of services has been set up to supply emergency food, housing, medical care, clothing, money for transportation, job training and substance abuse and psychiatric evaluations. For the past five years, the department has also run a nine-town regional employment program.
But Norwich's safety net may fall apart, Ms. Goulet said, because the State Department of Social Services is scheduled to take control of all general assistance programs by July of next year. The state will handle only mandated benefits at its 14 regional offices. The cities and towns are expected to continue providing services like home visits and crisis management.
General assistance, also known as city welfare, provides aid to single, unemployed adults who do not qualify for other state or for Federal programs. Under state law, the 14 cities in which state welfare offices are situated had the right this year to petition to retain control of their welfare programs. Norwich was the only city in the group to do so and is awaiting the state's decision. The remaining cities have already turned their programs over to the state.
State Representative Robert Keeley, a Democrat of Bridgeport, said his city was eager to shed responsibility for general assistance. The state took over Bridgeport's program in April. "Bridgeport wanted out for one reason: money," said Mr. Keeley, who is House chairman of the legislature's Human Services Committee. "The city has saved a couple of million dollars already," he said. "There wasn't a lot of concern over how well the program would be administered at the state level."
The Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments supports giving towns control of their general assistance programs. But a law would have to be passed to allow municipalities other than the 14 cities to do so. Two attempts to introduce a bill changing the present law failed, said Claudette Beaulieu, director of public and government relations for the State Social Services Department.
William Tallman, the City Manager of Norwich, wrote that the issue of who should administer general assistance should not be about control but about who is best able to provide direct services to the poorest and most medically needy people in the state. In a letter to Joyce Thomas, Commissioner of the State Social Services Department, Mr. Tallman said, "It should not be about fixing something that is not broken."
But state lawmakers believed the local general assistance programs were not working, Ms. Beaulieu said. "They felt they had 169 different programs out there in as many cities and towns. They had concerns about fraud and felt it would be more effective to consolidate cash and medical services under one roof and under one set of rules."
Discussions about general assistance among lawmakers and state officials reflect the changing approach to welfare in general, said State Senator Mary Ann Handley, a Democrat whose district includes Bolton, Glastonbury, Hebron and Manchester. Ms. Handley is Senate chairwoman of the Human Services Committee. "The general assistance program as it is now is essentially a program in which the relationship between the client and the social worker has diminished considerably," she said. "All of that was seen as a good way to reduce the welfare load. By making it less personal, some people would walk away from the system."
Mr. Tallman said the social worker providing the benefits should be intimately aware of all aspects of a case in order to address the barriers that prevent a person from holding a job. Social workers in Norwich have experience that cannot be replaced easily by workers trained only to decide whether or not a person is eligible for benefits, he said.
As Kathleen Kuvalanka, a social worker for the Norwich social services department, explained, "Many of us grew up here. We went to school with some of the people we're trying to help. They're more than just a name. The state will be removed from the consequences. Nobody will have any investment in what happens and any accountability."
In rural Lebanon, one problem is that residents on general assistance do not have transportation to a state welfare office, said Joyce R. Okonuk, Lebanon's First Selectman, in a letter to Ms. Thomas. "We can serve our clients better on a local level," Ms. Okonuk wrote, "as we are familiar with their circumstances and able to monitor their needs on a one-to-one basis."
The First Selectman of Stonington, Donald R. Maranell, agreed with Ms. Okonuk's point of view. "We believe the state cannot manage the town's welfare program with the same efficiency, empathy and common sense," he said in a letter to Ms. Goulet. "Just because the state takes away the administration does not mean the problem goes to the state. Each municipality will still need some level of service to deal with people who fall into the cracks of the system."
In Norwich, a 57-year-old former banker, unable to find a job because of his age and health problems, went to Ms. Goulet's office for help. The man, who asked that his name not be used, has diabetes, high blood pressure and deteriorating vision. He is unable to stand or walk for long periods because he has no feeling in his feet, and sores that form on his feet take a long time to heal.
He tried starting his own business, but, pressured by the recession, was forced to file for bankruptcy. Divorced after 22 years of marriage, the man has no children or relatives living nearby. At first, he said, he was too embarrassed to ask for help and so depressed that he thought about committing suicide. He contacted a priest, who referred him to the Norwich social services department.
"I stopped trying to do everything on my own. I had to face the fact that I was disabled," the man said.
A part-time job and a city welfare check of up to $300 a month helped the man get by for a year. During that time, the application he submitted for Social Security disability pay was denied twice on the grounds that he was employable.
The application was finally approved, and he is receiving disability pay of $1,000 a month. But nearly half that amount goes toward rent. His prescriptions and medical supplies cost $420 a month, and he doesn't know how he will pay for treatment for his vision. He is not eligible for Medicare and cannot afford private medical insurance.
For the past couple of years, the man has survived with help from his friends. He is struggling to start a home-based business, but has no savings to fall back on.
"The government doesn't address people who have been substantial taxpayers and all of a sudden can no longer sustain themselves because of economic cutbacks or physical disabilities," the man said. "In the local office, they at least met with me and talked with me. The state offices couldn't give me the personal attention I needed."
People receiving city welfare do not fit a single profile. They are a diverse group with varied work histories, skills and education. They include young adults in abusive homes, older people with chronic illnesses, people who are released from hospitals or treatment centers without jobs and former workers whose unemployment benefits have run out, said a report by the Connecticut Alliance for Basic Human Needs, an advocacy organization.
The state's response to Norwich's petition will be based on whether or not the city's general assistance program is cost-effective, Ms. Beaulieu said.
Mr. Tallman said the cost to taxpayers would be greater if cases are not managed properly. An agency unable to deliver services like cash assistance and medical benefits has more difficulty getting clients involved in activities that help them become self-sufficient.
State Representative Peter Nystrom, a Republican of Norwich, says it is unfair for the state to make a decision based on cost-effectiveness: "How can they say that? They're not paying for anything any more. They've shifted the whole cost to Norwich. The city has carried its share of social responsibility. They have no right to dismantle that."
Mr. Nystrom says he plans to introduce a bill in the next legislative session allowing local control of general assistance. He added there is bipartisan support for the measure. "I have no faith in the state being able to do what local people have done," he said. "The state has no intention of even trying."

HEADLINE: Market's Strong -- but for How Long?

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THE real-estate market tends to run behind the curves of the national economy, economists say, like a whip's curl. And so, with the nation's recovery well into its sixth year, the residential sector of the market snapped out of its doldrums only three years ago, with the New York metropolitan region on the trailing end of the curve.
For two years, the Manhattan co-op and condominium market has been bubbling -- fueled by big Wall Street bonuses, the burgeoning computer-based information industry and the chicken-or-eggish, self-fulfilling potential of bidding wars and price hikes -- all concentrated in a pressure cooker caused, in part, by limited housing production. 
 As economists and real-estate specialists predicted, the Manhattan market has since boiled over a bit, so that real estate activity in the city's other boroughs and its suburbs -- driven also by low and stable interest rates, low inflation and increasing employment -- has been simmering for at least the last year.
"The momentum is strong," said James Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, "so we're not going to fall off a cliff, unless there's a major external shock."
With the nation's economic variables apparently propitious and certain elements specific to the region (particularly New York's position in the global information revolution) strengthening, economists have begun to debate how sustainable the current rise in the region's residential market may be. But, at least for the near future, they say -- and none would be more definitive than that -- the signs seem positive.
Where there was only a hole in the ground 18 months ago, a 42-story co-op tower now looms over the western shore of Queens. Coupled with ongoing affordable housing projects, mortgage-assistance programs have helped revitalize whole blocks of otherwise blighted neighborhoods in the boroughs outside of Manhattan, so that even a few stretches of the South Bronx now seem like suburban tracts. And, after working their way out from under the burden left by, at best, unreliable sponsors during the dog days of the late 80's and early 90's, some co-ops in Queens and Brooklyn have refinanced their underlying mortgages and begun to sell apartments -- at increasing prices.
"We are selling co-ops in Forest Hills," said Ed Gitlin, a broker with Benjamin Realty, "and the average price of a one-bedroom that was $35,000 a year ago, right now it's ranging from $50,000 and up."
"In some buildings that have become more financially stable, prices have risen 30 percent just in the past year," Mr. Gitlin said.
"Is it rational? No."
Sales have also been relatively brisk and prices have inched upward through much of the suburban ring, although there remain stalled spots, particularly in and around some of the region's small, still-struggling cities, among them Paterson, N.J., and Hartford, Conn.
Home building is booming in certain areas, particularly if they are close to Manhattan or other major commercial areas. In Westchester County, for example, building permits are up 54 percent over 1996, while in Connecticut they are up 24 percent.
And less quantifiable, yet reflective of the mood of the market, there has even been a sprinkling of reports of packed open houses and bidding wars in the suburbs.
Plunging into the vicissitudes of that percolating market, Robert and Carolyn Matzelle of Ridgefield, Conn. -- he an accountant, she a teacher -- both bought and sold homes, in just three weeks.
"We're in the process of closing on a house in Newtown, southeast of Danbury," Mr. Matzelle said -- a four-bedroom colonial on 2.4 acres that, eventually, went for $326,000.
"We thought we had a confirmed sale at $317,000," Mr. Matzelle said. "We had a binder." But, apparently, a binder means "nothing," he said, "not unless you have a signed contract."
Two other couples made bids after the binder was signed. "We had to come back with our best offer, $326-even," Mr. Matzelle said, to win the war.
To "cinch the deal" on the sale of their four-bedroom, raised ranch on one acre in Ridgefield, the Matzelles agreed to hold an open house. "We had 20 people coming through; what a scene!" Mr. Matzelle said.
The winning bid: $322,500.
"So, we're actually getting a house that's larger than what we're currently in, newer than what we're currently in, more property than what we're currently on, for the same money," Mr. Matzelle said.
For all of Fairfield County, which includes the communities where the Matzelles bought and sold, the median sales price stood at $207,000 at the end of the third quarter of this year, according to data compiled by the Commercial Record, a business weekly -- a 13.7 percent increase over the $182,000 median price a year earlier.
And the number of sales for the county -- which includes more modest communities like Monroe and Shelton, as well as wealthy areas like Greenwich and Darien -- stood at 13,219 during the first nine months of this year, up 8.5 percent over the 12,189 sales during the corresponding period last year.
"Our problem here is that inventory is very low," said Randi Hutton, a broker with Weichert Realtors in Westport and Weston, Conn. "So we've had five situations just in the last week involving multiple bids."
"It's a good problem," Ms. Hutton conceded.
In Nassau, Suffolk and Queens, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes all three counties, the median price for a single-family home increased from $157,500 in January to $167,000 at the end of September, a jump of 6.03 percent. And sales volume in the three counties during the first three quarters of this year has kept pace with last year.
The pattern was similar west of the Hudson, where the New Jersey Association of Realtors divides the state into three sections. In northern New Jersey, the median sales price stood at $205,000 at the end of the third quarter, up 2 percent from $201,000 at the start of the year, according to the association. A year earlier, the median price was $188,100. At the same time, sales volume in northern New Jersey was well ahead of last year. In 1996, 58,400 homes were sold, an average of 14,600 in each quarter. In the first three quarters of this year, 46,750 homes have been sold, an average of 15,883 in each quarter.
"There's two main ingredients fueling the real estate economy," said Michael Ford, president of the New Jersey realtors group. "The first one, obviously, is the very attractive interest rate, and the second is the first-time buyer."
MORTGAGE rates in the region, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research company, "are hovering at the lowest point in 19 months -- 7.36 percent for a 30-year, fixed." And they have been "extremely stable this year," ranging from 8.3 percent in April for a 30-year, fixed rate, to the current low.
"We are just a half percentage point above the 28-year low that we reached back in October 1993 -- 6.83 percent," Mr. Gumbinger said, pointing out that in October 1981 the 30-year, fixed rate stood at a celestial 18.31 percent.
Among the first-time buyers that Mr. Ford spoke of were Dina and Mario Sosa who -- along with their daughters, Nicole, 4, and Jenna, 2, as well as Grandma Hilda and Grandpa Manuel Sosa -- were deep in the throes of packing last week.
"It feels good, except there's so much to be done," said Mrs. Sosa, a pharmacy supervisor in Woodbridge, N.J. Mr. Sosa is an auto mechanic.
The Sosas moved from Brooklyn a decade ago and were renting a house in Rahway. "You know what it is?" Mrs. Sosa said. "You put so much into a house and it's not yours, so you finally want something that's yours."
The new house, a four-bedroom split level that is only a few blocks away in Rahway, cost $180,000. The entire purchase process lasted a month.
"I thought it was going to be a lot harder," Mrs. Sosa said. "You hear the horror stories: the people change their mind, the mortgage doesn't go through. But we were the first to look and he took our offer."
A problem has arisen, with the children. "They want to paint their room red, so I'm arguing with them to make it a nice pink," Mrs. Sosa said. "And they want to know if the dog is coming. 'Yes, we're taking Taz.' "
In the current heated market, upscale Manhattan has been particularly torrid. By way of illustration, statistics compiled by the Charles H. Greenthal Residential Sales Corporation indicate that the median price for a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan stood at $521,000 in September, up 20.1 percent from $433,616 in September 1996. "People are not leaving New York," said Joyce West, executive vice president of Greenthal, "they're buying up. And so many areas have been reborn: I remember in the 70's I couldn't get people to go up above 86th Street."
Newcomers, too, are fueling the Manhattan market.
"What the mud of the Nile is for Egypt each year, the flow of the best and the brightest from the best or, at least, the most expensive schools is to New York," said George Sternlieb, the retired founder of the urban policy institute at Rutgers. "Suddenly, with glamour, we're pulling from all over."
A barometer of the pull to Manhattan for young newcomers was offered by a 34 percent increase in studio apartment sales -- from 462 in the first 11 months of 1996 to 619 in the corresponding period this year -- reported by the Corcoran Group.
"The studio segment is the first to go down and the last to go up," said Barbara Corcoran, the company's founder. "So, I read a lot into that number: that this market is fully recovered. The rich always do well, but studio owners usually don't. And these days the underdog is moving at a very fast pace."
John Graham, 34, an investment banker from Virginia, bought a studio in Manhattan during the spring. "Technically, it's not a studio," Mr. Graham insisted. "The bedroom has a door that closes it off. But it's very small, like living on a sailboat."
Perhaps the best description for an apartment situated above the elevator shaft and below the water tower of a 20-story building on West End Avenue would be: penthouse studio.
"I finally found a place that's perfection, on top of the world," Mr. Graham said. "However many millions of people there are in New York, I have no neighbors. I have windows all the way around. I've got a fireplace, hardwood floors, and it has a deck outside, too."
The price for high-rise, studio-scale perfection: "In the low-$300's."
In the estimation of Mr. Ford, the New Jersey realtors association president, the current upward trend "started back in '96, and this whole year has seen a good, sustained market, from Cape May to Fort Lee."
"This market," Mr. Ford added, with a broker's ingrained optimism, "I would love to say it looks like it's never going to end."
Fat chance, most economists say. But not all.
"We had a dreadful crash shortly after '87," Dr. Sternlieb pointed out, "and while other parts of the country recovered, the Northeast in general, but New York City in particular, was the caboose on the national recovery train.
"Now, the definition of a real estate developer is essentially a speculator without a memory, because, generally speaking, the problem of the real estate field is that by the time you have secured your financing, assembled your land and are digging a hole in the ground, the economy is beginning to peak and crumble. You're always behind the curve."
YET, there is no arguing with the fact that the nation's economic recovery is 6 1/2 years old -- two years short of the longest this century, from 1961 to 1969 -- while the average postwar expansion has lasted only four years. "So there is substantial national economic momentum," Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said.
The region's recovery is about 5 1/2 years long. "Not as long as the nation but, nonetheless, a very long expansion," Dr. Hughes said. And, over the last three years, the real estate market has joined the parade.
Sales of existing single-family homes across the country hit an all-time high of 4.08 million last year, according to the National Association of Realtors, and if the pace continues this year, a new record will be set.
According to "U.S. Housing Market Conditions," a report published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development last month, the median price of existing single-family homes throughout the nation in the third quarter of this year was $126,500, 5 percent above the third quarter of 1996.
And helping to spur the metropolitan area's real estate recovery is, of course, job growth. John Weiting, regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said 1997 "is shaping up as a fairly strong year for employment in the region." The tristate area added 134,000 jobs in the year ended in October, Commissioner Weiting said, topping gains of 114,000 in the prior 12 months, and only 43,000 in the year that ended in October 1995.
Job growth, low inflation, low and stable mortgage rates, all combined with New York's status as a center for the global information revolution and a mecca for immigrants, bode well for the future of the region's real estate market, economists say.
"One caveat," said Arthur Margon, director of the New York University Real Estate Institute: "The scenario is based on all those factors continuing or, at least, avoiding a serious contraction. And the only sign of trouble is that outside the United States you have these sort of air pockets in Asia."
In the glow of extended expansion, some observers have, in recent months, touted a "new economic paradigm," premised on the contention that integration of the world's markets because of computer technology has increased exports and productivity to such a degree that prices, wages, inflation and interest rates will all remain moderate for the foreseeable future. And, yet, at the same time, increased productivity has generated job growth.
All ultimately good for the real estate market.
JOHN TUCCILLO, consulting economist with the National Association of Realtors, does not quite hold to the theory. "All that doesn't mean we are not going to have recessions or that the business cycle is dead," Dr. Tuccillo said, "but it does mean that the economy is generally biased toward growth."
One other factor contributes to Dr. Tuccillo's optimism. "Most baby boomers are now 40 years old," he said. "That means they are entering a decade of high productivity, high earning, high savings and high spending. And, as far as housing is concerned, these folks will be buying up.
"So I think we will be seeing a very strong demand for housing over the next 10 years."
But Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, is fatalistic.
"As a business cycle gets old we are vulnerable to negative surprises," she said. "It seems as though we are immune because we don't see them on the horizon, but they are out there. And there will be a downturn."
Somewhere in the middle is Dr. Hughes, who wondered whether a shock must come or, perhaps, the regional real estate market might experience a prudent, sustainable pattern akin to regular respiration.
"You have to be a bit cautious, just because of the length of the expansion, that the law of averages is going to catch up with us," he said. "But there aren't that many imbalances built up, like in the 80's, when we had a huge run-up in prices, undisciplined corporate expansion, great overbuilding in the office sector, undisciplined lending in all types of ventures."
Imbalances in the current market include the potential for overvaluing in the stock market and heavy levels of consumer debt, Dr. Hughes said. "But if they don't cause a problem and the overall economy continues doing well into '99, we could be in striking distance of real estate's equivalent of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak."

T.G.I. Fifth Avenue Fills a Hungry Hole
 Timed for the onslaught of hungry holiday shoppers, the restaurant franchise T.G.I. Friday's, based in Dallas, opened on Fifth Avenue last month. 
 The new spot, with 400 seats in five stories on 604 Fifth Avenue, between 48th and 49th Streets, is run and owned by Riese Restaurants, a corporate group that runs 150 Manhattan restaurants and now owns nine T.G.I. Friday's franchises, all in Manhattan.
"There are no other full-service restaurants between 34th Street and Central Park South on Fifth Avenue," said Don Metznik, vice president of marketing for the Riese Organization.
But to make the space work, the company had to think vertically -- with three floors devoted to dining and two floors for the kitchen.
 
Do You Play 'Feelings'? There May Be a Job for You
 Doug Howard calls himself a hack guitar player and a lounge music enthusiast; he loves listening to Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. (He's also a devotee of Frank Sinatra and the songs of Cole Porter.)
But Mr. Howard, who is 41, felt there just wasn't enough lounge music out there. So he found two investors, and with $500,000 and office space at 568 Broadway, between Prince and Houston Streets, started his own label -- Lodestar Entertainment. He also works as general manager of the East Coast operation of ETV Network, a company that promotes and distributes music videos for public performances (like stores and cruise ships).
The mission of Lodestar: to sign up new "lounge music" talent. The company, with a staff of five, put out two CD's this fall: Joe E. Howard's "From This Moment On" and Scott Gordon's "Something to Remember You By."
Mr. Howard said: "You know, there are those of us who don't want music blasted in our ears. It's a niche market just waiting to be filled."
 
Former Restaurateur Turns From Roasting to Tanning
After catering for years to the Upper East Side, James Oliver, the former director of restaurant operations for the Sign of the Dove, Yellowfingers and Arizona 206, decided to go into business for himself -- but in Brooklyn.
He joined forces with two former Manhattan bartenders who had started a tanning salon business called Beach Bum Tanning, with seven parlors around the city. Mr. Oliver opened Brooklyn's first Beach Bum Tanning this fall, at 530 86th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway in Bay Ridge.
Why Brooklyn? "The demographics of this area were right," said Mr. Oliver, who said he looks for places where there are people 18 to 35 years old with a lot of disposable income. "It's a vanity thing," he said.
As for whether this is bad for one's skin, Mr. Oliver said: "Hey, eating will make you fat. It's only bad in excess. You know, we were meant to live outdoors, and it makes you look healthy."
The cost of looking healthy is $5 to $7 for a 20-minute session. You need three to five sessions for a tan, Mr. Oliver said. The first session is free.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Priming the Pump for New Middle-Income Housing

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE tenants living in a year-old apartment building called the Bristol in the Flushing section of Queens include a 26-year-old registered nurse free from the parental nest for the first time, a 45-year-old teacher who left her husband as well as her apartment when she moved to the Bristol with her two young children, and a Chinese astrologer.
The astrologer is Yung Yuan Lai, 63, who moved into a fifth-floor, two-bedroom apartment with his wife, Mei Chu, and two children in their 20's. Astrology is an honored profession in China, Mr. Lai noted, although 30 percent of his clients are Americans or other non-Asians. 
 Those proportions are close to those of the demographics at the Bristol itself, a 60-unit building at 138-49 Barclay Avenue, near Main Street. The Bluestone Organization, the builder-owner, says that 60 percent of the tenants are Asian, mainly of Chinese descent.
The more important tenant characteristic from a housing perspective is that 80 percent of the tenants are middle-income. As a 1990's housing product in New York City, the Bristol is a rare specimen -- a new rental apartment house outside Manhattan. It was built with tax-exempt bond financing, a method typically used only in Manhattan, where market-rate rents are high enough to permit the project to support low-income occupancy. Twenty percent of the tenants must be low income under this "80-20" program.
But now New York City has come forward with a new housing loan program, which, if successful, should generate about a dozen new middle-income apartment buildings outside prime Manhattan locations. Unlike the 80-20 program, it has no requirement for partial low-income occupancy. From the reaction of builders and lenders it could provide the impetus for construction in such locations as Flushing and Forest Hills in Queens, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, and Manhattan Valley and East Harlem in Manhattan.
The program is run by the city's Housing Development Corporation, a state-chartered public benefit corporation that provides financing for multifamily housing within the city. It was announced in late October, just before the mayoral election. Richard T. Roberts, who is chairman of the board of the corporation as well as Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, called the program a model for future city assistance to new multifamily construction.
The financing, which will come from long-term taxable bonds, will not impinge on the capacity of city agencies to promote economic development through tax-exempt borrowings. And, since H.D.C. bonds have an AA rating from Standard and Poor's, the housing will get the benefit of interest rates somewhat lower than current conventional mortgage rates.
In addition, the development corporation is prepared to offer a direct low-interest loan for each apartment built to further help make the apartments affordable. This subsidy is expected to average $15,000 an apartment and be offered at 1 to 3 percent interest over the term of the loan, which may be as long as 35 years. The amount will vary depending on the location of the project and the rent-generating capacity of the market in that area.
Eligible projects will be those with at least 20 apartments, produced either through new construction, the substantial rehabilitation of an existing residential building or the conversion, on an as-of-right basis, of an existing nonresidential building. In Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx or Staten Island, the property can be in any location where multifamily development is permissible. In Manhattan the site must be north of 110th Street in the case of new construction, or north of 96th Street in a rehabilitation.
The income limits on renters -- or buyers if the project is done as a limited-equity co-op -- are the same as those that apply to Mitchell-Lama middle-income housing, last produced in the late 70's. In households of one or two persons, annual income can be as high as seven times the annual rent, or as much as eight times the annual rent for larger families, up to a maximum of 250 percent of median income in New York City, or $118,500 for a family of four at present.
There are also rent or carrying-charge limits -- $800 for a studio, $1,050 for a 1-bedroom, $1,350 for a 2-bedroom and $1,750 for a 3-bedroom. A family earning as little of $40,000 a year might be able to afford a $1,000-a-month 1-bedroom apartment, paying 30 percent of annual income as rent. But the income limit for eligibility would be much higher, $84,000 a year. Because of the sites that are likely to developed, most tenants will probably be at an income level well below the maximum theoretically allowed.
TO get the program started, the Housing Development Corporation has set aside $15 million, which at an average of $15,000 a unit would finance about 1,000 new middle-income housing units. The money comes from the corporation's reserves built up from housing-finance operations, said Barbara Udell, president of the Housing Development Corporation, and if they are used successfully a second phase will follow.
Charles A. Brass, the corporation's vice president for development, said that preliminary responses from builders who have worked with city programs in the past has been positive. "We're basically looking for housing for families earning from $35,000 to $75,000 a year," Mr. Brass said.
The challenge for builders, several of them said in interviews, will be to find sites at low enough prices that are capable of attracting tenants who can pay, say, $1,300 a month for a 2-bedroom apartment. Most hopeful are those situations where builders already hold the property and are close to feasibility already.
"It's geared toward places where the market is at $1,300 to $1,600 a month and not many neighborhoods have that," said Ronald Moelis, a partner in in L & M Equity Ltd., a developer based in Larchmont, N.Y., that has participated in various city-assisted housing programs.
"If you can find a renovation project you might have a better shot at making the numbers work than in new construction," said Barry Zelikson, director of development at Sparrow Construction Company in the Bronx, another builder.
Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a major citywide construction lender, predicted the program would provide an opportunity for smaller, efficient builder-owners. "This could produce some affordable housing," he said.
For multifamily housing, that would be progress. Private multifamily housing production outside Manhattan has been nil in the 90's, said Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, although 20,000 units were created by city-assisted rehabilitations of vacant buildings, typically for low-income occupancy. The council's figures are compiled from city agencies. The Department of City Planning, which also reports on housing completions, has not yet released any data for the post-1995 period.
For builders generally, the biggest problem will be finding sites at a low enough cost in neighborhoods capable of attracting people able to pay $1,200 to $1,500 a month in rent. Typically, even when such sites exist owners tend to raise the asking price for land once a new subsidy program becomes available, again throwing feasibility into question. But sometimes builders already own the land. "We've had a site in Park Slope for 12 years where we could do 50 units as of right," said David Gaunt, a principal in Premiere Management and Development Company, based in Manhattan. "It's hard to pencil out a rental project. We're doing an evaluation now to see if this new program will work for us."
One likely user is the Bluestone Organization, the builder-owner of the Bristol in Flushing and nine other rentals in Queens and Great Neck, L.I., over the last 30 years. "We have a site in Forest Hills where we think it will work," said Harold Bluestone, a principal in the organization. "I can't disclose the location yet."

Chart: "Housing Production in New York City"
Historically, privately financed construction has been the principal form of new housing. In the 90's, subsidized housing became the chief form. Recently, in Manhattan, tax-exempt bond financing has helped spur a comeback in market-rate apartments. The chart shows the dramatic fall off of multifamily housing, public housing, and subsidized housing building from 1972-1995, while only one- and two-family housing construction has held steady

Making It in Manhattan: A Tale of Two Cities

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
WHEN New Yorkers talk about their "neighborhood," they most likely mean the streets filled with the places they patronize -- to buy vegetables, drop off dry cleaning, rent a video, fill a prescription or eat Chinese food. Small businesses, and the familiar faces running them, are a big part of an urbanite's daily life -- and vital to the nation's economic health.
Then there is that other New York "neighborhood," the skyscraper-and-cyberspace precincts that house the city's financial powerhouses. Here, the ZIP code may be local, but the customers and power are global. 
 Both New York worlds, Main Street's purveyors and Wall Street's masters of the universe, are described in fascinating detail in two terrific new books.
"Around the Block: The Business of a Neighborhood" by Tom Shachtman (Harcourt Brace, $28) is a lively, insightful chronicle of a year in the business life of a Manhattan block, specifically the section bounded by West 17th and 18th Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues in Chelsea.
The block has roughly 100 small enterprises, more than some midsized towns, the author points out. The mix is typical of a middle-class Manhattan street. Among the businesses are restaurants, dry cleaners, liquor stores, deli-groceries, video stores, plumbing suppliers and a lumber depot.
Although the block's business owners are much like entrepreneurs everywhere, a few trends are distinctly urban: Some businesses cater to gay clients. Many of the entrepreneurs are immigrants; the Korean owner of a liquor store says he took courses to learn the business after the store's former owner balked at selling to him because "I'm Asian and didn't know anything about wine." And a manager of a deli-grocery says there is so much shoplifting -- "and not just kids, people in suits" -- that he wants to stop selling french fries because he has to turn his back to the customers to make them.
At the time of Mr. Shachtman's interviews in 1993 and 1994, the neighborhood was just emerging from a recession that saw 60,000 small businesses close in cities nationwide, the author says.
Still, the block's 2,500 employees had produced a gross annual income of $1.5 billion in 1992. And the author, whose previous books include "Skyscraper Dreams," about New York's real estate empires, wanted to find out whether these -- and therefore other -- small businesses could bounce back and create more jobs. Eventually, they do.
"Around the Block" is a wonderful weave of personal stories and big-picture trends. Mr. Shachtman has mastered the art of the disciplined digression; his side trips into architecture, history and macroeconomics are short and sharply illuminating.
The book unabashedly roots for its entrepreneurs; there are no disgruntled employees or dissatisfied customers in its pages. And as the author vividly illustrates the struggles of keeping a small business alive, he chastises the institutions that, he says, fail to help. Around the block, he writes, "there are almost as many tales of shortsightedness, intransigence and lack of flexibility by banks and governmental loan sources as there are small businesses."
Small businesses are America's hope, he believes. "If capitalism is to retain a human face, and to be viable in our cities," he warns, "we must not permit it to be reduced to a creature of, or the product of, big business alone."
Which brings us to the fascinating 1990's business chronicle in that other New York neighborhood.
"From 1993 to 1995, I sold derivatives on Wall Street," writes Frank Partnoy in the opening lines of his excellent kiss-and-tell tale, "F.I.A.S.C.O.: Blood in the Water on Wall Street" (W. W. Norton, $25).
A derivative is an investment linked in value to another security, say a stock or bond. An option to buy a stock is a simple example of a derivative, the author points out. But Wall Street prefers the complicated examples, he writes, in part because they are so confusing.
At Morgan Stanley, where he worked in the Derivative Products Group for a year starting in 1994, "no one seemed to care about whether clients actually understood what they were buying," he writes.
Some of those clients, at pension funds and insurance companies, were simply in over their heads, he says, when they invested in "complex foreign exchange bets packaged to look like simple and safe bonds." Others, he says, understood the gamble but could point to the tiny reliable-bond ingredient of the currency-and-debt package if regulators came sniffing around. There was, after all, big money to be made in the $55 trillion worldwide market in derivatives.
(In a statement after the publication of "F.I.A.S.C.O.," Morgan Stanley assailed its contents. "The book is clearly a combination of inaccuracies and sensationalism," it said. "Our business is based on consistent and professional service to our clients and customers.")
Mr. Partnoy, now an assistant professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, writes with style and a supple intelligence, and he is a master teacher when it comes to explaining the arcane, mostly unregulated, deals carried out under the derivatives banner.
In the tradition of "Liar's Poker," Michael Lewis's account of a stint at Salomon Brothers, the author, who was 27 when he got to Morgan Stanley, is also entertaining as he tells the book's parallel story: his immersion into a strange, "feral" culture, "half geek, half wolf." It is a world, the author says, where traders and salesmen brag about multimillion-dollar deals that "rip" a client's "face off," quote compulsively from the movie "Caddyshack" and read Guns & Ammo magazine. (The weapons obsession is acted out in a yearly skeet shoot, the Fixed Income Annual Sporting Clays Outing, which gives the book its acronymic title.)
The author acknowledges that he initially hungered for this world, with its promise of millions in salaries and bonuses. "I suppose it is a bit of a character flaw that I beheld the financial orgy of a trading floor with such desire," he writes. "But I did."
Now, in the wake of the derivative debacles suffered by Orange County, Calif., among others, the message from Mr. Partnoy is this: "Wall Street has made, and continues to make, a huge amount of money on derivatives by trickery or deceit."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
A New Democratic Leader Sees Bipartisanship

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Despite Governor Whitman's near-defeat last month, New Jersey's Democrats did not make any significant gains in the General Assembly or the Senate. Republicans remain firmly in control of the Legislature. Democrats can accomplish, little, if anything, on their own.
So what role will Democrats now play in Trenton? Will they continue in their role as naysayers or join forces with their Republican colleagues so that lawmakers, and not Mrs. Whitman, wield the most influence over state policy and politics in the coming four years? 
 In the Assembly, Democrats have voted to re-elect Joseph V. Doria, a Democrat from Hudson County, as their leader. Mr. Doria and Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, have always managed to find ways to do business.
But in the Senate, there has been more political acrimony between Democrats and Republicans in recent years. Republicans rarely brought Democrats to the table to help draw up solutions to difficult problems. And Democrats responded by not cooperating at all under the leadership of the Minority Leader, John A. Lynch, of New Brunswick, who has decided to relinquish his leadership role.
Last week, Senate Democrats elected a new leader, the veteran lawmaker Richard J. Codey, who said was open to the prospect of a more cooperative relationship with Republican leaders. That is, if Republicans are more willing to bring Democrats into the process earlier and not just turn to them for support on bills after learning they don't have enough votes in their own caucus.
"It is a different climate," said Mr. Codey, 51, an insurance broker from West Orange who has served in the Legislature since 1974. "I think that it is more of a climate that lends itself to bipartisanship. The Governor can't run again, so no one can accuse us of being negative because we want her to be defeated. So I think our criticism will be, hopefully, looked at in a nonpartisan way."
He said that he also thinks that Republican legislative leaders and the Governor's office took Democrats for granted, at times, because there was a perception that their votes were not needed. "I am quite sure she won't be able to count on Republicans in the Legislature to advance her agenda with the same certainty as she did in her first term," Mr. Codey said. "In effect, Democrats in the Legislature could break a lot of gridlock created by the Governor's office and legislative Republicans."
Mr. Codey was first elected to the Assembly at the age of 26. He has sponsored numerous laws and bills over the years, including the Casino Control Act in 1977, which created casino gaming in Atlantic City. But he has focused most of his efforts on health care issues and tightening state laws and regulations to improve conditions in the state's mental health system.
In 1987, he took the unusual step of taking a job as an orderly on the night shift at Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital so that he could learn about conditions there. The staff did not know he was a state lawmaker. He told only his family and a few close friends about his plan, disguising his identity at the hospital by using the name of a dead rapist and the Social Security number of a dead armed robber.
"The conditions were unbelievable," he said. "It was mind boggling." Patients were not treated properly. There were no activities organized on their behalf. Medical and psychiatric treatment was inconsistent, at best. Some employees had criminal backgrounds. His findings prompted the resignation of the hospital's president and 34 other employees. He also drafted legislation to improve patient conditions and impose criminal background checks for employees.
Mr. Codey said that he has always believed strongly in the role of watchdog, and he believes that is an important role for members of the minority. "When the majority party is doing something wrong, you have to bark as loud as you can," he said.
But he said that Democrats were prepared to deliver difficult votes "if we can help craft the product of hard decisions."
"They always talk about bipartisanship when they don't have enough votes on that side of the aisle," he said.
The first test to see how closely Democrats and Republicans can work together will come before the end of the year. The state's current system of financing charity care -- paying hospitals for providing free treatment to uninsured individuals -- expires on Dec. 31. Both business groups and organized labor strongly object to proposals that the state continue to rely heavily on paying for charity care with money from unemployment taxes.
Several proposals are on the table, including a 25-cent cigarette tax increase. Democrats, punished by voters for supporting former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, have rejected past cigarette tax increase proposals. But this time, things could be different. Mr. Codey said that Democrats have been at the table with Republican legislative leaders, from the beginning on this issue.
And there could be movement on other difficult issues, like property taxes, school financing, auto insurance and capital construction costs for schools.
He said that it remains to be seen whether there will be agreement. "We can try to make a good faith effort on all of them," he said. "Obviously, there are times when we are not going to agree. But it will not be because we did not try to reach consensus."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
For Asian-Americans in Flushing, Boom and Maybe Bust: For Shops, Korea's Ills Are Catching

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Beneath the glowing neon and storefront signs on Union Street that offer items from electronic goods to bridal dresses, not a customer could be found last Tuesday night in Koreatown.
"It's going to be a very gloomy Christmas," said Jay Ha, the owner of the Hancook Travel Agency. "Nobody is going back to Korea because they are worried about their businesses and mortgages. And nobody from there can afford to come here." 
 South Korea, which was on the verge of defaulting on billions of dollars in commitments to overseas lenders, has seen its economy plunge in recent weeks. The International Monetary Fund agreed to a $55 billion bailout last week, but in the weeks before that, South Korea's stock market and the value of its currency, the won, went into a tailspin, rattling not only the Korean economy but also the nearly 400 businesses in Flushing owned by Korean-Americans.
Some local enterprises like grocery stores and auto repair shops are sandbagged against the financial tsunami because they do business locally and within the neighborhood. But others, like travel agencies, restaurants and clothing stores that rely on links to the old country, have been hit hard.
"On one hand, the devauled won means that Korean imports are cheaper," said Changsoo Kim, an economic adviser to the New York Society of Korean Businessmen. "On the other hand, many of the retailers have a big problem because they depend on Korean tourists, and suddenly no Korean can afford to be a tourist."
In a subterranean shop along Union Street, Sun Park was counting a small wad of bills, the day's sales at BL Men's Wear. "We have to be down 40 percent this year," Mrs. Park, 33, said glumly. The Italian-style shoes were marked down 50 percent. "We're going to have to have a sale all the way through New Year, because people are worried and have stopped spending their money."
Flushing is the nation's second-largest Koreatown, after Los Angeles, and would appear moderately insulated from the goings-on in South Korea. But the fiscal crisis there has revealed how deeply linked the Korean-American economy is to Asia.
"Besides the tourist dollars and the very new immigrants who still depend on financial help from home, the crisis has a psychological effect on consumption here," said Dr. Pyong Gap Min, professor of sociology at Queens College. "Even if you are well-to-do in America, if your family in Korea is suffering you tend to suffer, too. People worry and become frugal."
Money sent to family members back home may be less this year, as Korean-Americans feel the pinch. On the bright side, the dollars sent back are worth much more in the face of the weak Korean won.
Students also feel the exchange-rate pinch. Chang Han, an engineering student from Seoul, stared into a restaurant with a fully stocked bar. "You must believe things are going to get better," he said. "I hope it happens before Christmas." CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Express;
Berthing Those Babies

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

 BODY:
CHEVROLET has presented Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey a 1998 Chevy Express van so they can fetch home their septuplets, Iowa's neo-natal celebrities. My wife said it best: "There must be easier ways to get a free van."
But what a van. The McCaugheys' new ride is simply humongous, an extended-wheelbase version of Chevy's full-size-and-then-some passenger shuttle, nearly 20 feet long and able to carry in almost amniotic comfort 15 people and their luggage -- a claim not even Mother McCaughey can make. 
 Put it another way: On their way home to Carlisle from the hospital in Des Moines, the McCaugheys could stop to pick up a set of hitchhiking quints.
The Express puts up its considerable
avoirdupois against the Ford Club Wagon and the Dodge Ram Wagon in the full-size van market, which comprises the largest road-going vehicles typically available to consumers. Oh, sure, somebody out there may be marketing converted school buses, but they don't count.
The Big Three sell about 350,000 full-size vans a year. Ford has led the way in 1997 with 142,000 sold through October, compared with 88,000 for Chevy and 67,000 for Dodge. Some 20 to 30 percent of Ford's and Dodge's big vans are seat-equipped people haulers, the balance being cargo vans and stripped models destined to become custom conversions and airport buses.
But at General Motors, full-size vans configured for passengers -- the Chevy Express and GMC Savana -- accounted for a piddling 5 percent of big-van sales in the same period. The Express, bigger in several dimensions than its rivals, was redesigned for 1997 to help tilt the scales the other way.
Virtually unchanged for '98, the Express Van is a mechanical twin of the Chevy Van, a windowless cargo hauler upon whose buyers a clever name would seem to be wasted.
The test vehicle, though not as prodigious as the McCaugheys' stretched model, was still big enough to serve as modular housing. It was the standard-wheelbase (135 inches), 12-passenger Express G1500 LS, which I found quite justly named, since it can transport an entire Kinder-Care class 550 miles nonstop on a 31-gallon tank of regular unleaded gas. Its fuel economy rating of 13 m.p.g. in town and 18 on the highway, while seemingly scandalous, is in fact not bad considering the chunk of air it has to displace to make headway. My family of three -- no spectacular gang births are on the horizon, thank you -- nicknamed it "Boxcar Willie."
G.M.'s full-size vans offer a variety of power plants, starting with a workaday V6 of 4.3 liters, producing 200 horsepower and 250 foot-pounds of torque. The test van had the classic 350-cubic-inch (5.7 liter) Chevy V8, which turns out a hearty 245 horsepower and 325 foot-pounds of torque, enough to whip the huge vessel to 60 m.p.h. in less than 10 seconds. A turbo-diesel power plant is also available, churning out 190 horses and 385 foot-pounds. And the top of the line is a big-block, 7.4-liter V8 with 290 horses and 410 foot-pounds of torque, enough raw force to pull parking meters out by their roots.
Which you may be tempted to do when you try to park the Express. A Gulliver on the urban shore, the Express Van dwells in a spatial dimension about a third larger than the world's drive-through windows, parking decks and toll plazas were designed for. The 135-inch wheelbase is longer than a Suburban's (the McCaugheys' is 20 inches longer yet), practically guaranteeing that you'll clip a curb or perhaps a mailbox until, like a truck driver, you learn to wait until you're well into the intersection before you turn the wheel. In a vehicle 6.58 feet high, you'll find yourself ducking and breathing small prayers as you pass under those overhead barriers that say, "No Vehicles Over 7 Feet."
The Express's turning radius of 45.2 to 53.5 feet, depending on the model, can produce comic effects. Attempting to do a 180-degree turn on a narrow side street, I almost managed to get the Express stuck between brick walls, a la Austin Powers.
Visibility is excellent in the Express, practically 360 degrees, since the vehicle's northern hemisphere is almost all glass. But because the gunwales are so high, it's easy to miss a small sports car like a Miata swimming alongside the cetacean side quarters. The Express has good, oversized mirrors, and you need to use them.
For whatever aggravations come to the driver, the passengers enjoy a smooth, stable, spacious ride. The seats are firmly stuffed and dressed with muted fabric upholstery with beige vinyl trimming. The test model had rear air-conditioning with a series of ceiling-mounted climate outlets facing the three rows of bench seats.
There was, however, a surprising dearth of cup holders, which would be heresy in the unquenchable ranks of mini-van shoppers. Also, a wall-covering panel had come loose, the sort of quality-control item that drives consumers nuts.
Access to the seats is achieved through two right-side doors, hinged on the outside so they will swing well out of the way. And because the Express shares its genes with the cargo van, the rear doors are designed to open to 165 degrees, so that the Express can be backed snugly to a loading dock.
In fact, it's pretty easy to convert the Express into a cargo hauler. The rear seats unlatch and roll out easily. But don't try a clean-and-jerk maneuver with the seats on your own unless someone in your family practices sports medicine.
How much can the Express hold? With the rear seats removed, it yawns wide with 267 cubic feet of space. The extended version offers more than 316 cubic feet, enough to hold some 7,584 Pampers -- or roughly four and a half months' worth of nappies for the Clan McCaughey.
The Express is available in 1500, 2500 and 3500 load ratings, the latter able to transport almost two tons of passengers or cargo while towing a 10,000-pound trailer.
If you don't take your youngsters out of school for vacation, you could try dragging the school with you.
After a week in the Express, I'm surprised that full-size vans don't encroach more into the territory of the family mini-van. The Express is conscientiously equipped with dual air bags, daytime running lamps, child safety locks, a theft-deterrent system, four-wheel anti-lock brakes and heavy-duty chassis.
Plus the LS is stocked with creature comforts, from a compact disk player to a six-way power driver's seat, from 12-passenger seating (15 for the McCaugheys' G3500 Extended model) to remote keyless entry. And the price -- with $4,278 in options, the G1500 had a sticker of $29,689 -- is a fastball in the dead center of the mini-van strike zone.
For families living in wide-open spaces who are intent on cultivating their own farm teams, the Chevy Express LS seems, ahem, pregnant with possibilities.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
For Asian-Americans in Flushing, Boom and Maybe Bust: Housing Prices Rise With Immigration

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Eduardo Giago was purchasing three cigars at H & H Meat, a small Latino grocery that has been on the corner of Bowne Street and Franklin Avenue in southern Flushing for 20 years. He bit the end off one of his Te Amos and spat it out the door, his face rippled with concern.
"This used to be the Latin corner of Flushing," he said. "Now I don't think we're going to be able to afford to be here anymore." 
 While Flushing has long been a vibrant home to Asian-Americans, most had made their homes and established their businesses in the neighborhood's northern sectors, mainly above Sanford Avenue. But with immigration from Asia burgeoning, commercial development in northern Flushing is saturated, residential space is at a premium and realtors and developers are turning their attention to the area south of Sanford, bordered by Kissena and Parsons Boulevards and Kissena Park.
The area, once known as Doctors' Row because of the large concentration of physicians who formerly lived and practiced in oversized central-hall colonials there, has become one of the hottest real estate regions in Queens.
"Sanford Avenue was once the dividing line between the rich and the not-so," said Joseph Pistilli of the Pistilli Realty Group, based in Astoria. "Flushing is a boom area for the new Americans -- most of them Asian -- and they are high on property in this neighborhood as an investment."
For example, the Korean American Presbyterian Church of Queens, which is across the street from H & H Meats, already occupies the entire northern side of Ash Street and is currently developing the south side. On nearby Bowne Street, the finishing touches are being put on a large Hindu temple.
The growing Asian population has also increased demand for already scarce housing.
"There is such a lack of housing in Flushing right now that redevelopment is coming to this entire area," said Roger Lo, president of A. O. Realty in Flushing. "In two years, you might not recognize the place. It's going to look like Forest Hills."
With the city currently redoing the streets in southern Flushing, and a swath of large detached turn-of-the-century homes zoned for six- and seven-story residential developments, the real estate boom in the area seems bound to continue, said John Watts, president of the Flushing Local Development Corporation.
"When I was a realtor in the area 10 years ago, I couldn't sell a home there for $100,000," Mr. Watts said. "Some of these places are going for nearly four times that, I'm hearing."
While the recent downturn in Asian economies has rippled as far as Flushing, the relative safety of investing in the United States is likely to strengthen the neighborhood, Mr. Lo said.
"Hong Kong, Korean and Chinese money is flowing into Queens," said Mr. Lo, who recently returned from a month-long scouting trip to China. "It's a safer bet here."
But as in any booming area, the increase in real estate prices has raised concerns among longtime residents who fear they will be priced out of the market.
"That's the way it's been going around here," Mr. Giago said. "We're getting run out." CHARLIE LeDUFF

IT'S that time of year again, when the glitter in store windows and the throngs of people lining up to whip out their wallets magnify what seems to be a fundamental fact of New York life: We were put here to part with our money, and the city is set up to make us do just that.
"I tell out of town friends that just walking out the door will cost at least $30," said Kathleen Conkey, a lawyer who lives in Chelsea. "They don't believe me, until they get home and can't figure out where all their money went." 
 But how many New Yorkers ever stop to ponder how quickly the money flies from their hands? One way to look at it is by that classic New York unit of measurement, the hourly rate.
It's simple. Total your monthly expenses, including a budget for frittering -- a coffee here, a bagel there, a magazine for the ride home, a pair of gloves from a street vendor or a couple of martinis at the latest bar. Then divide by 720, the number of hours in a 30-day month. That's what you spend every hour to make your way in Gotham, the amount you feed into the ravenous New York-o-Meter.
"The American compulsion to consume is multiplied a million times over in New York, which is at the center of the American dream," said Cindy Kasovitz-Sichel, a psychoanalyst on the Upper East Side. "Here, more is better, luxury is good. We are measured not only by what we buy but how much we spend."
For some people, just stepping out on the street feeds the impulse to buy. This is the city that never stops selling, from ads in the subways to signs on taxis, buses and messengers' bicycles to the electronic hucksterism of Times Square. An endless stream of promotion urges passers-by to shop, eat, sleep, fly, drive, dress, smoke and drink their way to happiness, or at least urbane sophistication.
Those relentless messages, in turn, help fuel the city's competitive energy. And competition is one big reason people spend money. There's always somebody wearing nicer clothes, eating at finer restaurants, drinking at a trendier bar or working out at a slicker health club.
The competition for living space, meanwhile, is so cutthroat that many people end up in pint-sized apartments, which means they go out a lot, along with their wallet.
"In New York, it all boils down to our private geometry," said Julian Vigo, a cultural-studies theorist who teaches at the New School for Social Research. "Everyone's personal space is displaced. Public space becomes intimate space, except we pay for it."
The sense that they are using valuable space makes some New Yorkers feel obliged to pay a little more. They might, for example, leave a big tip after nursing a single cappuccino in a cafe for a couple of hours. And as Ms. Vigo pointed out: "When people go to St. John the Divine, they throw money on the plate even if they're atheists. They know how much it costs to light that place."
In other cities, "People spend extra money on their houses, cars and home entertainment systems, Ms. Vigo said. "But here we spend on our body. Our disposable income goes to restaurants, exercise, clothes, facials, massages, hair, acupuncture, music, dancing. Our bodies become our houses; they're what we invest in. It's why New Yorkers look so good and dress so well. But of course the cost of style is very high."
Yet style is one thing many New Yorkers crave, and advertisers know that. Sure, all that promotion entices people to buy, said Nick Cohen, chairman of Mad Dogs and Englishmen, an advertising agency. "But it's also part of the architecture and energy of the city," he said. "New Yorkers don't resent it the way other people would."
"New York is a megadose of American consumer culture," Mr. Cohen said. "People live here because they want to be part of that exciting, in-your-face life, and advertising is part of the menu."
New Yorkers "love the game," he said. "They love not being duped, even as they admire clever ads. Advertising is good sport here. It's popular culture reflecting itself back at us like a mirror."
The company's president, Robin Danielson, said New Yorkers who participated in recent focus groups for marketing research did not like the idea of an ad-free city. "We thought New Yorkers would be happy about a city without advertising, but we were wrong," she said. "The perceptions were dystopian, not utopian. It was a world without choice."
But it's not just billboards and the like that get New Yorkers to remember brand names, Ms. Danielson said. "Even garbage became advertising, like an empty Snapple bottle on the bus," she said. "People registered brand names from T-shirts, shopping bags, taxis, even graffiti. Everywhere in New York it says, 'Remember my name!' And people do." In focus groups conducted in Atlanta, by contrast, people said they got most of their advertising messages from television, Ms. Danielson said.
Psychological forces come into play, too. The intensity and pace of life in New York can spawn greed, envy, insecurity, guilt, even spite. And all of them can contribute to heavy spending, psychotherapists say.
One Manhattan therapist, who refused to be identified because of concern about compromising the privacy of his patients, said many of the people he saw worried about how much they spent. "I'd say it's definitely cause for great anxiety among New Yorkers," he said. "They talk about spending as much as food and sex, which says a lot."
Ms. Kasovitz-Sichel said spending can be a form of competition and a source of pride. "I see it in my practice," she said. "New Yorkers love to spend money."
Envy also has a lot to do with it, she noted, "though this is a complicated subject." She continued: "We either devalue those we envy, or we admire them. And if you admire big spenders, you are going to spend. It'll boost your self-esteem."
She said even children in New York were driven toward conspicuous consumption. "I bought my 11-year-old son, Steven, a tie at Sym's for $4.99. He said, 'Why didn't you by it at Ralph Lauren?' And I said because Ralph Lauren wanted $45 for the same tie. He said: 'My birthday is coming soon. You can buy me the Lauren tie then.' And this is a good kid. He hasn't been told by us to want these things. But kids here are under tremendous pressure to dress well."
Then there is what Ms. Kasovitz-Sichel calls "spite spending." She explained: "It's an important New York pastime among women who feel helpless and controlled by their husbands. They spend to show their mates they are worthy."
For some people, guilt drives spending. Parents who feel they aren't spending enough time with their children, for example, may have trouble saying no when a child demands riding lessons at Chelsea Piers or a little something from Schwarz.
Loneliness, too, can spur spending. New York is filled with lonely single people, and many go out a lot, spending money on bars, nightclubs, dating services and pets.
Of course, there are New Yorkers who resist the impulse to spend. They're disciplined. "It takes lots of organization and forethought," said Patty Glynn Lenartz, a freelance writer who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn. "Whenever we don't think about it, we spend tons of money."
Rather than going out for fun whenever the mood strikes, she said, "We stay home a lot and make our apartment as nice as we can. We cook at home and buy really good coffee, to resist any temptation to go to Starbucks." Every day, Ms. Glynn Lenartz makes a bag lunch for her husband, Bob Lenartz. "He doesn't buy sodas because that's $5 a week."
She has devised a simple but strict budget. "I look at what I know we'll have to spend every month. Whatever is left over, that's mine to spend per day," she explained. "If you only get $15 a day, that's all you get. If you spend $20 one day, you can only spend $10 the next. Those are the rules. You can't fool math."
For those who still feel as if they're paying too much per New York hour, it's worth remembering that this is also the bargain capital of the world. "New Yorkers can't resist a good deal," said Mark Waldstein, the author of "Mr. Cheap's New York," a guidebook (Adams Media Corporation, $9.95). "The cost of living is insane, but no other city offers so many ways to beat the system, like free concerts, discounted theater tickets, cut-rate clothes on the Lower East Side, cheap classes, free tours and lectures. Who needs money?"
Then there are those who are committed to a different attitude about spending. Wetlands Preserve, a nightclub, recently organized a protest in New York that was part of Buy Nothing Day, a national educational effort against "corporate greed" and "rampant consumerism," according to organizers. On Nov. 29, about three dozen people distributed leaflets at the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn. "Do you really need to buy that?" said one flier. "Can't you borrow it? Can't you get it fixed?"
Adam Weissman, a volunteer at Wetlands, said the idea was to encourage people to think before they spent. "In New York, there is overconsumption. How much do people need to buy?" he asked. "How much have commodities become a route to happiness here?"
Lou Carbonetti, executive director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association, said the group did not draw the attention of many shoppers. But if business at the mall had been hurt, he said, that "would hurt people throughout Brooklyn," because shopping adds to the area's economic well-being. "Brooklyn has had an economic upswing, but it's still very fragile," Mr. Carbonetti said, adding that 90 percent of the workers in the mall's 200 stores lived in the borough.
Like Mr. Carbonetti, Paul Wyant Kahn is well aware of the city's commercial pulse. A psychoanalyst who was a Zen Buddhist priest for 12 years, he said, "Many people are caught in the barrage of marketing stimuli in New York, which probably has the most intense amount of bartering, bickering and bombardment on the face of the earth." And, he said, "it's very hard amid all the madness to keep aware of your inner state."
One way to tune out all the seductive noise, Mr. Kahn said, is meditation. He said it's possible to meditate even while walking through Times Square.
"Keep the gaze at a lowered angle but high enough to see your way through the crowd, and focus your mind on the sensation of your body walking and the movement of your breathing," he counseled. "It helps to count your breath, from 1 to 10. Each time you get distracted by the glaring ads, a beautiful person or your own fantasies about closing that deal, just begin counting over again: one breath, two breaths. Like that."
 
A $200 Stroll Down the Avenue?
SOMETIMES a walk down a New York street can be an exercise in seduction. The alluring store windows, the smell of coffee or fresh-baked bread and the ads for everything from concerts to clothes can be hard to resist.
Say you're a hypothetical New Yorker on a hypothetical walk along lower Second Avenue one nippy afternoon. Passing Stuyvesant Square Liquors, you are drawn to the glowing holiday windows, so you step inside. That set of Stolichnaya vodka and glasses for $17.45 seems perfect for the boss's Christmas gift.
On your way out, you see a bus ad for "performance fleece" jackets from Old Navy. You have no idea what "performance fleece" is, but with the icy wind creeping though your ratty coat, you make a mental note to buy the jacket tomorrow.
Then you pass tiny Fratelli Ravioli and get a big whiff of garlic and parmesan. It's a warm, cozy smell, and you're expecting company tomorrow. Fresh mozzarella, rice balls, sweet sausages and fried ravioli set you back $15.75.
Next you pass the Orpheum Theater, where the marquee is advertising "Stomp." Suddenly, you remember that Aunt Sally is coming for a visit soon. She'd like this show. But because you didn't plan ahead, the only tickets you can get are $47.50 each.
Now you're getting hungry. The Second Avenue Deli's "health alternative menu" offers brisket of beef, "just like Bubba used to make," for $14.85. Then again, there's Tasty Corner Chinese, with steamed fish and black beans for $12.95. Or maybe, for the same price, some "Jewels on the Beach" from Pongsri, a Thai restaurant.
Having eaten, you're ready to press on. At Love Saves the Day, the window is full of unusual and colorful toys. You need a little something to bring to your neighbor's open house. The vintage Rock'em Sock'em Robots are fun, but they're $139. Your neighbor is a big John Travolta fan, and he'd get a kick out of the 1970's "Onstage Superstar Doll," but it's $150. For $15, the "Official John Travolta Picture Postcard Book" will do just fine.
At Moishe's Homemade Kosher Bake Shop, a pound of rugelach ($8.49) is irresistible for your own tree-trimming party. Then you pass Pommes Frittes, a house of Belgian fries. You love fries. Never mind that you've already had lunch. A jumbo portion, with roasted-garlic mayo, is $5.50.
Near Houston Street is New York Adorned. Piercing is $25 above the waist, $30 below, plus jewelry. How about that for a little holiday statement?
Pooped, you pop into Global 33 for a hand-shaken martini, which will run you about $9 with tax and tip. You dig in your pocket for cab fare home, or at least a subway token. After all, it's time for dinner. DAVID KIRBY
 
As the Day Goes, So Goes the Money
 LET'S say you spend $3,000 a month on everything from rent to the occasional Lotto ticket -- and that includes your "fritter money," the amount you spend without noticing on things like coffee, newspapers, croissants and beer. Your personal meter is running at about $4.17 an hour, 24 hours a day. Just spent three hours window shopping on Madison Avenue? That'll be $12.51, please. A good night's sleep of eight hours? It'll set you back about $33 before the garbage trucks rattle you to life in the morning.
For people who are self-employed or otherwise able to get a tax deduction for business-related expenses, there's even more reason to spend. The more they make from their business per hour, the more they can spend on their business per hour. And the more they spend, the more they can deduct. New York, with so many clients to woo and so many places to woo them, is tax-deduction city.
But while Uncle Sam knows the cost of making money in New York is high, he's not stupid. "I've had clients tell me they dropped $300 on opera tickets and then ran into business associates at Lincoln Center, said Herb Speiser, an accountant with Phillips Gold & Company. "They wanted to know if they could write it off. I said sure, but not over my signature."
Spending patterns vary wildly. Some people get by on less than $1,000 per month ($1.39 per hour) while others insist they could not possibly survive the rigors of Big Apple living on anything less than $20,000 a month ($27.78 per hour). DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: Health-Care Reform Redux;
A Tax Overhaul Looks Good, From Afar

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TAX reform may prove to be for Republicans what health care reform was for Democrats -- a seemingly popular idea that turned into a political disaster.
In the case of health care, a 1991 Gallup Poll showed that 85 percent of Americans believed that the system needed reforming. Bill Clinton seized on this mood and made health care reform a centerpiece of his 1992 election campaign. Good medical insurance, he declared, was a right, not a privilege. He promised to make it affordable to everyone. 
 But the monumental plan President Clinton offered after he was elected was carefully picked apart by interest groups like insurance companies, doctors and small businesses. The Republican minority in Congress opposed the President at every turn. Many people became scared that they might lose the ability to choose their own doctors or get treatment when they need it.
Ultimately, most voters and politicians decided that changes would be worse than sticking with the old health care system, flaws and all. Mr. Clinton's plan died in 1994. It was the most serious political defeat of his Presidency, and contributed no doubt to the Republicans' victory in the Congressional elections that year.
 
Deja Vu
The Republican drive for replacing the Federal income tax is taking shape in a similar fashion.
The latest Gallup Poll found that 73 percent of Americans believe that the tax system needs major changes or a complete overhaul. Republican lawmakers are stumping the country under the banner of "scrap the code." Party leaders believe they can make hay over Democratic opposition to tax reform and ride the issue to victory in the Congressional elections next year and the Presidential election in 2000.
But here's the rub: When they scrutinize the details of what the Republicans are proposing, people may find, as they did with the Democrats' health care plan, that they would be worse off than they are now.
President Clinton said in an interview last week that he might suggest some tax measures himself next year. But he is not likely to side with Republicans and favor completely revamping the system. Two main Republican plans are being discussed.
One, drafted by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, would impose a single flat tax of 20 percent for two years and 17 percent thereafter on both individual and business income and abolish almost all deductions and exemptions. The other, promoted by Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana, would replace the income tax with a national sales tax of 15 percent on almost all goods and services.
Both plans have provisions meant to insulate the poor. Mr. Armey would increase the personal exemption so that a family of four with annual income below $33,800 would owe no taxes. Mr. Tauzin would give periodic tax rebates to the poor. But both would repeal the earned-income tax credit, which provides cash to low-income workers.
Republicans say they hope to avoid the pitfalls of the health care experience by proceeding more cautiously than President Clinton did. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, met last week with Mr. Clinton about taxes. The upshot seemed to be that nothing more than tinkering with the tax law is likely next year.
Certainly no one expects votes next year on rewriting the tax code. Mr. Archer says that without a bipartisan approach, full-scale tax reform is out of the question until a Republican is elected President. But that will not stop the Republicans from talking about tax reform next year.
Many powerful interest groups are gearing up to fight the Republican plans with the money and fervor that was used in the health care battle.
The Health Insurance Institute of America -- the organization that sponsored the Harry-and-Louise television commercials that worked so effectively against the Clinton health plan -- is already maintaining that because neither Republican tax plan would allow businesses to deduct the cost of insurance premiums for their employees, the number of people without medical insurance would explode.
The real estate industry holds that the price of houses would rise enormously without the mortgage interest deduction. Many companies say they would go out of business if they could not write off the depreciation cost of expensive machinery and equipment already in their factories.
 
Math Problems
As if that were not enough, simple arithmetic shows that middle-class families would almost certainly pay higher taxes under the Republican plans than they do now. If the rich pay less in taxes, as they certainly would with a sales tax or an income tax rate cut, someone has to make up the difference if total Government revenues remain approximately the same. The Treasury has calculated, for instance, that a flat tax raising as much money as the existing tax system would require a 20.8 percent rate and that essentially all families with annual incomes below $200,000 would face more taxes.
Mr. Armey and Mr. Tauzin dispute such calculations. The skeptics, they say, do not take account of the lower interest rates and economic expansion that would result from their plans.
But that is theory, not fact. The Republicans might have trouble selling their ideas to voters just as Mr. Clinton could never convince people that they would be better off with his health program.
Here's why. In Mr. Clinton's case, while millions of Americans lack adequate health insurance, the vast majority of people are in fact covered. The comparable problem for Republicans on taxes is that while millions of taxpayers are frustrated by high rates and complicated rules on deductions, about two-thirds of Americans either owe no taxes or take the standard deduction and are taxed at a 15 percent rate.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Will Moscow's Gain Be a Loss For Investors?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
LENIN must be spinning in his tomb. The city of Moscow, once the capital of global Communism, could soon be the parent of an American mutual fund.
And no ordinary mutual fund, at that. Lexington Troika Dialog Russia has been, for much of this year, the best performer among all mutual funds in the United States. Before Russian stocks caught the contagion that swept from Asia to other emerging markets in October, the fund had gained more than 130 percent in 1997. 
 It has not fared as well lately, however, with the market turmoil of the last two months slashing the fund's value by more than a third. So although Lexington Troika remains up 60 percent since Jan. 1, most shareholders have lost money because they bought their shares after the fund had run up those huge gains.
The turmoil extends to Troika Dialog Asset Management, part of the Moscow-based brokerage firm that co-manages the fund's portfolio with the Lexington Management Corporation, a New Jersey-based mutual fund company. Troika Dialog is to be sold early next year to the Bank of Moscow, whose majority owner is the municipal government of Russia's capital city. Shareholders of the Lexington Troika fund are scheduled to vote on one aspect of the transaction on Dec. 19.
Why should investors care? The city is in the midst of privatizing hundreds of municipally owned enterprises. And while such deals in Russia have been marked by almost unfettered cronyism, the American regulators who oversee Lexington Troika can be expected to take a harsh stance on investments by the fund that are done at anything less than arm's length. If Russia's markets are the wild, wild West, the Securities and Exchange Commission can play the tough sheriff, even from afar.
And then there are the unanswered questions about the future involvement of the fund's founder, Peter Derby, a Jamaica, Queens, native who over the last seven years built Troika Dialog into Russia's biggest brokerage firm. He will not disclose what he is getting from the Bank of Moscow for selling, and he is noncommittal when asked what his continuing relationship with Troika Dialog and the fund will be.
But it is hard to see how the fund's shareholders can win. To the extent that Mr. Derby distances himself from the fund, they lose the benefits of his investing prowess, including the contacts that have helped the fund to make timely investments. To the extent that he remains involved, his motives will be different: As one of Russia's premier merchant bankers, he will profit by promoting investments to the fund rather than in making the fund perform well for shareholders.
For investors who bought shares of the Lexington Troika fund early, 1997 has been a vastly successful year. But for the majority of shareholders, the recent upheaval offers a cautionary tale about the hazards of investing in emerging markets.
Recent sharp drops in stock markets in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe prove that the strategy of spreading assets across the globe, in the hope that sovereign markets will act independently, remains a theory at best. And despite a global communications revolution that can instantly link an investor in Iowa with an executive in Irkutsk, there remain vast differences in securities regulations, accounting methods and the simple realities of doing honest business between West and East -- differences that make investing in emerging markets far more risky than some mutual fund companies would have investors believe.
"These issues get raised in emerging markets all the time," said Julie Allecta, a specialist in mutual fund law at the San Francisco firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who was formerly a lawyer at the S.E.C. "But they seem to exist in Russia to an inordinate degree. And in a place like Moscow or Russia, where cronyism is vital, the issues become much more substantial."
FEW entrepreneurs, if any, have been more successful in negotiating a path through Russia's fledgling securities business than Mr. Derby, 37, who moved to Moscow in 1990. He has since created a one-man financial conglomerate comprising Dialog Bank, a commercial bank; the Development and Restructuring Bank, a merchant bank; a related insurance company; Troika Dialog, the brokerage and investment banking firm, and its subsidiary that is co-manager of the fund.
Yet some participants in the close-knit Moscow brokerage community are still shaking their heads in wonder at Mr. Derby's decision in July to sell a portion of Troika Dialog -- which, given the explosion of underwriting business in Russia, is one of his most attractive businesses. Last week, at a Russian investment conference in New York, several expressed surprise when informed of Mr. Derby's sale of the remainder of Troika Dialog in the pending deal, which was disclosed only when the Lexington Troika fund filed a proxy statement in the United States last month.
And to these rivals, his decision to choose the Bank of Moscow over a foreign partner -- even as some of Troika Dialog's competitors were forging links with rich Western investment banks -- is the deal's most curious aspect.
In its recent ranking of the top 100 banks in Russia, the Moscow-based publication Russia Review ranks the Bank of Moscow the country's 12th-largest bank in total assets. But in terms of available capital, it ranks 32d. In a separate creditworthiness ranking by IC Rating, a Russian bank research firm, the Bank of Moscow sits squarely in the middle of the pack.
The bank does have one promising asset, however -- its link with the City of Moscow, a municipality that is essentially the realm of one man, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Executives in the Russian securities industry say a relationship with the Mayor is as important to generating business as any link with a foreign partner.
One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his desire to continue to do business with the city, likened Mr. Luzhkov's influence to the power once wielded by Chicago's legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley. "Like Daley, Luzhkov has got his fingers in a lot of pies," the executive said.
THE Mayor was traveling last week and could not be reached for comment on his ties to the Bank of Moscow and whether he would have any involvement with Troika Dialog. But Mr. Derby said of Mr. Luzhkov: "Troika Dialog's honesty and integrity are its main assets, as he sees it. He wants to make sure the firm grows properly."
Moscow's Mayor is not likely to be picking stocks for the Lexington Troika fund. But the fund's managers clearly hope to benefit from its new ties. "The bank's relationship with the City of Moscow places Troika Dialog in an excellent investment banking position for the companies yet to be privatized by the City of Moscow," states the Lexington Troika fund's latest proxy statement.
"That's troublesome," Ms. Allecta said. "They seem to be saying they have access to inside information, that they can manipulate the market because they can control the timing of certain entities being privatized."
Richard Hisey, a managing director at Lexington Management, the Saddle Brook, N.J., firm that markets Lexington Troika to American investors, said that the fund was comfortable that it would remain in compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, the governing statute for the mutual fund industry.
"The fire walls have been set up" to protect against conflicts of interest, he said.
Bruce Bean, a lawyer in the Moscow office of the Coudert Brothers law firm who has monitored events surrounding the fund, said investors should be protected by virtue of the fund's operation under S.E.C. oversight. "Russian law and regulation in this area is clearly underdeveloped," he said. "But American mutual-fund law is overdeveloped."
But investors cannot count on the fund's stellar performance surviving a management shake-up.
As chairman of Troika Dialog, Mr. Derby had substantial input into the firm's management of the Lexington Troika fund. So shareholders are bound to wonder if, after the sale, the fund's manager will lose much of the expertise that helped it to rack up big gains this year.
For most of the fund's 18-month existence, Mr. Derby said, he has provided big-picture investment ideas but left the stock-picking to a team led by Gavin Rankin, the Moscow-based head of research for Troika Dialog. Meanwhile, the fund's broad strategy has been overseen by Mr. Hisey, who works for Lexington in the United States. The two companies split equally the fund's management fee of 1.25 percent.
But Mr. Derby acknowledged that he often took a more direct role. "I built this firm from scratch," he said. He continues to refer to the Troika Dialog companies as "my children." And at times, he said, he stepped in to personally supervise the fund's investments.
"When there were certain excesses in the market -- huge volumes, high volatility or questions of a political nature that affected the fund -- I had the dominant say," he said. "The alliance with the Bank of Moscow, going forward, will change that."
But not entirely. "Of course, I will continue to maintain relationships with the management and individuals at Troika Dialog, and we will continue to work together when it's prudent to do so," Mr. Derby said. "I think we can go in with Troika Dialog on some of our transactions since we have this personal relationship."
BET if the cord is not being fully severed between Troika Dialog and its founding father, shareholders in the Lexington Troika fund may want to know how Mr. Derby's interests will compete with their own. For answers, investors in Lexington Troika, like shareholders of all funds, will have to rely on the managers and independent directors -- most of whom are based in the United States.
S.E.C. officials look closely at potential conflicts of interest, especially when they occur in foreign markets. In its oversight of funds that invest heavily in developing markets like Russia, "we ask funds to consider and describe any problems that might be material from the perspective of investors," said Barry Barbash, director of the S.E.C.'s mutual fund division.
In Lexington Troika's case, that results in several eye-numbing pages of the fund's prospectus, devoted to warnings about the possible negative effects of adverse political or diplomatic developments, social instability, expropriation or nationalization of assets, armed conflict in Chechnya, tensions between the President and the legislature, unrest caused by military downsizing, inexperience of corporate managers, lack of modern technology, lack of capital, high inflation, high taxes, dependence on foreign economic aid, and stock market speculators -- among other conditions.
The danger, regulators acknowledge, is that the disclosures are so overburdened with descriptions of possible negative outcomes as to make all the warnings seem irrelevant.
Of course, the biggest concern of the fund's shareholders may be the losses most are now sitting on.
Numbers supplied by AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., company that tracks the flow of cash in and out of mutual funds, show that two-thirds of the new investment into Lexington Troika this year came in the third quarter, after the fund's value had soared 78 percent in the first six months.
In doubling the fund's assets in a matter of weeks, those new investors bought their shares at prices in the low- to mid-$20's. Last week, though, the fund's net asset value fell below $17 for the first time since early May, before rebounding to about $18.
Another measure of the fund's recent problems: Despite its shining performance in the first half, Lexington Troika this year has lost about $15 million in investors' money, according to AMG Data's numbers through the end of November -- and $1 out of every $3 invested since the end of June.
TO be sure, some of the fund's sharp gains and subsequent losses were results of frenzied activity in the overall Russian stock market and had little to do with specific stock selections by the fund's managers.
Nevertheless, the fund's portfolio poses substantial risks of its managers' making.
At the end of June, the date of the last semiannual disclosure of the fund's entire portfolio, 13 percent of Lexington Troika's assets were in "illiquid securities," defined in the prospectus as those that cannot be sold within seven days "without taking a materially reduced price." Included among those were the fund's second-largest holding at the end of June: six million shares of Sibneft, an oil and gas company, which represented 4.2 percent of the fund's assets and 6 percent of its equity holdings. In the Russian market, analysts say, shares of all but the largest of formerly state-owned companies can be hard to trade in volatile markets.
Last week, Mr. Hisey said that the percentage of the fund's assets in illiquid securities was still about the same, adding that those stocks had taken "a haircut along with the other holdings in the fund's portfolio."
Mr. Rankin, the Troika Dialog research director, noted that during the late October crash in the Russian market, it became essentially impossible to trade those illiquid securities.
"You had what always happens when there's a crash: the focus was on liquid names, and on the illiquid ones there was really very little trading done," he said. "Many investors who spent a considerable amount of time to build up those positions in second- and third-tier stocks were reluctant to fire-sell them."
HOW does a mutual fund value its holdings of rarely traded Russian stocks that no one wants to buy? That question, too, troubled the S.E.C. when Lexington Troika first asked for permission to sell its shares, said Mr. Bean, the Moscow lawyer.
To gain approval, the fund agreed to keep about 15 percent of its assets in "very liquid assets" like United States Treasury issues, according to the prospectus, so that it could meet redemptions in the event of large shareholder withdrawals. Indeed, Mr. Hisey said that since the October market decline, the fund's cash position had climbed even higher, to about 30 percent of assets.
That means that the fund sold some of its more liquid stocks while continuing to hold most of its illiquid ones, he said.
Undoubtedly, many, if not most, Lexington Troika shareholders knew they were making a volatile investment. And the crisis in the Moscow market has not passed. "I see the short-term volatility continuing here for at least a few months," Mr. Hisey said.
Mr. Rankin concurs. With large emerging markets like South Korea and Brazil facing their own problems, investors in those countries -- which were major holders of Russian Government bonds -- have been pulling money out of Russia. That could further dry up the Moscow market's liquidity, as could the fact that Korea and other troubled Asian countries are big markets for Russia's production of basic materials, like steel.
In the long term, both managers, predictably enough, are optimistic. But investors may want to heed the observation of Mr. Rankin, who notes that much of the rise in the Russian securities market earlier this year came from "one-time revaluations" of Russian industries.
Among the stocks that performed the best, he cautioned, "there were not a lot of long-term growth stories."
 
Billy Joel, Glasnost, and Opportunity
Peter Derby said it was a 1987 trip to Russia in the entourage of Billy Joel, the pop singer, that opened his eyes to the opportunities there.
"I saw a lot of young people who looked just like the audiences at Madison Square Garden," said Mr. Derby, who served as a translator during the historic concert tour. "At the time, Gorbachev was talking about glasnost, telling young people to go out there and have a life."
In developing his securities business, Mr. Derby said, "I wanted to be there to provide legitimate answers for them."
In the process, he undoubtedly has made himself very wealthy, though he won't disclose details of his finances. His firm, Troika Dialog, has been the top trader among all brokerage firms operating in the rapidly growing Russian securities market, beating out esteemed competitors like Credit Suisse First Boston.
Not bad for a child of immigrants.
"I grew up speaking only Russian at home in Queens until I was 5 years old," Mr. Derby said in an interview last week in New York, where he was attending a conference on Russian markets. "When I went to Russia, I found the people there just like my family. I wanted to help them, but not to take advantage of them." EDWARD WYATT

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Those Ho-hum Utilities Have Started to Sizzle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
AS Southeast Asia's economic tumble has sent investors in search of calmer waters, one staid domestic sector -- the common stocks of utility companies -- has been showing new strength.
The ranks of best-performing specialty funds for the quarter so far are dominated by those that invest in utilities, be they electric power utilities, water companies or long-distance phone carriers. Phone stocks, in fact, are a staple of utility investors and have contributed greatly to the sector's recent advance. 
 There are some highly specific explanations for this sector's outperformance, such as a change at the helm of AT&T. But the more general explanation is that investors are seeking the safety of blue-chip domestic stocks that pay fat dividends, as riskier markets tumble like so many dominoes.
"There's a fear of instability in the market -- a general sense that we're due for a major correction," said Earl D. Osborn, a financial planner in San Francisco with Bingham Osborn & Scarborough. "When you're seeking more conservative stock funds, with high dividends to protect them, the classic fund for that is the utility fund."
Nearly all industries in the utility sector showed great strength in October and November. The S.& P. index that tracks long-distance phone companies spurted 19.7 percent during those two months, and the regional Bell operating companies advanced 14.7 percent. The S.& P. 500, meanwhile, edged up 0.9 percent.
Water companies -- of which there are only six in the S.& P. data base -- shot up 17.3 percent. Electric power companies (which in the minds of many investors are synonymous with the word "utility") sprinted ahead by 8.4 percent. Natural-gas producers eked out a 2.8 percent gain.
The only utilities to decline as a group in the two months were the independent power producers, which sank 12.5 percent. Sam Stovall, editor of S.& P.'s Monthly Investment Review, blamed profit-taking. "They were up 88 percent last year, and 36 percent in the year to date," Mr. Stovall said.
In common with most other utility stocks, the shares of companies that generate electricity are defensive in nature because they pay relatively high dividends, setting a price cushion beneath the shares.
"Their average dividend yield right now is 5.7 percent, so even if our economic expansion does slow down, these companies will offer a very attractive total return opportunity," Mr. Stovall said.
Moreover, although United States power companies have begun to enter into foreign ventures, such efforts are in their infancy, and the companies remain "truly domestic," he said. "They will not be adversely affected by the troubles we see overseas."
Indeed, while global utility funds have outperformed their purely domestic counterparts in recent years, that leadership was reversed in the last two months.
"The funds with significant overseas exposure haven't been doing so well lately," said Paul Ellenbogen, an equity fund analyst with Morningstar Inc., the fund research company in Chicago. "The funds that are doing the best are the domestically focused funds."
He cited the example of two funds in the Franklin Templeton Group, each managed by the same three persons.
Franklin Global Utilities was up an average of 16.6 percent annually in the five years ended Nov. 28, trouncing the 9.4 percent return of the Franklin Utilities fund. In October and November, however, the domestic fund advanced 6.5 percent, while the global fund declined 0.8 percent.
The foreign-domestic distinction, however, hardly exhausts the diversity of the 100 or so utility sector funds in the Morningstar data base. Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., said, "Some have a low of 20 percent invested in traditional utilities to a high of 99 percent." The ratio of average share price to book value ranges from 1.6 to 3.6, and the rate of three-year earnings growth of the average fund in the portfolio stretches from 8 to 29 percent.
Over the last few months, investments in telephone company stocks have fueled the price acceleration throughout the group. Reflecting the telecommunications advance, the best performer among nondiversified funds so far in the quarter is Smith Barney Telecom Income, and it is followed by a pack of utilities funds that have benefited from the gains of the phone companies.
Susan Flischel, manager of the Countrywide Utility fund, based in Cincinnati, and John Schniedwind, co-manager of the American Century Utilities fund, based in Kansas City, Mo., have each achieved double-digit increases -- 10.5 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively -- this quarter through Thursday. And each is betting relatively heavily on telecommunications.
Mr. Schniedwind's fund has 54 percent of its $157 million of assets in telecommunications stocks. His largest positions include AT&T and regional Bell phone companies, like SBC Communications and Bell Atlantic. AT&T shares have risen to the $50-plus level from the $30's since the company's board named C. Michael Armstrong on Oct. 20 to replace Robert E. Allen as chief executive.
Worldcom's deal on Nov. 11 to acquire MCI Communications gave another boost to the industry, Mr. Schniedwind noted. "The market feels there are a lot of favorable things that will come out of deregulation of telephones," he said.
At Countrywide, telephones "have really accounted for a lot of our performance," Ms. Flischel said, although power-company stocks have not held her fund back. "Quality companies that are solid, and growing their earnings and dividends, stand to benefit from deregulation in the electricity area," she said. Duke Energy, widely regarded as one of the best-run power companies in the nation, is one of her fund's largest positions.
Only 30 percent of the fund's $40 million of assets is in phone companies, but that is still unusually high as Ms. Flischel has cut back significantly on power-company shares. They are usually 65 percent of assets, in order to capture their relatively high dividend yields, but currently are just 50 percent.
Ms. Flischel said the cutback was partly to meet redemptions, caused largely by investors' preference for growth stocks as the bull market roared ahead.
"We've had cash leaving the fund, and we've had to sell stocks to raise cash, and we chose the underperformers, which have been in the electric area," she said.
Utility funds, in fact, have been mostly hemorrhaging cash since late 1993, when many utility securities were downgraded as the threat of competition permeated the industry. In the middle of last month, however, the sector began to record net inflows of cash and that has continued ever since.
Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., said utility fund assets had shrunk to as low as $18.52 billion on Nov. 12, from $27.46 billion on Nov. 3, 1993, before rising to $19.71 billion last week.
THE recent uptick in utility stocks is a result of trends that should persist for some time, many analysts say.
"We are bullish on utilities," said Ronald E. Rowland, editor of the All-Star Funds Newsletter, published in Austin, Tex. Their isolation from foreign events, their relatively low prices after years of neglect by investors and the benefit they derive from lower interest rates all point to continued strength, he said.
"Plus, the uncertainty surrounding deregulation is beginning to dissipate," he said. "It's starting to be a little clearer how that is going to play out."
Investors who are too conservative to buy a sector fund can gain exposure to the area through diversified funds.
"Equity-income funds are classic examples," said Mr. Osborn, the financial planner. "Any type of value or high-dividend-yielding stock fund is going to have an exposure to utilities."
Mr. Evensky said his clients also gain exposure through diversified funds. "Utilities traditionally are going to be considered a value play because of their nature, and we are very definitely invested in them," he said.
He noted that two funds he is using for his clients have given extra weight to the sector: DFA International Value is 4.5 percent concentrated in utilities, he said, and Montgomery Equity-Income has 11.5 percent. The sector's weighting in the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which tracks the S.& P. 500, is 2.7 percent.

HEADLINE: The World;
It Turns Out That All Global Politics Is Local

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHAT ever happened to global Kumbaya the we-are-the-world cooperative spirit that seemed only yesterday to have replaced the cold war?
Look at the headlines of the last few weeks: 
 * Most of America's closest allies refused to consider military action to force Saddam Hussein to admit United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq.
* Congress refused to give President Clinton the authority to negotiate trade agreements with the rest of the world.
* Efforts to reduce global warming are mired in disagreements large and small at a big summit meeting in Japan.
* The United States, China and Russia, big producers of land mines, refused to join 120 other nations signing a treaty in Ottawa banning the deadliest of the devices.
It wasn't supposed to be this way. Early in the 1990's, dozens of countries joined the American-led military coalition to oust President Hussein's forces from Kuwait. The North American Free Trade Agreement and the enlargement of the world's trading system promised to topple trade barriers east and west, north and south. The United States and other developed nations set ambitious goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at an environmental summit meeting in Brazil. And disarmament of all sorts was de rigeur.
But it turns out that all the New Age collegiality was fleeting, or maybe just overstated. It was an afterglow of the end of the cold war, not the light of the future. Appearances to the contrary, countries had not redefined self-interest to mean the greatest global good.
"The United States had won the cold war and was at the pinnacle of its power, so all the policies and preferences of the United States were translated into international politics," said Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of Foreign Affairs. "That was a momentary peak."
Which is not to say that there are not forces -- trade and technology, for example -- driving countries slowly but surely toward greater integration and cooperation. It is just that an interplay of old national interests and new centers of power has made the process much more complex and unpredictable.
Among the players beyond governmental control these days are nonprofit organizations armed not with weapons but with new technologies to pursue their agendas. The land-mine treaty, for example, might never have happened without an intensive campaign by private groups using high-speed, inexpensive global communications via the Internet and E-mail. And so the United States and Russia, the powers pivotal to big weapons agreements of the recent past, were left on the sidelines.
 
New Issues
The absence of global military tensions has given both countries and peoples a range of new issues to choose from in defining national security. Jessica Mathews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written about the new search for "human security" emerging "from the conditions of daily life -- food, shelter, employment, health, public safety -- rather than flowing downward from a country's foreign relations and military strength."
Finally, when it comes to the pursuit of national self-interest, it's hard to ignore the world's pre-eminent power. Some of the erosion of global goodwill can be attributed to annoyance over the United States' penchant for domestically driven economic sanctions -- against Cuba and Iran, for example -- and its refusal to compromise on smaller issues. If the United States had agreed to let a Frenchman head the southern command of NATO and had not tried to curb French investment in Iran, would France have been more amenable to military action against Iraq?
 
'Transgovernmentalism'
The dissipation of hopes for global amity has prompted an esoteric debate among academics and experts about what exactly is going on.
In a recent article in Foreign Affairs titled "The Real New World Order," Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Harvard law professor, argued that "liberal internationalism" -- under which institutions like the United Nations kept the peace after the cold war -- had been replaced by a "new medievalism," with the nation-state in permanent decline. But actually something called "transgovernmentalism" is becoming "the most widespread form of international governance," she wrote. By that she means not that the state is disappearing, but that government agencies, including courts, regulatory structures, even legislatures, are building global networks with their counterparts abroad.
Joseph S. Nye, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, has launched a project called "Visions of Governance for the 21st Century." He has gone mathematical, offering a nine-cell matrix to describe the factors at work in governmental decisions today: national, subnational and supranational forces intersecting with the private sector, governments and nonprofit groups.
Despite all the messiness, the United States and the international community appear to have cooperated well in the new war against economic collapse -- most recently with the current plan to bail out South Korea. They have marshaled their forces and taken swift, dramatic action to prevent instability.
"After the financial crisis in Mexico, there was talk about the principle of regional responsibility and leaving it to the United States," said Lawrence S. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. "Now, with the Korean crisis, there is a general recognition of the principles of global responsibility."
Ultimately, the more than $60 billion in loans to bail out South Korea will have to come from the world's taxpayers, so there is only so much patience for this sort of financial rescue.
There are other examples of New Age cooperation. NATO is drawing up plans that would keep NATO troops in Bosnia when their mandate runs out next June. And NATO's addition of three members from the former Warsaw Pact is proceeding better than expected.
"Obviously there are some things in which the international community is working in a collective fashion and some in which it is struggling," said Robert Zoellick, an Under Secretary of State during the Bush Administration. "It's not all or nothing."
Still, Mr. Zoellick, Mr. Zakaria and other foreign policy experts faulted the Clinton Administration for failing to develop long-term strategies for some of the world's thorniest problems, like Persian Gulf security.
"It takes a lot of effort to maintain the world," said Mr. Zakaria. "But the Adminsitration hasn't prioritized. You can't keep saying, 'I want your cooperation on everything.' "

In Medicine, Government Rises Again

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
HILLARY was right about health care. Well, not quite: Hardly anybody expects Congress to micro-manage medical services or to cap the maximum amount Americans are permitted to spend on insurance. But confidence that the health care system can solve its problems without a lot of help from Washington is rapidly evaporating.
As recently as a year or two ago, care regulated solely by the free market seemed the wave of the future, with feisty, profit-driven health maintenance organizations in the vanguard of the struggle to stamp out waste and remove medical specialists from the gravy train. Today, those H.M.O.'s are reporting falling earnings as they struggle with both angry consumers demanding better service and a medical establishment determined to resist any more cutbacks in fees. 
 So where to go from here? Surely not back to fee-for-service medicine fed by deep-pockets insurance that was too expensive a decade ago -- and would be even more expensive now. And surely not forward to Government insurance, with bureaucrats deciding who gets a hip replacement or a new treatment for Alzheimer's: Congress flatly rejected that option in the debate over the cumbersome plan from the task force that Mrs. Clinton directed.
"We're going though a period of soul-searching," said Robert D. Reischauer, who was head of the Congressional Budget Office during the Bush Administration, "one that will lead to a period of experimentation" with more Government intervention than the insurance industry wants and less than the center-left had hoped for.
Or, to put it another way: Hillary Lite.
The curtain is rising on a third act in a drama that opened in the 1980's, when most Americans were still enrolled in fee-for-service insurance plans through their employers. Health care costs were rising at a shocking five percentage points above the general rate of inflation -- and, for obvious reasons. Since patients' co-payments and deductibles were generally small, and generous coverage was the norm, "medical services seemed almost free and providers were under little pressure to economize," said Mark Pauly of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
Act two began in 1990, with the recession and the first wave of corporate downsizing. With labor on the defensive, employers were able to contain rapidly escalating medical costs by forcing employees into "managed care" arrangements -- in particular, into H.M.O.'s promising big savings.
At first the H.M.O.'s delivered. Hard bargaining squeezed some fat out of the system, forcing hospitals to reduce costs by closing wings and holding the line on employment. Physicians, faced with the choice of lower fees or far fewer patients, reluctantly traded in their Mercedes-Benzes for Camrys.
 
Reality Check
Then, too, there was the Hillary Effect -- the sobering impact of a year of debate over health care in which almost everyone acknowledged that business-as-usual was untenable. "I think providers really did become more reasonable," after the Clinton Administration went on the warpath in 1993, said Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University.
The cost of insurance for large employers flattened, or even fell. And the average growth in medical outlays per person, which was 5.2 percentage points above the rate of inflation in the 1980's, was much lower -- 3.4 percentage points higher than inflation -- during the first half of the 1990's.
It's not that the fat is gone. "Two hospital beds in five are empty," Mr. Reischauer pointed out. "What industry in a competitive market could make a profit at 60 percent capacity?"
But the balance of bargaining power is shifting back toward providers. When just one or two insurers controlled a large portion of a regional market, physicians had little choice but to accept whatever was offered. With more insurers competing, Mr. Reinhardt notes that doctors and hospitals in big cities may see patients from a dozen H.M.O.'s -- and insurers can no longer dictate fees.
So in the last year or two, the H.M.O.'s have shifted from squeezing providers to denying consumers access to services deemed ineffective or unnecessary. And as a political matter, patients are becoming harder to push around. Sending new mothers home the day after giving birth, for example, didn't win the H.M.O.'s many friends.
But more fundamental economic forces have also been at work. When employees worried they would lose health insurance of any sort, it was relatively easy to channel them into restrictive H.M.O.'s. But "now that they no longer fear for their jobs," Mr. Pauly said, they balk at running bureaucratic gauntlets to see specialists and "employers are again using generous benefits to attract and keep employees."
Insurers are responding to the backlash by offering less restrictive coverage. Employers are trying to pass on costs by requiring hefty co-payments -- typically 30 percent -- for the unquestioned right to see physicians outside designated provider panels. And in response to a combination of public pressure and intense lobbying by providers, government is making its weight felt.
Many states are regulating everything from the length of a hospital stay for a mastectomy to the financial incentives that H.M.O.'s give to physicians for denying treatment. And Congress is flooded with similar ad hoc proposals from both sides of the aisle -- including one from that stalwart of Republicanism, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.
Ironically, the regulatory initiative least likely to offend the sensibilities of free marketers is coming from the folks who brought you the Clinton plan. While the "consumer bill of rights" for health care just proposed by the Administration has a little something for everyone, its focus is on insuring adequate information for consumers, along with effective competition among insurers and providers. "Anyone should be able to compare plan benefits or physicians' credentials by logging on to the Internet," Mr. Reinhardt said.
This "make the market work" approach to reform -- which, parenthetically, has its origins in the trust-busting crusade of the very Republican President Teddy Roosevelt -- is not likely to please private insurers. But Mr. Reischauer predicts their opposition will soften since "they don't want to deal with regulators in 50 different states."
It's too early to say how the politics and economics of health care regulation will play out in detail. But a few things are clear.
 
Progress Costs
Explaining the lion's share of growth in health care outlays per person, Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard, notes that "medical technology has traditionally advanced in costly ways." Hence any regulation that trimmed a percentage point or two off the annual growth of medical bills would have to slow innovation -- or channel it in cost-saving directions like outpatient care.
By the same token, the ideas that for-profit care is at least as good as nonprofit, and that insured patients have no obligation to subsidize the uninsured poor are likely to come under intense scrutiny. "Are we really prepared to cede authority over who gets what treatment to private agents?" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Change, Mr. Reischauer predicts, will come as "three steps forward and two steps back." But he suggests that we may be overestimating the difficulty of coming to terms with systems that ration medical services through a combination of cold cost-benefit calculations and consumers' willingness to pay.
"The real resistance is coming from people who grew up with unlimited fee-for-service insurance," he contends. "Younger Americans are ready to accept managed care."

THE ECONOMY
For Workers, Slim Wallets . . .
A Federal Reserve survey has found what workers already knew: The bulk of the American labor force is not winning sizable wage increases, even as employers are driven to extraordinary lengths to find qualified personnel. Indeed, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate slid to a fresh 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November as payrolls surged. But providing evidence that wage-related inflationary pressures remain largely in check, the Labor Department reported that worker productivity rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter, the best rate in five years, and that unit labor costs fell 0.2 percent. . . . The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its closely watched factory index declined to 54.4 last month, from 56 in October. It was the index's third fall in three months, but still showed a strong economy. . . . The outlook was bolstered by a report from the Conference Board that the index of leading indicators advanced 0.2 percent in October, the sixth consecutive increase. 

BONUSES
. . . For Wall St., Fat Times
With sharply rising stock markets and hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of takeovers, 1997 has been one of Wall Street's most prosperous years, even compared with the two fat years that preceded it. The 190 partners of Goldman, Sachs & Company, will make a minimum of about $4 million each, with star performers and top managers getting as much as $25 million, according to recruiting specialists. Over all, bonuses for Wall Street's top bankers and traders are expected to rise an average of 20 percent to 30 percent, senior bankers and recruitment consultants say, with more than 1,000 people getting bonuses of more than $1 million.
 
BANKING
A Midwestern Mega-Merger
In the latest big bank deal, the National City Corporation, which is based in Cleveland, agreed to acquire the First of America Bank Corporation of Kalamazoo, Mich. The $6.7 billion combination would create the nation's 13th-largest bank and be a significant step toward consolidation of the Midwest's relatively fragmented banking markets.
 
'MADE IN U.S.A.'
Upholding the Standard
The Federal Trade Commission, responding to strenuous pressure from organized labor, state officials, more than 200 members of Congress and a sizable chunk of American business, decided that products labeled "Made in U.S.A." must be just that, with only "negligible" foreign content. The commission voted 4 to 0 to keep a half-century-old standard, often interpreted to mean that 98 percent of a good's value must be American-made. Abandoned was a proposal to relax the standard so that goods could have worn the label if only 75 percent of their manufacturing costs were American-sourced. Big businesses that import a lot of components or goods would have benefited, at the expense of smaller companies that rely mainly on domestic sources.
 
TECHNOLOGY
Let's Go to the Videotape
Court administrators, seeking to speed up tedious trials, are installing computers and visual aids to make it easier for jurors to see and understand evidence. State Supreme Court in Manhattan, above, installed "Courtroom 2000," with laptops, flat-screen monitors and special video-imaging equipment similar to that used in the Oklahoma bombing and O. J. Simpson criminal trials. Officials hope to cut trial times in half. Lawyers will be able to highlight evidence as sports announcers would a football play, but video games for bored jurors are presumably not part of the package.
 
COMPANIES
Three New Leaders
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, H.J. Heinz's silver-haired chief executive, is stepping down after 18 years, to be succeeded by William R. Johnson, the company's president. Mr. O'Reilly, once widely admired, has come under criticism in recent years over his compensation and the performance of Heinz's earnings and stock. . . . Chrysler elevated a cost-cutter, Thomas T. Stallkamp, 51, to president, making him the heir apparent to the chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, 57. . . . Citing Asian problems, Singer, the Hong Kong-based producer of sewing machines and other household products, named a new chief executive, Stephen H. Goodman, a Bankers Trust New York managing director. The company said it would close some plants and dismiss 5,968 workers, or 28 percent of its labor force.
 
MARKETS
Overcoming October Angst
After their collapse in late October, stock prices have bounced back and now, after six consecutive winning sessions, are just 110 points shy of their August highs. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 326 points, to 8,149.13, last week, propelled by big gains in Merck, while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 33.46 points, to 1,633.90.
 
AUTOMOBILES
Keep on Trucking
Mom's in her Panzer; all's right with the world. Americans, long known for their love of the road, are turning increasingly to light trucks, even if they travel chiefly to the mall, the office or to school, rather than across the tundra or through the Sahara, as depicted in commercials. Last month, for the first time since the end of World War II, families bought more trucks -- including sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups -- than cars, industry experts said. Demand is rising from women, like Marcie Brogan of Detroit, above, who view the big vehicles as safer. Of course, the big vehicles guzzle gas and pollute more than cars do. Thanks largely to purchases of light trucks, auto makers enjoyed a 3.8 percent sales gain in November. Convinced that the high-profit trend will continue, they are racing to build light-truck factories and to convert car plants to truck production.

A Record Bailout

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

GRAPHIC: Photo: After days of tense negotiations, South Korea agreed to stringent terms for a rescue of its economy, the world's 11th-largest. A record $55 billion of loans will be available to the heavily indebted country. Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which is leading the bailout, called the plan "a decisive and welcome response to the country's present financial difficulties." Still, austerity moves including sharp cuts in public spending could triple the South Korean unemployment rate, cause a surge in bankruptcies and create other hardships. Here, schoolchildren in Seoul clutch American dollars that they are donating to aid the country's ailing economy. Washington said it would make as much as $5 billion available to back up the bailout, in the hope of stabilizing a country in which the United States has considerable economic and security interests. Among the beneficiaries will be American banks that will be repaid for huge sums they had lent on risky projects. (The Associated Press)

Waking Up -- Too Late -- in the Token Role

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
The conservative revolution started with the premise that a liberal orthodoxy had hijacked the culture and muzzled public debate. In truth, the architects of the right -- Irving Kristol, Paul Weyrich, Pat Robertson, William Buckley -- were advancing an orthodoxy of their own, one that cast liberalism as an evil to be wiped out at any cost. With conservatives controlling the national agenda -- and the word liberal reduced to a slur -- the goal is clearly within reach.
The movement succeeded largely because it was focused -- and very well financed. Over the last 15 years, foundations and think tanks like Olin, Heritage, Hoover and Scaife have spent tens of millions of dollars boosting their positions through books, papers and intellectuals-for-hire. The rush of new money created a class of professionals who live very well cranking out ideology masked as disinterested scholarship. 
 Recruits were offered money, power and celebrity in exchange for ideological allegiance. But defectors who want out of the far right and into the respectable middle are peddling a more sentimental story. One after another, they have portrayed themselves as principled dupes who found out only too late that they had fallen in with zealots. The political writer Michael Lind said this in last year's manifesto, "Up From Conservatism." David Brock, the former hit man for The American Spectator, said it again at his departure from the right last summer. But no one has gotten quite the mileage of the economist Glenn Loury, whose black skin and formidable intellect were weapons for the Reagan White House and the 80's think-tank set.
Mr. Loury broke with his colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute -- ostensibly for the racially "derogatory" tone of a book by Dinesh D'Souza -- two years ago. He disappeared but came blazing back last month with essays in three publications, explaining his conversion. He turned right, he claims, after being excluded by black liberals for writing that the underclass was less a product of racism than of moral decay. After a decade on the right, he fled left again when he suddenly discovered that his chums had a dictatorial "party line" on race and would brook no dissent.
This is too pat to be true, especially for a man of Mr. Loury's considerable intelligence. Race-baiting, Willie Hortonizing and homophobia were part of the package from the start and actually in fuller use in the 80's than now. That Mr. Loury failed to detect a "conservative party line" on race while cozying up to the Reagan Administration -- and as a star on the conservative lecture circuit -- is simply implausible. It seems likely that he ignored the evidence of his senses to embrace the celebrity he considered his due as one of the first black stars on the right.
Along with Clarence Thomas and the economist Thomas Sowell, Mr. Loury had both the good and bad fortune to be in the first wave. Desperate to immunize itself against the charge of racism, the conservative establishment provided enormous professional rewards to these three. These men suffered grueling and unfair abuse from black liberals who cast them as "race traitors." But judging from Mr. Loury's experience, the most tortuous part of all was playing the role of the token -- the lone black person in the room who is scripted to smile and nod his assent at the appropriate moment.
Even among liberals, African-Americans risk being patronized, pigeonholed and reduced to a kind of lawn ornament. Mr. Loury suffered this, but seems to have taken several years to realize it. The insight seemed to leap out in a 1990 speech, later reported in The New Yorker, during which he berated the audience for seeing only his black skin and taking his presence as proof that conservative policy was "nonracist." "If by some magic I were suddenly to become white," he railed, "my brilliant, perceptive, and courageous insights would . . . be reduced to pedestrian, commonplace complaints, of little personal comfort to you."
The realization that he had been used in this classically repugnant manner was clearly painful. It cost him friends, peace of mind and shaded everything that followed. For Mr. Loury to now cast his "conversion" in sterile policy terms is to tell less than the full truth.

HEADLINE: Agents to Go Undercover In Detection Of Hiring Bias

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that it will employ undercover "testers" in two pilot projects to detect discrimination in hiring, particularly at the entry level.
In announcing that the commission will take a more active role in ferreting out job discrimination, officials said the need for such testers had increased because new welfare-to-work laws were bringing a large number of new employees, many of them minorities and women, into the marketplace. 
 The practice of using testers -- people who have equivalent qualifications but who differ in characteristics like race -- is a long-standing one in civil rights law, particularly in the areas of housing and money-lending. The Supreme Court upheld the use of testers in 1982 in housing-discrimination cases.
But the technique has been used less often to establish hiring discrimination, a complex arena in which it can be difficult to prove bias because hiring can be so subjective.
The commission said that it had let contracts to two private groups -- the Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington and the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago -- for a combined total of $200,000 to "study the use of employment testers to detect hiring discrimination."
The commission, which is the Federal agency responsible for prosecuting discrimination cases, said in 1990 that it would consider claims of job discrimination originating with testers, and called on civil rights groups to use the practice more. And again in 1991, the commission chairman, Evan J. Kemp Jr., repeated that the agency had received so many allegations of employment discrimination that it would accept charges from civil rights groups that used testers to uncover discrimination.
But the commission's announcement, made on Friday, that it would pay for pilot projects with testers marked its first active entry into the field of hiring. Generally, the commission does not initiate cases, but relies on citizens to file complaints.
Gilbert Casellas, chairman of the bipartisan commission, which unanimously supported the action, said in a statement, "If we can shed light on barriers to fair hiring in entry-level jobs, which are the gateway to self-sufficiency and economic independence, we will have made an important step in assuring equal opportunity for everyone."
Civil rights analysts hailed the move. "It's about time," said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington-based group that frequently prosecutes such cases. "Our long experience in fair housing has demonstrated repeatedly that testing is one of the most effective methodologies that you can use to expose racial stereotypes."
But other legal experts said they expected employers to challenge the legality of testers in job cases, just as landlords challenged the legality of testers in housing cases. Testers who pose for jobs or housing can create questions of entrapment, and employers can contend that applicants who are turned down are not harmed -- because they are only testers and not, in reality, people seeking jobs. The practice could also draw criticism from Republicans in Congress who are trying to abolish affirmative action programs.
The commission has not yet picked the cities where the tests are to be conducted or decided whether to test for discrimination based on race, age, sex, national origin or disability. Nor has it decided whether to send the testers to employers in the private sector or government.
Ellen Vargyas, legal counsel to the commission, said that the purpose was to try to find problems that job applicants might never know because they were unaware of who else had applied for a job or why they were rejected. But she cautioned that this was not a "gotcha" project, saying that the commission was more interested in learning about how employers discriminate rather than which employers discriminate. If the commission uncovers discrimination, though, she said, it will pursue it.
"With all the emphasis of putting people to work, of welfare-to-work, we know there are problems out there in hiring," Ms. Vargyas said. "We want to educate ourselves and the business community. People tend to hire people like themselves."
The commission resolved 106,000 discrimination cases in the fiscal year that ended in September, but Ms. Vargyas had no breakdown of how many were related to entry-level hiring. Of the cases resolved, the commission found that 11 percent had merit and the plaintiffs received a total of $178 million. In 60 percent of the cases, no discrimination was found. The rest were dismissed for administrative reasons like late filing.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
First the Heisman, Then Pink Slips

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Seated at dinner in a restaurant here one evening last week, a young man in short-cropped blond hair and wire-rim glasses, which lent an academic look to him, was approached by one of his fellow patrons.
"May I get your autograph?" the second man asked. "My son would be thrilled." 
 "Sure," said the young man. "What's his name?"
When the other man left with his request satisfied, the young man turned to his dinner companion. "This doesn't happen too often," he said, as though trying to allay any wrong impressions.
It doesn't happen often anymore, anyway. Not to Gino Torretta, who, though scholarly appearing from the chin up, has the thick neck, and, as was obvious beneath his blue shirt, the broad, sloping shoulders and the considerable chest of a professional football quarterback.
Five years ago this month, Gino Torretta, quarterback for the University of Miami's defending national champions, was named the winner of the Heisman Trophy, emblematic of the best college football player in the nation. He was at the top of the heap, just as Peyton Manning or Ryan Leaf or Charles Woodson might be when the 1997 Heisman winner is announced on Saturday.
Now, after having been released or waived by five National Football League teams in five years -- the last was the Indianapolis Colts last month -- and having completed just five passes in the N.F.L., Torretta is an unemployed quarterback who has been depicted as the ultimate journeyman. And, at age 27, the prospects of his realizing his dreams and expectations of a great pro career -- of an even commonplace pro career, for that matter -- seem to be growing ever more distant.
He has played in just two regular-season games. In one of those games, for the Vikings in his rookie year, he got in for the last play of the last game of the 1993 season. "I handed off," he said, with a wan smile. "But I was thrilled to get into the game. I knew that next season would be a season when I could shine."
It was not to be. The Vikings released him the following August.
This came as a surprise to Torretta, even though he was drafted by the Vikings in the seventh round, the 192d pick in 1993, after quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer were the first and second picks in the draft, and two other quarterbacks were also chosen ahead of Torretta. His arm and his mobility were suspect.
"I couldn't believe the draft when it happened," said Torretta. "I had a 26-2 record in college, and was on two national championship teams. But it didn't matter. I had confidence in myself."
The Vikings offered Torretta a three-year contract not substantially above the minimum, which was $100,000 a year. "I believed I could do better than that once I proved myself in about a year and so my agent negotiated for a one-year contract" at the minimum salary.
"This was just a start," he said. "I saw myself playing something like 10 years and eventually making enough money to set me up for the rest of my life."
Two months after Minnesota released him, the Lions, needing a fill-in for an injured quarterback, signed him. Torretta suited up for Detroit, but did not play. The next summer he played for the Rhein Fire in Dusseldorf, Germany, Detroit's team in the World Football League. He returned to the Lions, who released him that September.
"That was my lowest point," Torretta said. "When you get released for the second time. . . ." The thought trailed off. Now the bloom was off the rose, as it were.
He called Bill Walsh, who was then at Stanford, and whom Torretta admired growing up near Oakland. Torretta asked if he could work out for him. Walsh agreed.
"I want you to tell me if I can play in the N.F.L.," Torretta recalled saying. "If you don't think I can, then I can take it. I have a life after football. I can do other things. But I respect your opinion. I know you'll be honest with me." Torretta worked out for a week, and then came Walsh's assessment: "Gino, I believe you can play in this league."
Two months later, Torretta was signed by San Francisco, as insurance when Steve Young was hurt, in early November. Two weeks later Young returned, and Torretta was gone. He was re-signed and released three more times by the 49ers, under similar circumstances. The last time was on Nov. 19, 1996.
 
At Last, Torretta Gets a Chance
Two days later, Seattle, whose coach, Dennis Erickson, was Torretta's college coach, signed him. Mirer, the first-string quarterback, was hurt and unable to play; John Friesz, next in line, broke a bone in his leg and was out.
And so against the Raiders, in the last game of the season, the Seahawks' started quarterback No. 3, Stan Gelbaugh. But he tore a groin muscle on the second series of downs. There was no one else. Erickson signaled for Torretta to enter the game. Torretta played the entire game and Seattle won, 28-21. He threw one touchdown pass, had one pass intercepted and completed 5 of 16 passes, for 41 yards.
"I didn't think I played well," Torretta said, "but I played well enough to win. That's how I think of myself. Someone who can go in and win a game."
Erickson said: "I thought he was excellent under difficult circumstances. He'd been with us only a few weeks -- he hardly even knew the plays. I was sending in plays in the language of what we did at Miami."
Nonetheless, Torretta was released shortly after the season ended. He was signed by Seattle again early this year, and was released again.
"It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do," said Erickson. "If you know Gino, you have to like him. He's smart -- like he picked up on the plays so quickly -- and he's a hard worker and all his teammates like him. But there's just a numbers game that he has fallen prey to time and time again. In this instance, we thought that Jon Kitna, who was our third quarterback, was going to be the quarterback of our future.
"But I know Gino can play in this league, maybe not as a star, but surely as an insurance quarterback. It's just a matter of time that he finds the right situation -- if he has the will to hang in there."
The release by Seattle on Oct. 28 was followed by Torretta's swift stay with the Colts. In all, Torretta has been signed and released eight times by N.F.L. teams. But he can, after five frustrating seasons, look at a cup that is half-full, rather than half-empty.
"I've been vested," he said. "The average career in the N.F.L. is what -- less than three years."
But the disappointment clearly takes up the rest of that half-empty cup. "I see guys who never had anywhere near the success I had in college get opportunities that I've never had," said Torretta, who at 6 feet 2 inches and 220 pounds is about 10 pounds lighter than his college playing days. "But I'm not giving up. I believe one day I'll get my chance. And I'm going to be ready. I work out almost every day -- I jog, I do wind sprints, I do my weight training -- and then I check the Internet, or I watch 'SportsCenter' on ESPN to see if there've been any changes in quarterback situations on any of the N.F.L. teams."
That primarily means, injury. If a quarterback goes down, a slot opens up, even temporarily.
Last week Torretta learned that Washington Redskins quarterback Gus Frerotte was out for the season after suffering a broken hip in the Nov. 30 game against the St. Louis Rams. Torretta's agent, Leigh Steinberg, contacted the Redskins. The Redskins were interested. "Then I heard that they had signed Jamie Martin," said Torretta. "Sure, it's disappointing. But what can you do? You go on."
This is the world of the backup quarterback, or the backup to the backup, and more fact-of-life than vulturous.
When the three top quarterbacks for Indianapolis all suffered injury, a call on Nov. 11 was put through by the Colts to Torretta: "Hurry." Torretta was, as now, home in Miami. With his suitcase still not unpacked from his last football foray, Toretta jumped on a plane for Indianapolis.
"Why change clothes?" he said, with a smile. "There's no dress code in the N.F.L. locker room, and as long as I have clean underwear, no one cares."
When one of the Colts' other quarterbacks was given medical clearance to play, Torretta did not suit up for the game. He was released the following day, six days after joining the team.
So he returned to the city of his greatest triumphs, where a friend allows him to live in the penthouse he owns in an oceanside apartment building. It is a week-to-week arrangement, or until Torretta finds another football team.
Torretta doesn't spend all his time on the Internet. He and his fiancee, Bernadette Carney, plan to marry next summer. He is a licensed stockbroker, driving most mornings from Miami to the office of Slavic Mutual Funds Management Corporation in Boca Raton.
 
He Has the Smarts, But Maybe Not the Arm
 In college, Torretta not only made first-team all-American, but was also named to the all-Academic football team. He received his undergraduate degree in three and a half years and is six classes short of a master's degree in business.
"After all the pro football disappointments," said his friend, Marty Margulies, whose penthouse Torretta occupies, "the exceptional thing about Gino is how he's kept his perspective. I'm amazed at how he maintains this even keel."
 In Pinole, Calif., where Torretta grew up, there is another side. It is where Torretta's family owns a bar.
"And sometimes you get a smart aleck in the place who makes a remark about Gino," said Torretta's eldest brother, Gary. The remark is sometimes about Gino being "a bum."
"I tell them, 'How many guys you know personally who ever played in the N.F.L.?' " said Gary. "He says none. And I say that I know Gino will get his chance, that he deserves it. But I still have to hold back from getting physical."
Why hasn't Torretta made it?
"He's gotten so close on several occasions," said Steinberg, Torretta's agent. "He just hasn't had good luck. It seems he just gets beaten out by a hair every time."
Torretta, though, has carried a double-edged reputation since his junior year in college. One N.F.L. team scout, who asked not to be identified, gave this appraisal of Torretta:
"The positive is that he's very smart, and so he's able to pick up a team's system faster than most, and he's durable and has proved in college that he can lead a winning team. The negatives are that he does not have even average N.F.L. arm strength and he lacks mobility. You can get away with some things in college that you can't in the pros."
Torretta is, of course, aware of these criticisms.
"I can throw as well as most quarterbacks in the league," he said. "I don't have the cannon that a Jeff George or Brett Favre or Dan Marino have, but not many do. I know that my accuracy was once questioned, too. And early on when I was trying too hard to prove myself, I'd jam passes that I shouldn't have. I don't do that anymore."
Erickson agreed. "I think Gino has an above-average N.F.L. arm. And it has improved considerably in the last five years. As for his mobility, he's not going to establish any running records, but he is agile enough to avoid tacklers, like most quarterbacks."
Torretta is also aware of the history of Heisman Trophy winners. Some have been pro busts, to be sure, but not all. "There are seven or eight of them in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, out of about 61," said Torretta. "That's a pretty decent record." However, he is aware of Heisman-winning quarterbacks, like Gary Beban and Pat Sullivan and Terry Baker, who did not make it in the N.F.L.
"But they went on to successful business careers," said Torretta. "And I don't think they put in the effort of years that I'm putting in. But guys like Roger Staubach and Jim Plunkett were very successful in the pros. And I take heart in guys who've been around for some time before they get a chance, like Plunkett, even like Steve Young."
One recent morning Torretta was driving in his black Lexus from Miami to his brokerage office in Boca Raton. He was speaking on the car phone when there were repeated technical snags. In some ways, this seemed a metaphor for Torretta's pro football career: not quite completed. Frustratingly interrupted. Yet not quite dead, for Torretta finished the conversation at his office. But his last words on the car phone were: "Sometimes like this, driving along the road, I've imagined that one day I come back and lead a team to the Super Bowl. Wouldn't that be -- ." Crackle, crackle, crackle.

HEADLINE: The Clinton Agenda: Preview of His Goals For the Coming Years

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President Clinton conducted on Thursday by reporters from The New York Times, from a transcript supplied by the White House. 

 
Education
We've won the initial battles, but we're not there on the national standards in testing; we're not finished with providing educational technology to all the schools. I still believe we should be working to try to deal with the infrastructure of our educational institutions, even though we didn't succeed on that.
I think that it is very important to identify school districts that are, on balance, not functioning well, and try to create an entirely different environment with more school choice, more charter schools, end of social promotion, adequate use of standards in testing.
 
Families
And I'm proud of what we did on child care and the welfare reform bill. But we need to do more there, with a broader family leave and a number of other issues.
 
Health Care
We're about to have this Medicare reform commission to look at what can be done to add more life to the Medicare trust fund and structure it in a way that will guarantee quality affordable health care to people who are Medicare eligible. I think, in addition to that, I think we should take on the issue of the long-term stability of the Social Security system and, as I said earlier, ways that we can provide supplemental opportunities for people to save for their own retirement, so they'll have Social Security as a threshold, but have something on top of that. I think we have to look at ways to continue to expand health care coverage.
 
Environment
I am convinced that we can demonstrate to the American people that we can substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and fulfill our global environmental responsibilities as well as our responsibilities to our own people without giving up economic growth, but it will require a very disciplined, organized, coordinated effort to do it.
So I intend to do that. We still haven't passed the Superfund reauthorization and we still have too many toxic waste sites out there that are really causing a problem that is not only environmental but is economic to the places where they exist.
 
Food Safety
If you imagine over the next 20 years, it is inconceivable that you won't have more and more and more volumes of food crossing national lines in trade, and we have to be able to guarantee to the American people that we have a safe food system.
 
Biomedical Research
I do believe that in scientific terms, the last 50 years will be seen as an age of physics and an age of space exploration. I think the next 50 years will very likely to be characterized predominantly as an age of biology and the exploration of the human organism, especially with the completion of the human genome project, which I think will literally explode what we know about how to deal with health issues.
 
Race and Citizen Service
My goal with that is not only to have some policy prescriptions which will help, some of which I've outlined, and to help people try to come to terms with the things that we're fighting about like affirmative action, but in a larger sense, to create an ethic of service across racial lines so that when we begin this new century and when I leave office and go off into the sunset, the typical American will have at least three opportunities for constructive engagement with people with other races -- one at work, one at school and one in community service.
 
Foreign Policy
I hope we can get the Senate to support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We're going to have a protocol at the Biological Weapons Convention which will build on what we did with the Chemical Weapons Convention, which was ratified this year by the Congress, to help to strengthen our hand in dealing with the biological and chemical weapons fight.
I'm going to China to continue to try to work out our approach with them, which is engagement with integrity, and I think it's working well. I hope to have an impact, a positive impact on the difficulties between Greece and Turkey, and relations between India and Pakistan. I intend to go to India and Pakistan next year if all goes well. I hope to activate our Africa Trade Initiative, and I'm going to Africa.
And I feel very good that we are in better shape than we were six, eight months ago with our peace efforts in Bosnia. I'd like to see them successfully concluded. I think we've got a good chance now to see a successful peace in Northern Ireland because of what's going on there. And I'd like to see, if Russia ratifies Start II. I'd like to go back to President Yeltsin and finish the Start III process as we continue to dramatically lower the nuclear threat.

HEADLINE: Intense Lobbying Against Global Warming Treaty

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
If the Clinton Administration is struggling to strike a deal on global warming at talks in Kyoto, Japan, that is partly because warring domestic interest groups have spent many months -- and millions of dollars -- on highly effective lobbying campaigns designed to limit the White House's options.
Environmental groups, traditionally closely allied with the Administration, have succeeded in convincing the public that the threat of climate change caused by emissions of greenhouse gases is a settled scientific reality that must be confronted head-on. They say the Administration's proposal for a treaty is too mild, and that a European alternative would be better. 
 But powerful business interests have emphasized the economic risks and the need to bring developing countries into any binding new treaty, arguments that have strongly influenced the Senate, where any pact must be ratified. They say the Administration is going too far and too fast, the more so since the Third World is balking at a bigger role.
The private-sector lobbying, more intense, prolonged and costly than usual in the realm of diplomacy, has reached a fevered pitch this week in Kyoto, but it has been playing out in Washington for years.
The antagonists include big corporations with revenues larger than the economies of little nations, labor unions with more members than some countries' armed forces, industrial trade associations with headquarters grander than embassies, and a corps of professional environmentalists that rivals the diplomatic corps in polish and pinstripes.
"It is as if a large chunk of the lobbying community from the capital has been transported from Washington to Kyoto for two weeks," Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, marveled in a telephone interview from Kyoto, where he is an observer.
Although the lobbyists are in Kyoto in force, they are relegated to the sidelines. "Every night the U.S. delegation will come in and brief the 100 or so industry nongovernmental organizations who are present," said Constance Holmes, a lobbyist in Kyoto for the Global Climate Coalition, which represents major United States industries. "They brief the U.S. business community for half an hour, and then they brief the environmental community for half an hour."
For the past two years, more than 150 nations have been trying to devise a new, stricter treaty to replace the largely voluntary one that they agreed upon five years ago in Rio de Janeiro. It is intended to set binding limits on emissions of greenhouse gases by industrial nations.
Because confronting global warming means altering energy patterns throughout society, a solution to the emerging risk of climate change affects practically every conceivable interest group.
Opposing a binding treaty are car makers and corn farmers, steel mills and oil refineries, electricity producers and the coal miners who stoke their boilers. They claim that cutbacks in emissions would raise energy costs sharply, rippling through the economy, creating inflation and destroying jobs or sending them overseas.
Favoring a treaty are the main national environmental groups, who have spent a decade putting the issue on the global agenda. Among their most influential allies are businesses involved in conservation and renewable energy.
"This is more than the environmental community has done on any single issue in 10 years," said Philip Clapp, head of the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group set up three years ago to organize sophisticated media campaigns on major environmental issues.
But Eileen Claussen, who was an Administration climate negotiator until she left the State Department recently to work as an environmental consultant, said that the industry campaign in Congress was especially effective.
"By targeting the Congress, the industries responsible for the advertising campaign have widened the rift between the two branches," Ms. Claussen said. "This has had the effect of pulling the United States farther away from most other countries in the negotiations, and hardening its position on what would constitute an acceptable target and on what should be required of developing countries."
For months, the news media have carried a steady drumbeat of advertising on the climate issue. The Global Climate Information Project, an ad hoc industry coalition, announced in September that it would spend $13 million on advertisements to defeat a treaty. Rather than attacking the scientific argument, the group's advertisements used the threat of price increases and a fairness issue: that many developing countries whose emissions of greenhouse gases are growing rapidly would not be held to the same obligations as the industrial nations.
The advertisements echo the industry's slogan: "It's not global, and it won't work."
Environmental groups swung into action, calling the advertisements misleading. They noted that details of the treaty were still being negotiated, that the Administration was calling for developing countries to play a role and that economists were divided on what the economic consequences were likely to be.
The environmental groups demanded that CNN, the only national network that would air the advertisement during news programs, stop running it. At first the network complied, but it later reversed itself.
Although environmental groups have not been able to afford an advertising campaign on the scale of the industry group, the Sierra Club produced a television spot recently that began with a picture of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, whom it called an influential oil cartel leader, and castigated auto companies for producing gas guzzlers. And the National Council of Churches produced a spot featuring the poet Maya Angelou making a moral argument to save the planet. It is being aired free of charge, largely on Christian broadcasting stations, as a public service announcement.
There is little sign that the industry's campaign has moved the public. In a New York Times poll last month, only 6 percent of adults surveyed by telephone nationwide recalled seeing industry advertisements opposing a treaty. Of those who recalled the advertisements, two-thirds said they were not influenced, and the remainder were as likely to have been swayed in favor as against the treaty.
But that does not matter, said Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in media campaigns.
"The goal of these sorts of campaigns is not ordinarily to change attitudes on the part of the public," Ms. Jamieson said. "It is to persuade the legislative body that you are a player. You are involved, and you have ads on. And thus, in the next election campaign, you will have an effect by ultimately using advertising against them." It is in Congress, in fact, where the industry campaign appears to have the edge.
Earlier this year, business groups persuaded the Senate to pass a resolution insisting that developing countries like China play a bigger role in addressing the problem. The resolution was sponsored by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, where coal dominates the economy, and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican who adamantly opposes a new treaty.
Their argument is exactly the one the industry has been pressing in its advertising, and by October, when the President announced the United States negotiating policy, he, too, insisted that a treaty must include a role for key developing countries.
But the Byrd-Hagel resolution, though passed unanimously, left an out. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a treaty advocate, persuaded Mr. Byrd to state on the Senate floor that he did not demand that developing countries take on the same obligations as the developed world.
In Kyoto, lobbyists from both sides said as the talks continued that the issue most likely to block a compromise was the question of what role developing countries should play in controlling global warming.
An important component of the industry's success was its early decision to get organized labor involved. When the climate task force of the National Association of Manufacturers met earlier this year to map out a strategy for broadening opposition to a new treaty, it decided to look to the labor movement.
The most obvious ally for industry was the United Mine Workers of America. Coal miners hold just 80,000 jobs in the United States, a number that is shrinking even faster than emissions of greenhouse gases are rising. But because coal gives off more carbon dioxide than any other fuel, a treaty to limit emissions of greenhouse gases would hit that union hardest.
And coal miners' clout in the ranks of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is far disproportionate to their share of the working population. Richard L. Trumka, a former United Mine Workers president and now the secretary-treasurer of the labor federation, has played a major role in presenting the coal miners' case on behalf of all labor.
The labor federation's stance carries special weight these days, after its recent defeat of the Clinton Administration on trade policy.
Mr. Trumka used blunt words when he spelled out for the White House the views of the labor movement on the climate change talks.
If some countries are exempt from the emission-control targets in the treaty, he said, "We think our Government negotiators need to be prepared to walk away from Kyoto without a treaty in hand."

HEADLINE: As Asia Stumbles, U.S. Stays in Economic Stride

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Labor Department's announcement on Friday that the nation's work force had swelled by a whopping 404,000 in November killed, rather abruptly, virtually all the talk that the American economy was slowing down.
While various dangers certainly hang over the economy, it appears to have actually gained strength in the month that the Asian contagion spread to South Korea and concern grew that a worldwide slowdown might be developing. 
 "We have to lift our estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter," Edward Hyman, president and chief economist of the ISI Group, acknowledged to his clients on Friday, soon after the job numbers appeared. This bit of backtracking was evident among some of Wall Street's more pessimistic forecasters. Mr. Hyman said his new higher estimate would soon be forthcoming.
For this holiday season, the robust economy of the last year seems undiminished, and many economists predict that the gross domestic product is likely to grow by at least as much in the fourth quarter as it did in the third: an annual rate of 3.3 percent.
"The economy is hot; there is no doubt about that," said David Wyss, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting and forecasting service.
Next year is the new point of concern. The Asian crisis will undoubtedly have some effect. Several economists estimate that it will clip half a percentage point off next year's growth, among them Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research group. Still, if the decline is from a level that is higher than previously expected, he said, that leaves a respectable growth rate.
Apart from Asia, other dangers also loom. Consumers, already burdened by a record level of debt, could pull back on their spending, which has accounted for most of the economic strength in the last 18 months. And a sharp decline in the currently lofty stock prices would undermine the confidence that has kept spending strong.
Still, many economists who share Mr. Reischauer's view would welcome a slowdown in growth. For them, an economy that expands by more than 2.5 percent a year soon produces shortages of workers and goods, pushing up wages and prices. The Federal Reserve then steps in, raising interest rates to slow the economy and reduce inflation. Most of the recessions since World War II have occurred after the Federal Reserve brought on too much of a slowdown.
Wages are indeed rising for millions of workers. The strong job growth and low unemployment rate -- 4.6 percent last month and less than 5 percent since early this year -- have produced the sort of labor shortages that in the past have bolstered inflation. That happened in the late 1980's, prompting the Federal Reserve to step in. A recession followed in 1990.
But this period of growth, now in its seventh year, is different. The wage increases have been small so far, largely because job insecurity and weak unions have increasingly diluted labor's bargaining power. That is evident in the rate of voluntary resignations -- people who resign to take new jobs, presumably at better pay. As unemployment falls, the so-called "quit" rate normally rises, but it has recently fallen.
"People are still reeling from a dozen years of downsizing and uncertainty," said Irwin Kellner, an economist at Hofstra University.
A rising productivity rate in the last year is also taking the pressure off corporate America to raise prices. That is because workers are, in effect, paying for their wage increases by producing more goods and services each hour they are on the job. The extra revenue from selling these additional goods and services has helped to maintain profits without price increases.
Finally, the Asian crisis is starting to hold prices down, discouraging the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in keeping with its traditional view that an "overheating" economy -- one growing at more than 2.5 percent a year -- and a falling unemployment rate inevitably lead to rising wages and prices. "Unemployment and inflation have become disconnected," said David Collander, an economic historian at Middlebury College in Vermont.
The Asian crisis dampens inflation in two ways. Asian currencies are falling in relation to the dollar, making American products more expensive in those currencies. To compete, United States exporters are cutting their prices in dollars. Imports from Asia, on the other hand, are less expensive in dollars, also dampening inflation. And the process will most likely spread to the pricing of American-made goods that compete with Asian imports -- electronics and auto parts, for example.
More broadly, rising exports have been a source of the strong economic growth over the last two years, particularly exports to Asia. But with Asian demand falling, the first evidence of an export decline showed up in Government trade data released last month. Just as troubling, with demand at home weakening, Asian companies are trying to sell more of their products in the United States, and imports are beginning to rise, threatening to shrink sales, profits and employment at American companies that make competing products.
Asia, of course, is not the whole story. A decline in growth of half a percentage point -- from a level of 3.3 percent or more -- is not that much damage, as Mr. Wyss and Mr. Reischauer point out.
Consumer spending might, in the end, be the key factor. Pushed up by a spectacular burst of borrowing over the last two years, it has been the chief reason for the nation's strong economic growth. But Americans have accumulated consumer and mortgage debt equal to more than 90 percent of their disposable income, a record. Personal bankruptcies are also at a record high.
In the past, when consumer borrowing and spending slowed, Government borrowing and spending picked up the slack. But Government borrowing has declined, as the shrinking budget deficit shows, and so has Government spending. Indeed, the job creation in November occurred in every sector of the private economy, but Government job growth was nil.
"Consumer debt cannot rise indefinitely," said Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute. "If anything goes wrong, like a drop in stock prices or in income, then consumer spending would unwind."

HEADLINE: A Mellow Clinton at Ease in His Role

SERIES: ON THE RECORD -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton's friends and associates marveled for years at the zest with which he delved into the minutiae of policy and the latest blips of opinion polls. Now, major figures in Government say they are struck by the degree that Mr. Clinton drifts into soliloquies about another longtime passion, golf.
That Mr. Clinton's restless, voracious mind is wandering to the golf course is cited by some of his closest associates as a small yet telling example of how the Presidency is not engaging him in the way it did during his first term. 
 In dozens of interviews, some of Mr. Clinton's closest friends and advisers inside and outside the White House, as well as authorities on Presidential politics, agreed: Even with three years remaining, there was a conspicuous sense that Mr. Clinton is no longer consumed by big ideas and the prospect of major battles ahead. Liberals and moderates alike described Mr. Clinton as trapped in a risk-averse, aimless Administration of his own making.
Yet the portrait of a listless, distracted Chief Executive conceals a more complex reality. Mr. Clinton is far more in command and comfortable in his role. With more than 30 years of elections behind him, Mr. Clinton also believes that many of his goals have been achieved, and he is less urgent and more mindful of the realities of divided Government.
In an interview with The New York Times late this week, Mr. Clinton countered his critics by previewing what he described as an ambitious agenda for the next three years on matters ranging from education to health care to the environment to foreign policy. If the policy question is "a big issue," he said, "I'm just as involved as I ever was." Excerpts, page 26.
The President conceded that anyone in his job would be captive to the times. "Presidents are the custodians of the time in which they live as well as the instruments of the visions and dreams they have," Mr. Clinton said, sitting beneath a portrait of George Washington in the Oval Office. "So the first thing I had to start with was, you know, we don't have a war, we don't have a depression, we don't have a cold war.
"But," he went on, "what we do have is a breathtaking change going on as the economy and the societies in which we live become more globalized, as the information technology revolution continues to accelerate and as the world faces a whole new set of security threats as well as opportunities."
Others in Mr. Clinton's circle describe something of a second Eisenhower era, an era of economic good times and don't-rock-the-boat domestic policy. Indeed, Mr. Clinton has been frequently indulging in bouts of syrupy nostalgia and has slowed the pace of his day to allow more time for reflection -- whether on weighty matters or on golf.
"It's golf, golf, golf -- interspersed with politics," said Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. Referring to the President's change in focus, he said, "He realizes you can't do everything at once; he's willing to accept smaller, incremental victories."
Further blurring his focus, Mr. Clinton is distracted by a flood of accusations about fund-raising abuses in his last campaign that are certain to dog him for the remainder of his tenure. As an added complication, Mr. Clinton finds himself spending a substantial amount of time traveling to fund-raisers to help pay off the Democratic Party's huge debts.
Another new reality for Mr. Clinton is that he is surrounded by a restless staff of aides who have either grown bored with their jobs or have been at the White House for far shorter tenures than the President. Some of his associates described a cautious White House where there are fewer sharp ideological debates than in the first term.
"He has a great deal of political capital -- there's no point in hoarding it until it's too late to use it," said Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary and friend of Mr. Clinton's for nearly 30 years. Dick Morris, the architect of Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign last year, has been more critical of the President since he resigned in August 1996 in a scandal involving his relationship with a prostitute. "Everybody wondered after the election whether he'd go to the left or to the right," Mr. Morris said. "Nobody thought he'd go to sleep."
Asked why several people described a sense of aimlessness in the White House, Mr. Clinton shrugged and said, "Beats me," and recited a list of accomplishments this year, including the balanced budget agreement, an increase in education aid, reforms at the Food and Drug Administration and the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Returning to the original question about people portraying him as aimless, Mr. Clinton said: "I can't answer that. I honestly don't know why that is. But all I can tell you is I'll do the very best I can to disabuse them of it every day I'm here."
 
A Fourth Term
A String of Goals, But No Single Priority
Aimless or not, there is wide agreement that Mr. Clinton is embarking on a new, uncharted stage of his Presidency, one that some Democrats described as a fourth term because the past five years can be divided into distinct periods: the shakedown cruise of 1993-94 in which the White House swerved from crisis to crisis, culminating in the collapse of the President's ambitious health care proposal and the Republican takeover of Congress; the starkly partisan confrontation over the budget in the next two years, and Mr. Clinton's political recovery and cooperation with the Republican-controlled Congress in 1996 and 1997.
Mr. Clinton is still devising an approach for this new fourth term. Aides said the President was constructing a new definition of the term "social security," by trying to stitch together a variety of medium-sized policies aimed at families into one big thought.
Glancing at notes he had jotted down, Mr. Clinton said in the interview that "there will be a lot to do" -- and spoke of several goals for the next three years.
Mr. Clinton first cited education, saying he would continue to push for national standards in testing, the rebuilding of schools and technology for schools. He then moved on to describing ways to improve family life, like "broader family leave" measures, efforts to expand health care coverage, extend the Social Security system and improve race relations. He also previewed an agenda on the environment, food safety, biomedical research and a "huge foreign policy agenda" designed to "create a global system where the democracies of the world are cooperating more with shared markets."
Prospects for some items on the President's plate, like education reform, could be threatened by partisan contention on Capitol Hill. Others may not be easily achievable; restructuring Social Security, for example, could be a 10-year project. But other measures might be more popular on Capitol Hill, including family leave proposals and biomedical research.
In some areas, like food safety, Mr. Clinton could act through regulatory means. He might have a harder time on his ambitious foreign policy goals like bringing peace to Bosnia and improving relations with China.
Mr. Clinton did not cite any single issue as his overriding priority for the next three years. And one after another, White House advisers shrugged rather than even try to surmise how the second Clinton term would be remembered.
Asked for the biggest issue Mr. Clinton would tackle next year, Robert Squier, a veteran media consultant who attends regular political meetings with the President, replied: "I honestly don't know. I'm not sure he does either."
Robert S. Strauss, an elder statesman in the Democratic Party who advises Mr. Clinton from time to time, said: "I think he's got a lot of problems ahead. Within and without the White House he's not long in talent around him. Everybody's going to want to take a shot at him in the next election. With two years to go, why not pile on? But he's not going to be an easy mark; this guy's smart and he's tough."
Vice President Al Gore, when asked aboard Air Force Two late one night recently to comment on the state of the Clinton Presidency, did not have to be reminded of the outpouring of criticism recently that Mr. Clinton had already become a lame duck. Mocking such talk, he flapped his arms and squawked, "Quack, quack, quack."
Mr. Gore then returned to his cabin to contemplate the question. Several minutes later, just after the plane landed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, an aide returned with Mr. Gore's hand-written response: "I remember when some columnists and pundits decided in late 1994 that the President might no longer be 'relevant.' They even asked him at a press conference whether he thought he had any remaining relevance. Less than a year later he had single-handedly forced both houses of Congress to back down and re-open the Government -- twice -- abandon most of their 'Contract With America,' and instead adopt virtually all of his priority measures.
"Anyone," Mr. Gore continued, "who decides in late 1997 that the President's 'relevance' is in any doubt is making the same silly mistake all over again."
Still, there is a palpable sense, even among some of the President's closest aides, that Mr. Clinton is searching for his proper role. One aide explained that a sleepy Administration was inevitable. He said Presidents and their lieutenants function best in crises. (The tensions with Iraq did, briefly, force Mr. Clinton into a mode of high alert.)
"What you have over there are wartime generals," the aide said, pointing to the West Wing, "not peacetime generals."
 
'The Beige Bunch'
For Big Initiatives, Little Incentive
Perhaps the best gauge of the mellower tone is in the transformation of the meetings that take place in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House residence. In the two years leading up to the 1996 election, the meetings were the nerve center of the Clinton White House, where the President and his advisers plotted campaign strategy and, by extension, virtually every important policy move.
But those free-wheeling, hours-long sessions are history. While they still occur, they are no longer every week, they usually do not last more than an hour, and they have largely lost their luster without a campaign or a burning issue to galvanize the staff, several aides said.
"Most people don't find it useful," said one of the regulars, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's more of a sentimental journey for the President."
Some Presidential advisers expressed concern that, at least in public perception, Mr. Clinton is becoming the kind of "in-box President" he accused George Bush of being in the 1992 campaign. "They have nothing to say to America," Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas said in July 1992. "Nothing to be for. No record to run on. No vision of the future."
"He has the misfortune of coming to the Presidency at the time of limitation on the Federal role," said Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. "Given the limitations on his budgetary and policy-making scope, it's unlikely that you'll see anything of a magnitude of a Lyndon Johnson or a Franklin Roosevelt or a Woodrow Wilson."
Mr. Clinton may have less incentive to offer big initiatives because his approval rating in most polls has remained rock steady at around 60 percent -- an impressive level for any President. (In the first two years of his second term, Ronald Reagan's approval ratings were similar, until the fall of 1986, when his popularity began to slide after disclosure of the Iran-contra affair.)
Nor does there seem to be a great outcry from Americans for Mr. Clinton to intervene either more often or more forcefully in matters that affect their lives.
"You don't need 500 balls in the air," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is close to the White House. "As far as the public is concerned, there aren't that many big things that need to be done."
More and more, the next three years will be shaped by Mr. Gore's ambition, as the President and his staff increasingly turn to positioning the Vice President to run for the office himself in 2000.
"There's just a kind of frittering quality to his leadership," said Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton University and an authority on the Presidency. "There is a lack of sustained focus and willingness to narrow on some things and really get behind them."
Mr. Clinton is not helped by the fact that many of his closest aides have departed. Many other advisers -- most notably, Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff -- have talked openly for months about leaving.
The departure of such hard-edged, liberal aides as Harold M. Ickes and the politically ambidextrous consultant Mr. Morris has substantially changed the tone and volume of debate.
"The ideological battle is over," said Rahm Emanuel, a senior Presidential adviser. "There is no doubt he is a New Democrat. You still have policy debates. But there are no ideological debates."
Mr. Bowles imposed a discipline that was lacking in the early years of the Clinton Presidency, which has led to a more temperate intellectual climate. The atmosphere is corporate, one aide noted, more mature but less invigorating.
"I call them the 'beige bunch,' one current senior White House aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity, of the current team running the White House. "The chief of staff sets the tone and we all follow."
Despite the President's "social security" idea, Mr. Reich, the former Labor Secretary, said an excess of caution has seized the President when he could be proposing ambitious programs to address the anxiety of workers left behind by the booming technology-driven economy. He said he could understand Mr. Clinton's reluctance during the 1996 campaign to talk about society's losers. But he said the balanced budget and full employment presented Mr. Clinton with an opportunity to make significant strides in domestic economic policy.
Yet, Mr. Reich said, the "good news only" mindset of 1996 seems to still dominate White House thinking. "You now have a balanced budget that may even be in surplus and you have a legacy that up to now is primarily a Republican one," he said, "in the sense that it achieved some long-term Republican goals -- balancing the budget, getting rid of welfare, cutting capital gains taxes and widening global trade."
Mr. Reich represents a frustration from the left of the party; plenty of Americans, no doubt, are not as eager to see the President embark on some of those initiatives.
Still, noting that Japan is weakened economically and the United States is indisputably number one, Mr. Reich said, "If there was ever a time to get on with the larger agenda, it is precisely now."
 
The Comfort Level
Quicker Decisions, And Ease With Power
The criticism of President Clinton doing too little could not be more different from when he began the Presidency and, as he himself has acknowledged, tried to do too much. His aides used to say that Mr. Clinton was plagued by a "paralysis of analysis."
The scene in the Oval Office was familiar: An undisciplined President who always seemed surrounded by aides, discussing and debating issues far longer than many thought was necessary. These days, it is more typical to find the President alone in his office, reading or talking on the phone. He usually begins his day between 8:30 and 9 A.M., later than in the heat of the campaign.
The President said he had grown more at ease in reaching decisions and handing tasks to aides. Unlike the 1995 budget negotiations, when Mr. Clinton attended dozens of meetings with lawmakers, he was rarely present in the budget meetings this summer, preferring to send Mr. Bowles and other emissaries.
"I might make more decisions based on a detailed memo without a long meeting than I would have otherwise," Mr. Clinton said. "If it's something where I have a higher comfort level and we've got a clear course established."
His friends and associates described Mr. Clinton as a leader who has internalized the office in a way he could not early on. "He doesn't think it is at all odd that when he walks in a room everyone stands up or when he's driven down the street there are 40 men with guns and there are helicopters," said one of Mr. Clinton's senior aides. "None of even his oldest friends feels it is odd to call him 'Mr. President' any more."
Vice President Gore also described a new comfort level. "He started out as a good President; he has become a great President," he said. "Difficult decisions that required much time in the early part of his first term are now made quickly and correctly -- seemingly with little effort or angst."
As an example, aides recalled that Mr. Bowles confronted Mr. Clinton about making a decision on Speaker Newt Gingrich's offer to help salvage a vote in the House on expanding Presidential trade authority if Mr. Clinton would give in on restricting international support for abortions.
"We were in the Blue Room and Erskine walked up to him and said, 'Mr. President, I have to go in and see the Speaker and I have to give him an answer,' " a White House aide said. "Clinton turned right back and said: 'Erskine, I can't do that. This is principle.' Erskine sagged visibly. He sat down and said, 'Mr. President, you realize that could be the end of fast track.' He said, 'Erskine, I can't give you that.' Erskine said, 'Yes, sir.' "
Describing the incident, the aide said: "I was astonished. In the past, there would have been first an explosion at Newt or the Democrats and/or the staff. He would have said, 'How can I make a decision at 11:20 at night?' "
Mr. Clinton's defeat this year on the fast-track legislation, largely at the hands of members of Congress from his own party, was interpreted as an omen of difficulties that might await his future initiatives.
Richard W. Riley, the Education Secretary who is also an old friend of Mr. Clinton, said, "He seems like he's more wise in a lot of ways. He's not in such a hurry physically. He wants to stop and think things out."
Wiser, perhaps. But Walter Dean Burnham, a Government professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that from the outside Mr. Clinton's appears to be a passive, "finger-in-the-dike Presidency" in which his mission is "to prevent the Republicans from going all the way with their agenda."
Mr. Burnham warned that "it's easy to underestimate a President because he's still got a lot of power." But, he added, "I don't think he has a very clear idea of where he wants to go from here."
 
The Sentimental Side
Looking at the End Of a Political Life
The President's well-known sentimentalism has lately turned inward as he looks at the changes in his personal life and the approaching end of his political career. At his 50th birthday celebration in 1996, he mused that he had seen "more yesterdays than tomorrows." That is now true of his Presidency as well, and it seems to weigh on him at times.
Mr. Clinton is showing the physical signs of aging as well. His knee injury earlier this year was a reminder of the frailty of the human body and, far more than most people realized, it cramped his style. For two weeks, he was unable to leave the residence, even to cover the short distance to the Oval Office. His recovery -- which took three to four months -- appears to have made him more determined than ever to enjoy his time on the golf course and other physical activities.
This fall, the President was fitted with hearing aids in both ears, the result, doctors and staff said, of years of exposure to loud music and raucous crowds. During the 30-minute interview, Mr. Clinton fiddled several times with the hearing aid in his right ear. (He said "it works superbly," and explained, "The rule is you have to just keep pushing it in.")
Contributing to Mr. Clinton's spreading wistfulness was the departure this fall of his daughter, Chelsea, for Stanford University. He occasionally mentions it in speeches, particularly those to small gatherings late in the evening. At a recent Democratic dinner in Philadelphia, for instance, the President admitted to "feeling rather nostalgic lately," citing his 22d wedding anniversary and the difficulties with coping with the luxuriously appointed but childless nest that the White House has become for Mrs. Clinton and him. To keep them company, the Clintons are acquiring a Labrador retriever, the White House said this week.
While none among the White House staff will dare discuss Mr. Clinton's post-White House plans, he is clearly thinking about it. He participated in the dedication of the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Tex., last month and remarked on its grandeur with some envy. "I don't have as much land," joked Mr. Clinton, who has started unusually early to check out sites for the Clinton library in Little Rock.
Yet more than anything else, some prominent Democrats said they were surprised by Mr. Clinton's longing for the golf course.
"It's amazing to me," said Senator Daschle. "He can pour out data about a golf course like he can about polls and voting turnouts in precincts and county elections. He regales us, with some frequency, with stories of being out on the golf course and hitting this incredible drive. With a remarkable clarity, you can picture what it was he was doing, how he was doing it, what he was wearing."
Mr. Clinton laughed off the notion of golf as a preoccupation. "It's not fair to say I'm obsessed with it," he said.
But he became unusually animated when the subject came up. "When I talk about it, it's just a way I get away from it," the President said. "If I were really serious about it, I'd have a lower handicap and a different approach. It's a lot of fun for me. It relieves the pressure of the job."

HEADLINE: A Price to Pay for Proposed Restrictions on Tobacco

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Before the end of the year, the City Council is likely to ban outdoor cigarette advertising within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds, day care centers, amusement arcades and other gathering places of the young -- in other words, practically anywhere in the five boroughs.
But that would be only a foretaste of the far-reaching changes that may lie ahead for the New York region as the war on smoking continues, experts say. If Congress ratifies the proposed settlement reached last June between the nation's tobacco industry and its foes -- the legislative battle begins in Washington early next year -- this region is likely to be affected more profoundly than any other, analysts say. 
 "A settlement would have a more pervasive impact in the New York area than anywhere else, even the tobacco belt," said David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. "I can't imagine a Congressional tobacco bill that wouldn't protect tobacco farmers."
Although brightleaf tobacco is hardly a mainstay of this region's economy, Madison Avenue could be deprived of tens of millions of dollars in billings if Congress enacts draconian prohibitions affecting cigarette marketing.
And it is New York, not tobacco country, that is home to the parent companies of three of the nation's cigarette giants: the largest, Philip Morris Companies; the second largest, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, and the fourth largest, the Loews Corporation. Analysts said that the corporations could downsize or even move out of New York in the wake of a settlement.
Furthermore, because New York State spends more Medicaid money than other states, it would wind up with a larger share of the tobacco settlement than any other state: as much as $21 billion over 25 years.
New York City's share of payments, based on Medicaid expenditures, would be 60 percent, or more than $12 billion. That money could be used for anything from health care to tax relief.
On its own, the City Council bill would have a major impact in the five boroughs. Since more than 30 members of the 51-member Council are also sponsors, final passage is expected at a full meeting of the Council on Dec. 17. The bill, proposed by the Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, is being evaluated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has said he agrees with its anti-smoking goals.
Although many tobacco analysts and legislators believe that Congress will ultimately adopt a broader settlement, "the word, for now, is uncertainty," said Dennis C. Vacco, the New York State Attorney General. "There is no way of knowing whether there will be a settlement, or a legislative agreement, or whether we'll turn the clock back to the status quo of the last four decades."
Lawmakers could insist on settlement costs high enough to drive the tobacco makers from the table, preventing an agreement. But the industry's top negotiator, J. Phil Carlton, has said that the settlement will be the basis for Congressional legislation "by next spring or summer."
Peter G. Verniero, the New Jersey Attorney General, said that the proposed national settlement, including its anti-advertising provisions, "serves as a very strong basis for national legislation."
"I have confidence that there will be a national settlement of some sort," he added.
The national settlement would require cigarette companies to pay $368.5 billion over the next 25 years to compensate states for the costs of treating smoking-related illness and to finance nationwide anti-smoking programs. In return, tobacco companies would be given virtual legal immunity in the future.
Stiff resistance to the settlement from anti-smoking forces pushed Congressional consideration into the new year. Tobacco critics do not want the states to share what they call tainted wealth.
"That money makes state governments partners of the tobacco business," said Joseph W. Cherner, the policy chairman of the Coalition for a Smoke-Free City, an association of 50 anti-tobacco organizations.
Under the terms of the original settlement, New Jersey would receive the 10th-largest sum of any state -- more than $6 billion over the 25-year payout. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has asked that the money be earmarked for health expenses and tobacco-related programs.
Connecticut would receive $3.6 billion over 25 years, and "the Governor and the Legislature would decide how the money would be used," said Richard Blumenthal, the state's Attorney General.
Tax revenues would rise sharply if Congress imposed higher tax rates on cigarettes, at least at first. But higher prices would eventually drive down consumption and cut into the $860 million in state and local sales taxes on the $3 billion worth of cigarettes sold in the New York region yearly, according to Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Though cigarette vending machines have been banned in most places in New York City, there are about 40,000 machines elsewhere in the region taking in about $312 million annually that might be affected by legislation, more than in any other region, according to Victor Lavay, publisher of Vending Times, a trade publication based in Manhattan.
If Congress accepts strict advertising restrictions, many analysts say the tobacco industry will agree. Beyond New York City, the advertising landscape of the metropolitan region would be transformed if Congress banned outdoor advertising, to the tune of $6.3 million spent in the area last year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, an industry research concern.
Madison Avenue could suffer further losses since much of the $500 million spent on tobacco advertising annually is generated by New York advertising agencies. They include Mezzina/Brown, which creates Camel campaigns for RJR Nabisco; Young & Rubicam, which advertises the Parliament brand of Philip Morris; Grey Advertising Inc., which handles brands like Carlton and Kool for B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., the nation's third-largest cigarette company, and Compton Partners, which creates Newport ads for Loews.
In the traditional compensation formula, advertising agencies keep 15 percent of the amount their clients spend on ads. Therefore, New York-based agencies stand to lose at least $50 million from tobacco advertising restrictions, analysts said.
A settlement agreement or Congressional legislation could have a longer-term consequence for New York: the tobacco companies' New York headquarters could be downsized or moved.
The companies declined comment. A sampling of tobacco executives and Wall Street analysts said Philip Morris, which directly employs 6,200 people in the region, was unlikely to leave. "But RJR Nabisco easily could," said Gary D. Black, a tobacco analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "After a settlement," he said, "RJR Nabisco will spin off its Nabisco food business and divide its tobacco operations into domestic and international. So they wouldn't need to have much of a headquarters in New York."

New City and State Laws Aiming at Young Smokers
As Congress prepares to consider landmark legislation intended to reduce underage tobacco use, a growing number of states, cities and schools are taking measures to crack down on what they see as a major cause of the problem: young people themselves. In some states, minors convicted of trying to buy cigarettes or chewing tobacco could lose their driver's licenses. Some cities are using undercover police to catch youths who smoke, and some schools are screening students for nicotine. 1

HEADLINE: A Scaled-Down City Government Has Fewer Jobs for the Hopeful

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
It was the final day to apply for a clerical position with the New York City government, and people were making hurried pilgrimages to the city's personnel office in lower Manhattan, a procession of the chronically unemployed and the recently laid off, part-time workers clasping wrinkled resumes and welfare recipients towing young children.
Many of them were optimistic on that day late last month, but that may have been because they did not know their chances. Officials estimated that nearly 35,000 people were seeking clerical jobs, whose starting salary is about $18,000 a year. If recent history is any guide, only a few hundred will get those jobs any time soon, no matter how qualified they are. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's effort to scale back municipal government has led to a stark retrenchment in city hiring, putting an end to the city's traditional role as a jobs engine for the masses. But even after the city shed thousands of jobs, even as the municipal work force no longer seems the bastion of secure employment that it once was, people still clamor to get in -- just as they have for most of this century.
The pay is not high. Yet the lines that curled around the personnel office at 18 Washington Street attested to what many of the applicants said were the virtues of city employment: Civil Service and union protections; coveted benefits like health insurance, overtime and a pension, and a semblance of stability at a time when the local unemployment rate remains around 9 percent.
"Look around you," said one job-seeker, Josephine Hill, 45, pointing to the scores of people picking up applications. "Things are tough and getting tougher."
The city's work force has weathered significant turbulence as Mr. Giuliani has sought to address the city's financial problems by reducing the number of positions through attrition and buyouts. His predecessor, David N. Dinkins, also cut jobs. And layoffs are always a threat, though very few have been imposed over the last decade.
But many of the applicants said these changes had not diminished the allure of a city job. They expressed anxiety about the private sector, saying that companies often laid off workers unexpectedly and refused to give benefits to those in entry-level positions. "The city is more promising," said Alice McCauley, 27. "You can have a future with it."
The hopes, though, far outweigh the job openings. Last year, more than 15,000 people applied for an $18,000-a-year position as an office machine aide -- the workers who run copier and fax machines, said Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Personnel. Next year, the city is to collect applications for sanitation workers for the first time since 1990. It will likely reap more than 100,000, and ultimately hire only a few thousand over the next five years, officials estimated.
The city's jobs information line receives an average of 20,000 calls a month, even though under the Giuliani administration, the city has not accepted applications for many popular Civil Service positions. And some of the more menial jobs have been taken over by work fare workers, though the administration is loath to acknowledge this.
In the rare instances when the city does unlock the gates to employment, the response is overwhelming, as shown by the crowds at the personnel office on Nov. 25, the deadline to apply for the clerical position.
There was Ms. Hill, who had held a temporary position with the city's housing agency before being let go a few years back, leaving her resentful and unable to find work. A few feet away hunched Roy Brown, 25, painstakingly filling out forms, explaining that employment with the city would give him the benefits that he could not garner from a private job. And nearby was Darlene Boston, 37, a mother of three who said she was eager to leave the welfare rolls.
There was a time when many of these people could have landed jobs with the city, when such employment offered successive generations of poor minority residents a path to the middle class, when the city was so eager to hire that it advertised for workers on billboards and recruited clerks by distributing a pamphlet at high schools entitled "A Career in Government Administration."
"When you came out of high school, you could always get a job with the city," said Ms. Boston, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. "But that's dying. In my community, these jobs were perceived as a way out. It was a chance to make a better income, get a decent apartment, join the credit union, even buy a home for your family."
Ms. Boston said she knew people in her predominantly black neighborhood who had grown disillusioned with the city work force because it has faced so many reductions in recent years. Some black New Yorkers whose forebears built their lives on such employment have turned away from the city, resolving that their future is in the private sector. Still, many others want these jobs.
At the turn of the century, the city employed about 30,000 workers. By the early 1960's, that number had risen past 200,000, and while it dipped during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, it resumed its increase in the 1980's.
The Department of Personnel wrote in one of its annual reports in the late 1960's that the city was striving to meet the "urgent and growing staff needs of city agencies." In its current literature, the department notes that there are few opportunities because of the "city's effort to maintain a smaller work force."
The Giuliani administration makes no apologies for its policies, saying that it is healthier for the city if private industry, not government, is the prime generator of jobs. With the city facing big projected budget gaps in the coming years, administration officials say, it cannot sustain such a large work force without raising taxes, which would damage the local economy. And they point out that even as the administration has reduced the number of Civil Service and non-Civil Service workers paid for by city revenues by 20,000, to 200,000, the number of private sector jobs has grown by more than 175,000.
"The city has constantly struggled to support this mammoth government," said Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine. "The Mayor's philosophy is that the best way to fuel the economy is to create jobs through the private sector, not through the government."
The state and Federal governments have also cut jobs. Over all, government employment in New York City is down by more than 90,000 jobs in the last six years, officials said. New York State has reduced the number of Civil Service positions statewide by 21,000 over the last three years, officials said.
New Jersey has 10,000 fewer state jobs than a decade ago, and Connecticut has reduced its work force by 6,000 in the last three years.
New York City is still doing some hiring, but it is mostly seeking people with college degrees or credits, or extensive training, like engineers, plumbers and steamfitters. In fact, the city has become more selective, toughening the educational and experience requirements for some positions. This month, it is accepting applications for a job called assistant retirement benefits examiner, which pays $26,000 a year. Among the requirements are college credits, including courses in math and accounting, or equivalent experience.
Before last month, the last time the city collected applications for the clerical position was in 1990 and 1991. Ms. Collins, the spokeswoman for the Department of Personnel, said the city decided to accept new applicants because it has not had a pool of qualified candidates -- known as a Civil Service list -- since 1995.
When clerical spots open through attrition, the city will probably leave many of them unfilled. If it cannot do that with some positions, it wants to have qualified applicants to choose.
Of the nearly 35,000 who are seeking the job this time, about half are expected to pass the Civil Service test and make the list. But few will get off the list, administration officials said. (The nearly 35,000 applications include those the city has already received and more that it will collect next month, when there is a special deadline for applications for clerical jobs at the city's hospitals agency.)
Historians and labor analysts say they have just begun to study the impact of the drop in government jobs in the city. If some neighborhoods have been anchored by residents who spent years working for the city, what happens when their children and their neighbors cannot follow in their footsteps?
"This is a big change, no question about it," said Prof. Joshua Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College. "It used to be that you could have a relatively modest job and relatively modest pay but have a long-term sense that you had a future in the city. These are the people who became the church deacons. They provided a social stability that was important to New York."
But for some of the people in line at the personnel office, the social impact of the decline in Civil Service job opportunities seemed less important than the fact that the gates were open, however slightly.
"I had a city job and foolishly left it, so any way I can get back in, I'll try," said Tracey Jackson, 34. "You don't make a whole lot of money, but the benefits outweigh that." Asked which applications she was seeking, she quickly replied, "I'm taking everything I can get."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
A SUSPENDED PLAYER, A SHAKEN LEAGUE

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
James Gordon first encountered Latrell Sprewell 10 years ago in a crowded corridor between classes. The varsity basketball coach at Washington High School in Milwaukee stopped the 6-foot 5-inch sinewy senior and asked if he would come out for the team.
"Yeah, O.K.," Sprewell replied, shrugging his shoulders. 
 From that nonchalant exchange emerged a new existence for Sprewell, one in which the teen-ager would soon be catapulted toward National Basketball Association stardom.
With no organized basketball experience before his senior year, he would, in less than a decade, become one of the most explosive shooting guards in the N.B.A. and, by 1996, sign a $32 million contract with the Golden State Warriors.
"I loved him," said Gordon, recalling his one year of coaching Sprewell. "He never put his chin down and he always did what you asked of him."
He then added, "I'm sure at one point last week, he must have thought to himself, 'Where is the line where you're stepping on my dignity and self-worth, where you're questioning my loyalty?' "
Whether Sprewell actually asked himself such a question isn't known. But what is clear is that the 27-year-old player did cross a line, choking, punching and threatening to kill his coach -- P. J. Carlesimo -- in an intensely ugly confrontation last Monday. That led to the termination of Sprewell's contract by the Warriors and a decision by Commissioner David Stern of the N.B.A. to suspend him for a full year, the longest non-drug suspension ever handed down by the league.
Peevish young star versus abrasive taskmaster. Both men perhaps too proud and egocentric to give ground in a tumultuous player-coach relationship.
The tension began percolating long before Monday's outburst, but when the eruption came it shook the entire league, the latest in a series of troublesome incidents in the N.B.A. involving on-court and off-court misconduct by any number of its players. In particular, Sprewell's attack on Carlesimo raised uncomfortable issues for the league dealing with race, mutual respect and a generational chasm between players and coaches that, at least in some instances, may be widening.
Nevertheless, some saw the incident as being too stark and frightening to signify anything other than a head-on collision between two very different people in which one of them completely lost control.
"It's too simplistic to say Latrell Sprewell is now the poster guy for the Generation X players," said Dr. Richard Lapchick, the director of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport and Society. "The act was so unprecedented and so offensive, I think you have to treat it as an incident that is out there, almost an island in itself."
If that is the case, then how did Sprewell get there? When he finished his senior year at the University of Alabama in 1992, he had experienced only five seasons of organized basketball. He had gone from high school to Three Rivers Community College in the predominantly white rural community of Poplar Bluff, Mo.
For Sprewell, who had grown up in a black section of Milwaukee, the transition amounted to culture shock. But he stayed for two years and prospered on the floor, leading Three Rivers to the junior college national semifinals in his second season.
From there, he transferred to Alabama, where he also stayed for two years. And in that second season of 1991-92, Sprewell averaged 17.8 points a game while also being named to the all-Southeastern Conference defensive team. No other player in the S.E.C. could match the amount of minutes -- 36.2 a game -- Sprewell stayed on the court. He was clearly both durable and talented.
Still, at least two N.B.A. general managers said they were concerned enough about reports questioning Sprewell's maturity to pass on him in the first round of the 1992 draft. But Sprewell's ability to maneuver his tall and slim 190-pound frame through mounds of muscle was too much for Don Nelson, then the Warriors' coach and general manager, to overlook. Nelson took him with the 24th pick of the draft.
Sprewell became invaluable to Golden State in his first two seasons, averaging 15.4 points a game as a rookie and increasing that output to 21 points a game the following year. But Sprewell also displayed signs of insubordination with the Warriors, including boycotting practice after Chris Webber, his friend, was traded away in November 1994 after a long, and well-publicized, feud with Nelson. During that protest, Sprewell went so far as to write Webber's uniform number on his sneakers.
Eventually, people associated with the Warriors began to wonder whether they had mistaken Sprewell's maturity as a basketball player for his maturity as a person. The older Sprewell got, the more he seemed to gravitate toward the youngest players on the team; over the last two seasons his best friend on the club became forward Joe Smith, who is 22.
Meanwhile, Sprewell's father, Lakosta Fields, would often accompany his son to social gatherings after games -- as if he were one of Sprewell's young teammates, a former confidant of Sprewell's said.
 
An In-Your-Face Coach Doesn't Coddle Players
In any case, by the time Carlesimo was hired in June, Sprewell was the only box-office attraction left for a franchise that seemed full of promise in the early 1990's but had become hopelessly overmatched.
Carlesimo was replacing Rick Adelman, whose mellow demeanor as the coach had earned Sprewell's trust even though it didn't do much for the Warriors' record. Adelman had essentially coddled Sprewell, but now the player would be dealing with Carlesimo, a tough personality with a provocative in-your-face style.
The oldest of 10 children and the son of Pete Carlesimo, a well-known college sports figure, the younger Carlesimo began his coaching career at New Hampshire College in 1975. From there, he went to Wagner College on Staten Island for six seasons before moving to Seton Hall. In effect, he had finally arrived in the big time, in the world of powerful coaches who turn programs around for a living.
And in 1989, in his finest moment as the head man on the bench, he took the Pirates to the championship game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, losing to Michigan in the final seconds in overtime. For Carlesimo, the defeat was painful, but the tournament run was sweet vindication because students at the school had been calling for his ouster not long before.
As guarded as any coach in the league, Carlesimo saved his emotions for his teams. He won plenty of games at Seton Hall -- his overall record was 212-166 -- but his foul language and brusque style on the bench could clearly alienate players.
Finally, after 12 years at Seton Hall, Carlesimo made the leap that high-profile college coaches often dream of making. He signed on with the Portland Trail Blazers for the 1994-95 season and stayed there for three years, making the playoffs each season but also reinforcing his reputation as a coach who could be difficult, a hand grenade with a whistle.
In particular, he had a two-year feud with Rod Strickland before the team's point guard was traded to Washington in July 1996. At one point, in late February and early March of that year, Strickland staged a six-game boycott of the Blazers, saying he could no longer play for Carlesimo.
Last spring, rumors cropped up that Carlesimo was about to be fired. But instead the Trail Blazers caught fire, winning 11 in a row and giving Carlesimo what turned out to be a temporary reprieve. After the season, which ended in a first-round playoff loss to the Lakers, Carlesimo was indeed dismissed. But like any number of other coaches, he soon landed in another job -- this time with the Warriors for a contract that extended over five years.
 
A Terrible Start To the Season
In Golden State, Carlesimo was taking over one of the least-talented franchises in the league, a team that in recent years had traded away such stars as Webber, Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and, finally, Chris Mullin. And this season began miserably for Carlesimo and his players, who were able to win only one game in their first 14 through last weekend.
The losing undoubtedly put even more of an edge on Carlesimo's personality. The Boston Celtics scout John Carroll, who assisted Carlesimo for seven years at Seton Hall and worked as his advance scout for one season in Portland, tried to illustrate Carlesimo's plight at Golden State.
"What is a player's coach?" Carroll asked. "Someone who often lets things go. On a talented team, you can get away with that. But you cannot let things go if you plan to turn things around. You can't give in to that losing mentality. P. J. has never given in to that losing mentality."
And then there was the observation by the former Warriors guard Mark Price, a 12-year veteran of the league, who prophesized way back on Oct. 5 that Carlesimo's style could bring about an altercation with one of his players.
"P. J. is not going to settle for what happened last year," Price said. "I think there will be a confrontation before that point."
He was right. According to several witnesses, last Monday's altercation began with Carlesimo instructing Sprewell to make better passes during a drill and escalated from there.
According to The Contra Costa Times, Sprewell shouted to Carlesimo, "Don't come up on me, don't come up on me," as the coach walked across three-quarters of the gym floor to confront the guard.
"P. J. provoked it," one player said. "He could have stopped or walked the other way, but he didn't. He kept going."
But as a coach, Carlesimo was surely faced with a dilemma -- whether to back down in front of his players. In the end, Sprewell lunged at Carlesimo and then choked him for nearly 15 seconds as his teammates watched before slowly moving in to help separate the enraged player from the shaken coach.
"This was like a prison guard movie, where players turned their backs," said one person with knowledge of the incident.
Sprewell was thrown out of the practice but returned 15 minutes later while the players, unaware of his presence, were scrimmaging. And he again attacked Carlesimo, landing a glancing blow with his fist to the coach's neck before being pulled away -- by players and assistant coaches.
From there came swift punishment by first the Warriors and then the N.B.A. and an equally quick decision by the players association to contest the termination of Sprewell's contract and his one-year suspension by filing a grievance. The grievance will be heard by an arbitrator -- John Feerick, dean of Fordham University Law School -- perhaps as early as Jan. 4.
But even as arbitration awaits, the debate over Sprewell's action and punishment intensifies.
"One of the issues that has not been examined here is how far can a coach go with his conduct," said Arn Tellem, Sprewell's agent. "Are there any limits, or do all players have to deal with abuse and mistreatment?"
Tellem's list of clients includes Albert Belle and Isaiah Rider, two other controversial athletes. In his role as Sprewell's key adviser, Tellem is yet another figure in the life of a millionaire athlete who has many people telling him what he wants to hear and perhaps not enough people telling him what he needs to know.
"I can't control any client, nor can anyone," Tellem said. "In the heat of the moment, there are moments of passion in life when no one can control their actions. There is a deep issue here, and that's not the issue."
Tellem would not say whether he was alluding to the obvious racial and generational divides -- Sprewell is black, and Carlesimo, 48, is white -- but on Friday night he did acknowledge that he has been in contact with Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who handled O. J. Simpson's murder defense. Tellem also said that Sprewell might agree to talk about the incident early this week.
Meanwhile, the union intends to interview a number of players -- most of them young and black -- who have reportedly experienced a pattern of verbal abuse by Carlesimo.
"There is probably some racial element to it," said Butch Beard, the former N.B.A. player and coach, who is black. "But I don't really see it that way. I'm sure people are thinking the white coach doesn't know how the brother thinks. Give me a break. You can hate your coach, but you don't physically attack him."
Said one black team official who spoke on condition of anonymity: "The color of the victim is not the issue here. If it were Don Chaney, he still hits him," referring to the former head coach and current Knicks assistant coach, who is also black.
"This is an angry young man," the team official added. "He does not need a new team. He needs some intervention from friends and family."
Added Lapchick: "If the league is 79 percent black, how do you explain why this one guy acted like he did and the rest did not? The most frightening part of this is, he came back in after having time to cool down."
In the book, "Long Time Coming, a Black Athlete's Coming of Age in America," the former N.B.A. star Chet Walker argues that lack of respect for authority in sports can be derived from bleak social and economic conditions afflicting black Americans.
"If you're a black kid, it's not good enough to shoot from outside," writes Walker, who played from 1962 to 1975 and won a championship with Philadelphia in 1967. "You like to break people down by taking it to the hole. Such moves come from anger and frustration, from competing and trying to be on top, from struggling all your life. Only people who have something can afford to be unselfish, unless you're a saint.
"In the ghetto, you often must take what you can before someone takes it away. Moving the ball around so that someone else can take a better shot often appears to be a virtue from another world. Soaring over an opponent, driving in at him, then looking at him to say, 'I crushed you' -- that's control. Perhaps the only place a young black player can feel it."
 
Another Incident, This One 2 Years Ago
 The confrontation with Carlesimo was not the first time Sprewell had grown so agitated after an altercation that he came back to settle his differences with an intent toward injuring someone.
Two seasons ago, he reached the boiling point in a dispute with a former teammate, Jerome Kersey, who is also black. After a practice fight escalated, Sprewell left and returned to the gym with a 2 by 4 before he was restrained by teammates. At that point, he said he planned to return with a gun.
Club officials, frightened Sprewell might make good on this threat, kept Kersey in the locker room for three hours until they deemed it was safe for him to leave the building.
And then came Monday's altercation. By that day, Sprewell had already grown tired of Carlesimo's tirades. After a practice on Nov. 24, Carlesimo had lashed into the team, saying it was one of their worst workouts of the young season. Sprewell was in disbelief.
"For 90 minutes of the practice, he was telling us we worked hard," he said to a teammate. "I don't understand it. I guess if he says we weren't working hard, it takes the pressure off him because he can't coach."
And from there, the tension kept growing. Something as innocuous as his coach asking him to pass the basketball more crisply set him off, severely damaging a dream that began in a high school corridor a decade ago.
"I didn't know that was coming," said Gordon, the high school coach. "I don't think anyone did. With Carlesimo, you know, where there is smoke there is fire. But there are fundamentals of basketball and there are fundamentals of life. And in both, you're not supposed to hit the coach."
But Sprewell did. And now his future in the N.B.A. is unclear. Abe Pollin, the owner of the Washington Wizards, told The Washington Post that he would consider signing Sprewell at some point in the future "if he would open his heart and ask for forgiveness." Other teams were also reportedly interested in Sprewell, contacting the Warriors before the league decided to hand down the yearlong suspension.
As for Carlesimo, and the rest of the Warriors, the season continues. On Friday night in Oakland, Calif., with Smith wearing "Spree 15" on the tape around his ankles in a tribute to his friend, Golden State beat Orlando, 104-89.
"It was a great win for our team," Carlesimo said. For a coach who had gone through the most traumatic week of his career, it had to be. But it was clear that neither he nor the team nor the league had put the incident to rest.

They're in the Money

 BODY:
South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economic power, will get the largest international rescue ever: a $55 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United States and several other nations. Though the first signs of change will be severe cuts in public spending and a retrenchment that would double, perhaps triple, unemployment, the bailout is expected to restore the value of the Korean won and pay off foreign debt. Apologizing to Koreans last week in a nationally televised speech, the Minister of Finance, Lim Chang Yuel, said, "Please understand the necessity of the economic pain we must bear and overcome."

HEADLINE: Brown Wins Mayoral Race In Houston

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Lee Patrick Brown, who grew up on a farm in small-town Oklahoma and headed police forces in three of the biggest cities in the nation, was elected Mayor of Houston tonight, becoming the first member of a racial minority to be Mayor in the city's history.
Mr. Brown, who is black, overcame a barrage of negative television advertising by his opponent, Rob Mosbacher, a local businessman who spent $4 million on the race, more than any mayoral candidate ever has here. He also prevailed despite the unusual 11th-hour intrusion into the race by New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who publicly lambasted Mr. Brown for his handling of the Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn six years ago, when Mr. Brown was New York's Police Commissioner. 
 A popular police chief here in Houston for eight years before moving to New York, Mr. Brown sought throughout the campaign to downplay the Crown Heights episode, insisting it was all part of the "jungle of New York politics." Despite official criticism that he received in New York, Mr. Brown told voters here that under his leadership, the police had actually managed to avert a "Los Angeles-type riot" in Crown Heights.
The margin of victory was somewhat smaller than what had been suggested in polls in recent weeks, which had put Mr. Brown ahead by 10 percentage points or more.
But it was a clear victory, and Mr. Brown was exultant tonight at a hotel near the Astrodome when he delivered a speech that noted his campaign slogan -- "A Mayor for All of Houston" -- and contained an appeal for racial harmony.
"This was a campaign based on the conviction that a great international city can celebrate and capitalize on its cultural diversity and make it a source of strength rather than a source of division," said the Mayor-elect.
Taking note of the racial milestone represented by his victory, Mr. Brown said: "Tonight, my friends, another barrier has fallen in the city of Houston. The doors of opportunity have opened wider for all of Houston's children."
With all of the roughly 300,000 votes counted as of 11 o'clock tonight, Mr. Brown won 53 percent of the vote in the run-off election, compared with 47 percent for his opponent. While Mr. Mosbacher won a comfortable majority of votes among white residents of the city, exit surveys today clearly indicated that Mr. Brown had benefited from a strong turnout by blacks, who voted overwhelmingly for him.
Mr. Brown, who also served as President Clinton's director of national drug-control policy, will succeed Bob Lanier, a popular three-term incumbent who was barred from running for re-election because of the city's term-limits law.
Though Mr. Brown is a Democrat and Mr. Mosbacher a Republican, the election is officially nonpartisan, with no primaries.
In voting on Nov. 4, Mr. Brown led a crowded field of candidates, gathering 41 percent of the vote. But that was less than the outright majority needed for victory, forcing him into today's runoff with Mr. Mosbacher, who captured 29 percent of the vote in November.
Several polls taken over the last month had suggested that Mr. Brown was comfortably ahead, though analysts cautioned that the size of the turnout for runoff elections is difficult to predict, and that Republicans such as Mr. Mosbacher can often count on a stronger turnout in their voter base than can Democrats.
Nonetheless, there were also indications that the prospect of Mr. Brown's election had energized black voters here. Black residents make up about 28 percent of Houston's population of 1.8 million, but exit surveys taken today indicated that they may well have accounted for a third of the voting population.
With the economy in relatively strong shape and crime having declined in recent years, there were no major policy differences that distinguished the two candidates in this election, other than their stands on affirmative action. Mr. Brown is a proponent of the policy, as is Mayor Lanier, while Mr. Mosbacher said Houston's affirmative action program should be replaced with a small-business development program.
Both men had said they would govern in the mold of the popular incumbent, Mr. Lanier, who was barred from running again because of a city term-limits law.

Overcapacity Is Warned For Nuclear Waste Sites

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6

 BODY:
A planned nuclear waste disposal site in the California desert, and others proposed around the nation, might be unnecessary and could sink the industry, an economist has warned.
The nation's three current dumps for low-level radioactive waste will have excess capacity well into the next century, because recycling and new compacting technologies have sharply reduced the volume of waste, the economist, F. Gregory Hayden of the University of Nebraska, said on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Hayden has said the annual volume of low-level waste shipped to disposal sites dropped from 3.8 million cubic feet in 1980 to 422,000 cubic feet in 1996. He says the decline means that the three current dump sites in Richland, Wash.; Barnwell, S.C.; and Clive, Utah, have anywhere from 29 to 260 years of capacity at current disposal rates, which will probably drop even further.

HEADLINE: Architecture

BYLINE: By Martin Filler; Martin Filler, who frequently writes about architecture, contributes to House Beautiful, The New York Review of Books and The New York Times.

 BODY:
LIVING ARCHITECTURE: A Biography of H. H. Richardson. By James F. O'Gorman. Photographs by Cervin Robinson. (Simon & Schuster, $50.) Even during his short life it was commonplace to say that Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-86) made architecture in his own image -- expansively unconventional and warmly welcoming. That close conjunction of the personal and the professional makes the vivid biographical approach of James F. O'Gorman, a professor of art at Wellesley and a leading Richardson scholar, the ideal way to understand this contradictory figure, part Romantic and part Rotarian, who redirected the mainstream of American architecture in the two decades after the Civil War.
A 300-pound dandy who enjoyed dressing up in medieval robes, Richardson was nonetheless sensitive to the sweeping political and social changes of his time. Born on a Louisiana plantation but educated at Harvard (where he developed the networking skills he used to advance his brilliant career), he sat out the war in Paris, studying architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and keeping his future options open. Returning to the United States in 1865, he eventually settled in Boston, where his friendships led to his breakthrough commission, the Romanesque-inspired Trinity Church of 1872-77, acclaimed then and now as a masterpiece. 
 Gregarious and persuasive, Richardson soon gained a national clientele for his bold, stone-clad structures. Yet his strenuous eating, drinking, traveling and work habits took their toll. As he succumbed to Bright's disease at 47, several of his greatest works -- including the Marshall Field Wholesale Store and the Glessner house in Chicago, and the Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail in Pittsburgh -- were only nearing completion.
O'Gorman's conversational prose is perfectly complemented by the eloquent images of the architectural photographer Cervin Robinson, whose definitive compositions, unimprovably lighted and instructively detailed, emphasize Richardson's dynamic interplay of massive masonry and delicate ornament. The historian Henry Adams, a Harvard chum and later a client of the architect, wondered at his "overflow of life," and that prodigious vitality comes across on every page of this book.
 THE FOUR BOOKS OF ARCHITECTURE. By Andrea Palladio. Translated by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield. (MIT, $50.) Today the most famous unread text on the building art, "The Four Books of Architecture," by the Italian Mannerist architect and theorist Andrea Palladio, was revered as the bible of the classical tradition for centuries after it was first issued in Venice in 1570. Drawing on the monuments of ancient Rome as well as the author's own villas and public works, this philosophical treatise and practical guide served as the pattern book for countless Palladian buildings by other architects around the world.
Elegantly translated (in the first new English version since 1738) and illustrated with the lyrical, rarely seen woodcuts of Palladio's original, this welcome publication gets us closer to the plain-spoken voice of the master. His head may have been on Parnassus, but his feet were firmly planted in the workaday agrarian life of his native Veneto region. The high priest of proportion, he knew that the correct relation of the parts of a structure to the whole is not just an esthetic nicety but a functional necessity.
PORTRAIT OF VENICE. By Giandomenico Romanelli. Photographs by Mark E. Smith. (Rizzoli, $95.) VENICE: THE CITY AND ITS ARCHITECTURE. By Richard Goy. (Phaidon, $69.95.) This is a year of bracketing anniversaries for Venice: 13 centuries since the city-state elected its first doge, and two centuries since the end of the Venetian Republic. That glorious millennium-plus saw the realization of an urban vision unlike any other, a dreamlike web of shadowy canals lined with pale pink Gothic palazzi and studded with sun-splashed plazas and churches of stupendous richness.
Two handsome new volumes far surpass the routine tributes to "La Serenissima" that appear every season. The more visually stunning "Portrait of Venice" is most noteworthy for the vibrant color photographs of Mark E. Smith, who has lived there for 20 years. Smith is well acquainted with the hidden Venice, the insider's city that lies just beyond the touristic landmarks. The tranquil Romanesque cloister of Sant' Apollonia is just steps away from the clamor of St. Mark's Square, and the Palladian garden pavilion behind Ca' Zenobio, now an Armenian college, might be in some Arcadian countryside.
Though less pictorially compelling, "Venice: The City and Its Architecture," by Richard Goy, a historian and architect who has written several books about the city's design, provides the more substantial text. With authoritative scope and dense detail, Goy tells how the proud, resourceful, luxury-loving inhabitants of the islands of the lagoon fashioned their incomparable cosmopolis.
MAHARAJAHS' PALACES: European Style in Imperial India. By Sylvie Raulet. Photographs by Anne Garde. (Vendome, $85.) The trouble with exoticism in the Information Age is that we think we've seen it all. And yet, like latter-day Marco Polos, we still yearn for the thrill of discovering unimagined splendors, the more opulent and bizarre the better. That impulse can be sated by this haunting album memorializing the strange stylistic hybrids that grew out of the British domination of India until 1947.
The French architectural and travel photographer Anne Garde has a sure eye for the telling detail. In her elegiac images of princely and plutocratic dwellings -- from the Marble Palace, a Calcutta merchant's mansion mobbed with Victorian statuary, to the Art Deco extravaganzas of the rulers of Jodhpur and Morvi, the last word in international playboy swank -- these east-west meldings can seem more logical than outlandish. For example, at the Maharajah of Dholpur's palace, rooms tiled with intricate English Arts and Crafts patterns remind us how much William Morris and his followers owed to Islamic decorative traditions.
AN EARLY ENCOUNTER WITH TOMORROW: Europeans, Chicago's Loop, and the World's Columbian Exposition. By Arnold Lewis. (University of Illinois, $34.95.) Louis Sullivan, the titan of Chicago architecture, predicted that the bombastic neo-classicism of that city's 1893 World's Fair would sound the death knell for the forces of progressive design, of which he was then the leader. Sullivan was all too prescient about the chilling effect the temporary plaster temples of the "White City" were to have on his own career. But according to Arnold Lewis, a historian at the College of Wooster in Ohio, the more lasting impact on foreign visitors to the exposition was experienced not at the fairgrounds but rather in Chicago's bustling commercial Loop, where a far more amazing preview of the future was on display.
There, such pioneering firms as Adler & Sullivan, Burnham & Root and Holabird & Roche had recently mastered the audacious new vocabulary of steel-frame high-rise construction that within a generation would revolutionize the practice of architecture more fully than at any time since the Renaissance. It was not just those innovative buildings that transfixed observant Europeans, but also the frenetic pace and abrupt habits of a public that seemed of a piece with its thrusting, no-nonsense surroundings. Here was a brave new world indeed, and its implications were at once fascinating and frightening to Old World believers in the civility of city life.
TOWARD A SIMPLER WAY OF LIFE: The Arts & Crafts Architecture of California. Edited by Robert Winter. (Norfleet/University of California, $45.) The idealism of the Arts and Crafts movement, which began in Victorian reaction against the dehumanizing forces of industrialization, found a particularly sympathetic following in California. Settled by individualists and receptive to new ideas, the Golden State by the turn of the century had fostered several thriving centers of Arts and Crafts design, whose makers and patrons saw it not as a style but a way of life.
Building unostentatiously, those reformers believed, was the path toward social and even spiritual improvement by eliminating divisive displays of wealth. The difference between Charles and Henry Greene's exquisite wood-and-shingle mansions in Pasadena and a modest Craftsman bungalow nearby was one of degree, not essence
Edited by Robert Winter, an architectural historian who specializes in California topics, this compendium of essays on 31 architects by 21 writers is uneven, but it includes several fine contributions. Among them is a chapter on William W. Wurster, the midcentury modernist and San Francisco Bay Area regionalist, by Daniel Gregory, an editor of Sunset magazine and a grandson of early Wurster clients. Mr. Gregory points out that in our got-it-flaunt-it age, Wurster's landmarks of enlightened simplicity are not safe even in the hands of their supposed admirers. Drawn by sites the architect chose for their natural beauty, today's purchasers of those down-to-earth designs, he writes, "immediately begin remodeling to . . . give the house a richer, more sumptuous feeling. . . . A million-dollar house should, well, look more like a million-dollar house."
LANDMARKS IN THE LANDSCAPE: Historic Architecture in the National Parks of the West. By Harvey H. Kaiser. (Chronicle, $60; $75 after Dec. 31.) Between the two world wars, while East Coast architects, fixated on historical forms, tried to make sense of modernism or struggled for economic survival, a small, lucky band of their colleagues out West were having the time of their lives dreaming up a distinctive new American style. After the National Park Service was created in 1916, the question arose as to how new structures for those preserves ought to be designed. As the Secretary of the Interior wrote to Stephen Mather, the new agency's first director, "Particular attention must be devoted always to the harmonizing of these improvements in the landscape."
Pursuing that mission, the high-minded but pragmatic Mather and his imaginative team of architects devised the appealingly rugged look now known as National Park Service Rustic, a vigorous mix of log-cabin construction, the twiggy Adirondack camp style and the boulder-girt architecture of H. H. Richardson (though oddly he is not cited in this otherwise comprehensive study). Often financed by commercial concessionaires, the service's buildings were of uniformly high quality but varied appropriately in scale and materials from site to site.
Such majestic wood-and-stone piles as the Ahwahnee Hotel at Yosemite, Timberline Lodge in Mount Hood National Forest and Old Faithful Inn, the pride of Yellowstone National Park, are all more than able to hold their own against the humbling grandeur of the scenery around them. Those beloved but heretofore insufficiently honored treasures at last receive their historical due from Harvey H. Kaiser, an expert on rustic architecture who is equally up to his subject.
THE GHOSTS OF BERLIN: Confronting German History in the Urban Landscape. By Brian Ladd. (University of Chicago, $29.95.) With erudition, insight and restraint, Brian Ladd, who teaches history at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, carries off the dangerous task of analyzing architecture and urbanism in the once and future capital of Germany in terms of its horrific political past. He convincingly argues that architecture embodies ideological meaning more powerfully than other artifacts of a society. Berlin, he thereby suggests, is unique in our century for the accretion of so many conflicting memories in its buildings and monuments, several of which have shifted identities to an astonishing degree through successive regimes.
For example, Hitler's fascist-style Ministry of Aviation headquarters, which escaped destruction at the end of World War II, under the Communists became an administrative center for the German Democratic Republic, which was formally proclaimed in the building in 1949. A plaque now commemorates the anti-Communist uprising that focused there in 1953, but makes no mention of the Nazi terror bombardments plotted behind those severe travertine walls. And after the country's reunification, this again-recycled office block housed the Treuhand, the Government organization in charge of transferring state-owned East German property back to the private sector.
THE WORK OF CHARLES AND RAY EAMES: A Legacy of Invention. Essays by Donald Albrecht, Beatriz Colomina, Joseph Giovannini, Alan Lightman, Helene Lipstadt and Philip and Phyllis Morrison. (Abrams/Library of Congress and Vitra Design Museum, $49.50.) Despite their central place in design history, relatively little has been written about the husband-and-wife team of Charles and Ray Eames. Though obsessive self-recorders -- they left an archive of a million papers and photographs -- they deflected others' attempts to interpret their work, which embraced architecture, exhibitions, films, furniture and graphics, often in dazzlingly synergistic combinations, from the 1940's through the 70's.
Aside from the midsize Herman Miller Furniture Company (which manufactured the Eameses' most renowned designs, including the molded plywood "potato chip" chair of 1946), the couple's major clients included I.B.M., Polaroid and the United States Information Agency. Far from becoming corporate (or governmental) tools, the Eameses used their populist philosophy of "the most of the best to the greatest number of people for the least."
This excellent companion volume to the current Eames exhibition that comes to the United States in 1999, starting in Washington and going to three other cities -- organized by the Library of Congress (which preserves the couple's documents) and Germany's Vitra Design Museum (which bought their collection of furniture and prototypes) -- offers perceptive discussions of the pair's diverse output. Most noteworthy is the architectural historian Helene Lipstadt's pathbreaking account of the Eameses' nonpartisan political agenda, manifest in their 1976 Bicentennial exhibition "The World of Franklin and Jefferson." Ever optimistic after a decade of national turmoil, they hoped the show would stimulate a new sense of American community, which they always tried to foster through their ingenious and democratic designs.
THE LIFE AND WORK OF LUIS BARRAGAN. By Jose M. Buendia Julbez, Juan Palomar and Guillermo Eguiarte. Photographs by Sebastian Saldivar. (Rizzoli, $50.) Virtually unknown to the public until a 1976 Museum of Modern Art retrospective, the reclusive Mexican architect Luis Barragan became a cult figure with an international following by the time he died a dozen years later at the age of 86. Barragan's quiet but intense minimalist structures -- mostly houses, defined by monolithic stucco walls, saturated tropical colors and natural illumination -- possess a spiritual quality that connects with many people's notion of an eternal way of building.
Barragan's architecture helped bring modernism back to the elemental strength of its original vernacular sources. Like such older International Style masters as Le Corbusier, Barragan was mesmerized by the traditional architecture of North Africa and saw its particular suitability to the Mexican climate. A genius of environmental integration, Barragan set his low-key structures amid pools, fountains and gardens of his own design, the last of which he aptly called "the most effective refuge from the aggressiveness of the modern world."
"The Life and Work of Luis Barragan" strikes just the right balance between the factual and poetic sides of the architect. Trained as a hydraulic engineer, he grew into an artist whose late works -- especially the Gilardi house of 1975-77 in Mexico City -- attained a degree of almost mystical abstraction that brings to mind the light sculptures of James Turrell. Here Sebastian Saldivar's beautiful photographs effectively convey what the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza in his prologue to this affecting book calls the "simple, dense, physical presence" of Barragan's timeless work.

HEADLINE: Notable Books of the Year 1997

 BODY:
This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Holiday Books issue of December 1996. It is meant to suggest some of the high points in this year's fiction, poetry, nonfiction, children's books, mysteries and science fiction. The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings.
 
FICTION & POETRY 
 ABBREVIATING ERNIE. By Peter Lefcourt. (Villard, $24.) A lively farce about a woman who is tried for killing her husband in an aggravating way; unlike real life, the affair has a moral center in two reporters who finally cry "Enough!"
THE ACTUAL. By Saul Bellow. (Viking, $17.95.) In this novella, intelligence and stylistic beauty compensate for inconsistencies of plot in the story of a man's pursuit of his ideal love.
THE AGUERO SISTERS. By Cristina Garcia. (Knopf, $24.) An exhilarating meditation on Cuba and Cubans in the early 1990's told in the form of a family saga and with a wit that makes the characters easily accessible.
ALIAS GRACE. By Margaret Atwood. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $24.95.) Grisly but playfully devious, spiced with spooky plot twists, this high Gothic novel is based on an actual murder (did the scullery maid really do it?) in 1840's Toronto.
ALL AROUND ATLANTIS: Stories. By Deborah Eisenberg. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) Many of these spirited, powerful stories concern children, affluent and neglected, whose precocious perceptions outrun their power to articulate them.
ALREADY DEAD: A California Gothic. By Denis Johnson. (HarperCollins, $25.) A novel of deep creepiness, with a cast of criminals and nut cases who, just like square folks, long for connection to something, somebody, outside themselves.
ALTERED STATES. By Anita Brookner. (Random House, $23.) Condemned to the mines of despair, the prisoner of Brookner's latest novel -- a man this time -- seeks surcease from a ruinous obsessive love in a cold and misty solitude.
ANDORRA. By Peter Cameron. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) Comic verve is harnessed to a darker purpose in this novel about a wealthy American who seeks refuge from sorrow in an imaginary, and remarkably polite, Andorra.
ASYLUM. By Patrick McGrath. (Random House, $22.) An elegant and restrained but sufficiently gruesome Gothic, narrated by a complacent psychiatrist who assigns textbook pathologies to the dreadful things his patient does for love.
AT THE OWL WOMAN SALOON. By Tess Gallagher. (Scribner, $22.) The poet's second prose collection describes characters exhibiting a bittersweet mixture of deflated New Age wisdom and tired wonder.
THE AX. By Donald E. Westlake. (Mysterious Press/Warner, $23.) The unspoken dread of the American middle class is the engine of this suspense master's novel about a middle-aged middle manager who sees only one solution to being downsized: murder.
BEAR AND HIS DAUGHTER: Stories. By Robert Stone. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A first collection of stories by a novelist of distinction; never less than acute and intelligent, they concern men who are most alive when they are angry.
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO: Stories. By Mary Gaitskill. (Simon & Schuster, $22.) The enviable wealth of emotion and perception in these stories' characters makes them large enough for the author's inspection of women's sexual relations.
BELIEVERS: A Novella and Stories. By Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $23.) Quirky, eloquent, religiously concerned stories that disclose unplumbed depths and unpredictable destinies in people of the most ordinary kind.

HEADLINE: Radio's Renegade

BYLINE: By JULIE LEW

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
For most of his life, Stephen Dunifer did not hesitate to speak out or become involved in causes, from saving redwoods to protesting the Persian Gulf war. But the only cause that has put him in the limelight is his current one: the battle to open the nation's airwaves to small, low-power stations like his Free Radio Berkeley.
His fight began on a night four years ago when he hiked into the Berkeley hills with a radio transmitter tucked in his backpack and sent his voice out over the local airwaves. The battle has since moved to Federal court, where Mr. Dunifer is challenging Federal Communications Commission regulations that set a minimum transmission power standard of 100 watts for any radio station with a broadcast license. 
 For two generations, Berkeley has been synonymous with rebellion against the status quo, with contrarian -- not to mention utopian -- thinking. Mr. Dunifer's notion that anyone with a transmitter should be able to start a radio station fits the egalitarian tenor of the town.
The bearded, genial Mr. Dunifer considers his Free Radio Berkeley broadcasts an exercise in free speech and a galvanizing force for listeners. The station's mix of news, music and political commentary in half a dozen languages, he says, gives a voice to segments of the area ignored by larger stations.
But by operating it, he is ignoring Federal rules. As the F.C.C. continues its efforts to enjoin him from broadcasting, the fight that the 46-year-old self-taught electronic engineer and computer-system designer is waging has become a cause celebre for many of the perhaps 1,000 unlicensed broadcasters nationwide. Many of them, in fact, are his customers; he also sells the equipment needed to start a low-power station.
In their 1993 rebuttal to the F.C.C.'s attempt to fine Mr. Dunifer $20,000 for making unlicensed broadcasts, his lawyers wrote, "the fundamental problem is that the F.C.C. has not provided procedures by which micro radio broadcasters can become licensed or authorized."
But if Mr. Dunifer's advocates see him as a free-speech crusader and the Johnny Appleseed of low-power radio, the F.C.C., the legal guardian of the common property of the airwaves, sees him as a radio "pirate" who is breaking the law, disrupting licensed broadcasters and posing a threat to public safety.
The heart of Mr. Dunifer's argument is that F.C.C. regulations -- particularly a 1978 rule requiring an applicant for a radio license to use a transmitter with a minimum power of 100 watts -- are based on outmoded technological assumptions and set an insurmountable economic barrier for many would-be broadcasters.
In one filing, Mr. Dunifer's lawyers wrote, "The cost of owning and operating a radio station has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands and even million-dollar range," effectively limiting participation in the broadcast media to large corporations only.
Since Mr. Dunifer's court battle with the F.C.C. began in 1993, he has achieved a partial victory. Federal Judge Claudia Wilkin refused in November to grant an injunction sought by the F.C.C. that would have shut Mr. Dunifer's station down pending arguments on his contention that existing rules amount to an unconstitutional restraint on free speech.
But as far as the F.C.C. is concerned, Mr. Dunifer is flouting rules that other broadcasters must live with. In a telephone interview last week, William E. Kennard, the new chairman of the F.C.C., said that the commission had studied proposals to license small radio stations, "and I think they rejected that approach because of interference concerns."
"It's a terrible safety problem," Mr. Kennard said. "Some of these unlicensed broadcasters have chosen bands adjacent to air traffic control channels. We just can't allow a situation where you have illegal broadcasters disrupting communications between pilots and control towers."
That argument means little to Mr. Dunifer. "The air-to-ground frequencies are 118 to 135 megahertz," he said. "There would be no reason for anyone operating in those bands, because no one will be able to hear them." Commercial FM radio operates between 88 and 108 megahertz.
Mr. Dunifer is not the only pirate broadcaster in the F.C.C.'s sights. The commission's push against low-power broadcasters has taken two such stations off the air in the last two months: Radio Free Allston, a noncommercial low-power station in the Boston area, which the agency shut down on Oct. 28, and "Tampa's Party Pirate" in Florida, which was closed last month.
In New York City, the Steal This Radio collective, at 88.7 FM, started its station in 1995 on the Lower East Side with an antenna built from plumbing supplies. It continues to broadcast.
Such stations, Mr. Dunifer argues, serve a vital function in their communities, giving more voices a chance to be heard. The F.C.C., he declares, should accommodate them.
"This is an important case because it shows the really corrupt nature of broadcast policy," said Robert W. McChesney, a scholar who has written several books on mass media. "The reality is that the commercial broadcast lobby is the single most powerful lobby in the country. Given their immense power, it's virtually impossible for any public participation, so the laws are simply undemocratic and corrupt."
In the spring of 1993, the F.C.C., perhaps acting on a complaint, began monitoring Free Radio Berkeley broadcasts, then sent Mr. Dunifer a notice that he would be fined $20,000.
Mr. Dunifer's lawyers contested the fine, leading the F.C.C. to seek an injunction against his broadcasts. Mr. Dunifer was gleeful. "We've gotten our fondest wish, which is to be in Federal court," he said recently. "This was being done basically as a free-speech statement and a challenge to their regulatory and statutory structure."
The specific focus of his challenge, now before the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, is a 1978 F.C.C. regulation limiting the award of new broadcast licenses to stations operating at a minimum of 100 watts. The rule was adopted in an effort to eliminate clutter and overlapping signals, but it also had the effect of raising the price of entry for broadcasters.
"This is the moment for this kind of thing to come together because the technology has made it possible," said Ron Sakolsky, a public policy professor at the University of Illinois.
"If you get an F.C.C. license, you have to initially invest $50,000 to $100,000," he said. "Now, it's possible to do it for a much smaller cost, and people are saying, 'Why can't we go on the air?' "
For those in a hurry to get their soapbox on the air, Mr. Dunifer sells a package for $595 that includes equipment for a half-watt station. It does not include audio gear, but "$1,500 can get you on the air," he said. Half a watt of power sends a signal strong enough to cover about half a mile.
Mr. Dunifer said he emphasized with all would-be broadcasters the importance of taking every precaution to prevent interference with other signals.
Not surprisingly, broadcasters who have paid their license fees and are protective of the clarity of their signals are working with the F.C.C. to shut down low-power stations.
The National Association of Broadcasters says the number of unlicensed micro-broadcasters has been growing as the price of broadcasting equipment drops.
"We want to make sure unlicensed broadcasters and their illegal activities won't be tolerated," said John Earnhardt, a spokesman for the association, which has pushed the F.C.C. to step up enforcement.
Still, in his interview, Mr. Kennard emphasized that he was open to changing the face of the radio spectrum.
"I am personally very concerned that we have more outlets for expressions over the airwaves," he said. "I have made it a point of my tenure here as chairman to try to spotlight the fact that the broadcast industry is consolidating at a very rapid pace. And as a result of this, there are fewer opportunities of entry by minority groups, community groups, small businesses in general. And I'm very interested in hearing ideas to remedy the unfortunate closing of opportunities for a lot of new entrants."

HEADLINE: News-Ad Issues Arise in New Media

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Scrambling to make huge investments in the Internet pay off, some of the biggest news organizations have begun linking advertisements to news on their World Wide Web sites more closely than in the mainstream print or broadcast media.
In recent weeks, CNN and MSNBC have both started running advertisements for the on-line store of Barnes & Noble. The ads offer to sell books tied directly to the topic of the news stories they abut. For example, with a recent CNN article on the killings in a Kentucky high school there was a button promising a link to books on teen-age violence. The news sites collect a commission for each book sold from these ads. 
 The publishers and advertisers say they are trying to exploit the interactive nature of the medium, offering readers a new dimension in easy and relevant shopping. But others, even in the advertising business, worry that as the interests of the publishers and advertisers become more intertwined, the independence of news reporting could be compromised.
"The pressure for ad dollars is so great that some Web sites would do anything to bring in the money," said David J. Moore, chairman of Petry Interactive, a company that sells Internet advertising. "I'm a guy who likes to make money, but to the extent that publishers start to mix advertising and editorial, they risk losing the confidence of the consumer."
The deals have been sought by Internet publishers who are frustrated by the limitations of simply selling advertisements and increasingly looking to earn commissions from sales made through their sites or fees for passing on the names of people who are interested in a product. These arrangements also play into the needs of cash-hungry on-line merchants -- and skeptical producers of mainstream brands -- who want to pay for ads only when they produce results.
"Transaction-driven stuff will account for the lion's share of advertising revenue," said William Doyle, an on-line advertising analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Right now, this is a great medium for direct marketers and not so great for brand builders, in terms of cost efficiency."
Because the Internet is in its commercial infancy, advertisers and publishers are inventing a new set of rules, one that is very different from those in print or broadcast news.
For example, CNN's travel articles all have links to an on-line travel agency, run by the Internet Travel Network, under the CNN brand. And at the ends of book reviews on The New York Times on the Web are links that readers can use to buy the books directly from Barnes & Noble.
Publishers plan sports stories paired with buttons selling team jerseys; compact disks and tickets are for sale with the entertainment news, and coverage of technology trends is accompanied by links to stores selling the latest gadgets.
Yet the ability to create customized advertising for Internet news articles creates added challenges in the already difficult relationship between news and advertising.
Most newspapers and magazines allow advertisers to determine the general placement of ads, say in the sports or business section. And television stations get some of the profits from the sales generated by those late-night ads for miracle knives.
But never before have publications had such a direct interest in sales tied to their news reports. Indeed, to help Barnes & Noble devise a list of recommended books, CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc., sends the bookseller a daily schedule of the top news items on its Web sites, something TV networks ordinarily would not disclose to advertisers.
"Instead of saying the lines are getting blurry, say we are creating a new paradigm that is not editorial and not advertising," said Susan Boster, the director of marketing for Barnes & Noble's Web site. "It is a service offered to consumers."
Beyond simply buying advertising space, the bookseller sees itself as a partner with the various news and information sites.
"Since they get a percentage of each sale, they are encouraged to change their offerings to increase sales," Ms. Boster said. She said that the publishers are given instant access to data about what titles are selling well on other sites so they, too, can include links to the hot books.
With the links just a few months old, Ms. Boster says, it is too soon to say how well they are doing.
Not every publisher is enamored with these arrangements. Some do not want their profits to depend on their advertisers' prices or the quality of the service.
While some sites, like the Web search engines, mingle book sales links with other offerings, some more traditional news organizations have taken pains to segregate them. For example, on the General Electric cable unit, MSNBC, the list of books to buy is identified with the word "advertisement." And officials of CNN's Web sites insist that the links do not compromise its editorial independence.
"CNN takes its journalism very seriously," said Richy Glassberg, general manager of advertising sales for CNN's Web sites. "The advertisers have nothing to do with the content."
Still, Merrill Brown, the top editor of MSNBC, acknowledged that tension had already arisen from the news site's coverage of on-line bookselling. It dealt with the conflicts by removing the Barnes & Noble advertisements from those articles.
Mr. Brown said that while it was easier to prevent such overt biases as treating advertisers in a more favorable light, editors were still being drawn into discussions of the commercial aspects of their publications far more so than in more established media.
"The pressure is not how we cover the news," he said. "The pressure is enormous to make advertising and sponsorships that make sense."

HEADLINE: Orders for Machine Tools Rose in October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
American orders for machine tools rose in October for the second consecutive month, pushing total purchases so far this year above 1996's level, an industry survey showed today.
Orders from American companies for domestic and foreign-produced machine tools rose 6.6 percent to an estimated $699 million in October, from a revised estimate of $656 million in September, said a report from the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association. 
 Three of the five regions surveyed reported an increase during the month. Moreover, October's estimate pushed orders for the first 10 months of this year to $6.87 billion, 17.6 percent ahead of the corresponding period a year earlier.
"Orders from the aerospace and high-tech industries, such as medical and computer equipment, are accelerating, while orders placed by the auto industry for custom-made products are down from peak levels in 1996," said Don F. Carlson, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology.

HEADLINE: Marketing 'Flight Simulators for Business'

BYLINE: BY GORDON ARNAUT

 BODY:
At the Montreal offices of Canada's biggest phone company, visitors peering over the shoulders of the company's top strategists get a glimpse of what appears to be a computer game playing across their screens. If Bell Canada Ltd. is increasingly worried about the entry of competition into its local phone business, why are its executives playing computer games?
It turns out the on-screen villains are rival phone companies -- well, virtual imitations -- created by the software. And the puzzles they are presented with are questions like, "What happens to my market share if a competitor lowers his price?" 
 In gaming sessions, as many as 50 players compete in a virtual world called Telesim, an elaborate telecommunications industry simulation created by Thinking Tools Inc. of Monterey, Calif. "There is a winner and there is a loser," said Michael Park, Bell Canada's vice president for performance, whose job is to enhance the performance of the company through data base and economic analysis. "And the winner is the team that comes up with the best shareholder value for our company."
For example, last November when the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications Commission, the equivalent of the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, introduced measures to open up local phone markets, Mr. Park convened a session of Telesim to help executives brainstorm.
John Hiles, the founder and chief executive of Thinking Tools, describes his company's software as "flight simulators for business." There are about 300 users of Telesim (which costs $100,000 to $200,000, depending on the configuration) at Bell Canada and the software is also used by Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic, AT&T and Sprint.
Another Thinking Tools simulator, called Project Challenge, is a simulation that lets project managers test complex projects to identify possible problems and solutions.
The challenges come in the form of virtual team members, software agents who come complete with attitudes (displayed by means of frowns or happy faces on lapel buttons), who might burst in to complain about someone involved in the project. Team members also represent skills and resources and may present solutions instead of problems.
Project Challenge is used by Comdisco, a computer leasing and consulting company, to teach project management to its consultants. The Pentagon uses it to teach students at the National Defense University.
Thinking Tools has designed custom simulators for Xerox, Andersen Consulting, the United States Army and the task force that put together the Clinton Administration's ill-fated health-care overhaul proposal. Prices range from $500,000 to $1 million.
Using computers to model reality is not new -- simulations were among the earliest computer applications and have been used by scientists, engineers and economists to study everything from the behavior of subatomic particles to the effects of tariffs on international trade. What makes the Thinking Tools simulators different from such conventional models is that they rely on a cast of virtual people -- software that simulates individual behavior.
Known as multiple autonomous agent technology, this approach seeks to reflect more accurately the workings of complex systems like markets or ecosystems by taking into account the random behavior of individuals and the choices they make. "Essentially you have a bunch of tiny little actors running around, each one containing a repertory of behavior," Mr. Hiles said. "That's how real-world systems get to be so surprising and complicated."
In recent years, computer scientists, with cross-pollination from the physical and social sciences, have made strides in creating so-called artificial life inside a computer, in the form of software that exhibits biological rules: natural selection, reproduction and mutation.
Genetic algorithms can compete with each other in solving problems and can mutate by exchanging bits of code with one another, thereby evolving into forms that are increasingly adept at finding solutions.
Much of the research into artificial life, or A-life, is centered at the Santa Fe Institute, a privately financed research center whose sponsors include many Fortune 500 companies. The hope is that A-life will be a practical tool for many users, from multinational corporations to supermarket managers.
But thus far, Thinking Tools is the only company selling products based on the technology. And, while several major companies including Citibank, DuPont, Deere and the British grocery giant J. Sainsbury P.L.C. have invested in the research, it is unclear whether agent models, for all their promise, are yielding any bankable results.
One drawback is the cost: Thinking Tools' latest simulator, Think 2000, which is intended to help managers cope with the year 2000 computer problem, starts at $25,000; the cost of custom programs can reach seven figures.
As a result, Thinking Tools, which lost $1 million on revenue of just $20,000 in its latest quarter, has struggled to increase its sales. The company, which was spun off in 1993 from the Maxis Corporation, has recently shifted its focus from custom-developed simulators for individual clients to shrink-wrapped products like Project Challenge and Think 2000.
Still, the technology has attracted some prominent followers, including Esther Dyson, publisher of the influential computer industry newsletter Release 1.0, who also sits on the board of Thinking Tools. "It'll become mainstream and you won't notice it's there anymore," she said.
These days, many people see agent-based modeling as a powerful tool for business. W. Brian Arthur and John Holland, researchers at the Santa Fe Institute, have built an artificial stock market populated with hundreds of investors. "These little guys get smart by learning which one of their strategies works best," Dr. Arthur said. "As they learn, they're changing around their strategies, which changes the nature of the market."
Michael Schrage, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher and consultant, said: "You don't have to clone an entire human being and raise them from birth to get human behavior. We can get very important insights into how humans behave by imbuing agents with just a handful of very simple rules."
Macy's, which is owned by Federated Department Stores, has commissioned an agent simulation of its retail environment to help it to better understand how things like promotions and sales affect planning issues like store staffing and layout. Coopers & Lybrand, the consulting firm building the Macy's model, is another sponsor of the Santa Fe Institute.
Some proponents predict that the technology will become more accessible within a few years, just as financial analysis using spreadsheets -- once esoteric and expensive -- has become virtually universal.
Dr. Arthur is more cautious: "Yes, I do feel that this will be a major area in years to come. But we're still in the Wright brothers stage."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Other Invasion

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Watching the latest go-round with Saddam Hussein, it would be easy to conclude that in the Middle East nothing ever changes. Things just go round and round. In fact, though, just beyond the headlines there are some intriguing forces at work. Saddam Hussein is not the only agent of change in this region.
Consider three conversations I had recently in the Persian Gulf. The first was with Kholoud al-Feeli, a Kuwaiti woman reporter, who remarked to me: "My brother just got married to a Kuwaiti woman he met on the Internet in a Kuwaiti chat room. They kept exchanging messages and finally met in person, and it was love at first sight. They got married here. Their wedding cake was a computer and a keyboard." 
 A few days later I met another gulf Arab woman journalist, who told me she regularly, but anonymously, files news about her country for a gulf Web site -- "and my Government doesn't know I'm doing it."
The third conversation was with Ibrahim Dabdoub, head of the National Bank of Kuwait: "You wouldn't believe what just happened here," he said to me. "Kuwait Airways needed to finance the purchase of two new Boeing aircraft. We bid on it the way we always do. But some regional American bank called Nationsbank, which no one had ever heard of here, came in and won the contract by offering a super low rate . You don't have to go to the States -- the States is coming to you."
What do these conversations have in common? For years the Arab world has been walled off from the information and financial-market revolutions that have transformed Asia and other parts of the globe. Oil allowed the Arab states to escape many of the pressures for downsizing, streamlining and privatizing their economies. Well, the walls are coming down. For technological and economic reasons the Arabs can't maintain those walls anymore.
One sees several responses. First, there are those who are trying to adapt. Take Fatima al-Abdali, a Kuwaiti environmental health scientist, who owns one of the most popular Internet cafes in Kuwait, Coffee Valley, where you can sip latte and surf the Net. Educated in America, Ms. Abdali wears a veil, as a sign of Islamic piety, but is a total Web-head underneath.
"I had this idea three years ago for an Internet cafe," she told me. "I knew it was coming and that if I didn't open one, someone else would. I realized we can have some control over it, so let's teach people the good parts and make it consistent with our own culture, rather than wait to be invaded by it. I adopted it, and adapted it, and on our Web page now we are slowly introducing some women's rights issues."
Another response is the populist-Islamist backlash, manifested in the Kuwaiti press and Parliament, where globalization is often depicted as a new form of colonialism, secularisim or imperialism. Workers, Government employees and merchants who relied on Government monopolies and subsidies are all organizing against the first tentative steps by the Kuwaiti Government to privatize some services that it can't afford to keep subsidizing.
What's intriguing, though, is that in the latest student elections at Kuwait University, always a bellwether, Islamist candidates got wiped out by the independent, liberal and secular parties. I asked Abdul Aziz al-Sahli, a 21-year-old communications student, why the Islamists may have stalled. "The Islamists are not that impressive anymore," he said. "The secular parties are helping the students more with the small things that students care about now -- Xeroxing, E-mail problems, library books, parking. The society is less ideological now. We need to look for a job."
Indeed, with 60 percent of Kuwait's population under age 20, the Government has got to unleash the private sector to create more jobs. It can't afford the subsidies any longer. It's the same across the Arab world.
Saddam Hussein temporarily upset the Middle East when he invaded Kuwait. Then there was a cease-fire. Saddam might still do something crazy that would explode the whole region.
But in the meantime, there is another, silent invasion going on in the Middle East -- the invasion of information and private capital. And how Arab societies respond to this invasion -- whether by adapting it, adopting it or rejecting it -- will definitely have a huge impact on the future of this region. And be advised: With this silent invasion, there will be no cease-fire.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, a New Generation Discovers Philanthropy

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Steven Spielberg has given more than $45 million to charity in the past five years and vows to commit at least $20 million more by the year 2000. David Geffen has probably given away nearly as much.
Just this year, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, transferred 1.3 million shares of Disney stock, worth $127 million, into his family's charitable foundation, and he recently promised $25 million from his company to help build the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. 
 In Hollywood, a new generation of philanthropists is being born -- and not a moment too soon, some philanthropists would say.
For all their glitzy wealth and self-promotion, residents of Los Angeles, particularly members of the entertainment industry, have been relatively stingy when it comes to charity. The nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles ranked 48th in a survey of giving by the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 1994, the most recent data available. (New York City was 27th, while Minneapolis was No. 1).
"Hollywood has not really been involved in the city until now," said Harold M. Williams, president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which runs the J. Paul Getty Museum and, with its $4.3 billion endowment, does not need to raise money. "While there are incidents of huge generosity, there is, unlike New York, no sense of civic pride that obliges one to give in a sustained or systematic way. There is no Brooke Astor."
Yet Eli Broad, chairman of SunAmerica, the financial services corporation, who has helped raise money for the new concert hall, argues that the Disney gift suggests a resurgence of the old coalition between entertainment, business and civic interests that 30 years ago helped pay for the city's original concert hall and other pioneering civic projects.
Philanthropy professionals trace charity's tepid performance in Los Angeles to several factors. As a relatively new city compared with those in the East, for instance, it has less of a tradition of giving. Its population is increasingly made up of immigrants who are not only new to the city but to the American style of charitable giving. The city's entertainment industry is notoriously volatile, as are the incomes of those who depend on it. Finally, Los Angeles has been battered by natural disasters and economic changes that reduced the financial base for charity.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to philanthropy is the city's geography. In New York City, many of the leading cultural institutions are concentrated in the wealthiest neighborhoods, like the Upper East Side. But in Los Angeles, cultural institutions downtown are far from their well-heeled patrons in Pasadena, the traditionally Catholic and Protestant stronghold, and in the Westside, home of the entertainment industry and Jewish professionals.
"I love downtown," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, which serves mainly Los Angeles County. "But many friends won't go there for lunch, much less dinner. They think of downtown as some kind of Kurt Russell movie."
The city's separation of social elites also complicates fund-raising. Historically, a few prosperous families owned large tracts of Los Angeles and influenced much of its development. But in the early 1960's, as its wealth diminished, the establishment was forced to reach out to the Jewish studio heads of Hollywood and to blacks who had gained a share of power in politics and the civil rights movement.
Dorothy Chandler, the wife of The Los Angeles Times publisher and the city's leading cultural patron, joined forces with Lew R. Wasserman, the head of MCA, the entertainment conglomerate, to build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, the city's first major performing arts facility. The center's largest auditorium, a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
But the alliance between Hollywood and old-line society did not last. In addition, the persistence of what Mr. Shakely calls a "Jewish-Protestant gulf" and the lack of a unified social elite have hindered the civic spirit that underpins philanthropy.
The city's troubled economic base has intensified philanthropic dependence on the entertainment industry, which tends to be cause-oriented, highly personal, and more political than other philanthropic groups. As a result, causes like AIDS and civil liberties often take priority over the city's cultural institutions.
Hollywood charity also tends to be more flamboyant than gifts from other Los Angeles givers, like Katherine B. Loker, an heiress who is said to have given about $20 million to universities, or B. Wayne Hughes Sr., chairman and co-founder of Public Storage, the nation's largest owner and operator of self-storage space, who has given about $25 million to health charities. "Hollywood giving is all about billing," said Edward Bleier, president of pay television and cable distribution for the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner, who lives in New York.
Consider Mr. Geffen, a founding partner of the new movie studio Dreamworks SKG, who is worth an estimated $2 billion and who has given away more than $35 million. The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art now has a Geffen Contemporary annex ($5 million gift); the University of California at Los Angeles has a Geffen Playhouse (another $5 million gift); and the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, an AIDS service organization, has a David Geffen Center for H.I.V. Prevention and Health Education ($2.5 million gift). Fund-raisers in Los Angeles joke that Mayor Richard J. Riordan could solve the city's fiscal troubles simply by changing its name to Los Geffen.
Hollywood givers also like creating their own philanthropies. For instance, Mr. Spielberg, the film director, has chosen to promote Jewish life through two new foundations. He said he also gives to Los Angeles institutions, as well as to "whatever touches me."
But in a break with most of Hollywood, Mr. Spielberg said that at least 25 percent of his giving is anonymous. Likewise, Mr. Eisner, though not yet known as generous by mogul standards, declined to disclose how much he gives each year. But, to lure other givers, he went public with the company's "challenge" gift to the Disney Concert Hall, which depends on other corporate sponsors to donate $25 million more.
Supporters of the Disney hall have raised 80 percent of the money needed to build the 2,350-seat hall, which is seen as a instrumental in reviving downtown and to building the kind of inclusive civic coalition that characterizes New York philanthropy.
The Disney corporate gift took more than a year to secure because the company wanted to insure that a performing arts center would be provided at the hall for students of the California Institute of the Arts, which it supports, Mr. Eisner said.
Nevertheless, supporters say, the gift will shake loose other foundation and corporate money. "Once the city has a few high-profile projects around which all citizens can rally," said Mr. Broad, the SunAmerica executive, "people who have never given will do so and a tradition of giving will finally take hold here."
Others are not so sure. Mr. Williams, of the Getty, said the Disney gift was perhaps the start of a trend. Mr. Eisner said that while that was not his intention, he would be delighted if it had that effect.
"I personally did well in Southern California, so I feel I should give back here," he said.
 Mr. Eisner has done so well, in fact, that on Wednesday, he exercised options to buy about $695 million in Disney stock.
Mr. Eisner said that he might also make an individual gift to the hall for programs if they are consistent with the goals of his family's charity, the Eisner Foundation, to help disabled and disadvantaged children.
Prof. Gary N. Tobin, a philanthropy expert at Brandeis University, called the Disney matching grant "a great step forward," but he was cautious about whether it marked a turning point for Los Angeles.
"Yes, there is Spielberg and other potentially big givers in L.A.," Professor Tobin said. "But will they give to the city's life or to anything? We don't know yet."

HEADLINE: I.M.F.'S NEW LOOK: A FAR DEEPER ROLE IN LANDS IN CRISIS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
For more than 50 years the International Monetary Fund has been imposing austerity plans on countries in crisis. But with the bailout package it agreed to with South Korea last week, the fund is pushing far more deeply than ever before into the day-to-day operations of one of the world's largest economies.
The program will include many of the usual I.M.F. prescriptions, including raising interest rates and taxes, to deal with financial problems that were more dire than the South Korean Government had let on. But the program will try to go much further to overcome stiff resistance within South Korea and bring sweeping changes to a business culture built on close coordination and cronyism between the Government and crucial industries like automotive, shipbuilding and steel. 
 As the bailout of South Korea suggests, the financial crisis that has spread across East Asia has marked a turning point in the role of the fund. Long a stern monitor of general economic probity in developing nations, it has been forced, along with the World Bank and other institutions, to take on bigger, more complex and riskier roles in recent years, starting with Mexico in 1995.
"These international institutions, built for the days of sheltered national economies, must now meet the challenges of the new world of global markets, where no economy can or should shelter for long behind national controls and purely national barriers," said Gordon Brown, Britain's Finance Minister.
So heavy has been the demand on the fund over the past few months that for the first time some analysts are raising questions about whether it has enough money left to cope with future crises, a concern that fund officials said is premature.
In the last few months alone, the fund has had to come to the rescue of three countries that had been models for economic development: Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The fund has also had to attempt to keep the upheaval from destabilizing Japan, Russia, Brazil -- indeed, the entire world economy. Under its leadership, international institutions and individual countries have pledged more than $100 billion in aid to propping up Asia.
As details emerge of how the South Korea bailout will work -- and of how the country's financial condition deteriorated at a frightening pace over the past month -- officials in the United States and around the world are focusing again on the abilities and limitations of the I.M.F., the 181-nation organization based in Washington that is the lender of last resort to tottering economies.
The fund's emphasis has long been on lending to countries whose economies have gotten in trouble because of currency and trade imbalances. Its prescriptions, developed largely by professional economists operating in effect under the authority of the richest countries, have tended to focus on austerity, an approach that makes it less than welcome in many developing countries.
But because it is the only organization that has the money and expertise to keep entire economies afloat in a crisis, governments are often left with no choice but to swallow its medicine.
After accounting for the cost of the South Korea bailout, of which $21 billion will come directly from the I.M.F., the fund will have immediate access to about $44 billion to cope with future crises. In addition, it can win fairly quick access to another $25 billion in backup funding provided by a group of 11 industrialized nations, including the United States.
By virtue of its financial contributions, the United States is the fund's largest shareholder, at 18 percent, and effectively wields a veto over major programs and policies. But officials within the fund and the Clinton Administration have become increasingly concerned about the willingness of Congress to provide more financing.
The fund faces a variety of other issues, including whether the fund can spot developing problems early enough to address them before they reach a crisis point and whether, once a rescue is necessary, the fund has the clout to force the governments of bigger and more powerful nations than it typically deals with to carry out the painful adjustments these countries have accepted.
For the last few years the fund has had only modest success in imposing some financial discipline on one of the largest of its new breed of clients, Russia. And in Asia the fund has grown increasingly frustrated with Indonesia, in particular, for already wavering in its commitment to whip itself into shape. As a result, officials from the fund and the United States approached the South Korea bailout intent on winning agreement to as many specific, detailed provisions as possible to restrict South Korea's wiggle room.
So adamant was Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that the South Korea plan have teeth, people involved in the talks said, that the deal was held up for 10 hours in its final stages before South Korea agreed to such relatively arcane points as implementing accounting standards that would force Korean companies to provide a clearer view of their financial condition.
"The only thing the United States did -- Secretary Rubin -- was to say, look, Korea has no stronger supporter than the United States and we believe in its economic potential and its economic future," President Clinton said in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday. "But we want the plan to be real. And that's what the I.M.F. said they wanted, and that's what we got."
On a general level, the fund's growing role in overhauling the private sector is making it a more explicit advocate of the style of capitalism long championed by the United States, centered on free markets, reduced government involvement in business decisions and more openness.
As a result, the fund is increasingly under attack as a pawn of American policy and as an agent of destruction among Asian countries that have always pursued a more closed, authoritarian capitalism.
Almost by default, the fund has also become the closest thing the world has to a global financial regulator, prodding countries to make sure their banking systems are sufficiently strong and sophisticated to deal with the risks that accompany the huge capital pools that race around the world in search of higher returns.
 
What's Different, What's New
"What's different about the last three programs -- and different from Mexico -- is that banking- and financial-sector restructuring is absolutely at the heart of the program," said Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official. "That's new."
Whether it can effectively play the role of regulator remains a question, given the magnitude of the task and the fund's mixed record in foreseeing and heading off the Asian crisis. In the end, the fund may frequently find itself putting out financial fires rather than preventing them.
Indeed, many experts feel that the very nature of the fund will limit its ability to monitor the inner financial dealings of countries at risk and force them to take painful steps to shape up before their problems worsen.
The experts said the fund's only real leverage is over countries that are already under I.M.F. programs, which Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea were not. Even when the fund has a good handle on emerging problems, as it had with Thailand's deteriorating condition earlier this year, it feels constrained in warning the markets, fearing that disclosure would create the very panic and crisis it is seeking to avert. Mr. Fischer says the fear of making a mistake also acts as a deterrent.
"The problem is that the I.M.F., even when it suspects major problems in a country, has no way of making that country do the right thing until there is a crisis," said John G. Heimann, chairman of global financial institutions for Merrill Lynch. "Pre-crisis, the I.M.F. has a lot of carrots but not sticks. Once the crisis happens, then the I.M.F. can tie conditionality -- the stick -- with money -- the carrot."
The Thailand case illustrates Mr. Heimann's point. The fund's staff became nervous about Thailand's economy last year, but the Thai Government largely ignored repeated I.M.F. warnings, say fund officials.
In the case of Thailand, the fund's mistake was underestimating the seriousness of Thailand's condition because the Government over-reported its foreign currency reserves, a crucial indicator of financial health.
The I.M.F. missed the shrinkage of South Korea's foreign currency reserves, too, say fund officials. The South Korean central bank had been lending some of those reserves at below-market rates to private Korean banks, who needed the money to repay short-term loans from international banks in the so-called interbank market.
 
How to Defend Plunging Currency?
As foreign banks grew increasingly nervous about extending credit to South Korea, the interbank market tightened in November. Therefore, the central bank could not collect its loans. To the outside world, including the I.M.F., South Korea had $30 billion in foreign currency reserves, but the Government actually had no more than half that amount available to defend its plunging currency.
The depth and speed of South Korea's deterioration may have surprised the I.M.F., but fund officials say their swift reaction prevented a real catastrophe.
"The drama of this negotiation resulted from the realization when the mission arrived in Seoul on Wednesday, Nov. 26, of the alarming state of the foreign reserves," Mr. Fischer said. "When we were invited in, Korea was possibly 10 days away from a financial catastrophe, and the urgency to compress negotiations into one week required a ruthless concentration on priorities."
The lesson the fund has learned from the Asian crisis is to improve its surveillance of the financial markets and require better and more timely data.
The Asian situation "shows the importance of having much more transparent information," said one fund official, who said the fund was examining how to get better data on a country's foreign reserves.
This is not a new lesson.
After the Mexican crisis of 1995 caught the fund by surprise, the fund commissioned a secret study that recommended improved data collection and more focus on financial flows, as opposed to trade patterns.
The fund beefed up its ability to analyze financial data and created a new international data standard. Forty-three countries now follow that standard, but Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea are not yet fully in compliance, says a fund official.
The I.M.F. studies every country once a year and issues a report. Countries have resisted efforts by the United States to make the reports public, but starting this year parts of the report can be released, though only with the permission of the individual country.
 
Study of Fund Finds Quandary
This illustrates a quandary highlighted by the 1995 study of the fund: its reliance on member countries. This difficulty is already being played out in Indonesia.
The agreement with Jakarta is not as specific as the agreement with Seoul, and fund officials privately fear that President Suharto may be using the vagueness to backslide on pledges to dismantle inefficient and costly government projects.
The notion of meddling in a country's regulations for private corporations is a long way from the I.M.F.'s creation in 1944 at Bretton Woods, N.H., as the guardian of the world's currencies.
Some critics question whether international organizations, financed by tax dollars from member nations, should have any role in bailing out nations undone by their own failed policies and by investors and lenders who made a bet on them. They favor letting market forces determine winners and losers.
"Absent an I.M.F. bailout, the amount of market reform that would occur and the amount of market opening would be greater," said Lawrence Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Is the Top Lure For Students From Abroad

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Uyen Nguyen, a Fulbright scholar from Norway, came to the New School for Social Research to study Vietnamese refugees in New York. Peter Jacobs came from South Africa for graduate work in economics at Fordham University. Rie Akazawa, a 35-year-old graduate student from Japan, is focusing on speech and communications at New York University.
These students and others have turned Manhattan into the most popular destination in the United States for foreign students, according to a report by the Institute of International Education. 
 Colleges and universities in Manhattan drew nearly 19,000 foreign students in the 1996-97 school year, the report found. The total in the five boroughs was nearly 26,000 and almost 40,000 were on campuses within 50 miles of Columbus Circle.
Last year was the first time that Manhattan -- New York County -- ranked No. 1 since the institute began tracking county-by-county figures three years ago. Los Angeles County, which had previously held that distinction, drew just under 18,000 foreign students in the 1996-97 school year.
More students poured into New York even as the overall number of foreign students attending American colleges and universities remained relatively flat for the seventh consecutive year -- at 457,984, up about 1 percent from the previous year.
That compares with a mere 89,000 American students studying abroad in the 1995-96 school year, the latest year for which data were available.
Institute officials say the United States benefits by having foreign students study here, not just because of the money they spend, but also because of the diversity they bring and the relationships they establish. The meager growth in their numbers "does not bode well" for this country, said Andrew Heiskell, chairman of the institute's executive committee, who predicted that other countries would be competing harder to attract the world's best students.
In recent years, New York colleges have found they have an advantage, as growing numbers of students are attracted by the city itself.
Peter Jacobs, the South African graduate student at Fordham, said he chose New York over Houston because of its range of activities -- he has spent hours at the New York Botanical Garden, the Bronx Zoo and museums -- and its international flavor. Before starting school in the fall, he spent the summer in Boulder, Colo. "It was quiet," he said. "It wasn't so nice. I prefer New York."
Rie Akazawa, the N.Y.U. graduate student from Tokyo, said she was drawn to New York because she thought she would feel more at home in a large city and because of the mix of people here.
"I don't think this kind of diversity can be experienced anywhere else," she said, "and it helps expand my view." In Tokyo, she said, she had English-speaking friends, "but this is beyond what I had there."
Research opportunities are an attraction, too. Uyen (pronounced WEN) Nguyen, the Fulbright scholar at the New School, said she had considered studying Vietnamese refugees in California. But her adviser in Norway, where she is a naturalized citizen, suggested New York, because Vietnamese refugees here have been studied less.
Ms. Nguyen, who is 24, said New York has been fantastic. "There is such diversity in the people and in ways to live," she said, "and people are more open-minded than anywhere else I've lived."
Some American colleges -- particularly specialized ones like the Juilliard School or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- find they easily attract international students.
But many others have developed active recruiting programs. Oklahoma City University, a Methodist-affiliated institution where foreign students make up 31 percent of the student body, set out to attract foreign students 15 years ago in the belief that its American students should be exposed to greater diversity as the economy became more international. Other colleges, like Salem-Teikyo University in Salem, W. Va., have developed overseas affiliations in the face of shrinking enrollments of American students and growing financial problems.
But American colleges are also becoming more creative in trying to draw foreign students, particularly in finding ways to help them pay for study here. N.Y.U., for example, recently introduced a pilot program in which students in certain countries can borrow from Citibank, Chase Manhattan or American Express at terms comparable to those in domestic student-loan programs. And Massachusetts has organized a statewide effort to promote its colleges abroad and offer loans to foreign students who attend public and private colleges in the state.
Boston University ranked as the most popular campus for foreign students, with 4,657, according to the institute's report. N.Y.U. was second, with 4,491 foreign students, and Columbia University ranked fifth, with 3,807. Other popular campuses include the University of Southern California (with 4,183 foreign students), the University of Wisconsin at Madison (3,886) and Ohio State's main campus (3,772).
New York colleges with sizable proportions of foreign students include the Manhattan School of Music, where 40 percent of the student body came from abroad last year; Juilliard (32 percent); Pratt Institute (27 percent), and the New School for Social Research (23 percent). At Columbia, foreign students made up about 19 percent of the student body, and at N.Y.U., 12 percent.

HEADLINE: How a Presidency Was Defined By the Thousand Parts of Its Sum

SERIES: ON THE RECORD -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
By legislation, regulation and exhortation, President Clinton has generated a remarkable number of seemingly modest initiatives.
Though often derided as political gestures, some of the little ideas, from advocating school uniforms to insuring overnight hospital stays for new mothers, have had significant influence around the country. Taken together, Mr. Clinton's initiatives have produced coherent and substantial changes in health care, and to a lesser extent in education and social services. 
 His ideas are screened by pollsters and picked in part to enhance his popularity. But brick by brick, Bill Clinton is proving himself to be the incremental President, accomplishing piecemeal some of what he cannot do all at once.
Having defeated him in some head-on fights, the President's political opponents now worry that he is achieving his goals by other means.
"President Clinton is still trying to get his health care plan into law, piece by piece," said Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is House majority leader. "President Clinton would like nothing more than a triumph of incrementalism whereby he enacts his entire Health Security Act before he leaves office."
In an interview last Thursday, the President became most animated when it was suggested that many of his policy initiatives seemed small-bore. Leaning forward in his yellow armchair, he began scooping the air with his hands as he repeatedly stretched out the word "bi-i-ig" to describe his supposedly little notions.
"A lot of these so-called small ideas make a big difference," Mr. Clinton said. He and his aides maintain that, while many of their initiatives are ridiculed as piddling by politicians in Washington, they loom large in classrooms and at dinner tables everywhere else.
Dealt a series of legislative defeats at the end of Congress's last session, belittled as a lame duck and beset by allegations of campaign finance abuses, Bill Clinton is trying to retain the political initiative in Washington and his grip on the public's attention. To do so, he is relying on an approach he developed from hard experience in his first term.
In September 1993, President Clinton brandished a red, white and blue "health security card" before Congress and proposed to reshape one-seventh of the nation's economy. But after the crushing defeat of his health care proposal, Mr. Clinton found himself the first Democratic President since Harry S. Truman facing Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. His commitment to reducing the Federal budget deficit -- which his aides are coming to view as one of his foremost accomplishments -- further restricted his freedom to propose costly programs.
But Mr. Clinton remained absorbed by domestic policy and eager to prove his political relevance by making it, his associates say. As a result, since 1995 the President has continuously experimented with the powers of his office to generate initiatives, relying more on executive orders and the bully pulpit.
"We developed a process by necessity in the wake of the '94 elections where we had to spend a lot more time focusing on executive action," said Bruce Reed, the director of Mr. Clinton's Domestic Policy Council. "And I think, you know, we have the drill down now."
Many outside the Administration mock the slender ideas, and they have become fat political targets. In a speech last Tuesday, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who has been positioning himself as a Democratic alternative to Vice President Al Gore in the next Presidential race, declared, "Too often, our leaders seem enamored with small ideas that nibble around the edges of big problems."
Prof. Charles O. Jones, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, offered a more nuanced view. He said that the "trivialization of Presidential power" under Mr. Clinton had enabled the President to define a role for himself when, by his own admission, the era of big government is over.
"Here is a guy on a lifetime search for issues, a policy-ambitious President who would like to see himself in the tradition of great Democratic Presidents," said Mr. Jones, a former president of the American Political Science Association. "But he is hemmed in politically. Clinton has found a way to be an activist President in political conditions that would suggest inactivity by the Government."
"Why should the President be interested in these common, ordinary household issues?" Mr. Jones asked. "They show his empathetic quality, his understanding of the little problems that people truly face. And they show there is still a critical role for national political leaders to play when we don't have great big thundering economic or international crises."
Mr. Clinton's approach to policymaking is proudly derivative. He and his aides say that almost every idea they propose has been developed and tested elsewhere, usually at the state and local level. The ideas are culled from newspapers, television, letters from the President's high school classmates, bills pending in Congress and memorandums submitted weekly to Mr. Clinton by Cabinet secretaries and White House officials.
His final campaign is behind them, but the President's aides still seize ideas for political purposes, to advance his chosen themes: community, opportunity and responsibility. They still commission polls to test the popularity of new ideas. But the aides argue that the ideas also make good policy, furthering his efforts to improve education and training, cut crime and protect children.
Consider a sample of the initiatives Mr. Clinton has generated: providing cellular telephones to citizen patrols, keeping liquor advertising off the airwaves, establishing a television rating system, restricting tobacco sales, blocking importation of modified automatic weapons, suspending the driver's licenses of deadbeat dads, encouraging college students to tutor third graders, creating a national registry for sex offenders, holding a White House conference on the brain development of babies, holding another one on child care, subsidizing tuition for people who agree to teach in poor communities, putting safety locks on guns, fighting truancy. And so on.
After Mr. Clinton, in his 1996 State of the Union Message, endorsed school uniforms as a way to promote discipline, cartoonists nationwide mocked the idea as insubstantial. But since then, prodded by the Department of Education, hundreds of schools in big cities and small towns have adopted uniforms and praised them for encouraging school unity and civility.
Mr. Clinton returned to a related theme in his radio address on Saturday. In response to the fatal shootings of three teen-age girls at a Kentucky school, he ordered his Attorney General and Education Secretary to produce "an annual report card on school violence."
Mr. Clinton argues that the little things mean a lot. "For all those kids that aren't going to jail, and for all those people that are safer now, the expansion of curfews or the expansion of school uniforms is not a small thing," he said in the interview. "It is a big thing."
 
Birth of a Tactic
Health Care Tests Policy-by-Increment
No field of domestic policy illustrates President Clinton's revised approach better than health care. Having utterly failed in his efforts to guarantee insurance coverage for all Americans, he has made substantial progress in subsequent efforts to secure coverage step by step, for children and for many adults who switch or lose jobs.
And in the coming year, he appears likely to achieve another goal: Federal regulation of health insurance to protect the rights of patients.
"President Clinton has never changed goals, only strategies," Mr. Armey said.
The stepwise strategy has certain advantages for the President. Mark W. Isakowitz, director of Federal relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, said: "These incremental proposals can fly in under the radar on Capitol Hill. They do not present a big fat target as the Clinton health plan did."
Mr. Clinton showed no desire to return to the health care issue in 1995 and fought Republican proposals to make sweeping changes in Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal programs for 70 million people who are elderly or poor, calling them Draconian.
On Dec. 6, 1995, he vetoed the Republicans' bill to balance the Federal budget, citing "extreme cuts" in Medicare and Medicaid as the main reason.
But Mr. Clinton altered the political dynamic when, in his State of the Union Message in January 1996, he endorsed a low-key effort to make health insurance more readily available to millions of people who change or lose their jobs. The proposal, advanced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Nancy Kassebaum Baker, then a Republican Senator from Kansas, had stalled in Congress, although it was extremely modest by comparison to Mr. Clinton's scheme to redesign the entire health care system.
The endorsement illustrates one of Mr. Clinton's favorite tactics. By embracing a bill, even an obscure one, he can raise its visibility and increase its chances of becoming law.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill followed a tortuous path through Congress, but ultimately proved irresistible in an election year. The measure, signed in August 1996, set a significant precedent for Federal regulation of health insurance, an industry long regulated by the states.
Congress followed that precedent a few weeks later by passing a bill that requires health plans to cover at least 48 hours of hospital care after a baby is born. Mr. Clinton had used a Saturday radio address in May 1996 to endorse such legislation, condemning what he called "drive-through deliveries."
The bill became law in September 1996, over the objections of insurance companies and employers, who said it would open the door to Federal mandates for coverage of specific services. Mr. Clinton is now pushing a bill to guarantee overnight hospital stays for mastectomy patients.
The Administration's efforts to expand health insurance for children provide an even more revealing example of its incremental strategy. In February, the President offered a grab bag of proposals -- Federal grants to the states and changes in Medicaid -- costing $5 billion over five years. With encouragement from the White House, Congress transformed that medium-size proposal into a big new health program for children, costing $24 billion over five years.
As part of the budget agreement, Congress also made vast changes in Medicare, broadening coverage of preventive services and creating a supermarket of insurance options for older Americans. The Medicare changes included many of the Republican proposals from 1995, but Mr. Clinton forced the Republicans to add protections for beneficiaries.
The next step in Mr. Clinton's incremental strategy is a "bill of rights" for health care consumers, guaranteeing access to data on the quality of health plans and the right to appeal a denial of care or reimbursement. "I'm going to fight very hard for it," he said in the interview.
Mr. Clinton used a Presidential commission to forge a consensus. Bypassing Congress, he immediately ordered Federal agencies to comply with the standards, putting pressure on health plans and private employers to do the same.
 
The Follow-Through
For Many Initiatives, It's Show, Tell, Do
Mr. Clinton's small initiatives inevitably reach the public through photo opportunities, contributing to a sense that they are strictly for show. Further, Mr. Clinton has sometimes abandoned them. A $5 billion school repair program, announced with fanfare in the 1996 campaign, vanished during budget negotiations after the election. Mr. Clinton has said he plans to revive it.
But the President's aides have regularly followed through on his small ideas to see that they are put into practice.
For example, in his re-election campaign, Mr. Clinton appeared at a women's crisis center in Sacramento, Calif., to propose that law-enforcement leaders and the telecommunications industry establish a nationwide telephone number for nonemergency calls. That, he said, would free overburdened 911 operators to handle more serious calls.
Mr. Clinton directed the Attorney General, Janet Reno, to see the proposal through, and in February, the Federal Communications Commission set aside a number -- 311 -- for nonemergency calls nationwide.
The Justice Department, to test the number, has been helping pay for a pilot project in Baltimore, where calls to 911 have dropped 25 percent. Dallas and San Jose, Calif., have adopted the 311 system, and other cities and states are considering it.
Questioned about the 311 number, Rahm I. Emanuel, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, began reeling off the names of cities that were considering using it. Asked why he was up to date on the subject, Mr. Emanuel said that a weekly memorandum to the President summarizing agencies' programs had recently described the system. Mr. Clinton, Mr. Emanuel said, had written on it, "Where is the F.C.C. on expanding this to other communities?"
Mr. Clinton often melds politics and policy by appearing with children to announce new initiatives. In August 1996, the President's campaign train stopped in Wyandotte, Mich., where he read "The Little Engine that Could" with two towheaded children. He also announced that he would seek $2.75 billion from Congress over five years to teach third graders to read.
Mr. Clinton's aides immediately tried to give the program heft. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley waived a requirement that colleges pay a quarter of a student's work-study wages, provided the student agreed to tutor elementary school students. Other White House officials began calling on college presidents to line up commitments to the program.
On Oct. 21, Mr. Clinton appeared in the White House East Room to read "The Carrot Seed" with a child -- and to announce that 790 colleges had pledged tutors to America Reads.
"It's a broader way of thinking about the Presidency," said Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, "not just what you can do legislatively, but the full panoply of what you can do with the office."
During budget negotiations over the summer, Mr. Clinton secured about 70 percent of the money he wanted for the program's first year.
Similar follow-through, on a larger scale, has characterized Mr. Clinton's approach to changing the welfare system. Over the fierce objections of most of his Cabinet, Mr. Clinton in 1996 signed a Republican bill radically reducing the Federal role in providing welfare. Since then he has taken several steps to soften its effects.
This year, Mr. Clinton ordered Federal agencies to set an example for private employers by hiring welfare recipients. At a more substantive level, he persuaded Congress to reinstate benefits for some legal immigrants. Congress also agreed to provide money for work programs and to establish a new tax credit for employers hiring welfare recipients. All told, the changes restored more than a quarter of the cuts in welfare spending made by the 1996 law.
 
Ideas for Tomorrow
A Dry Well? Never, Clinton Insists
In the 1996 campaign, Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's political strategist, grilled Cabinet members and other officials for ideas, consulted outside experts and scoured the news -- and then slashed through layers of bureaucracy to take suggestions directly to the President.
Now, Mr. Morris, who resigned in a sex scandal a year ago, said Mr. Clinton seems to have run out of ideas. "As far as the bite-size ideas," he said, "that pipeline's dry and there's no one to generate them, and on the major ideas, he just doesn't have them anymore."
The President says he has no such problem. "We all read everything that's in print all the time, trying to come up with new ideas," Mr. Clinton said. He said that "probably three times a week I read a story in the paper or I see an article in a magazine or something" that prompts him to tell Mr. Emanuel, "We need to have somebody start working on this idea."
President Clinton likes to develop national policy from local success stories. Last Wednesday, at a town meeting on race in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Clinton announced that he would seek money from Congress to create 15 to 25 "educational opportunity zones" in poor urban and rural areas. Through such zones, the Federal Government would assist school districts that agree to make radical changes, like allowing students to choose among schools and making it easier to get rid of bad teachers.
The initiative was prompted by some press clippings about Chicago's success in changing its schools. Mr. Clinton forwarded the clippings to Mr. Reed, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, who began looking for ways to encourage other cities to adopt the same practices.
With his proposal to create a national dialogue on race under fire as insubstantial, Mr. Clinton made the idea an immediate priority for his aides planning next year's budget.
"The President wanted to show that he had a serious school improvement proposal as part of the race initiative," Mr. Reed said.
Mr. Clinton's aides are preparing a series of other small initiatives, together with some larger proposals, for the President's State of the Union Message early next year. Mr. Clinton dropped some hints about those ideas, including one to help provide health insurance to people 55 to 64 years old.
"I got a letter just the other day from a woman who was in my high school class," he said. "Her husband got sick and took early retirement. He's got a pretty decent retirement but they can't afford health insurance.
"And this is a bigger and bigger problem for Americans."

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: Footprints Left by a Lot of Baby Steps"
Some of the ideas and projects pushed by President Clinton:
 
POLICE -- The President promised to put 100,000 more officers on the street under the 1994 crime law. Local police departments have received money for 63,500, of whom 30,000 to 40,000 have been hired and trained.
 
SCHOOL UNIFORMS -- Uniforms have become common at public schools in Miami, Cleveland, Chicago, Boston and New York.
 
AMERICA READS -- Almost 800 colleges have made commitments to find reading tutors for hundreds of thousands of children.
 
CHILD SUPPORT -- The 1996 welfare law requires states to have procedures to suspend driver's licenses, occupational licenses and recreational licenses of those violating child-support orders.
 
WELFARE -- Federal agencies have achieved 20 percent of the President's goal of hiring 10,000 welfare recipients by 2000. The Administration has commitments from 2,500 employers to hire and retain welfare recipients.
 
TV RATINGS -- Most networks have adopted a new, more informative ratings system that uses letters like V for violence and S for sex.
 
SEX OFFENDERS -- Mr. Clinton ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to develop a national registry to track sex offenders and child molesters, just three months before Congress in 1996 passed a bill requiring such a data base.
 
HEALTH CARE -- Among many proposals, the President pushed for a children's health insurance program, enacted this year, that provides money to states to buy private insurance or expand Medicaid for children. (pg. A21)

HEADLINE: Gore, in Japan, Signals That U.S. May Make Some Compromises on Climate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Monday, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore arrived here today hoping to "generate some momentum" in talks on what to do about global warming, and immediately said he had told the American delegation "to show increased negotiating flexibility."
Even as Mr. Gore signaled that the United States might make some compromises, however, he indicated that it remained committed to its original position on reducing rich countries' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. 
 "We came to Kyoto to find new ways to bridge our differences," Mr. Gore told a high-level gathering of ministers from more than 150 countries as they opened the decisive three-day session of the Kyoto talks. But in so doing, he said, "we must not waver in our resolve."
The United States, he continued, "remains firmly committed to a strong, binding target that will reduce our own emissions by nearly 30 percent from what they would otherwise be -- a commitment as strong, or stronger, than any we have heard here from any country."
The Administration has said previously that it would achieve the 30 percent reduction by cutting its emissions of greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2112. That is the target it proposes for all industrialized countries. Environmentalists and European delegates say that target is too low, while representatives of the fossil-fuel industry say it is too aggressive.
The Vice President extended an olive branch to the developing countries, who have resisted the United States' entreaties to commit themselves to some sort of new emissions-control action. "We understand that your first priority is to lift your citizens from the poverty so many endure and build strong economies that will assure a better future," he said. "This is your right; it will not be denied."
But he reiterated the American desire that developing countries and rich ones participate in joint efforts to reduce emissions in the poorer nations.
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said that Mr. Gore had a "prime opportunity" to "make a strong case for why all the nations of the world must be included in any agreement," but that "instead of asking for binding commitments from developing nations, he offered grand rhetoric on global understandings."
What form new American flexibility might take, should it develop, was unclear. Mr. Gore linked it to the adoption of a broad framework encompassing both market mechanisms to reduce emissions and the "meaningful participation of key developing countries."
Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said the call for flexibility did not necessarily mean that the United States would change its position on targets and timetables for emissions reduction, and that there were other areas of possible compromise. One, said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, might be the number of greenhouse gases included in an agreement.
Senator Lieberman called the speech "an important statement that could break the ice jam and result in a major agreement."
Some environmentalists also portrayed the speech as a breakthrough. "At the eleventh hour, the Vice President's statement has given us some cause for hope," said John Adams, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the speech "provided the key to unlocking the global gridlock which has paralyzed the negotiation process."
Other environmentalists were not so positive. Greenpeace expressed "extreme disappointment at the speech's failure to commit the U.S. to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions."
Representatives of the fossil-fuel and energy-intensive industries like the auto makers were cool to the speech. William F. O'Keefe, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group, said the reference to flexibility "suggests that the delegation is willing to go beyond the President's policy. I think that only means greater trouble for the economy."
As the Vice President spoke, perhaps 48 hours remained in which to forge an agreement. While differences had narrowed on some major issues, none were settled.
Two big areas of concern are under discussion. One is the extent to which industrialized countries should reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and on what schedule. The other is the question of the near-term role of developing countries in helping solve the problem.
With the endgame under way, many participants in the talks believed, a settlement was within reach on the question of the rich countries' commitments.
The European Union has proposed cutting emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Japan has proposed cuts ranging from 2.5 percent to 5 percent below 1990 levels for the same three gases. The United States favors cutting average emissions for the period 2008 through 2112 back to 1990 levels, but it would include three other greenhouse gases: hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride.
All six gases trap heat in the atmosphere, although carbon dioxide is by far the most important. The combined effect of the gases, many scientists say, will raise the average global temperature by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions are not reduced. This, say the scientists, would cause the oceans to rise, rains to become heavier, floods, droughts and heat waves to become worse, ecological and agricultural zones to shift northward and growing seasons to become longer in northern climes like those of Canada and Russia.
The European Union also proposes that its member countries be allowed to meet a unionwide cut of 15 percent by requiring some member countries to make deeper cuts while allowing the emissions of others to grow.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. to Sell Pass Providing Limitless Rides

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
For the first time in the 93-year history of New York City's subway and bus system, mass transit riders will be able to buy a monthly or weekly pass good for unlimited rides, transit officials and others familiar with the plan said last night.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the prices of the passes and other details would be announced this morning, when Gov. George E. Pataki is scheduled to hold a news conference. 
 Last night's statements follow two months of intense speculation about what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to do with a 1997 budget surplus that stood at $128 million at the end of September and has been projected to rise to $167 million by the end of the year.
Both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, had urged the M.T.A. to offer riders 12 fares for the price of 10, which would effectively roll the fare back to $1.25, from $1.50, and would erase the 25-cent increase levied in 1995. But an official who worked on the package of discounts said that the 12-for-10 deal would not be offered. The plan also includes a cut in the $4 fare for the M.T.A.'s express buses, the official said.
The M.T.A. has already announced plans to offer Metrocard users 11 fares for the price of 10 beginning in January, effectively cutting the fare to $1.36, and officials said that plan would still be offered. Riders will still be able to buy Metrocards encoded in smaller dollar amounts, the official said.
"The Governor wants to provide riders with a wide range of choices," he said.
Most major American cities have some form of unlimited transit pass, with the price of a monthly pass ranging to the equivalent of 30 rides in Atlanta to 59 rides in Chicago.
Without knowing the price of the pass, transit advocates could not say whether it would necessarily be a better deal than the 12-for-10 proposal. But Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group that has been pushing for a fare cut, said that, provided that the monthly pass was "reasonably priced" -- around $60, say, the equivalent of 40 rides -- the pass could be "tremendous."
"A monthly pass is the single most dramatic move transit officials can make to attract New Yorkers out of cars and onto transit," he said. "Once you have a pass, why take a cab or take a van or drive a family car? You already have bought access to the transit system for a month." He said that M.T.A. studies have shown that a $60 monthly pass would attract 89 million new riders to the system, a ridership increase of 6 percent.
The option of a weekly pass, Mr. Russianoff added, was good news for working people with low incomes, who tend to be the most heavily dependent on mass transit and who advocates said might not be able to afford to buy their transit a month at a time. "That is a very serious attempt to make sure that the pass is within the reach of riders of very modest income," he said.
Assuming that there are 20 workdays a month, a monthly card priced at $60, the equivalent of 40 rides a month, would allow a regular commuter to take mass transit essentially for free on weekends. Put another way, if the pass cost $60 and its holder made a round trip every day of a 30-day month, the effective fare would be only $1. If the card were priced at $67.50, the equivalent of 45 rides, a card holder who made a round trip would be paying an effective fare of $1.12.
The decision to offer a monthly pass rather than the 12-for-10 discount was motivated in part by political one-upmanship, officials said. Mr. Vallone, the most vocal proponent of the 12-for-10 deal, is considering running against Mr. Pataki next November, and many officials said they felt the Governor wanted to offer something even more impressive.
But a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, Michael S. Clendenin, was not complaining last night. "We still think 12 for 10 is the easiest option," he said, "but over all, this is still a great victory for transit riders, who will be getting back the surplus that they earned."
The surplus is the result of a number of factors, primarily the city's booming economy -- a fraction of the sales tax goes to transit -- and a jump in ridership. The free bus-to-subway transfers the M.T.A. began offering in July apparently attracted thousands of new riders to the system and yielded an increase in revenue rather than the big drop officials were expecting. For close to two months, advocates urged the M.T.A. to put the surplus to use, either to cut fares, increase service or pay off debt, lest the state or city grab it away, as happened with past surpluses. But M.T.A. officials said that they could not be sure the financial picture would stay rosy and that they were hesitant to make plans. Last Tuesday, however, the agency's Executive Director, Marc V. Shaw, said that a fare break would be announced soon.

HEADLINE: Denied Food Stamps, Many Immigrants Scrape for Meals

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
In Manhattan, a 53-year-old workfare participant from the Dominican Republic sweeps the city streets, searching for a glimmer of silver amid the trash. And he pockets the dirty nickels and dimes for food with a desperation that leaves his cheeks burning with shame.
In Brooklyn, a 42-year-old mother of four from Trinidad spends her rent money on food, buying grape Kool-Aid instead of orange juice and canned tuna instead of fresh beef, and edging ever closer to eviction. 
 And in the Bronx, a 40-year-old woman from Peru rides the subway from food pantry to food pantry, pleading for groceries to fill her refrigerator. One turns her away because she lacks a referral. Another runs out of rice, spaghetti and green apples while she waits in line.
"I'll keep looking," the woman, Rosa Dolone, said wearily as she walked out of the crowded church into the cold winter morning. "My children have to eat."
In the first wave of welfare cuts to hit New York City under the Federal welfare law, more than 50,000 able-bodied legal immigrants between the ages of 18 and 59 have been denied food stamps since September. The law, which was intended to move foreigners off public assistance and into jobs, has pushed an estimated 770,000 immigrants off the food stamp rolls across the nation, Federal officials say.
And as the months pass and kitchen cupboards grow barer, immigrants who earn on average about $10,000 a year find themselves giving up fresh meat, spending rent money on groceries, lining up at food pantries and hunting for work in a city where the unemployment rate stands at 9.1 percent, nearly double the national average.
Calling the situation a crisis, Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, proposed on Nov. 26 spending an extra $2 million to restock food pantries running short of supplies. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani agreed, and promised to have his aides survey the city's food programs to determine their needs.
The demand for emergency food had surged even before the food stamp cuts, although it is unclear what had driven the increase. In the fiscal year that ended in June, the city distributed 9.3 million pounds of food to soup kitchens and food pantries, a 52 percent increase over the previous year, city statistics show.
But while advocates for the poor worry that hunger is on the rise in New York City, few of the more than a dozen immigrants interviewed recently said they were actually going hungry. Instead, they appeared to be sliding deeper into poverty, joining the long line of needy people forced to devote more time and more energy into stretching food dollars and filling stomachs.
Single adults and immigrant families, in particular, are struggling to survive with less. State officials have agreed to finance food stamps for the elderly, the disabled and children, with the city contributing $26 million, but able-bodied adults no longer receive those benefits. And Houth Leng of Cambodia now gets $127 a month in food stamps instead of $354 for himself and his six children.
In a shabby brick tenement in the Fordham section of the Bronx, Mr. Leng can still afford to make chicken soup for his children, but he has eliminated snacks and has fallen a month behind in the rent.
In Flatbush, Brooklyn, Nicole Joseph of Trinidad crawls into bed some nights with a cup of Maxwell House coffee and a growling stomach while her two boys dine on leftover chicken stew. "It makes the food last a couple more days," she said.
And in Washington Heights, Elisa Osorio of the Dominican Republic waited an hour last Wednesday in a line that began in a dimly lighted church basement on Broadway and spilled into the street, joining a queue of grizzled men, wrinkled women and young mothers, all hoping for a bag of groceries, including powdered milk, a can of no-name tomato juice, an 18-ounce box of Kellogg's cornflakes, white rice and some sweet potatoes.
"I have nothing at home, just some water, milk and rice," said Ms. Osorio, 22, who lost $214 a month in food stamps and sends her three children to her mother's apartment to eat.
But while the jostling crowd peered anxiously at the white plastic bags filled with groceries, the Washington Heights Ecumenical Food Pantry ran out of tomato juice and cornflakes.
"We'll just have to give them more rice," sighed Oswaldina Carrillo, the pantry's coordinator, as she packed the grocery bags.
Some local merchants say they also feel the sting of food stamp cuts. And in the Fordham section of the Bronx, where some Cambodian immigrants now buy chicken wings instead of fresh fish, and in the Inwood section of Manhattan, where Dominican mothers cook more rice and beans than beef, some store owners say they see fewer customers.
Ramon Hernandez, manager of Los Prados Meat Market in Inwood, often stands in an empty shop these days, his white apron bloodied by the meat his customers can no longer afford. He used to take in $600 a week in food stamps. Now, it is only $200.
"It's hard on them and it's hard on us," said Mr. Hernandez, who was forced to lay off one of three employees, but still gives his customers orange juice and sweet sausages on credit. "Everyone is suffering."
But the impact of the cuts seems to vary neighborhood by neighborhood. Some food pantries, including Washington Heights Ecumenical, say they have benefited from holiday largess. The Northern Queens Family Center in Astoria, for instance, was well stocked last week. And the Coney Island Gospel Assembly pantry in Brooklyn fed only three families last Wednesday.
In a random survey of 42 food pantries conducted by the city several weeks ago, none reported having to turn away anyone, said Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The city is currently conducting a broader survey of hundreds of emergency food providers to better assess the need.
In March, the city filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government to prevent the cuts in food stamps and other benefits to immigrants, saying the loss of Federal food dollars would cause "extreme hardship, hunger and malnutrition."
The city lost that legal battle, but advocates for immigrants and city officials say the situation is less dire now that state officials have agreed to cover the most vulnerable immigrants, about 67,000 people across the state. "That has not solved the problem, but it has certainly ameliorated it," Mr. Coles said.
But advocates for the poor say it is not enough. The New York City Coalition Against Hunger, an association of food programs, has reported a growing crisis, with 73,000 families and individuals turned away from emergency providers when food runs out each month.
But Mr. Coles, who noted that city spending on food programs has increased steadily over the last four years, said the city's preliminary surveys did not yet support that.
But no one denies that thousands of immigrant families are now struggling. Janice Arrieta, the 42-year-old Trinidadian mother of four who buys Kool-Aid instead of juice, lies sleepless most nights as she frantically calculates her shrinking budget.
She used to receive $248 each month in food stamps. Now she receives $179. She has fallen behind on her rent and her electric bill. A widow and a welfare recipient for several years, she is now looking for work.
That is exactly what the Republican Congressional authors of the Federal welfare law hoped would happen: that the new law would force immigrants on public assistance to move into the work force. And Ms. Arrieta, who used to be a cook in a restaurant, says she would welcome the opportunity to work.
But she has yet to find a permanent job. A temporary position as a home health aide paid $5.75 an hour, but lasted only four days. So she continues to scrimp and scrape, baking her own bread, going without meat and telling her children she can no longer afford fancy cereals like Froot Loops.
"Sometimes you feel like giving up," Ms. Arrieta said wearily. "The kids want this, the kids want that, and you just get depressed thinking about how life is."
But with four children to feed, she has little time for depression. So she whispers a prayer and gets back to the business of getting by. "I cook rice," she said. "Rice will always fill you up."

HEADLINE: Japan Official Hints at Sale Of U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Japan's governing party has suggested that the Government is considering selling some United States Treasury bonds to shore up the nation's ailing banks. Such sales could have far-reaching effects on financial markets around the world.
Such sales were last hinted at this summer, when Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made offhand comments about Japan's holdings during a visit to New York. 
 His remark that Japan might be tempted to exchange Treasuries for gold sent stocks plunging in New York, with the Dow Jones industrial average giving up one of its largest single-session losses since Black Monday in 1987. The Japanese Government subsequently denied that Mr. Hashimoto was talking about selling the holdings.
It is not clear whether the comments, which were made on Sunday by Taku Yamasaki, a top policy-making official of the Liberal Democratic Party, were a reflection of the Government's real intention to sell its Treasury holdings or a trial balloon meant to lift the yen. The yen fell to a five-year low of 130 to the dollar in trading on Friday.
Japan holds more than $300 billion in Treasury bonds, and with its financial system so frail, a big question among market players has been whether Japan will sell some of its holdings to bail out weaker banks. Traders worry that if Japan begins to dump its Treasury holdings on the market, bond prices might plummet, raising interest rates in the United States. That, in turn, could hurt American stocks and American industry and ripple around the globe.
A huge sale of Treasuries by Japan has long been regarded as a prospective nightmare in global financial circles, but that is considered very unlikely because Japanese investors themselves would be hurt. Treasuries offer them a safe investment that yields a much higher interest rate than Japanese bonds. By selling bonds, moreover, Japan would help drive down the value of the rest of its portfolio.
The plan being discussed by the Liberal Democratic Party is to sell only a part of the Government holdings, Mr. Yamasaki said. Mr. Yamasaki added that he expected the move to have little impact on the market.
"There would be little negative impact even if the yen gains strength, now that the yen has depreciated to such a low level," Mr. Yamasaki said on Sunday. "I think an exchange rate of 120 yen to the dollar would be appropriate."
In fact, the falling yen would help Japanese exporters by making their products cheaper in world markets. But the Government worries that the falling yen and rising exports would cause dangerous new trade frictions with the United States.

HEADLINE: Two Swiss Banks Plan a Merger, Forming Global Financial Giant

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE with PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
Two banking giants, Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, announced early today that they planned to merge, creating the world's second largest bank.
The proposed merger would be one of the largest corporate deals ever, and it is the latest in a recent series of deals in the global market for financial services. Banking companies in Europe, like those in the United States, have been on a buying spree to expand their markets and increase their ability to compete around the world while cutting costs. 
 The companies said that the merger, which was announced at a news conference in Zurich, before the opening of European financial markets, would lead to cuts of as many as 13,000 jobs worldwide -- 7,000 of the two banks' 40,000 jobs in Switzerland, and another 6,000 among their roughly 18,000 overseas employees. The job losses are likely to fall heavily on the banks' operations in New York; both banks are among the largest foreign financial institutions in the United States.
The combined bank is to be called United Bank of Switzerland, with corporate and consumer banking operations headquartered in Zurich, while the private banking unit will be based in Basel. It would control $592 billion in total assets, putting it behind the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi of Japan, which controls $696 billion in assets.
By contrast, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the largest American banking company, with $340 billion in assets, does not even rank in the top 10 of the world's banks in terms of assets.
A merger of Union Bank and Swiss Bank would also create the world's biggest money-management company, surpassing the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments.
Banking industry analysts said the deal would encourage other large financial companies around the world to pursue mergers of their own to remain competitive.
"This will ring the bell for everybody around the world," said John Keefe, who runs Keefe Worldwide Information Services in New York. "This will be a signal to the top few players that they have to increase their scale. Morgan and Citibank and Chase will have to think about what they are going to do."
Some details of the merger were unclear last night, but Marcel Ospel, the tough Swiss banking executive who until now has run the Swiss Bank Corporation, which is based in Basel, was appointed as chief executive of the combined bank. Mathis Cabiallavetta, who is now chief executive of Union Bank, which is headquartered in Zurich, the Swiss banking capital, was appointed the new bank's chairman.
The deal involves an exchange of stock. Shareholders of Union Bank, Switzerland's largest banking company, are to own 60 percent of the equity in the new bank, while shareholders of Swiss Bank, which ranks No. 3, are to own the remainder. The merger will require the approval of shareholders as well as Swiss antitrust authorities. Shareholder votes on the merger are to take place on Feb. 3 and 4.
Rumors that the banks were about to make an announcement buoyed the stock prices of both banks in recent days.
But the Swiss banks have been struggling in recent years, and the banks reported their first losses ever last year, as the Swiss economy was hurt by recession, and as the traditional fortresses of the Swiss in asset management and international investment banking were assailed by revitalized American institutions like Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Goldman, Sachs and others.
Changing economic conditions around the world, as well as the slump in Switzerland, are the driving forces for the deal. The merger, though, does come at a time when Switzerland's banks, and notably Union Bank, have also come under heavy fire for their handling of the accounts of victims of the Nazis. This week, the banks got a brief respite after a three-month moratorium was announced by United States city and state financial officers who had threatened punitive action. In coming months, however, the banks are expected to face mounting pressure to reach an out-of-court settlement in New York, where they face class-action suits from Holocaust survivors and their heirs.
Union Bank came under particular criticism earlier this year, after a security guard came across documents relating to the sale of Jewish property in Germany being shredded in the bank's basement. The guard passed them to a Swiss Jewish organization. The guard, Christoph Meili, was dismissed from his job, and later fled to the United States, where Congress accorded him and his family residence rights.
Reports of possible mergers swirled through the world of international finance at least since last year, when an approach by Credit Suisse, the No. 2 Swiss banking group, unsuccessfully broached the idea of a merger to Union Bank. Undaunted, Credit Suisse announced earlier this year an $8.8 billion takeover of the big Winterthur Insurance Company. This regrouping, plus a surge in net profits thus far this year, as the big Swiss banks cashed in on increased earnings on securities trading on the world's bull markets, have caused Swiss bank stocks to catch fire recently, rebounding strongly after several years of weak performance.
In addition to long-established commercial banking businesses in the United States, both Union Bank and Swiss Bank have a broad range of other financial service companies. In recent years, the Swiss Bank Corporation acquired O'Connor, a Chicago derivatives business; S. G. Warburg, a British investment bank with a sizable Wall Street presence, and Dillon Read, a venerable old-line American investment bank with blue chip clients, but with a declining market share in the main Wall Street businesses. Union Bank, for its part, has tended to acquire teams and individuals to bolster its ambitious plans for the United States. It was Mr. Ospel who, in 1995, persuaded Swiss Bank to take over Warburg.
A merger of Union Bank and the Swiss Bank Corporation would create a mammoth money management company, with assets under management of more than one trillion Swiss francs, about $670 billion, pushing it past Fidelity Investments in the United States as the world's biggest money managing company. Union Bank's position as the world's No. 3 money manager came under assault last month, after Merrill Lynch announced it will acquire the Mercury Asset Management Group of Britain for $5.2 billion. The acquisition raised Merrill Lynch's assets to $450 billion.
The merger is the latest move in a scramble among European banks and insurers to restructure their businesses as the introduction of a single European currency approaches. Since Switzerland, which is not a member of the 15-nation European Union, will not take part in the union, its banks are hustling to get access to the single currency area through acquisitions and cooperation accords. Thus in August, Union Bank paid $196 million to acquire Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a Frankfurt private bank, in a move to expand in Germany.

HEADLINE: Old Man Bandwidth;
Will Commerce Flourish Where Rivers of Wire Converge?

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Three years ago, Brian Reid came away from a tour of California's missions with an epiphany that today is transforming this cornerstone city of Silicon Valley into the nerve center of cyberspace.
Mr. Reid, a computer scientist with the Digital Equipment Corporation, had done pioneering work in the 1970's on the Arpanet, the computer network that would evolve into the Internet. While playing tourist with his fourth-grade daughter in 1994, he realized that each 16th-century mission he had visited represented an experiment in urban planning; those that combined the right economic, geographic and social factors eventually blossomed into cities. 
 Just as centers of commerce sprang up along navigable rivers, around natural harbors and parallel to railroad tracks and major roads in earlier centuries, Mr. Reid came to believe that the commercial hubs of the next millennium would take root around pipelines that carry torrents of computer data.
"Bandwidth is the delivery vehicle by which these companies sell their goods in the information age," Mr. Reid said last week. "Bandwidth in the late 1990's is important for commerce in the same way that railroads were important in the 1890's and seaports were in the 1790's. It's the way you sell your product."
As applied to the Internet, bandwidth is a measure of how much data can flow between any two computers at any given moment. The Internet can be seen as a system of larger-to-smaller pipes or the branches of a plant's roots. The closer your computer is to the Internet backbone -- that is, to the fattest pipes or roots in the system -- the more data you can send and receive in any given second. And data, whether encoding streams of video or customers' orders, are the raison d'etre of the Internet.
Mr. Reid, who heads a team of network engineers at Digital, is realizing his vision in Palo Alto, where a combination of public and private investment has created the highest-capacity switching point on the Internet. Last spring, the City of Palo Alto completed construction of a $2 million, 15-mile-long fiber optic ring that snakes beneath these suburban streets and culminates in Digital's new Internet Exchange, which the company bills as the world's biggest on-ramp to the Internet.
The combination is proving to be a powerful magnet for bandwidth-starved companies, from start-ups like WebTV Networks and E*Trade Group to established businesses like the venture capital firm Accel Partners. In the process, it is transforming this city into the nation's premier Internet address.
"It's like being right on top of the nexus of five major railroads," said Steven Pearlman, chief executive of WebTV, the Internet television start-up that was acquired earlier this year by the Microsoft Corporation.
As a result, along University Avenue, Silicon Valley's version of Rodeo Drive and the commercial street that connects the city to nearby Stanford University, chic restaurants, furniture and bookstores and latte and burrito stands are bustling with engineers, programmers, venture capitalists and hackers drawn here by the chance to grab a chunk of bandwidth in the land rush of the information age.
At the same time, the rapid growth of Internet commerce is supercharging the economy of Silicon Valley. Technology companies like Dell Computer and Cisco Systems -- each of which expects to sell more than $1 billion of hardware on the World Wide Web in the next year -- are being joined in the rush to electronic commerce by old-line companies like General Motors, which has begun selling cars and trucks on line.
And while Dell and G.M. are not situated in Silicon Valley, it is widely believed that the surge in on-line commerce worldwide increases the economic advantage for this region. Already more than 50 percent of all worldwide traffic on the Internet passes through Northern California.
"Silicon Valley's initial regional advantage is being reinforced through early and massive leading-edge investments in technological infrastructure," said Annalee Saxenian, a University of California at Berkeley professor in the department of city and regional planning. "Through this process, Silicon Valley will compound its advantage relative to competing regions, just as the manufacturing belt did in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
Palo Alto's investment in a fiber optic infrastructure capable of connecting to Digital's Internet Exchange at blinding speed is attracting companies like Accel Partners, which relocated here in November from San Francisco, leasing a three-story building on University Avenue. Accel's executives said that the availability of high-speed Internet connections was a crucial factor in their decision to move.
"Easy access to state-of-the-art video and data played a central role in how we thought about building our new headquarters," said Jim Breyer, an Accel partner.
Palo Alto's fiber-optic data and voice network comes within one mile of every home and business in the city. It will permit residents, businesses and organizations to link to the global computer network at speeds that will dwarf even today's fastest cable modems.
It will also offer far greater speeds than the fastest digital connections being planned by telephone companies. Symbolically, the ring intersects the Internet in the basement of the building that was once the local telephone company's switching office, just half a block off University Avenue, where Mr. Reid's team installed the world's most powerful private Internet exchange point.
But telephone companies are also players in Digital's exchange: four currently supply a total of 14.9 gigabits a second of data capacity -- the equivalent of 193,500 simultaneous voice telephone calls. What is more, Digital's hub has enormous additional capacity: it can be expanded to support the equivalent of 87 million simultaneous calls.
The building, which was 100 percent occupied in July, just 10 months after opening, now houses the equipment for 35 Internet service providers, including @Home, WebTV Networks, Deutsche Telekom North America, Hongkong Telecom, Internet Initiative Japan and UUNET Technologies. It is also connected to the world's longest OC-3 fiber network link to Asia, a beachhead for Japanese corporations that want to conduct Internet business in the United States. (An OC-3 cable carries 155.5 million bits a second, the equivalent of about 2,016 simultaneous phone calls.)
A primary attraction of this kind of exchange point is that it permits companies conducting sales over the Internet to put their Web servers at the spot where Internet data flows most swiftly, making them easily accessible to millions of customers. (Deutsche Telecom, the German telecommunications giant, also chose this location for its Internet services to experiment with aspects of electronic commerce precluded by heavy regulation in Europe.)
Just as important, the Digital Exchange serves as a neutral meeting ground for the world's largest fiber optic communications companies.
The first Internet exchange points, known as Network Access Points, or Naps, were established in the early 1990's, when the National Science Foundation set out to privatize the Internet. Then, in 1995, a growing traffic jam in Internet data led to the idea of a private exchange service that would bypass much of the congestion at the original Naps.
To be sure, many of the nation's cities and private telecommunications companies are also racing to deploy fiber optic networks. In California, other ambitious fiber optic infrastructure projects are under way in Los Angeles, San Diego and Anaheim. On the East Coast, the City of Winston-Salem, N.C. will complete its own fiber network in January.
But Palo Alto, Mr. Reid said, offers a unique synergy of culture, business and technology. "If you're trying to launch a new business model, you have to do what the padres did," Mr. Reid said, alluding to the Spanish missions that inspired Digital's exchange. "This is the beginning of the infrastructure of the economy of the new millennium."
There is a tremendous commercial advantage to be gained by placing the most popular Internet services directly at the peak of the bandwidth pyramid, Mr. Reid says, since it cuts out the need to push data "upstream" to the exchange.
"Everyone wins because there is half as much traffic on the Internet," he said.
To stress-test the hub's capacity and robustness, Mr. Reid's team using Digital's popular Alta Vista search engine as an "attractive nuisance." Unarguably the most powerful search engine on the Internet, Alta Vista handles 25 million queries a day and delivers 62 million pages to users. Despite those levels of traffic -- about 15 times the traffic for the most popular news and entertainment sites on the Web -- Alta Vista has remained the fastest and most robust search engine on the Net.
But access to the Internet is not the only need that businesses have for bandwidth. High-speed intranets and local area networks also allow companies to unite workers at numerous remote sites into a single "virtual office."
Early on, Mr. Reid also approached the City of Palo Alto, asking that Digital be permitted to run fiber optic cables through city conduits to interlink its nine research laboratories in the downtown area into a single virtual office building. That model helped attract WebTV, which, since it was founded here two and a half years ago, has rapidly spread to 10 office sites in downtown Palo Alto.
The virtual office model is now viewed by economists and Silicon Valley executives as the corporate archetype of the new information economy inspired by Internet commerce.
Harry Saal, chairman of Network General, a Silicon Valley computer networking company, said, "Fiber optic networks have meant that we are able to create distributed network-like businesses without resorting to the high-rise model."
While employment of the new fiber optic infrastructure here has so far been all business, that may change soon.
"Palo Alto is undergoing a transition to an information-based economy," said Van Heimke, the city's telecommunication manager. "The early market is the commercial one, but there will be school and residential markets as well."
About 80 percent of the city's homes have personal computers, and according to PA-COMNET, a local organization pushing for higher speed Internet access for the community, Palo Alto already has the highest per-capita Internet use in the world.
On Dec. 1, Mr. Heimke's department proposed to the City Council that the city enter into negotiations with companies that are developing advanced fiber-optic consumer-oriented Internet technology with the goal of bringing an ultra-high-speed Internet connection to every business and residential address in the city. The proposal will be taken up this week.
The city government has its own reasons for wanting to wire the entire city. It is already moving some of its bureaucratic procedures, like filing building permits, to the Internet, and officials say they expect that this is only the first step.
"We set out to be the first city on the Net," said Liz Kniss, a City Council member and former mayor of Palo Alto. She also predicted that the arrival of residential fiber optic networks would fundamentally alter community life.
"The impact of the Internet has already become so apparent," she said. "The other day I was looking for a local soccer schedule. It's midnight, and who are you going to call?"

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about a new fiber optic network in Palo Alto, Calif., misstated the age of California's historic Spanish missions, which were cited by a Palo Alto scientist as inspirations for his vision of the network. Most missions were built in the 18th century, not the 16th.

HEADLINE: Corporations Adopt a Different Attitude: Show Us the Value

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
AVON PRODUCTS used to support causes that alleviated human suffering. Today, it gives only to programs that relate specifically to women, its primary customers. So March of Dimes and lung cancer associations are out; scholarships for women, and breast and ovarian cancer groups are in. "Our giving has to be in line with our vision for the business," said Marcia L. Worthing, the senior vice president for human resources.
AT&T, which no longer makes phone equipment, has stopped financing charities in foreign countries where it had manufacturing plants. It is funneling the money to Internet-related education programs in California, Illinois and the handful of other states where it has introduced local phone service. "We're investing in communities and causes that represent our primary markets," said Timothy J. McClimon, the executive director of the AT&T Foundation. 
 Say goodbye to the days when corporations blithely wrote checks to many worthy causes -- or to all groups that counted the chairman's spouse on its board. Say hello instead to the new world of "strategic giving," the fancy phrase that corporate-giving gurus use to describe how every dollar or product they give must mesh with the company's markets or employees.
"Corporate philanthropy has always brushed up against marketing, public relations, government relations and human resource management," said Craig Smith, a senior fellow at the Conference Board in New York, which researches corporate trends. "But now companies are far more explicit about using it as a subtle means of manipulation."
Most corporate chiefs would bridle at Mr. Smith's wording, but few would disagree with his premise. "The chief executives are all asking, What kind of value are we getting for our investment?" said Curt Weeden, the vice president of corporate contributions at Johnson & Johnson. Paul M. Ostergard, the head of the Citicorp Foundation, added, "It's a lot easier to persuade top management to increase philanthropic giving when they're certain it addresses the right priorities."
In a sense, the trend is a logical extension of the strategic changes that have swept corporate America in the 90's. One by one, companies have dispensed with sentimentality and shed longtime products and services that no longer provided the best return on investment. Corning no longer makes Corningware; Monsanto has moved out of basic chemicals; Westinghouse is exiting everything but radio and television.
Inevitably, charities have fallen prey to the same paring knife. The Metropolitan Opera or the American Cancer Society or the local Little League club might have been on the giving list for decades. But if the cause does not somehow support the core business, it is out.
Companies have not used strategic giving as a flimsy excuse to get stingy, though. According to the Conference Board, American companies and their foundations donated $8.5 billion in cash and products last year, up from $7.9 billion in 1995. Although a growing number of those dollars are leaving the country as companies try to shore up their images overseas, that still leaves ample sums for American causes.
Chief executives are also proving to have deep pockets. Bill Gates, for example, has earmarked $200 million of his personal money to connect libraries to the Internet. And Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and Time Warner's vice-chairman, has pledged a total of $1 billion to the United Nations.
A growing number of companies match any employee's charitable donation, whether or not the charity is on the strategic list. Many companies also offer grants to causes at which employees -- or, better still, teams of employees -- volunteer.
Take the American Express Foundation. It will give away $23.2 million this year, mostly to historic preservation, arts and education programs that tie in with its financial services or travel and tourism businesses. Yet over the last three years, it has given almost $850,000 to diverse causes that include an organic garden project, a traveling mammography van and a cat rescue program. The unifying theme: American Express employees work as volunteers with the groups sponsoring those programs, and the company sees the program as yet another employee benefit.
"We can't give to everything that comes over the transom," said Mary Beth Salerno, the foundation's president, "but we do want to give to causes that are important to our employees."
But few corporations are as benevolent as their numbers indicate. An increasing chunk of corporate contributions are in the form of products or services, which companies can value at their retail prices but manufacture for far less. Last year's tax-law changes made the economics of that approach even more compelling: companies donating $1 in cash can write off $1; by contrast, companies donating a product that costs $1 to make but sells for $3 can write off $2 -- the cost plus half the difference between the cost and the fair-market value.
To further sweeten the deal, donated products act as a showcase. When Johnson & Johnson sends drugs to a disaster area, more doctors grow familiar with those products. When Avon donates cosmetics to a homeless shelter, the products -- and the company's largess -- are displayed to social workers, family members, doctors and others with more buying power than the immediate recipients.
"We are putting products into the community," Ms. Worthing said. Products accounted for about $6 million of Avon's $18.6 million in contributions last year, she added.
FEW companies are contrite about the tilt toward products. Most insist -- and many nonprofit groups agree -- that the charities would have to buy the products anyway and couldn't care less about how the companies value them on their books.
"We give in ways that help the recipients the most," said Barbara Dingfield, the director of community affairs for Microsoft. Although cash accounted for only about $11.1 million of Microsoft's $73.2 million in contributions last year, Ms. Dingfield noted that the company had given scholarships to women and members of minorities who want to study computer science and given cash grants to libraries nationwide as well as to community programs in the Puget Sound region in Washington, where Microsoft has its headquarters.
Moreover, corporations say that if they are to be castigated for overinflating the dollar value of their gifts, they should also be praised for not quantifying the countless hours of employee time they donate.
"By itself, checkbook philanthropy is going to be ineffective in getting disadvantaged kids on a college-bound track," said Mr. Ostergard of Citibank, whose employees and retirees to mentor children and teach classes in schools that Citibank supports with cash.
General Electric also sends employees and retirees into schools as mentors and tutors and into community groups as team leaders and organizers. It recently committed one million employee-hours to America's Promise, a White House-sponsored program to help troubled children. And it has started a program to send administrators of nonprofit groups through classes in management techniques led by G.E. managers. The aim is to make sure nonprofits get the maximum bang for G.E.'s donated buck. (That's the carrot. The stick is that G.E. cuts off any charity that cannot show that it is putting its money to good use.)
"We are leveraging our grants and gifts of product through our people," said Jane L. Polin, the program manager of the General Electric Fund, which dispenses about $30 million a year.
Add to that "and through the press." Corporations are becoming quite adept at pushing news of their generosity into the papers and onto the airwaves.
"We get a lot of exposure for our work, and that is not accidental," said Mr. McClimon of AT&T. "We write press releases, advertise events and spend a lot of time making sure the publicity machines at the nonprofit organizations are rolling along."
If there is one overarching force driving philanthropic triage at corporations today, it is the chance for good exposure to an important constituency. American Express is helping train welfare recipients for jobs at a Pennsylvania mall. Why? "The retail industry is a very important customer of ours," Ms. Salerno said.
The giving landscape abounds with such examples. Johnson & Johnson, which will give away $52 million in cash and $70 million in products this year, will direct most of the money to hospital-related causes, like medical research and management education for nurses and administrators. But it will also give a large sum to Head Start, which helps disadvantaged youngsters prepare for elementary school.
The link? Head Start has a health-care component, and "our affiliation gives us tremendous good will with doctors and dentists and in Washington," Mr. Weeden said.
Similarly, 80 percent of the $35 million that the Citicorp Foundation will give away this year will go to community development and education programs, particularly those that give lower-income people upward mobility by providing things like loans and schooling. But Citicorp will still give sizable sums to the arts -- including high-profile opera and concert companies that already have wealthy patrons. "That kind of support is pretty important to our private banking customers," Mr. Ostergard said.
Indeed, at some companies the new strategic focus has brought more, not fewer, causes under the philanthropic roof.
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB, a pharmaceutical and personal-care product company, had for decades directed its donations almost exclusively to medical research. Three years ago, at the behest of a new chief executive, the company's foundation broadened its concept of strategic giving. Now it also gives to women's health- education programs -- a tie-in with its Clairol line of women's products as well as its drug lines -- and to science education programs that might interest children in pursuing research or medical careers.
"We try to identify issues that have an impact on all our divisions," said John L. Damonti, the president of the foundation, which gave out $22 million last year. "We want people to look at our grants and understand what our company is all about."

HEADLINE: Why Do We Donate? It's Personal

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY; Susan Jacoby, a writer in New York, is finishing a book about four generations of her family.

 BODY:
Give all thou canst;
high Heaven rejects the lore
Of nicely calculated less or more.
 -- William Wordsworth
WOULDN'T it be pretty to think so? Of course, the calculating begins as soon as a child is old enough to have money of her own. When I was 7, my parents said I must reserve a portion of my weekly allowance for the collection plate at Sunday Mass. But the amount was to remain a secret between God and me. The tabernacles and chalices were made of gold and silver, I reasoned, so God didn't need more than five cents on the dollar. 
 Lest anyone think I was a stingy, selfish child, I want to make one thing clear: I gave lots of money to the March of Dimes because my best friend in second grade had a brother in an iron lung. Every time I saw a canister I would put in a dime or a quarter, not the measly nickel (or penny, if I had incurred heavy expenses that week) I customarily gave in church.
All giving is personal. With the possible exception of sex, no activity offers a clearer reflection of individual affinities, values and neuroses, at age 7 or 70. So it is only fitting that individual, living Americans -- not corporations, not bequests -- account for nearly 80 percent of the whopping amount of money ($150.7 billion in 1996) donated for philanthropic purposes each year.
While patterns of giving and not giving reflect individual preferences, they also illuminate the larger economic pressures shaping the lives of Americans in the mid-90's. Total giving is up, for example, mainly because the bull market has made the richest 20 percent of Americans richer and more willing to dig into their stock portfolios for large gifts. But the percentage of people who give anything to charity has shrunk.
Competition for philanthropic dollars, reflected in mailboxes bulging with fund-raising appeals, has intensified as more nonprofit institutions, under pressure to fill the gap created by government cuts for everything from the arts to food stamps, vie for charitable contributions from fewer donors. Administrators of nonprofits do not even want to think about what could happen if recent stock market tremors scare the wealthy out of the "giving mode," as it is known in Philanthrospeak, the professional lexicon of fund-raisers.
Between 1993 and 1996, while the average donation from contributing households rose to $1,017 from $880, 3.8 million homes vanished from the givers' ranks. A report by Independent Sector, a Washington-based organization that charts long-term philanthropy trends, found in 1995, the last year in which data are available, that more than 30 percent of American households contributed absolutely nothing to nonprofit endeavors. "There's a real danger if giving comes to be perceived as a hobby for the elite rather than the responsibility of everyone," says Virginia A. Hodgkinson, a research professor of public policy at Georgetown University.
Paul Clolery, the editor in chief of The Nonprofit Times, agrees, noting that "while the rich can afford to give more per capita, the middle class has been the backbone of American philanthropy in this century."
Nonetheless, headlines focus on blockbuster gifts from "major donors" (Philanthrospeak again), like the flamboyant Ted Turner. His pledge of $1 billion for United Nations social programs over the next 10 years stands out even among the super-rich. And should the gift work out to less (which it could if the value of the promised Time Warner stock falls), well, never let it be said that cold-hearted calculations outweighed the attention-getting value of the word "billion."
When reporters asked Mr. Turner why he gave to charity, he replied flippantly, "Well, it's 'Just say yes.' " But he then acknowledged the more complicated personal dynamic involved in all charitable contributions. "I've been learning how to give," he admitted. "It's something you have to keep working on because people like money the way they do their homes and their dogs."
With more nonprofits chasing dollars from fewer donors to meet greater needs, it is not surprising that a growing number of academic researchers -- call them "philanthroshrinks" -- are trying to figure out what impels givers to part with their money. What, for example, motivated 89-year-old Oseola McCarty to take $150,000 -- her life savings as a laundrywoman -- and establish a scholarship fund for black students at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, her hometown?
"A lot of people forget the obvious: that unlike taxation, giving is voluntary," says Paul G. Schervish, the director of Boston College's Social Welfare Research Institute.
Thomas B. Murphy, a Michigan philanthropist who sponsors research on giving in the hope of fostering charitable involvement among the wealthy, puts it this way: "Most human beings need to feel that they, their families and their businesses are secure before they're going to be truly comfortable about giving. Only then are they able to look at charitable involvement not as a sacrifice, but as something that adds to their own happiness."
In spite of (or perhaps because of) a tradition of philanthropy unequaled in most other nations, Americans are busybodies when it comes to charity. In interviews for this article, I was astonished at the range of unsolicited aspersions concerning the giving habits of others. Some kindly souls sniffed at "little old ladies who send dollar bills through the mail," while others disapproved "on principle" (the precise nature of the principle wasn't clear) of "sentimentalists" who give to street beggars.
Millionaires who want their names on buildings are criticized by millionaires who consider such behavior tacky. One patron of the arts expressed pity for those foolish enough to give money to such ill-defined "philanthropic products" as drug rehabilitation programs and counseling for troubled families. "They can't really believe their money is doing any good," he sniped.
Then there is the plaintive chorus of the unchosen. Mr. Turner's gift irked certain Atlanta business executives who felt that CNN's hometown deserved more largess. Finally, gifts that are targeted for specific social or political causes draw heavy fire from those who disagree with the donor's views.
While the quirky nature of individual giving fuels second-guessing, there is little evidence that the rich differ substantially from the middle class in charitable motivations.
It may seem comically obvious to point out that giving makes people feel good, but the underlying and less obvious reality is that the feel-good effect involves both selfish and altruistic motives. People give because they are asked to by their peers, whether those peers turn up on a Forbes list, at a P.T.A. meeting or in church. They give out of compassion for the less fortunate and a sense of responsibility to society; as payback for their own good luck; as penance for their sins, even out of a primitive desire to propitiate the gods.
Perhaps the most powerful influence is the intensity of the giver's identification with a cause or a group of people in need.
 
Personal Connection
When We Think It Could Be Me
I still remember the sick feeling in my stomach when my childhood friend told me that his brother had come down with polio after swimming in Lake Michigan. I swam in the lake, too. After that conversation, I simply could not pass up March of Dimes canisters.
"This is my town, that could be my grandmother" is how Marcia Stein, the executive director of Citymeals-on-Wheels in New York, describes the potency of such connections. Citymeals, which receives more than 90 percent of its support from 40,000 donors, is highly visible in that city because New Yorkers -- unlike most other Americans, who depend on cars for transportation -- see the frail elderly making their way around town. And the help delivered, Ms. Stein noted, is "something people can see and touch."
Antoinette Pridmore, a retired high-school physics teacher living in the Bronx, typifies the brand of giver who strongly identifies with the recipients of her annual donations. Ms. Pridmore, managing on a fixed income at age 90, is also the sort of giver who tends to be ignored by fund-raisers pursuing the big score. Her nicely calculated total is $240 a year -- all she feels she can spare.
"I guess I qualify as one of those old ladies who puts dollar bills in envelopes," she says with a laugh, her precise diction recalling her past as a teacher in a more demanding era of public school education.
Although her own sight and hearing remain keen enough for Ms. Pridmore to drive to the grocery store, she reserves $5 a month for Citymeals because she knows that many homebound elderly in her neighborhood rely on the hot food the organization delivers each day. She allots the same sum for Calvary Hospital nearby, known for its humane care of terminal patients, because her sister died of cancer there.
Like Mr. Turner, Ms. Pridmore underscores another truth about charitable giving: personal does not necessarily mean local. She also gives $5 a month to a foundation that is dedicated to preserving the delicate ecology of the Galapagos Islands, which she visited nearly 25 years ago.
"At my age, giving is a way of staying connected to the world," she says. "I would like to be able to give more, but everything I do give is very meaningful to me."
While all giving may be voluntary in theory, peer pressure exerts a huge influence in practice. Consider the fact that Americans give first (and often last) to their churches. Although religious giving has dropped slightly in recent years, churches and synagogues receive nearly half of all charitable donations -- $69.44 billion in 1996.
Education, the second most popular charitable choice ($18.81 billion), depends upon another obvious category of membership: alumni.
The importance of organization affiliation was underlined in the Independent Sector poll, which found that those who belonged to any group were more than twice as likely to give to charity as those who did not. The association between membership and volunteering was stronger: members were nearly three times as likely as nonmembers to devote time to charitable projects.
Of course, both peer pressure and belief in an institution play a role when donors give generously. Yes, you'll be forced to join a synagogue if you want your son to have a proper bar mitzvah, but you would not want your son to become bar mitzvah unless you wished to support Jewish observance.
The combination of motives for giving, and the connections that influence donors large and small, were described by the entrepreneur Michael R. Bloomberg in the September issue of his magazine Bloomberg Personal.
"I didn't give because I expected to get anything back," Mr. Bloomberg wrote in straight-faced fashion, referring to a $55 million donation to his alma mater, the Johns Hopkins University. "I gave because it's a great school and I felt I owed them."
He then confessed cheerfully that the donation had generated "great publicity for my company and the university, yielding rewards in terms of new business and accelerated fund gathering (I was also chairman of the Johns Hopkins capital campaign) that I couldn't have anticipated."
In fact, Mr. Bloomberg could have easily anticipated that his contribution would attract others. "There's a herd instinct in fund-raising," he acknowledged in an interview. "When people see what others have given, they want to match it."
Even without social competitiveness, personal example is a powerful force. Two years ago, for example, Ms. McCarty made her donation to the University of Southern Mississippi. Her gift, a singular act of generosity and selflessness, was soon followed by an extraordinary outpouring of financial support for the institution not only from local business executives but from across the country, and the original endowment quadrupled in just two years.
The stimulation of free-floating guilt simply isn't as effective a fund-raising tactic as either social pressure or personal example (though someone must be responding to the PBS telethons or stations wouldn't broadcast them). In the Independent Sector poll, a request from an acquaintance was rated the most likely to succeed. Mail and telephone solicitations and advertisements in newspapers and magazines were far down the list. (News articles, however, were considered effective.) Television commercials were the least persuasive appeals.
 
Underlying Optimism
Taking Action For a Better World
Optimism may be one of the most underrated emotional components of giving. "Givers are not fatalistic, pessimistic or passive people," says Ervin Staub, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has conducted extensive research on charitable motivations. "They see a problem, and their response is to figure out a way to fix it."
Mr. Murphy, for example, is a trustee for Volunteers in Prevention, a Michigan project that provides adult mentors to selected juvenile and first-time offenders instead of throwing them into the probation system. The program has cut recidivism among its clients 90 percent and costs only $50 per capita each year because it is operated mainly by volunteers.
"When you see that people who were reached through your efforts are building new lives," Mr. Murphy says, "it makes you want to give more of yourself and your time."
Barbara McKillip, who had no financial resources when she started a foundation to supply children's books to neglected rural communities, embodies the same personal commitment. Ms. McKillip, who grew up in a small Missouri town, was a librarian at a community college in Eugene, Ore., when, appalled by state cuts in library financing, she started the Libri Foundation.
"Actually, my dad is an accountant and it was his idea," she explains. "I was going on and on one day about how if I won the Oregon lottery, I would buy books for kids who didn't have any access to them. My dad said I didn't need the lottery, that I could set up a foundation and see if other people wanted to help. I thought, Why not?"
In the last five years, the foundation, run by Ms. McKillip out of her living room in Eugene, has distributed $250,000 in books to 245 libraries from Alaska to Iowa. Ms. McKillip seeks out tiny communities willing to raise money of their own and matches their donations 2 to 1.
Mary Weiss, the president of a women's club in a retirement community in Walnut Creek, Calif., is the kind of committed small donor whom Ms. McKillip has attracted. The Walnut Creek women raised $850 and recently traveled to the town of Courtland to see the new books their money had purchased and to see the children, mostly sons and daughters of migrant workers, who use the library.
"Courtland is part of the Sacramento library system, which has so little money that it cut the town off altogether," Ms. Weiss says indignantly. "I thought, Well, as citizens it's important for us to do something even if the government isn't meeting its responsibility."
Linda Barbanel, a New York psychotherapist who specializes in the psychology of money, says external forces, like government cutbacks, play a minor role in a giver's behavior. "The real truth is that people who want to give will find a way to give something, regardless of what's going on in society or even in their own financial lives," Ms. Barbanel says, "and those who hate to part with money will find reasons to hang on to every dime."

HEADLINE: A Hands-On Generation Transforms the Landscape of Philanthropy

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
PAUL TUDOR JONES 2d, 43, came to New York in 1978 with $1,700 and a determination to make it big in the commodities markets; he did. Peggy Dulany, 50, who does not use her surname, Rockefeller, always had wealth, but she also had profound convictions about the debilitating effects of poverty, injustice and racial hatred.
Ron W. Burkle, 45, bagged groceries after school in California when he was a boy, but now owns a supermarket empire built with the proceeds of his leveraged-buyout business. In Colorado, Tim Gill, also 45, became one of two openly gay millionaires on the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans through Quark Inc., the desktop publishing software company he founded in 1981. 
 These intensely private people are giving away millions of their own money. They are also part of a new generation of givers transforming philanthropy in what may be the world's most philanthropic nation.
More hands-on and businesslike in their approach, these boomer philanthropists -- all in their 40's or early 50's -- have a different attitude than many of their elders. Harnessing that attitude to their inherited or newly made millions, or billions in some cases, they have already decided that they must be personally involved in creating more effective charities and communities that will lead to a better nation and world.
In the process, they are expanding what constitutes philanthropy by broadening the targets of their giving to include, for instance, gay rights. And because they already have money, many scholars, policy makers and fund-raisers are looking to them for clues as to how their peers will give when the much heralded transfer of wealth -- some $2 trillion in assets -- occurs as America's middle-aged population inherits it from their parents.
The United States has seen transformations in philanthropy before. At the turn of the century, America entered what many regard as a golden era of giving when New York City became home to banking, railroad and oil barons like Morgan, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller, who used their money to start the foundations and cultural institutions that still bear their names and reflect their influence.
In the Midwest a generation later, the Ford and Chrysler fortunes ushered in a second philanthropy boom. Now a strong economy and stock market (hiccups and all) have increased the nation's wealth -- by $1.4 trillion in the last year alone -- and spawned a new cluster of rich and super-rich.
While most of these younger philanthropists engage in traditional giving -- to their colleges, churches or synagogues and hometown cultural institutions -- students of philanthropy have already noticed generational differences. "Younger generations are widening their circle of giving," said Ann Castle, who helps assemble the lists of the most charitable Americans for Slate, the on-line magazine.
Christopher Mogil, 41, who with his wife, Ann Slepian, also 41, started the Impact Project, a Boston nonprofit organization that helps philanthropists help one another, said that younger givers tend to have a very participatory style. "They want to be involved, not just to write checks," said Mr. Mogil. A result: regular visits to projects they have financed, not standard practice in most family foundations, are very much in vogue.
So is collaborative giving, in which donors support one another's causes, and so are forums where donors can trade information about worthy causes and discuss philanthropic successes and failures.
Mr. Mogil has a trove of tales. Reared in New York, he was working in 1980 for a community development group in Philadelphia when he inherited about half a million dollars from his mother's family. "I had no idea initially how to handle that," he said.
Eventually, he gave away about half of his inheritance and used the rest to create the Impact Project to help young donors chart their own courses. The project sponsors publications, counseling and workshops through which Mr. Mogil and Ms. Slepian have shared their expertise.
Impact's quarterly publication, More Than Money, published with a partner in Eugene, Ore., has 1,000 subscribers, half of whom each have a net worth exceeding a million dollars. Mr. Mogil said that he finances much of the project's $195,000 budget, which will grow to $270,000 next year, "because I don't want to fund-raise."
AMONG baby boomers, Mr. Mogil said, those with inherited wealth tend to be more cautious in their giving than the self-made rich. He explained that beneficiaries of inherited wealth, like lottery winners, "are often slow to ask what their wealth means, how it affects their personal lives and relationships and how they can contribute to the world." But self-made philanthropists "are used to saying, Here's what I want and here's how I can make it happen."
A prime example is Mr. Jones, the Memphis-born commodities broker. Soon after he earned his first million, he said in a recent interview, he was determined to "give back" to the city that had made his fortune possible. "I was and am a walking, talking poster child for New York and its infinite possibilities," he said.
Helping finance college scholarships for disadvantaged high-school students, he said, he quickly realized that the youngsters needed more than money and mentoring to get to college. "Hungry kids can't focus," Mr. Jones said. "And battered teen-agers can't either."
And so in 1988 the Robin Hood Foundation, self-declared "guerrilla philanthropy," was born. Using $3 million of Mr. Jones's own money, along with substantial gifts from two Wall Street colleagues who were also budding givers, the foundation tries to break poverty's stranglehold in New York through innovative projects. Robin Hood, with a $20 million endowment, is among the largest backers, for one, of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, which is trying to rejuvenate eight city blocks in Harlem.
What Mr. Jones calls a "social venture approach" to philanthropy, in which donors seek a real return on philanthropic investments, is common among younger givers, said Craig Smith, a philanthropy expert at the Conference Board, a New York-based business research institute. "The new generation is bringing the perspective of entrepreneurship into the nonprofit world," Mr. Smith said. "Many no longer accept the conventional wisdom that nonprofits are not about competition. They're far more likely to think about how a nonprofit can work as efficiently as their business."
Ms. Dulany agrees. The daughter of David Rockefeller, she recalled that philanthropy was a constant topic of conversation in her home. Her way with it, however, was influenced primarily by the impoverished family in Brazil with whom she lived when she was 19. "That shaped my view that we must look at issues globally, that our greatest allies in solving problems of poverty are those confronted with poverty," she said, "and that we need not just to throw money at the poor but devote our own time, money and energy to working with them and involving them in the solutions."
THE Synergos Institute, the New York-based nonprofit group Ms. Dulany founded, puts that philosophy into practice by mobilizing public and private resources, including the United Nations, to reduce global poverty and inequity. It also tries to strengthen the ability of poor communities to solve their own problems. Bruce Schearer, the institute's chief executive officer, said that with only a $2 million annual budget, Synergos has helped groups in Ecuador, Mexico, Mozambique and Zimbabwe establish foundations to raise money for their projects.
"It's important not only to give money to feed hungry people, but also to create programs to enable people to find jobs and become entrepreneurs and feed themselves," said Ms. Dulany, who is also a board member, among others, of the African-American Institute.
In line with that philosophy, Mr. Burkle in Los Angeles is generous not only with his money but his time. He recently contributed $15 million to help build the new Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, but as chairman of D.A.R.E., an antidrug group, he has educated youngsters about the dangers of drugs and eased the hostility between some minority youths and local police.
Mr. Gill was already dabbling in philanthropy when Colorado voters approved Amendment 2, which prevented municipalities and the state from passing statutes to protect homosexuals from discrimination. "Tim realized that he had to help educate people about gay and lesbian issues," said Katherine Pease, who heads the Gill Foundation, begun in 1994 to do just that.
Next year, the foundation's budget will provide for $3.4 million in grants to help change public attitudes toward gay Americans and protect their rights. This year, the group made a $100,000 contribution to the American Red Cross to help flood victims in Fort Collins, Colo.
While that might seem like tame philanthropy and not too cutting edge, Ms. Pease said it was innovative nonetheless. "By giving to things that advance the community's interests," she explained, "we're trying to persuade people that before we're gay men or lesbians, we are human beings."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Where Image Prevails, Talk About Race Turns Bland

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman 

 BODY:
Who could fault the outpouring of virtue from President Clinton's town hall on race last week? It was a lesson in gentility for afternoon television, a show without raunch or rant, insults or inanities, crackpotism or kookery. One wanted to like it. But when it comes to race, television has moved much beyond the sound bites that filled those two hours of C-Span.
One can imagine a time when television, if there had been television, would have been important for this sort of display, say if in the 1930's a national figure like Eleanor Roosevelt had led an all-American tolerance class. That could have improved benighted attitudes toward minorities. But with the help of television itself, the nation is, happily, well beyond such pleas and admonitions. 
 With Bill Clinton himself playing chief talker for what he called "all this talking stuff," the selected audience was on its best behavior. Clean-cut students delivered mild complaints (the young "biracial" man who is annoyed at having his small checks questioned by his bank) and confessions (the white man who likes Bill Cosby on the tube but becomes uneasy at encountering a certain order of black man in person). An Hispanic woman and an Asian-American man reminded the audience that they had grievances, too. A black-white team of ministers advertised their buddyship in a sort of vaudeville duet. Others were ready with scripted mini-sermons in behalf of mutual understanding, and the pleasure of diversity was on many lips.
But what was it all about? Beyond sending the performers home feeling better, the mission was fuzzy.
We have long since heard them all before, all the complaints and the confessions, the tales of indignities and effusions of guilt. All on television. If television talk could do the job of eradicating vestiges of racism, it would by now have been done. The shows may be vulgar, but when race rears its head, the proprieties are strict: hatred is out. And in the image stakes, television has been considerably in advance of the rest of the nation. The on-screen world is wondrously integrated, from stars to anchors, pretend cops to pretend perps, wholesome families to sitcom clucks.
The President must know that. He must know that anyone who has not yet been brushed by the wings of tolerance, sensitivity, some semblance of good will is probably beyond reach. So in search of something more tangible than further preachments, he proclaims that his televised national conversation (in which no one does much conversing) is meant to produce specific ways of addressing what his predecessor would surely call the race thing. And the Presidential project, which has given little hint of getting anywhere since it started six months ago, turns up as an uplift road show.
Training a camera on several dozen likable folks for a couple of hours in hopes of devising means of dealing with hard problems like rotten schools, unemployment, poverty, crime, family disarray and the other ills that television keeps telling us are embroiled with race is like sending a squad of cheerleaders onto the field and expecting it to score touchdowns.
It may only be a measure of our frustration and scarcity of ideas that we have entered a time of prayerful exhortation to go forth and do better, be it about race or fatherhood or other bafflements. Sure, a televised meeting or march can help promote a cause once it is defined, but it is not much good at formulating or working out any sort of plan for the tangle of matters that have come to define the problem of race. Whatever the President expects from his race initiative, he is not likely to find it via the tube. That's not where serious thinking or serious politicking gets done.

For Bank Mergers, Big Is Not Always Better

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
There is no question that with about $590 billion in assets the bank to be created through the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation will be breathtaking in its size. But does that matter?
As banks in the United States have discovered -- despite the merger boom of the last few years -- size alone does not assure success. Performance is the name of the game, and bigness sometimes can present more problems than it solves. 
 "There are certain instances where being large is helpful for a bank, in areas like risk management, access to capital, cost effective deployment of specialized skills and negotiating," Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said. "But size alone isn't an end in itself. Banks here have found it more important to have leading market share in a variety of businesses rather than merely having a lot of assets."
American banks, swamped in bad loans just a decade ago, were hardly in a position to offer lessons to their global competitors, but today many of these same banks are considered strategic models by foreign banks.
Citicorp, the second-largest United States bank, long ago stopped emphasizing asset growth and instead focused on profitability -- a fact not lost on the Swiss merger candidates, which said yesterday that they hoped the new bank would achieve a return on equity of 15 percent to 20 percent.
Moreover, despite their size, such large United States banks as the Chase Manhattan Corporation and J. P. Morgan & Company have been trying to fashion themselves as financial service emporiums that offer one-stop shopping to big corporate clients. This places less importance on asset size and more importance on a bank's ability to deliver a variety of client services, from loan syndications and equity underwriting to asset management and advice on mergers and acquisitions.
A merger between Union Bank and Swiss Bank does not guarantee that the new bank will be any more able to compete successfully in these businesses. Indeed, there are already plenty of examples of huge foreign banks that increasingly look like dinosaurs because of their lack of a competitive edge.
Japanese banks have routinely filled most slots on the top-10 lists of international banks of the last decade, their very size inspiring overwrought fears of a Japanese financial invasion. Yet these same banks have proved to be disastrously poor lenders and slow to innovate.
Even Sumitomo Bank Ltd., a behemoth once considered one of the most dynamic and smartest of Japanese banks, has been sideswiped by bad loans and lagging investments in new technology and products.
In Europe, Deutsche Bank A.G. traditionally wielded its mammoth asset base and top-notch credit rating with baronial disdain, accustomed to air-tight corporate relationships and little competition.
But, despite its position as the second-largest bank in the world -- pending the Swiss bank merger -- Deutsche has struggled in recent years with bad real estate loans, lax risk management practices and an inability to take on smaller American rivals in investment banking.
To be sure, size must always be reckoned with. Despite their many shortcomings, Japanese banks are still formidable competitors in such arenas as large-scale project finance. And some international banks, such as ABN Amro Holding N.V. of the Netherlands and HSBC Holdings P.L.C. of Britain and Hong Kong, are considered nimble operators in spite of their size.
But some analysts and academics are wary of the push for size just for size's sake. David Beim, a professor of finance at Columbia University, said the marriage of Union Bank and Swiss Bank created a goliath that might be too large for its own good.
"It now has no serious competition in Switzerland, and I worry about the European tendency to form national champions in certain industries because it removes the competitive pressure," he said. "It may allow them to become either complacent in their business practices or become so dominant in Switzerland that they have too much pricing power."
It is unlikely, however, that concerns about unfettered size will slow the consolidation wave that many bank advisers and analysts expect to sweep through Europe's financial markets in the next couple of years.
In some cases, there is a strong economic rationale for such mergers, particularly in countries such as Britain that have large -- but weak -- banks. And because financial services is a growth industry while traditional banking is not, banks will continue to feel pressure to offer as many products as possible; that too will push mergers along.
But as often as not, combinations will also be driven by the egos of bank executives. "There will be a few very large global banks when the dust settles, and if you're choosing not to grow you're choosing not to play in that stratosphere," said Dwight Crane, a finance professor at Harvard University. "That's a very hard thing to ignore for the managers of any bank."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Two forecasters predict spending on Madison Avenue should remain robust next year.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
TWO executives whose twice-yearly forecasts of advertising spending are closely followed along Madison Avenue see 1998 as a year of somewhat slower -- but still strong -- growth.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A. in New York, and John Perriss, chairman and chief executive of Zenith Media Worldwide in London, offered their optimistic predictions at the opening session of the 25th annual Paine Webber Media Conference, which began yesterday morning at the McGraw-Hill Building in midtown Manhattan. It continues through Friday. 
 The outlooks of Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss are important because their forecasts, which they issue every summer and fall, are considered barometers of marketer behavior. The predictions of Mr. Coen are typically more rosy than Mr. Perriss's, but the two executives echoed each other yesterday in declaring that ad spending is likely to remain robust, despite moderation of the American economic expansion and problems in the Asian-Pacific region.
"The momentum is very favorable for another good year for advertising in 1998," said Mr. Coen of McCann, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"It may be tough to make gains on top of the gains made in 1997," he added, "but on balance most of the evidence is that the media marketplace is holding up pretty well."
Mr. Perriss of Zenith, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C., said: "Ad spending is slowing down in growth terms, but still growing. We think we've gone through the peak of the current economic cycle. But there are no horror shows anywhere."
One reason for the positive prognostications about next year is the stimulative effect of the Winter Olympics and election campaigns on demand for commercial time and advertising space. Another reason is continuing growth in competitive categories like automobiles, computers, cosmetics and toiletries, drugs and remedies, financial products, liquor and travel. A third reason is an increasing national presence among advertisers that had once been locally focused; among them are retail drug chains and direct response marketers.
Mr. Coen predicted that advertisers would spend a record $198.4 billion in the United States in 1998, an increase of 6.2 percent over the $186.8 billion that he now forecasts for 1997. The 1997 figure represents a 6.6 percent gain from the $175.2 billion that was spent in 1996.
In terms of advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product, $198.4 billion next year would come in just shy of 2.35 percent, which was the record set in 1987 and matched in 1988. That would compare with 2.31 percent for 1997 and mark the sixth consecutive gain since a bottom was touched at 2.12 percent in 1992.
Mr. Coen's figure for 1997 of $186.8 billion has been raised a tad from a forecast of $186 billion he made in June. Mr. Coen, who has been keeping track of media and marketing trends since 1948, changes his figures from one presentation to another, based on updated spending or economic data.
And the American ad spending forecast of $198.4 billion for next year has been increased slightly from an initial estimate of $196.5 billion that Mr. Coen offered in June.
Among the national media that Mr. Coen expects to draw more ad dollars in 1998 are cable television, radio, telephone directories and newspapers. Among the local media, he lists retail and classified newspaper advertising.
Internationally, Mr. Coen forecast ad spending of $236 billion for 1998, up 5 percent from a revised figure of $224.8 billion for 1997. Next year's figure is down from a prediction of $240.5 billion made in June; the decrease was attributable to uncertainties related to the economic problems in Asian-Pacific markets like South Korea and Thailand, which had been growing strongly until recently.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for 1998, then, is $434.4 billion. That would represent an increase of 5.5 percent from a revised worldwide total of $411.6 billion for 1997 -- the first time it has surpassed the $400 billion milestone. The 1997 figure marks a gain of 5 percent from the $387.3 billion spent in 1996.
Mr. Perriss offered somewhat different totals from Mr. Coen because he focuses his predictions on major media like television, newspapers, magazines and radio.
Ad spending in major North American media will reach $117.3 billion in 1998, Mr. Perriss said, up 5 percent from the $111.6 billion he expects for 1997. For 1999, he projected $122.7 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent from his 1998 figure, and for 2000, he projected $128.2 billion, up 4.5 percent from 1999.
As for overseas ad spending, Mr. Perriss forecast $200.5 billion in major media in 1998, up 7.2 percent from the $187.1 billion he expects for 1997. In the Asian-Pacific region, he said, the banking and currency crisis "is expected to impact on consumer confidence much more than on the economic fundamentals."
Mr. Perriss's prediction for ad spending overseas in 1999 is $214.1 billion, up 6.8 percent from 1998. His prediction for 2000 is $229.3 billion, up 7.1 percent from 1999.
For the worldwide 1998 total, then, Mr. Perriss's forecast is $317.8 billion, an increase of 6.4 percent from $298.8 billion in 1997. His 1999 worldwide total is $336.8 billion, up 6 percent from 1998. And his 2000 worldwide total is $357.5 billion, up 6.1 percent from 1999.

HEADLINE: Bosnia II?

BYLINE: By Misha Glenny; Misha Glenny, author of "The Fall of Yugoslavia," is completing a history of Balkan nationalism.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Ministers and ambassadors from 51 nations gather in Bonn today for their annual review of how successfully the Dayton agreement on unifying Bosnia is being carried out. They will hear complaints that local leaders and international officials have been stalling, sowing confusion, missing deadlines and just plain acting ineptly.
But the senior delegates in Bonn ought to take a few minutes to discuss another Balkan problem: Kosovo. 
 Bosnia is a shocking example of what happens when things go wrong in the Balkans. Kosovo is a disturbing example of where that may well happen again soon.
The province in southern Serbia is home to the former Yugoslavia's most intractable conflict, which has been likened to an unexploded bomb. Ninety percent of Kosovo's more than two million people are Albanians who have suffered discrimination at the hands of the Serbian authorities. Human rights groups cite arbitrary arrests and beatings of Albanians.
In the past, diplomats have dismissed Kosovo as the accident that never happens -- the bomb that never explodes. There has been much tut-tutting and mild pressure, but no real push for a negotiated solution to Kosovo's problems. In the last few months, however, the situation in the province has steadily deteriorated.
Until recently, the Albanians of Kosovo followed the advice of their self-proclaimed President, Ibrahim Rugova, and restricted themselves to peaceful protests. But the last 18 months has witnessed the emergence of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a shady group that has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks on Serbian police officers and civilians. It has also killed Albanians accused of collaborating with the Serbs.
Members of the Kosovo Liberation Army stepped out of the shadows for the first time nine days ago when three masked men in military fatigues attended the funeral of an Albanian teacher, Halit Geci, who had been killed in a shootout between the group and the Serbian police. Brandishing semiautomatic weapons, the three swore that they would avenge Mr. Geci's death and Kosovo's Albanians.
That finally drew the attention of diplomats. Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, last week described the surge in violence in the province as alarming and announced that Germany and France would be urgently looking for ways to contain the problem. The American charge d'affaires in Belgrade, Richard C. Miles, visited Kosovo several days ago to appeal for calm. If Kosovo descends into violence, it may well spill over to neighboring Macedonia, where this year occasional shootouts have punctured the uneasy calm between Albanians and Macedonians.
Mr. Rugova, a moderate, is fast losing support among his own people. Last week, he renewed his appeal for American and European mediation. Unfortunately, the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, still the master of Serb politics, has stated repeatedly that Kosovo is an internal problem and that no outside mediation is necessary.
Serbs say that they cannot make concessions in Kosovo because of its historical importance to them. It contains their most important religious monuments and is the symbol of Serbia's medieval statehood. But they must realize that Kosovo is now of no economic or strategic value to them. For their part, the Kosovo Albanians must appreciate that they are not going to get independence overnight. If the Kosovo Liberation Army begins to dictate politics in Kosovo, there will be large-scale bloodshed.

HEADLINE: 56 Troubled Lenders Closed by Thailand

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec. 8

 BODY:
This country drew cheers from economists today by closing all but two of 58 ailing finance companies, the toughest step yet to address economic problems.
The action, which was unexpectedly forceful, will cost 5,000 to 10,000 jobs and increase Thailand's economic pain. It had been delayed for months as the recently ousted Cabinet shrank from challenging powerful business leaders. 
 "We applaud it because under the circumstances it was a very courageous decision," said Shiva Kumar, a director of the World Bank's office here. "It sends the right signals about the Government's determination to clean up the financial sector."
Action on the finance companies, which had been suspended in June and August, was demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a key step in revamping the country's battered and inefficient banks.
The I.M.F. extended a $17 billion bailout package to Thailand in August after its currency, the baht, and its stock market fell and decade-long growth of 8 percent a year slowed sharply. Exports have fallen, companies are closing, prices are rising and growing numbers of people are losing jobs.
The plunge in the Thai economy set off a chain reaction through the region and rattled world markets, with the I.M.F. extending larger aid packages to Indonesia and South Korea. Economists worried that Thailand might be slow to recover because of political disarray and Government inaction.
Today, the benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 3.35 percent, and the baht, which has fallen in value by more than 40 percent since July, rose slightly in Asian trading against the dollar.
The Government's action today cleared the way for release of additional funds by the I.M.F. Bangkok has already tapped $5.47 billion of the bailout money, and the I.M.F. in Washington is scheduled to vote on the release of an additional $3 billion.
In the long term, the action could help put the country on the road to recovery, economists said. If Thailand continues with forceful measures like the one today, it could again become one of Southeast Asia's economic leaders, said Mark Greenwood, representative here of Paribas Asia Equity, a global investment bank. "If Thailand continues down this path of liberalization and letting the markets do their work, it will be hastening the day when it comes out of the current mess that Asia finds itself in -- a leaner and meaner animal than the others," he said.
During a decade of rapid growth, the finance companies had offered easy terms to inefficient industries and unproductive real estate ventures. Accusations of cronyism and corruption were common.
The lenders were left holding an estimated $9 billion in nonperforming loans, most of that in property.
"We hope very much," said Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, that "our decision to clean up the financial system systematically will signal we are moving in the right direction."
He said that the Government had approved rehabilitation plans for only two of the 58 finance companies, Bangkok Investment and Kiatnakin Finance and Securities P.L.C.
Bangkok Investment intends to sell an 80 percent stake to AIG Consumer Finance, a unit of the American International Group.
Mr. Tarrin is one of the technocrats brought in to manage the economy by the new Government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, which took office a month ago, after the collapse of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's Cabinet.
The Finance Minister said the 56 institutions closed today would be liquidated under a program that would give foreign creditors the same rights as domestic ones. Two new banks will be set up to take over their healthy assets; their troubled assets will be sold later.
In addition to these institutions, Thailand has 15 commercial banks and 33 other financial institutions, which are nonbank lenders forbidden to accept deposits.
"There is still a question mark over the 33 companies that remain," said Stuart Matthews, research chief of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Securities in Thailand. "We saw very tough action today, which did surprise the market. I hope it will result in mergers among those 33."
The heads of the 58 financial institutions had issued a statement last Thursday apologizing for the debacle but blaming the Thai central bank for their problems.
"We feel sorry for depositors, creditors and shareholders who acted in good faith and employees who will lose their jobs," the executives said. But they accused the Bank of Thailand of "sending us the wrong signals and inaccurate economic data, stunting economic growth and causing businesses in several industries to go bankrupt."
One of the institutions, Dynamic Eastern Finance of Thailand, said it would sue the central bank for $126 million.
At a recent finance ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Mr. Tarrin said that Thailand was "totally committed" to the austerity measures demanded by the I.M.F. and intended to operate under "a new style of transparency," rather than by the back-room deals common in much of Asia.
"We believe this is the only way Thailand can return to restoration of market confidence and financial stability," he said. "I think Thailand, being the first to experience the troubles, hopefully will be the first to get out. We are determined to do this, and we will do it."

Confidence From Toyota
 TOKYO, Dec. 8 (Bloomberg News) -- The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would shift some production from Japan to two plants in Thailand and that they would resume operation in January after a two-month shutdown.
Toyota said it planned to increase the number of vehicles exported from Thailand. Output at the two factories was halted in November because the Thai economic slump was cutting into demand. Production is to resume on Jan. 7.
In addition to the vehicle exports, Toyota will begin exporting diesel engines and parts from Thailand to Japan.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Moscow Restores Benefits to 3 U.S.-Russian Oil Ventures

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 8

 BODY:
When Vice President Al Gore came to Moscow in September he took up the cudgel for American oil companies. The Americans complained that billions in new investment were in jeopardy because of obstreperous local leaders, unreliable Russian partners and a lethargic bureaucracy.
Today, American officials declared they had scored a small but noteworthy victory. 
 After months of importuning, United States officials have persuaded the Yeltsin Government to restore tax and pipeline privileges to three American-Russian joint ventures that extract Russian oil.
"The action on the joint ventures is a positive signal to energy investors in Russia," Jan Kalicki, the Clinton Administration's trouble-shooter on oil and gas issues, said in an interview.
The American partners in the three joint ventures are Anderman/ Smith Overseas Inc.; Conoco, a unit of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, and Phibro Energy Production, a unit of Salomon Smith Barney, which is owned by Travelers Inc. The Conoco venture is called Polar Lights and the Phibro deal White Nights. The three projects were started at the beginning of the decade after the Government gave assurances that they would receive special treatment to enable them to recover their investment costs.
Those expectations were upset when the ventures were saddled with an array of new taxes, undercutting their financial viability. Phibro's joint venture, for example, says that it paid more than $17 million in unexpected new taxes between September 1994 and August 1997.
The aim of the agreement disclosed today is to make good on the Russian Government's promises that the ventures could recoup their investment. No one pretends, however, that the move has transformed Russia's well-deserved reputation as a difficult arena for oil investors. There is still a long list of problems.
The United States, for example, has sought unsuccessfully to persuade the Russian Government to reconsider its decision to revoke the Exxon Corporation's right to develop oil in the far north.
Exxon won that right in an auction only to lose it after Russian companies complained that it received too advantageous a deal. American officials are discussing a compromise: Exxon should have the right to participate in a new auction and match the winning bid.
The Amoco Corporation's vast project to develop the North Priobskoye oilfield in Western Siberia also remains in big trouble. Its new Russian partner, the Yukos oil company, has little interest in sharing the profits with Amoco although it lacks the capital to develop the field on its own.
Both the Exxon and Amoco projects were intended to be carried out under production-sharing agreements, which Western oil executives regard as far superior to traditional joint ventures because they offer more protection.
Under production-sharing accords, foreign companies receive drilling rights and an assurance that taxes will remain stable. And most Western companies are reluctant to invest new money in Russia without them. Still, getting approval for production-sharing agreements in the the Russian Parliament and among local authorities has proved to be a slow and painful process.
American officials still hope that some major new production-sharing deals can be moved forward. They say that the inclusion of new Russian partners will help prospects for two big projects in the northern region of Nenets as well as a new oil drilling venture in Sakhalin in Russia's Far East.
In the meantime, they have sought to iron out the problems that developed with the older joint ventures. The joint ventures account for a relatively small share of prospective investment and oil production but have a high political profile.
The roots of the current dispute go back to the early 1990's when the three joint ventures argued that they needed special privileges to recoup their investment costs because they were developing difficult oil deposits.
In all, the Conoco joint venture amounts to an investment of about $400 million; the Phibro venture has invested approximately $120 million and the Anderman/Smith project about $86 million.
The privileges involved three years of preferential access to Russia's clogged export pipeline and a promise to keep excise tariffs to a minimum for the same period.
But the companies complained that the Government had, in effect, changed the terms of the deal by imposing new taxes after production began. Then the pipeline and excise tax privileges expired on Sept. 1. Access to the pipeline shrank and excise taxes quadrupled. The companies complained that they were still in the hole.
The new decision on joint ventures is intended to address these complaints. It was hammered out by Sergei N. Kiriyenko, the Fuel and Energy Minister, and one of the Russian Government's economic reformers, and Mr. Kalicki as part of a broader review that is still under way on the problem facing American oil investments.
Under the new understanding, the joint ventures will be able to export 100 percent of their production through the pipeline. Excise taxes will be rolled back retroactively. Though details are still being worked out, the privileges are likely to be extended for six to 10 months.
Whether the decision will fully satisfy the joint ventures is unclear. Phibro has told the Government it needs to have its privileges extended for more than a year and a half to recoup its investment costs, as promised. Officials from the joint ventures' Moscow offices did not return phone calls, seeking comment.
Nor is it yet known which companies will lose access to the export pipeline so that the three joint ventures can be accommodated.
It is also not clear whether the decision will augur breakthroughs in the more important area of production-sharing agreements.

HEADLINE: Muslim Leaders' Talks Hailed by Iran as Rebuff to U.S.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Leaders representing the world's one billion Muslims poured into this capital today for a conference that Iran is hailing as evidence that it has overcome American-led attempts to isolate it as an international pariah.
The gathering is the largest in Iran since the 1979 revolution, with a turnout that is expected to include nearly three dozen heads of state. 
 Among those countries whose delegates arrived today are close allies of the United States, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which pointedly stayed away from an American-backed conference last month in Qatar that had been intended to promote economic ties between Israel and Arab nations.
The meeting here of the Organization of the Islamic Conference remains unlikely to produce any kind of wholesale realignment toward Iran's opposition to the American-sponsored quest for a broader peace in the Middle East.
But as Iran assumes the chairmanship of the 55-member group, it has clearly taken major strides toward rehabilitation in the eyes of nations that once viewed the Islamic republic and its calls for the export of revolution with deep foreboding.
And by the time their meeting concludes on Thursday, the assembled Islamic leaders are expected to include at least a strongly worded resolution condemning Israel for "reinstating an atmosphere of war" in the Middle East.
With the many heads of state expected to attend the gathering, President Mohammed Khatami of Iran has declared that the gathering "shows the power and stability" of his country of 60 million people, which the United States has sought to isolate since the revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, who had been America's most important ally in the Middle East.
The United States, which prohibits most commerce with Iran, has labeled Iran the greatest threat to security in the Middle East, mostly because of the support it has provided to militant organizations violently opposed to the peace effort.
But European governments, which defend their policies of engaging the Teheran Government in both political and economic terms, have firmly resisted American calls to join in an economic embargo.
And the seal of approval by the high-level Arab turnout this week is merely the most dramatic in a series of steps in which Iran has broken away from its isolation.
These steps include the signing of the biggest foreign investment deal since the revolution, a $2 billion natural gas contract with a French, Malaysian and Russian consortium, and the ending of a diplomatic impasse with the European Union that has brought European ambassadors back to Teheran after a seven-month absence.
At a time when efforts to broker a wider peace in the Middle East have made no headway for nearly a year, Iran has also drawn increasing numbers of Arab states toward its antagonistic view of the American-led effort. And since the election of Mr. Khatami in May, it has signaled a desire to build closer ties with its long-suspicious neighbors, particularly in the Persian Gulf.
Those latter factors have played an important role in allowing Iran to claim center stage now in regional diplomacy, with this week's meeting destined to overshadow the one in Qatar as the year's most important gathering of Arab leaders.
At least in terms of symbolic importance, perhaps the most significant arrival today was that of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the highest-ranking Saudi to visit Iran since the revolution.
As the self-styled center of Islamic orthodoxy, Saudi Arabia has for years been among Iran's most ardent critics, and it has repeatedly raised alarms over Iran's support for Shiite Muslim militants in the region.
But in the months since Mr. Khatami's election, Iran has worked assiduously toward reconciliation with the Saudis, and Iran is clearly hoping that the attendance of the kingdom's heir apparent will help to promote closer ties between two of the region's most important military powers.
Others attending the conference include Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, which like Saudi Arabia refused to attend the Qatar conference.
Egypt has similarly expressed recent animosities toward Iran, with some officials accusing the Teheran Government this year of providing support to Islamic militants who are trying to overthrow the secular Government in Cairo.
But anger toward Israel and bitterness toward a United States that is no longer seen as being an evenhanded partner has now led Egypt to swallow whatever distaste remains and join in a conference whose main aim, Iranian organizers say, is to overcome historic divisions and promote Islamic solidarity.
Another delegate whose visit may promote some fence-mending is Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan of Iraq, its highest-ranking visitor since Iran and Iraq waged their long and gory war from 1980 to 1988.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Greenspan Refrain: That Was Then . . .

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
If you had listened to Alan Greenspan just two months ago and then considered what has happened in the American economy since, you would have to conclude that a Federal Reserve tightening was a sure thing. The fact that few expect it now is a tribute to how rapidly the world can change, and to how fast seers can change their minds.
In Congressional testimony on Oct. 8, Mr. Greenspan was as clear as he has ever been on what would lead the Fed to tighten before inflation indexes began to leap. The economy, he said, could not long sustain the current rate of job creation without a burst of inflation. 
 "The performance of the labor markets this year has been on an unsustainable track," Mr. Greenspan said, pointing to a sizzling annual pace of two million new jobs created. He said there were simply not enough prospective workers without jobs to allow that rate to continue.
"To be sure," he said, "job growth slowed significantly in August and September, but it did not slow enough to close, from the demand side alone, the gap of the demand for labor over the supply from increases in the working-age population."
The message seemed clear, or at least as clear as the Federal Reserve Board chairman ever allows: Either employment growth slows on its own or the Fed will tighten credit to ward off inflation.
So what happened? First, the Government revised the statistics for September, so that the job pace appeared not as slow as Mr. Greenspan had thought. The current estimate for that month is 269,000 net new nonfarm jobs created, up from 215,000. October's figure is now 287,000, and November's is 404,000. The average comes to 320,000 jobs a month, or an annual rate of 3.8 million, nearly twice what Mr. Greenspan deemed unsustainable.
At the same time, there have been indications that wages are starting to rise much more rapidly than they had been, as would be expected when a record percentage of the population is working and the jobless rate has fallen to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent.
What happened in those two months? Asia crumbled. Now, with the International Monetary Fund directing bailouts in some countries, and Japan expected to finally begin dealing with its sick banks, it would seem extremely unfriendly of the Fed to make the international situation even stickier by raising interest rates when its Open Market Committee meets next week. Countries trying to keep their currencies from collapsing against the dollar would not appreciate higher interest rates in this country.
So the consensus is that the Fed will do nothing. Whereas six weeks ago, the markets seemed worried that Asian flu would make the whole world sick, now the belief is that the Asian flu will keep the Fed from doing anything to end Wall Street's party. That has produced a confidence that sent the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a new high Friday, the very day the employment figures were released. It was the first peak since the October panic brought on by Asian concerns.
In recent years, it has almost always been a losing strategy to bet against the stock market's rising. But perhaps, just perhaps, this latest rise is unsustainable.
Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, points out that for several years corporate profits have grown much faster than the economy as a whole, a reflection of rising profit margins. Now, he says, companies may confront a bad combination of factors that squeeze profit margins rather than expand them. The tight labor market threatens to raise wage costs for many businesses, while those that deal in products sold around the world may find it hard to raise prices, given Asian overcapacity and weak currencies. All this could make optimistic profit forecasts look unreachable.
Mr. Barbera also thinks that the Fed will eventually tighten, probably early next year after the Asian situation appears to have stabilized. If that happens, or if his profit-squeeze forecast works out, stock prices could come under pressure.
The best argument against that bearish outlook right now has nothing to do with economic statistics or inflation. It centers on the fact that Wall Street's forecasts tend to mirror the market. Wall Street overcame its worry about Asia not so much because of confidence that the Asian problem will be adequately dealt with -- it is far too early to answer that question -- but because financial markets stabilized and even rallied. That happened largely because individual American investors saw the Asian-induced plunge in American stocks as a buying opportunity.
That could happen again, as a market decline brought on either by poorer profits or a new Fed tightening is greeted by even more buying, and by analysts then finding reasons to believe that higher short-term interest rates and lower profits should not derail the bull market.
Were that to happen, the winners would again be those who bet on higher stock prices. And Mr. Greenspan might dust off his remarks about "irrational exuberance." As it happens, Friday was the first anniversary of his use of that phrase. The S.& P. 500 is up 32 percent since then.

HEADLINE: 3 Companies In U.S. Share Asia's Pain

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Several American companies in widely different industries -- aerospace, soft drinks and computer software -- but with big global presences are beginning to feel negative effects from Asia's financial crisis.
The Boeing Company said yesterday that Asian airlines might delay taking delivery of as many as 60 jetliners over the next three years because economic problems were slowing growth in airline traffic. Securities analysts said profits at Coca-Cola Company would decline in the fourth quarter and in 1998 from a strong dollar, which has risen sharply against Asian currencies. And the Oracle Corporation reported disappointing earnings, also hurt partly by the dollar's strength. 
 Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker, could see as many as 20 Asian deliveries a year delayed though 2000, said Gordon McHenry, director of airline industry analysis for Boeing. The company still expects to deliver the jetliners, starting in 2001, when an economic rebound is predicted in the region, he said. The company's stock fell 93.75 cents yesterday, to $51.4375.
A loss of 20 deliveries a year would be small compared with the company's expected total worldwide delivery of 550 planes next year, Mr. McHenry said. Yet analysts said Boeing's report did not eliminate their concerns about the uncertainties of doing business in Asia.
The shares of Coca-Cola, which gets 80 percent of its profit from abroad, fell $2.50, to $63.5625, on diminished profit expectations. Coca-Cola gets 17 percent of its profit from Japan, and in the last three months the dollar has gained nearly 8 percent against the yen, reducing the amount of profit in dollar terms.

HEADLINE: Evangelical Protestants Giving Less to Churches, Study Says

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR

 BODY:
Evangelical Protestants, whose churches have historically urged members to tithe their incomes, are placing a decreasing percentage of their personal incomes in the collection plate, according to a wide-ranging study released yesterday of giving patterns in 29 Protestant denominations.
A portion of the study, titled, "The State of Church Giving Through 1995," compared personal giving within eight denominations belonging to the National Association of Evangelicals and eight mainline Protestant denominations in the National Council of Churches. From 1968 to 1995, it found a steady narrowing of the difference in giving as a proportion of income between mainline Protestants -- a group that includes most Presbyterians and Lutherans, for example -- and evangelicals, who emphasize a personal conversion experience, or being "born again." 
 The study found that members of the evangelical denominations were giving their churches an average of about 4 percent of their incomes in 1995, down from about 6 percent in 1968. Giving by members of the mainline Protestant denominations -- lower to begin with -- also declined, but less sharply, to 2.9 percent of personal income in 1995, from about 3.3 percent in 1968.
The study was done by Empty Tomb, a Christian research and service organization in Champaign, Ill., that has published an annual survey on church giving since 1988. The organization bases its calculations on financial and membership figures published by 29 Protestant denominations in The Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches (Abingdon). For figures on per capita disposable personal income, the organization relies on annual estimates of the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The current study also reports that while the value of individual church members' donations to the 29 Protestant denominations rose to an average of about $498 in 1995, from about $97 in 1968, that increase was less than the growth in after-tax personal income in the same period.
Referring to the statistics on evangelicals' giving, Sylvia Ronsvalle, Empty Tomb's executive vice president, said she believed that they reflected how evangelicals had become closer to the broader American culture, their economic and political status having risen since the 1960's.
Although he had not seen the statistics, Richard Cizik, a policy analyst in the National Association of Evangelicals' governmental affairs office, said the findings also suggested that evangelicals were increasingly inclined to give to religious causes outside their churches.
The eight evangelical denominations in the study were the Brethren in Christ Church, the Church of the Nazarene, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, the Evangelical Congregational Church, the Evangelical Mennonite Church, the Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches, the Free Methodist Church of North America and the General Association of General Baptists.
The eight mainline denominations were the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.; the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ); the Church of the Brethren; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; the Moravian Church in America, Northern Province; the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ.

HEADLINE: HUD Has An 800 Line To Give Aid To the Needy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
With expectations of a colder winter than usual in many parts of the country, the Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced the creation of a toll-free telephone number to summon aid for homeless people caught without food and shelter.
Department officials said the number would also be used to encourage more Americans to get involved in solving problems that lead to the deaths of several hundred homeless people every year because of exposure. Severe conditions are possible this winter, they said, because of El Nino, the warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that disrupts normal weather patterns. 
 "This is literally a matter of life and death," Andrew M. Cuomo, the Housing Secretary, said in a speech that was broadcast to groups that work with homeless in 66 cities.
Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, a nonprofit organization, applauded the department's efforts so far as they go. But like others who work to reduce the homeless population, Ms. Foscarinis said she was more concerned about solving economic and social problems that lead to homelessness.
"The important thing," she said, "is educating the public about homelessness and finding solutions. People who see homeless on the street are concerned, and they want to respond. But what's missing is why people are homeless. It's important to look for real solutions."
The initiative is part of the Clinton Administration's continuing efforts to reduce the number of homeless people, officials said, at a time when most major cities cannot provide adequate shelter to meet the nightly demand. The housing department estimates that at least 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night, and a 1996 analysis of the homeless population by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty found that none of the nation's 50 biggest cities had sufficient beds to accommodate them.
The study found that in many of the bigger cities, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the disparity was especially large. Houston, for example, had 2,238 emergency shelter beds and a homeless population of 12,000.
Mr. Cuomo said the Federal Government had stepped up its efforts for the homeless, with $823 million available for homeless programs as part of the latest budget, compared with the $300 million that was authorized four years ago.
But as part of today's announcement, he gave the equivalent of a national pep talk, imploring the 5,000 service providers who were tuned in around the country to intensify their own efforts by arranging for additional emergency shelter in their communities for the months ahead.
"Resources are one problem we have to deal with," he said. "Do we have enough? No. Can we use more? Yes. Can they be increased? Yes."
Housing officials are planning a dual role for the toll-free telephone number, (800) HUD-1010. Its most urgent use is to allow a caller to summon help for a homeless person in desperate need of shelter or food. The caller will be immediately connected to a local homeless service.
But housing officials said the number would also allow local organizations to engage callers in a wider conversation about homelessness, to explain other ways help was needed.
Thomas J. Knoll, executive director of Community Family Life Services in Washington, said the possibility of recruiting people to help was "what excites me the most about the hot line."
Peg Reece, executive director of Unity for the Homeless in New Orleans, a nonprofit group, said New Orleans already had an elaborate emergency response system in place for severe weather that includes a toll-free number.
"But the H.U.D. number would more likely help people learn how they can get more involved," Ms. Reece said.
Mr. Cuomo disputed the notion that many Americans calling to alert the authorities to a homeless person would feel put off by an extended conversation about social ills and community needs. To the contrary, he argued. "Most people want to help but don't know how to get involved," he said.
Lee Blons, executive director of Caritas, a nonprofit homelessness organization in Richmond, said, "Most people who are concerned enough to pick up the phone would be willing to be asked to do more."
To promote the effort, the housing department intends to distribute 300,000 wallet-sized cards in supermarkets, bookstores and community centers around the country that list the toll-free number as well as 10 suggestions for to volunteer time and money to help eliminate the causes of homelessness.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Falling by 38.29

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed, as some big blue chips fell on concerns that the Asian crisis could hurt earnings while technologies issues gained.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 38.29, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,110.84, its first decline in seven sessions. Coca-Cola led the the decline in the Dow, falling 2 1/8, to 63 9/16. Coca-Cola was responsible for 10.2 points of the Dow's loss. 
 Coca-Cola fell after Andrew Conway at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover and Jennifer F. Solomon at Salomon Smith Barney cut their earnings estimates for the company. Both cited the dollar's strength against the yen, as currency earned overseas will be worth less when converted into dollars.
The Boeing Company fell 15/16, to 51 7/16, after the company said the delivery of as many as 60 of its jetliners would be delayed over the next three years because of slower growth in airline traffic in Asia.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, up 33 percent this year, fell 1.42, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to 982.37. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks small- and mid-capitalization companies, rose 3.97, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 442.03.The Nasdaq composite gained 17.64, to 1,651.54.
The Microsoft Corporation led the Nasdaq higher. While Microsoft has been one of the market's stellar stocks, more than quintupling over the last five years, it has lagged of late. It has not set a record since July 17, when it closed at 149 1/2. The Intel Corporation, up 7/8, to 78 7/16, is off 22 percent from its Aug. 20 high.
The Nasdaq, dominated by technology companies, has gained 7.6 percent since the market tumbled Oct. 27. The Dow, meanwhile, filled with huge multinationals, many of them regarded as safe, is up 13 percent. The average is off less than 2 percent from its Aug. 6 high of 8,259.31.
Bank stocks rose after the First American Corporation said it had agreed to buy the Deposit Guaranty Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation said they would merge, intensifying speculation that other combinations are in store. "More bank deals are likely to be in the works," said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "The focus continues on increasing shareholder value. Low interest rates have prompted them, and more are to come."
The Mellon Bank Corporation rose 4 3/8, to 63, The Banc One Corporation gained 1, to 56 1/2, and the Nationsbank Corporation rose 1 1/8, to 62 1/8.
First American, parent company of First American National Bank, offered 1.17 of its own shares for each Deposit Guaranty share, valuing Deposit Guaranty's stock at $64.06. Deposit Guaranty rose 4 5/8, to 57, and First American fell 5 3/16, to 49 9/16.
America Online Inc., which is up 162 percent this year, rose 2 7/8, to 87 1/4. The stock was rated a new "buy" by Frederick W. Moran, a media analyst at the brokerage firm Furman Selz Inc. Mr. Moran said the Internet service had added capacity to fix a bottleneck that made it hard for subscribers to gain access to AOL last year. AOL's position as the largest provider of Internet access, with 10 million subscribers, sets it up to capitalize on the falling price of personal computers, Mr. Moran said. Fannie Mae fell 1 3/4, to 54 11/16; Freddie Mac lost 1 1/16, to 41 3/4, and Countrywide Credit Industries fell 1/2, to 42 3/16, after the three stocks were reduced to "hold" from "buy" by David Dusenbury, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.

HEADLINE: Auto Business Sold to Rival In Korea Crisis

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Ssangyong Group, one of Korea's biggest family-run businesses, has sold off its automobile company to the rival Daewoo Group in what executives described as the first friendly takeover in the history of Korea's largest conglomerates.
The unusual sale, a step in the consolidation of Korea's overcrowded automobile industry, capped a swirl of activity as Korea Inc. continued the makeover spurred by the nation's economic crisis and the rescue by the International Monetary Fund last week. 
 In addition to its purchase of the automobile company, Daewoo announced on Monday its greatest management reshuffle ever. It will send the 24 chairmen of its major subsidiaries to new overseas posts where they will head regional offices in charge of all Daewoo products.
The giant Hyundai Group, after an arm-pumping rally in its auditorium, said it would cut capital investment next year by 40 percent and mount a big export drive.
Officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy said they were preparing to inject what could be about $1 billion in Government money into two of the nation's sickest commercial banks -- effectively nationalizing them, analysts said.
Fear that more financial and industrial companies might fail helped send the Korean won free-falling toward another low.
The currency market was also roiled by reports that the South Korean Government might be understating the extent of its financial problems -- leading to fears that more money might be needed than the $57 billion committed by the I.M.F.
South Korea said its short-term foreign currency debt, payable within a year, is about $66 billion. But news reports here say, and a Finance Ministry official conceded, that this figure does not include the debts held by overseas subsidiaries of Korean companies. This amount, which Korea calls spot financing, is about $50 billion, although it cannot simply be added to the $66 billion to get a total because there is some double counting.
Kwak Sang Yong, associate director of the foreign exchange policy division of the finance ministry, said that the $66 billion conforms to the World Bank standard, which is debt owed by residents to nonresidents and is not based on nationality. Overseas subsidiaries tend to borrow locally based on their own assets.
"Do you think the Korean government must include AST's financial liability in our nation's external debt," he said, referring to an American computer company owned by Samsung Electronics. "I don't think any country in the world would do that."
Meanwhile the Chosun Ilbo, the nation's leading newspaper, said on Monday that the Government's foreign currency reserves had droppped to as low as $5 billion by the time the I.M.F. rescue was announced last week, well below the last official reported figure of $30.5 billion at the end of October. Stocks were down more than 6 percent this morning after a 4.8 percent decline on Monday.
The sale of control of the Ssangyong Motor Company to Daewoo, which probably saved the Ssangyong Group from collapse, could set a precedent for restructuring of the family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, that dominate the economy here. Now highly diversified, they may focus on fewer industries and sell the rest -- either to other chaebol or to foreign companies. Last month Ssangyong sold its paper company to Procter & Gamble.
Until now, the chaebols had easy access to capital and competed for bragging rights by becoming bigger and more diversified -- leading to overcapacity and soaring debts. To give up part of one's empire, especially to a rival family, was a disgrace.
But the financial problems of the chaebol could change that attitude. "The reason the chaebol became so big and fat and diversified was that the more you did the more money you made," said Milton S. Kim, president of the Ssangyong Investment and Securities Company and a member of the family that controls the Ssangyong Group. "Now, the tide has changed. Small is beautiful."
Ssangyong, the sixth-largest chaebol, accumulated too much debt through an ill-conceived expansion into the already crowded passenger car business. Six of the nation's top 30 chaebol have already failed this year, including the Halla Group, which was declared bankrupt on Saturday. Many analysts thought Ssangyong would be No. 7.
"We were understandably on the short list, but this should take us off it," Mr. Kim said. "It gives us a huge breathing space."
The purchase price for Ssangyong Group's 53.5 percent share of publicly traded Ssangyong Motor was not announced but it is expected to be a pittance. What is much more important, Mr. Kim said, is that Daewoo will relieve the Ssangyong group of 2 trillion won -- or about $1.5 billion -- of the 3.4 trillion won in debt of Ssangyong Motor.
Furthermore, the creditors, led by the Cho Hung Bank, will reschedule the debt, giving Daewoo a moratorium on payment of principal for 10 years and Ssangyong for 5 years. Interests rates will also be set at prime rate or slightly above, about half the going rate in Korea.
Ssangyong's tale is typical of the chaebol. With its main strength in cement and oil, the group bought its supplier of cement-mixing trucks in the mid-1980's and became a manufacturer of trucks, buses and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
But a few years ago, Kim Suk Won, the group's chairman at the time and a car enthusiast, decided to enter the passenger car business with technology supplied by Daimler-Benz of Germany. The car, called the Chairman and costing roughly $35,000, went on sale last month as the most expensive passenger car in Korea. But production of a luxury car is not expected to be large enough to cover the investment.
The purchase by Daewoo is the latest step in the consolidation of the overcrowded auto industry. Earlier this year, the Kia Motors Corporation went bankrupt and was taken over by the Government.
The Samsung Group will begin selling cars next year, but has postponed expansion of its capacity.
Already South Korea's industry is operating at well below capacity and auto sales in Korea, down 2.4 percent so far this year, are expected to nose- dive next year because the I.M.F. rescue will result in much slower growth and higher unemployment.
For Daewoo, Korea's No. 2 auto maker, the purchase allows it to have a full product line, from mini-cars to large trucks, to challenge the market leader, Hyundai Motor. Ssangyong's sport utility vehicles and trucks barely overlap the passenger car product line of Daewoo Motor.
Daewoo has been expanding rapidly, both in Korea and around the world, building or buying factories mainly in developing regions like Eastern Europe. It plans to enter the American market with three passenger cars next year and may eventually add Ssangyong's sport utility vehicle to its American lineup.
An official in the Daewoo chairman's office insisted that taking on Ssangyong's debt would not endanger Daewoo. Daimler-Benz, which owns 2.4 percent of Ssangyong Motor and looked at buying the company, is expected to continue technical help, the Daewoo official said.
On the banking front, officials at the Ministry of Finance said that on the Government would inject new equity today into the Korea First Bank and the Seoul Bank, two commercial banks that are now basically insolvent because of their heavy loans to now collapsed chaebols.
While ministry officials said the amount of the infusion had not been decided, Korean news reports indicated the Seoul Bank would get 1.1 trillion won, or about $820 million. The Korea First Bank, which was already given 800 trillion won more than a month ago, will be given an additional 300 billion won, or about $220 million.
The South Korean Government battled fiercely against I.M.F. requests that it shut insolvent banks to speed the restructuring of the financial sector. When they announced the terms of the rescue agreement, South Korean officials did not initially tell the public that they had agreed with the I.M.F. to shut two unnamed commercial banks if the banks did not meet international capital standards after a certain period.
While analysts said the Government would now be the controlling owner of both banks, a Finance Ministry official said "the Government will definitely, as soon as possible, divest" itself of its shares once the banks get back on their feet.
But Kim Chul Jung, banking analyst at Ssangyong Securities, said the new equity was still not enough to erase the two banks' negative book value. He said the banks might be closed or merged eventually.

HEADLINE: Talk in Japan of Selling U.S. Bonds Has Little Effect

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Once again, talk of a Japanese selloff of United States Treasury bonds has been heard, briefly raising the possibility of new market tremors, but this time few investors seemed rattled.
Indeed, it turns out that the Bank of Japan has been quietly selling some Treasury holdings for days, causing barely a stir. 
 The latest speculation about a sale of bonds came on Sunday, when Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council, said the Government was considering selling some Treasuries to help troubled Japanese banks raise dollars they needed.
Japanese news reports described Mr. Yamasaki's suggestion as more serious than the offhand comment made six months ago by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on the possibility of such sales, which rattled markets worldwide and sent United States stock prices down.
But today the markets seemed to largely shrug off the possibility of a big Treasury bond sale. In the United States, stocks were mixed and bond prices only dipped.
 Japanese stocks rallied sharply early Tuesday on reports that Mr. Hashimoto favors spending $77 billion to help financial companies write off bad loans. The Nikkei 225-stock index rose 518.16 points, or 3.22 percent, to 16,650.25.
Bankers and foreign-exchange brokers here said even before Mr. Yamasaki's proposal was reported that the nation's central bank had been selling some Treasury holdings to raise dollars in the repurchase market, meaning it has agreed to buy them back later. These sales are essentially loans using Treasury instruments as collateral, and do not increase the supply available.
The central bank has been using the proceeds for loans to banks confronted with high borrowing costs. Lenders have cast an increasingly wary eye upon the health of the entire financial system, afterfour large institutions collapsed last month.
The possibility that Japan might unload United States Treasury holdings, an idea heard from time to time, could have a big impact on the markets. Japan is the largest foreign holder of United States Government debt, and a substantial sale could cause a supply glut that sends prices down and interest rates up.
But Japanese officials said no selloff of Treasury bonds was envisioned. They noted that any money raised would be done through the repurchase market -- the same process the central bank is using.
Behind Mr. Yamasaki's remarks seemed to be the idea that the central bank could temporarily lend the proceeds of bond sales to banks facing difficulty borrowing, thereby alleviating the credit squeeze.
"It's a way for the Government to give cheap financing to Japanese banks in a situation where the market is not judging credit risks in the same way it would under normal conditions," said Robert Alan Feldman of Salomon Brothers Asia.
Foreign-exchange brokers said the central bank had entrusted the proceeds of sales made in recent days to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Bank, which in turn have made loans to their shakier brethren.
A currency broker who spoke on condition of anonymity said some banks pressed for cash last week were now issuing certificates of deposit to other Japanese financial institutions that needed funds. .
In that way, the Bank of Japan has solved the short-term financing problems many commercial banks have confronted. Indeed, the only footprint the central bank has left is in the "Japan premium," the extra tenths of a percentage point that Japanese banks pay to borrow overseas. These premiums have fallen roughly in half.
The central bank does not disclose its total United States bond holdings. All Japanese investors held slightly more than 6 percent, or $330 billion, in Treasuries at the end of 1996, said Ronald Bevacqua of Merrill Lynch.
As such, Japanese investors as a group can influence United States bond prices and yields -- potential leverage in any economic dispute between the two largest economies. But few expect Japan to use it.
Historically, the Japanese have held Treasury bills in times of distress, most recently in 1995, when concerns about the Japanese financial system made credit expensive.
Second, interest rates in Japan are measured in tenths of a percent, rather than full percentage points, making Treasuries about the highest-yielding asset held by Japanese institutional investors.
Third, this coming April 1, longstanding regulations curbing Japanese purchases of investments denominated in currencies other than yen will end, which could cause a flow of capital out of the country..
Already, the Japanese subsidiary of Citibank is reporting a large increase in its deposits.
And Japanese banks, which are large holders of United States assets, cannot afford to cash out their Treasuries. As of March 31, most big banks must meet the Bank of International Settlements' standard that they maintain capital equal to 8 percent of their assets. A reduction in their United States Treasury bills, which are considered virtually risk-free, would make that harder to achieve.
The greatest curb on a Japanese sale of American bonds lies in the global consequences of such an action. "From the Government's perspective, they're well aware of the implications of a large-scale liquidation of U.S. Treasuries, including higher interest rates worldwide and an increase in the Japan premium as well," said Kathy Matsui, Goldman Sachs Japan's chief market strategist here.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Fair Fares

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki put himself behind imaginative discounts in transit fares yesterday when he endorsed unlimited-ride monthly, weekly and daily passes and other breaks for New York City's subway and bus riders. The Governor's plan is sensible and superior to that proposed by city officials. He needs to insure that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board, which he dominates, approves the development of discount options and gives transit executives freedom to experiment and fiddle with fares at the M.T.A.'s next board meeting later this month.
Mr. Pataki's proposal will lessen the transit drain on many riders' wallets, and it suggests that those who share responsibility for governing New York and nurturing its economy want the city and region to offer the array of rapid-transit fares long taken for granted in London, Paris, Tokyo and other world capitals and in U.S. cities as well. 
 The Governor's plan sets out to introduce deep-discount options in exchange for unlimited rides for customers with different needs, desires and incomes: a monthly pass priced at $63 (the cost of 42 rides), a weekly one priced at $17 and a one-day $4 pass, as well as breaks for senior citizens and users of express buses. Equally important, his proposal will allow the transit executives to begin to exploit the Metrocard's vast untapped power to lure different kinds of customers to ride more often. Designing an off-peak fare that can relieve rush-hour overcrowding should be on the M.T.A.'s agenda.
While not much was said about when these fare options will kick in, it appears that the M.T.A. is poised to roll out its set of discounted, unlimited-ride fares next summer. That is too far off. It should only take about 90 days to assess the fare structure's fairness to riders of various incomes, adjust accordingly if necessary, and build customer awareness.
With such a long lead time, transit executives might well seek advice on fine-tuning the pricing from an advisory panel composed of individuals sensitive to the city's social goals and others who are experts at defining the right price points for generating revenues. Few issues have such impact on individuals and businesses as the fares charged for mass transit.

HEADLINE: California G.O.P. Faces a Crisis As Hispanic Voters Turn Away

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The California Republican Party, the mighty army that helped propel Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to the White House, now finds itself facing a big problem: It is rapidly losing ground among the fastest-growing group in the electorate of the nation's most-populous state, Hispanic voters. Expressed in either English or Spanish, the arithmetic is clear.
By 2025, the Census Bureau projects, the Hispanic share of California's population will rise to 43 percent, from just under 30 percent now, an increase of some 12 million people and the largest such gain in the nation. By 2000, Hispanic residents are expected to account for nearly 30 percent of the voting-age population, though citizenship, voter registration and participation lag well behind that level. 
 Republicans, burned by a backlash against Gov. Pete Wilson's strong stands against illegal immigration and affirmative action, have seen their share of the Hispanic vote slide precipitously. When first elected in 1990, Mr. Wilson won about 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.
That dropped to 25 percent in 1994 when he campaigned for Proposition 187, a measure to cut off public services to illegal immigrants that was passed by voters but has since been blocked in Federal court.
There was a political case to be made for the Governor's stance: Mr. Wilson, his popularity buffeted by the state's economic downturn, was trying to solidify his base among whites in what initially seemed like a close race for re-election against State Treasurer Kathleen Brown. He was also exploring a campaign for President, and his position on illegal immigration was widely considered a potential plus among conservative Republicans in the party primaries.
But now Mr. Wilson's short-term strategy seems to be causing long-term headaches for his party. At least one statewide poll shows State Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republicans' presumptive nominee for governor next year, drawing the support of only about 14 percent of the Hispanic voters.
That is an ominous prospect for any party in a state that is poised to become the first on the mainland where non-Hispanic whites are a minority. The national implications for the party are also sobering, both because of California's electoral importance as the most-populous state and because of growing Hispanic populations in states like Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois.
"The trend is obvious, and the political danger is real," Stuart Spencer, one of the California's most respected Republican strategists, warned in an open memorandum to party leaders 10 days ago.
Mr. Spencer wrote that the party risked "political suicide and dooms itself to permanent minority status in California" if it did not reach out to Hispanic voters.
"We are dramatically losing market share of the fastest-growing segment of the electorate," he warned. "These are voters who should be with us on the issues of jobs, taxes, Government regulation, education, public safety and the importance of family."
Nationally, about one million more Hispanic voters turned out in 1996 than in 1992, and Mr. Spencer, who worked for Mr. Reagan and Gerald Ford, is not alone in his determination to keep California, so often a national bellwether, from setting the pattern for the national party.
Many Republicans are concerned that a California ballot proposal to end bilingual education in the public schools, which is sponsored by Ron Unz, a multimillionaire and former Republican candidate for governor, will further alienate Hispanic voters. Party regulars endorsed the measure, which is expected to qualify for the ballot next year, at their state convention this fall, but the state Republican chairman, Michael J. Schroeder, actively opposes it and says the party will "not spend a dime" to support it.
The problem is all the more frustrating to many Republicans because the party has shown in recent contests that it can make inroads among Hispanic voters. In Los Angeles, Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican, won re-election last spring with the support of 60 percent of Hispanic voters, who for the first time exceeded black voters as a share of the electorate.
"I do think it's a constituency that we should have a lot of affinity with," said Alex Castellanos, a Cuban-born Republican consultant in Washington who has worked for clients like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. "It's an absolutist culture, very black and white, with strong moral values. I think that's Republican culture. It's a strong Catholic culture, one of the few groups where the abortion issue is not fuzzy."
"It is also, and this is something that's hard to talk about, but it's more of a daddy-bear, father-figure culture, and Republicans have been very successful with crime and other patriarchal issues," Mr. Castellanos said. "At the same time, we're seeing the biggest economic boom in world history, with tremendous opportunity for economic success, and nothing is more likely to make you a Republican than being economically successful and paying a lot of taxes."
At the moment, the gap between the parties here is striking. The chairman of the state Democratic Party is former State Senator Art Torres, while Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, is the first Hispanic Speaker of the State Assembly. There are five Hispanic Democrats from California in Congress, and no Republicans. There are 17 Hispanic Democrats in the state Legislature and 1 Republican, Rod Pacheco of Riverside, who last year became the first Hispanic Republican elected to the Assembly in 115 years.
Republicans here were concerned enough that they staged a special daylong Latino Summit in September intended to mend fences. Mr. Wilson, who says his opposition to illegal immigration was twisted by Democrats to suggest that he opposed services for legal immigrants, defended his actions and accused his opponents of "a massive disinformation campaign, based on that ugliest of accusations: racism."
But though few Republicans are willing to say so openly, it is clear that Mr. Wilson, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election, remains highly unpopular among Hispanic voters and is something of an impediment to the party's efforts to reach out to them. His re-election advertisements in 1994 showed grainy black and white footage purporting to depict illegal immigrants streaming from Mexico as a narrator intoned, "They keep coming."
"There were some fundamental miscalculations," said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected an Appointed Officials, a nonpartisan group here. "With the short-term strategy that Wilson implemented for his own re-election, he gambled away the Latino votes of the Republican Party."
By contrast, Mr. Vargas said, another Republican, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who speaks fluent Spanish, has generally good relations with Hispanic voters because "he gets it, he understands what Latinos mean to the future of his state."
Still, 2 of every 3 new Hispanic voters in Texas register Democratic.
Mr. Spencer has been urging California Republicans for years to make more of an effort to appeal to Hispanic voters, and he wrote his memorandum in support of Ruben Barrales, a 35-year-old San Mateo County Supervisor in the San Francisco Bay area who is seeking the Republican nomination for state treasurer next year. "If we cannot even support just one qualified Latino Republican for statewide office, then we deserve the political disaster that awaits us," Mr. Spencer wrote.
Assemblyman Pacheco noted that Mr. Reagan enjoyed the support of almost 50 percent of Hispanic voters, twice the level of last year's Republican Presidential candidate.
Mr. Spencer said Republicans had a history of similar mistakes.
"Our party has a sad (and politically self-defeating) history of alienating immigrant groups and new voters," he wrote. "The G.O.P. closed the door to Irish and Italian immigrants in Massachusetts and New York in the last century. We did the same to Poles and other Eastern Europeans in Chicago and other urban centers. We did it again to Asian-Americans in Hawaii."
Mr. Schroeder, the Republican chairman, has for the first time hired a full-time Hispanic outreach coordinator and has made increasing diversity in the party his top goal.
"The broader challenge for the party is to get the debate back with the issues that work for us: economic opportunity, strong values," Mr. Schroeder said. "Where we got off the beam is that some of the ads run by Republican candidates in recent years conveyed the message that Republicans don't like Hispanics, and to quote Jack Kemp, 'If people don't know that you care, they won't care what you know.' "
There have been a few rough spots on Mr. Schroeder's watch. A "Pride in Diversity" breakfast at the state convention this fall featured Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, who has asserted that "white men are an endangered species."
And as a private lawyer, Mr. Schroeder has drawn Democratic fire for representing former Representative Robert K. Dornan, the Orange County Republican, in his effort to show that voter fraud by Hispanic rights groups was responsible for his narrow loss to Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat, last year. Mr. Schroeder explains that effort by saying "We believe in outreach to Hispanics, not outreach to felons."
Mr. Pacheco said that halting the trend was still possible.
"We do have time to change," he said. "It's got to be done quickly, and sincerely. If it's just done for the next election, nobody's going to buy that."

Blue Chips Fall on Concern Over Impact of Asian Crisis
Concern about Asia's impact on corporate earnings helped pull down the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 38.29 points, or half of 1 percent, at 8,110.84 -- its first decline in seven sessions. Coca-Cola led the decline in the Dow after analysts said that the strong dollar would hurt the company's profits in Asian markets. The S.& P. 500 slipped 1.42 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent.
But technology issues were stronger, and the Nasdaq composite index, led by Microsoft, gained 17.64 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,651.54. D14 

Other companies in the United States are being hurt by the turmoil in Asia. Boeing said Asian airlines might delay taking delivery of as many as 60 jetliners over the next three years because the region's economic problems were slowing growth in airline traffic. Oracle reported disappointing earnings, hurt in part by the strength of the dollar in Asia. D2.

HEADLINE: PATAKI ANNOUNCES UNLIMITED PASSES FOR CITY TRANSIT

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced a program of monthly, weekly and daily passes yesterday that will give mass transit users unlimited trips for a fixed price and drastically change one of the central aspects of public transportation in New York City.
The passes, which will cost $63 for a month, $17 for a week or $4 for a day, are priced to give the biggest breaks to people who use the system for more than just a five-day-a-week commute: workers who hold two jobs, parents who take their children to school and then go to work, people who go out at night. The plan also calls for half-price passes for people over 65 and a cut in the fares on express buses to Manhattan from $4 to $3. 
 The Governor said the passes would cost the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $236 million a year in revenue it would otherwise collect if pass holders paid the full $1.50 fare. But officials said the cost would be financed by growing farebox and tax revenues that by September had produced a surplus of $128 million, a figure that continues to grow. The remaining money, at least $60 million, officials estimate, would come from unspecified cost-cutting in the transit agency.
Combined with other discounts for users of the Metrocard that have been approved in recent months, the passes, Mr. Pataki said, would help create a more seamless, user-friendly transit system, one that would make New Yorkers considerably more mobile and, in turn, stimulate the economy and cut pollution and traffic by tempting drivers and cab riders back onto mass transit.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had urged that the surplus be used to give 12 rides for the price of 10, was disappointed by the announcement. "It does not really help the most typical subway rider, which is the person who uses the subway twice a day to go to work and return from work," he said.
For a transit system that for decades has operated on a one-fare, one-ride philosophy, Mr. Pataki's announcement marked an ambitious change. It also was a remarkable turnaround for the Governor himself, who less than three years ago was painted as the villain who initiated the first subway service cuts in decades and who brought about a 25-cent fare increase. News analysis, page B7.
"The goal here," Mr. Pataki said, "was very simply to empower the rider. Empower the person who takes the subway and the person who takes the bus by giving them the broadest possible range of options as to how they want to choose to use the mass transit system."
The M.T.A. already plans to offer Metrocard users a 10 percent bonuson bulk purchases starting next month -- giving them 11 rides for the price of 10 and effectively rolling the fare back to $1.36. Since July, bus-to-subway transfers have been free.
The passes are expected to increase ridership by up to 100 million passengers a year, the Governor said, a 6 percent increase over the transit system's annual ridership of 1.5 billion. State officials said they expected "hundreds of thousands" of riders to buy both the monthly and weekly passes. The passes would be valid from the date of purchase rather than from the beginning of the month or week, officials said. The millions of dollars in interest the M.T.A. could earn each month from riders who pay for their trips in advance would partly offset the cost of the pass program.
The M.T.A. board, which is controlled by the Governor's appointees, is expected to approve the pass system on Dec. 18. The new passes might be available by next summer, only months before Mr. Pataki seeks re-election.
The passes would not yield savings for everyone. In order to save money beyond the 11-for-10 deal, a cardholder would have to ride the system 47 times a month. That means that someone who uses the system simply to commute to and from work five days a week, or about 40 rides a month, would not benefit. Similarly, to come out ahead on a weekly pass, a Metrocard user would have to take 13 rides.
The package's only flat-out fare cut calls for a decrease to $3, from $4, in the fare on the M.T.A.'s express buses to Manhattan, which are used by 25,000 commuters, 80 percent of them on Staten Island. Another 40,000 commuters ride private express buses regulated and subsidized by the city, and city officials have said they would match any fare cut by the M.T.A. The Governor's plan also calls for a $120 monthly express bus pass that would be good on subways and regular buses as well.
In announcing the transit pass plan, Mr. Pataki rejected a plan pushed by Mayor Giuliani and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, that would have used the transit surplus to offer 12 rides for the price of 10, an idea that would effectively cut the fare to $1.25 -- where it was before the fare increase of 1995. Such a discount, they argued, would give a break to all riders no matter how often they traveled.
"I have no specific objection to the package of benefits that they're talking about," the Mayor said. "But the benefits are going to be given to people who use the subways six or seven days a week, or people who visit the city."
Mr. Vallone said in a statement, "A strategy to increase ridership is smart. A plan that excludes our city's working class is not."
But Mr. Pataki said his plan provided the greatest benefit to the low-income New Yorkers who are most dependent on mass transit. And he dismissed suggestions that he rejected the 12-for-10 proposal in order to deprive Mr. Vallone, who is considering running against him next November, of a political victory.
The transit and environmental advocates who flanked him at a news conference in Manhattan said he chose the best plan.
"The most successful fare programs are the ones that give a variety of discounts because there are different markets," said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group that has been fighting for monthly passes since the 1970's. "And I haven't been been to a single community forum in 20 years as a transit advocate where someone hasn't asked me how come New York doesn't have a monthly or weekly pass." Many big cities, including London, Paris, Los Angeles and Chicago, have had monthly and weekly transit passes for years.
Mr. Russianoff, who has often criticized Mr. Pataki for cutting state transit subsidies and for presiding over the 25-cent fare increase in 1995, the biggest in the history of the system, praised the Governor's proposal as "bold" and "innovative."
Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the New York Urban League, which sued the M.T.A. unsuccessfully to block the 1995 fare increase on the grounds that it discriminated against minority groups, called the proposal "a very positive step for the working-class citizens of New York City." He added that the weekly passes would be attractive to people who could not afford to spend $63 at once on transit.
Officials said the pass would be a form of the Metrocard, the plastic-coated card with a magnetic strip that allows fares to be deducted electronically at turnstiles.
Riders will be prevented from handing the pass off to others at the turnstile by a feature that will make it impossible to use the card more than once at the same station within a certain period of time, perhaps 20 minutes, officials said. But nothing will stop pass holders from lending their passes to someone else when they were not using the system, and Mr. Pataki said that was fine.
"We would not consider it an abuse," he said, "if someone uses the card Monday through Friday, then gives it to their kid on the weekend to go out. This is a card for the whole family."
Some transit advocates had argued that the surplus should go to rebuild the transit system, or to help pay off its mounting debt, the payments on which are scheduled to hit nearly a billion dollars a year after 2000, which could put pressure on the M.T.A. to raise fares again.
But Mr. Pataki said he felt that the best way to strengthen the system in the long term was to build ridership. Although some subway lines in Manhattan are already jammed during rush hours, Mr. Russianoff said that overall, the subways carry only half as many people as they did 50 years ago and that the passes would go a long way toward making mass transit central to more people's lives.
The pass system would be the shining moment for the Metrocard, which was introduced in 1994, along with a $750 million turnstile system, precisely because it would allow the M.T.A. to offer variable pricing. After initial resistance, it is now used by more than half of riders.
John Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a watchdog group, said that the package of discounts represented "sort of the end of the era of transit pessimism" in the city.
"The subway system was this icon of decrepit, crime-ridden New York," he said. "Now that the system is more or less functioning, we can start looking at stuff like ridership incentives. People are going to flood into the system because of these options."
