Gains by Vioxx Competitors Appear to Be Short-Lived
The Pfizer painkillers Celebrex and Bextra experienced a jump in sales immediately after Merck pulled Vioxx from the market, but the gains appear to have been short-lived, according to data from market research firms.
 Indeed, doctors appear to be avoiding putting patients on Bextra, which some studies suggest might have some of the same heart risks as Vioxx, according to ImpactRx, which tracks physician practices. [Page C2.]

Pfizer Plans Filings on New Drugs
Pfizer is on schedule to complete the filing of 20 new drug applications by the end of 2006 as it confronts patent expirations affecting 31 percent of its sales, said its chief executive, Henry A. McKinnell Jr., left. A new combination cholesterol medicine, a pill to help smokers quit and a portfolio of cancer drugs will do the most to replace $14 billion in annual revenue from drugs that will face generic competition. [C2.]

Growth of Global Economy Slowing
Prospects for the global economy next year are growing dimmer as high oil prices hurt consumption and the unchecked rise in the United States trade deficit depresses the dollar, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said. [C3.]

A.I.G. in Deal With Regulators
American International Group and regulators have finalized a settlement that calls for the company to pay $126 million in penalties and restitution and to allow an independent monitor to review the company's books. The Justice Department said that it had agreed not to pursue criminal charges against a unit of A.I.G. for 13 months. [C2.]

HEADLINE: Partisans Sound Off at Hearing on Competing Building Codes

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City's comprehensive endeavor to overhaul its construction codes got its first full public airing yesterday, as hundreds of plumbers, steamfitters, construction workers and firefighters packed a City Council hearing and occasionally disagreed noisily in support of two competing bills.
 To standardize the elaborate patchwork of local regulations that have made putting up buildings in New York a complex maze, both bills would adapt many of the same codes used throughout the nation. The codes recognize new construction materials and techniques, while preserving many of the precautions put in place for a densely packed, high-rise city.
 One bill, known as Introduction 478, is based on the International Building Code, the standard used by most cities and states. The bill has the strong backing of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the real estate industry, who say it will reduce costs and simplify the construction process. 
 The second bill, known as Introduction 368, endorses a newer code designed by the National Fire Protection Association. It has won the support of the firefighters' and plumbers' unions, in part because they say the safety provisions are more stringent, but also because they are angry that the process has largely unfolded behind closed doors.
 Yesterday, at the Council's Housing and Building Committee, the standing-room-only crowd was dominated by people sporting either red stickers that read ''Support Intro 368'' or black buttons that spelled out ''IBC.'' And among council members, at least, it was hard to tell which proposal was the early favorite, given the general, fact-finding nature of most of their questions.
 Since the stakes for the future design of the city are considerable and the interests of those on either side are strong, there were several contentious moments. At one point, Councilman Robert Jackson, the main sponsor of the National Fire Protection Association code, hinted that the Bloomberg administration had long ago selected the International Building Code and failed to study the other options fully. 
 ''You've heard of the word 'setup,' haven't you?'' Mr. Jackson said.
 The onlookers roared with approval. They roared so boisterously, in fact, that the committee's chairwoman, Madeline Provenzano, who is also the chief sponsor of Introduction 478, used a mild expletive and warned that she would kick everyone out of the chambers, if necessary, in order to proceed.
 ''Take it outside,'' she said.
 If nothing else, most parties agree that the current code is cumbersome, inefficient and daunting. They agree, as well, that whatever code is adopted will alter New York's interior workings in important and sometimes life-or-death ways, affecting everything from fire sprinklers in high-rises to plastic pipes in private homes. 
 Plans for the new codes were hammered out over the last two years by 13 committees appointed by the Bloomberg administration and including engineers, safety experts and real estate developers, among others.
 In her testimony, Patricia J. Lancaster, the city's buildings commissioner, said the International Building Code was superior to the fire protection code ''in every way.'' Most important, perhaps, the International Building Code is used in 44 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, she said, while the National Fire Protection Association code is used only in Pasadena, Tex., and Pittsfield, Me.
 Her support was echoed by Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, who said a clearer and simpler building code would shave costs and make it easier to fulfill Mr. Bloomberg's plan to build and preserve 65,000 units for low- and moderate-income families by 2008. 
 Those assessments were challenged by people such as Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association; Bertha Lewis, executive director of Acorn in New York, an advocacy group for low-income families; and James M. Shannon, president of the National Fire Protection Association.
 Those speakers and others said the mayor's approach was flawed and limited because it relied too much on developers and ignored the voices of the working class. In fact, some said their complaints were rooted not in any major economic or safety differences in the codes, but rather in the approach to the process, with the National Fire Protection Association being far more inclusive.
 ''It's irrelevant how they differ; it's not about the content,'' said James Hart, a spokesman for Plumbers Local 1 and Steamfitters Local 638 in New York, in an interview with reporters. ''This is David against Goliath. This is really the big institutions of New York City versus the working class. All we want is to be heard, and have our opinions represented.''

HEADLINE: Consumers Less Confident; Output Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in November to the lowest level in eight months as higher energy prices reduced optimism, especially among lower-income Americans, the Conference Board said yesterday. 
 The group's confidence index dropped to 90.5 from 92.9 in October. The decrease may signal that consumer purchases -- which, the Commerce Department said yesterday, helped the gross domestic product increase in the third quarter at a faster-than-expected 3.9 percent annual pace -- are now poised to slow. 
 The report on output was a revision of the 3.7 percent third-quarter pace initially estimated, as consumer spending rose 5.1 percent. 
 But public confidence was uneven. ''This Christmas season,'' said Delos Smith, a Conference Board economist, ''that's all you're hearing, that people who earn below $35,000 and the stores that serve them are hurting, Wal-Mart being the prime example.'' The more than 50 percent rise in oil prices this year, he said, ''really hurts those with lower incomes.'' 
 Confidence fell among those who earn less than $35,000 a year, with that index falling in November to 81.7 from 95.2. The drop was even more pronounced for those making less than $15,000. Sentiment rose among consumers who make more than $35,000, and was highest for those above $50,000, with that index up to 109.4 from 108.2 in October. 
 The confidence gauge had been forecast to rise to 96 in a Bloomberg News survey of 5,000 households. Estimates ranged from 93.5 to 100. 
 A separate report yesterday from the National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago showed that business in the area grew at a slower pace in November. The gauge fell to 65.2 from 68.5. Readings higher than 50 indicate growth. 
 ''The economy still is doing reasonably well,'' said Ron Marshall, chief executive at the Nash Finch Company, which distributes food to stores and military bases, ''and we have seen some recovery in employment, but there's a lot of concern right now.'' Consumers, he said, had ''nothing left to borrow, and whatever discretionary income they have left is being absorbed by higher fuel costs.'' 
 Optimism about the economy over the next six months declined, and plans to buy new cars, homes and appliances slumped. 
 Americans said they would spend less. The percentage of people who said they would buy a car in the next six months fell to 4.2 percent from 7.6 percent in October. Those saying they would buy a home fell to 2.4 percent from 3.6 percent, and the percentage planning to buy a major appliance dropped to 24.2 percent from 27.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Co-op Fire Kills Couple on Upper East Side

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A smoky fire swept through a high-rise apartment on the Upper East Side early yesterday, killing a couple whose children had chided them for mislaying lighted cigarettes and whose neighbors had urged them not to smoke in their home.
 The fire began and ended in a 19th-floor apartment at 60 East End Avenue, a 42-story co-op building with a half-moon driveway in front. Investigators at the scene said the wife might have fallen asleep while smoking in bed. The Fire Department, however, did not officially identify a cause and said the investigation was continuing. 
 The wife, Angela Schiller, 66, a former film and television actress under the name An Tsan Hu, died at the scene, investigators said. Ms. Schiller's husband, Lloyd Schiller, 86, a retired printing salesman, was taken from the building in critical condition. Both were pronounced dead at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, the Fire Department said.
 Residents, including a family on the same floor as the Schillers, said they would immediately press for a co-op resolution banning smoking in the building, which is near 82nd Street, about six blocks from Gracie Mansion. In 2002, the co-op board at 180 West End Avenue, near Lincoln Center, adopted a rule banning new buyers from smoking in their apartments. Real estate experts said at the time that the ban was the first for a co-op building in the nation. 
 The fire in Apartment 19A was reported at 4:46 a.m. yesterday. The building has more than 120 apartments and is made of concrete. There are smoke detectors in the apartments and in the hallways, the building management said.
 More than 100 firefighters and 25 fire engines and other rescue vehicles rushed to the area. One neighbor, Vincent DonFrancesco, who lives near York Avenue and 81st Street, recalled being shaken out of bed by the rumble and din of the fire engines.
 He rushed to the window of the apartment he shares with his wife, Linda. ''At first I thought maybe a car was on fire,'' said Mr. DonFrancesco, 49, an unemployed chauffeur. ''And then I heard a lot of breaking of glass.'' Still in his pajamas, he pulled on jogging pants and a jacket and rushed to the street in the morning darkness.
 Mr. DonFrancesco said he was astonished by what he saw only a block away: tongues of fire coming out of what he later found out was the 19th floor of 60 East End Avenue, glass and debris flying out as firefighters inside axed the windows open, and then water from fire hoses cascading out of the broken windows.
 Overhead, Mr. DonFrancesco said, he saw a helicopter with a searchlight and heard shouts from what he took to be firefighters on the roof of the high-rise getting into position in case the fire spread. Dozens of residents of 60 East End Avenue and nearby high-rise apartments were pressing their faces against their windows watching the fire being fought, Mr. DonFrancesco said.
 The fire was under control by 5:36 a.m., the Fire Department said. Mr. DonFrancesco stayed on the street, talking to firefighters.
 ''When they got there, the gentleman was, like, dazed right by the door,'' Mr. DonFrancesco said, referring to Mr. Schiller. ''But the firemen said that by the time they got inside, the lady was already dead.''
 Stephen Miller, 56, a restaurant owner, lives with his wife and family on the same floor as the Schillers. He said he did not know the Schillers well, even though there are only three apartments to a floor. ''I only knew them to the extent that I asked them to smoke less -- my only contact, I'm afraid,'' Mr. Miller said.
 But Mr. Miller, who has lived in the building for four years, had become increasingly adamant about the couple's smoking. The Schillers appeared polite but indifferent to his pleas, he said.
 The deaths will inspire building residents who oppose smoking to take action, Mr. Miller said. ''Many of us will be introducing a resolution to have it be a non-smoking building,'' he said. ''It's long overdue in all of these high-rise buildings.'' 
 Sydney Pfeifer, 62, is one of Lloyd Schiller's four children. A retired schoolteacher in Norwich, Conn., Ms. Pfeifer visited her father, a pipe smoker, every week. He divorced Ms. Pfeifer's mother, Barbara, more than 40 years ago, she said. Angela, Mr. Schiller's wife, was a heavy cigarette smoker, Ms. Pfeifer said.
 There was evidence of carelessness with cigarettes everywhere in the apartment, Ms. Pfeifer said, mentioning holes in the carpet where burning ash had dropped.
 She recalled expressing her worries to her father about the smoking, especially Angela's. But he would reply, ''People do what they want to do,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Red Cross President Plans Visit to Washington on Question of Detainees' Treatment

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that the organization's president, M. Jakob Kellenberger, was hoping to visit Washington soon to press senior Bush administration officials about the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 Committee officials in Washington, and at the organization's headquarters in Geneva, said that Mr. Kellenberger had made visits to Washington before. But it was clear that any coming visit would be used to raise at a high level the issues contained in a Red Cross report charging that the American military had used psychological and physical coercion on detainees that was ''tantamount to torture.'' 
 A report in The New York Times on Tuesday said the International Committee of the Red Cross made the charges after a visit in June by a team of relief workers that included medical personnel. A memorandum based on the report and obtained by The Times said the Red Cross believed that doctors and other medical personnel at Guantanamo were assisting in the planning of interrogations in what was described as ''a flagrant violation of medical ethics.''
 The Pentagon on Tuesday denied that its forces at Guantanamo engaged in torture and said the detainees there, who now number about 550, were treated humanely.
 Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a news conference in Indianapolis on Tuesday, dismissed accusations that the tactics amounted to torture.
 ''We certainly don't think it's torture,'' General Myers said before delivering a speech to the Economic Club of Indianapolis, according to the Web site of The Indianapolis Star. ''Let's not forget the kind of people we have down there,'' he said. ''These are the people that don't know any moral values.''
 The State Department appeared to take a more conciliatory approach to the Red Cross report.
 ''We take their reports very, very seriously,'' Richard Boucher, the department spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday. Mr. Boucher declined to comment on the specifics raised in the report but said, ''We value very much things they raise for us in their reports.''
 The report of the June visit was the first in which the Red Cross, which has been visiting Guantanamo since January 2002, used the word ''torture'' directly to describe its views of the detention and interrogation system there.
 Under its agreement with the United States government, the Red Cross is allowed access to the detention facilities at Guantanamo and may interview each detainee. In exchange, the Red Cross agrees that it will not make public any criticisms but will relay them only to the government.
 The Red Cross operates in Guantanamo from a double-wide trailer just outside the barbed wire and fence of Camp Delta, the main detention facility there. The inspection teams are composed of several people. They usually remain there for four or five weeks at a time, then take a month off, committee officials have said. Detainees are interviewed with a translator provided by the Red Cross away from any military personnel.
 The medical personnel on the Red Cross inspection team also view the medical facilities and interview military medical personnel. The report said that sometimes ''outside doctors'' are brought in to help interrogators plan their strategy of interviewing detainees.
 It also said that psychologists and psychological workers in a group called the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, known as Biscuit, were advising interrogators.

HEADLINE: Under Ridge, Color Alerts and Mixed Security Reviews

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
As the man who oversaw the creation of the largest federal agency in a half-century, Tom Ridge exits the Department of Homeland Security with a record of progress in plugging some gaping holes in areas like aviation security and biodefense. But he also leaves his successor with daunting challenges in other areas that critics say the department has largely ignored.
 Many experts believe the nation's chemical and nuclear plants, ports and even parts of the fortified aviation sector remain vulnerable to attack. And a number of internal and outside audits have questioned whether the mammoth operation that Mr. Ridge designed has the controls in place to do the job. 
 His successor will also face growing tensions about whether taxpayers or private interests should pay the lion's share of the often-staggering costs of securing the country -- an issue that bedeviled Mr. Ridge during his tenure. 
 ''There's a shared fiscal responsibility,'' Mr. Ridge said in a recent interview, echoing a plea that he has made to many industry groups. ''And that means we can't look to secure all these facilities out of the federal taxpayer's pocket.''
 Mr. Ridge was best known as the public face for the nation's color-coded terror alerts, warning for months that another terrorist attack was likely. The government raised the alert to ''high,'' or orange, status six times on his watch, even as domestic security officials sometimes squabbled with the Justice Department about what they felt were overly dire warnings from Attorney General John Ashcroft.
 His role in issuing the warnings raised the profile of Mr. Ridge -- a confidant of President Bush and former Pennsylvania governor -- but it also brought skepticism and ridicule at times. When his department suggested in 2003 that Americans buy emergency items like duct tape to guard against chemical attacks, Mr. Ridge became fodder for late-night comedians and was roasted at Washington's annual Gridiron dinner by a performer who wrapped himself in plastic before an audience that included Mr. Bush. 
 Mr. Ridge ''seemed more interested in grabbing headlines than in developing, implementing and communicating to the American public an effective policy for preventing terrorist acts at home,'' said Alon Ben-Meir, a professor of terrorism studies at New York University and Middle East director for the World Policy Institute at the New School.
 But behind the criticism and jokes lay widespread recognition that Mr. Ridge had one of the most difficult jobs in Washington -- trying to assemble 22 separate agencies into one -- and potentially the most unforgiving one. Republicans and Democrats alike have praised his diligence and calm leadership.
 Mr. Ridge ''had the difficult task of overseeing the largest government reorganization since World War II,'' Representative Jim Turner of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said Tuesday, ''and his efforts will have a lasting and positive impact on the security of our nation.'' 
 Yet concerns remain among Congressional leaders and security experts that the 180,000-employee agency is still too fragmented and has struggled to become a clearinghouse for terrorism intelligence. 
 Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has poured tens of billions of dollars into domestic security. Besides installing thousands of explosive-detection machines in airports, much of the federal spending has gone for building defenses against bioterrorism, expanding border patrols and upgrading local emergency response teams.
 In running the department, Mr. Ridge also strongly espoused Mr. Bush's view that the best way to protect the nation was to root out terrorists overseas. 
 The department was created last year with high hopes for producing quicker and clearer assessments of the latest terrorism threats, but its investigators and analysts have been dogged by turf battles with counterparts at agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 Even some Republicans in Congress fear that with the reorganization of the intelligence community, the department could end up mainly disseminating intelligence to state and local officials rather than being a major analysis center.
 The department's agencies include immigration and the Coast Guard, and it also is intended to secure the nation's critical infrastructure from attack. 
 Mr. Ridge often pointed out that the department has no authority to order businesses to do anything. And in recent months, he increasingly urged private industry to cover more of the security costs.
 But critics say the government has been inconsistent -- and even unfair -- in requiring large-scale security upgrades at seaports, while refusing to put similar mandates on the powerful oil and chemical industries. Some say that resolving this debate will be one of the most urgent tasks facing Mr. Ridge's successor.
 ''Our adversaries have figured out, at least in the form of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, that by going after those critical infrastructures that underpin our way of life, they in fact can chip away at our power,'' said Stephen Flynn, who has been the project director for a bipartisan task force on domestic security. ''It's our weakness.'' 
 Only 5 percent of the 9 million cargo containers that pass through the nation's ports each year are physically inspected. Mr. Ridge has acknowledged that the threat of a nuclear ''dirty bomb'' inside a container could shut down ports and disrupt the global economy.
 The Coast Guard estimates that a 2002 law requiring security improvements will cost $7.4 billion in the next 10 years, but the government has offered only $565 million in grants to ports and maritime companies.
 ''I don't know of a single nonprofit that uses one of these facilities,'' Mr. Ridge said recently. Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, countered, ''I think it's unrealistic to say we could do it without federal help.''
 Counterterrorism officials also warn that terrorists could kill tens of thousands of people by blowing up a chemical plant and releasing toxic gas.
 When he was still at the White House, Mr. Ridge joined with the Environmental Protection Agency in considering new safety rules in 2002. But after the oil and chemical industries met with Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, and other senior aides, the White House quietly blocked those efforts, current and former officials say.
 Since then, Mr. Ridge and his aides have worked with the chemical industry to improve security through voluntary measures. Administration officials say this produced improvements more quickly than if they had battled in Congress or the courts about new regulations. But critics say that without strict oversight, many of the nation's 15,000 chemical, oil refineries and sewage treatment plants are not doing as much as they can to seal out terrorists.
 ''I find it inconceivable that we're not checking on a regular basis what actions these plants are taking on security,'' said Senator Jon Corzine, a Democrat from New Jersey who plans to push for legislation once Congress reconvenes in January. 
 Mr. Ridge said recently that the department's most striking advances have been made in air security, making it much more difficult for terrorists ''to turn an airplane into a missile.'' It also is spending billions of dollars to enhance bioterror defenses.
 He and others say there are still areas of vulnerability, including potential targets like trains, private aircraft and trucks that haul hazardous materials.
 Airport officials also are pushing for more federal help. They want to replace baggage screening machines with more efficient systems, at a total cost of $5 billion, said Todd Hauptli, a lobbyist for the American Association of Airports Executives.
 Others, like Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, want to require airlines to screen all cargo carried on passenger planes, only a tiny fraction of which is now tested for explosives.
 Mr. Markey's bill failed this year amid pressure from the White House and the struggling airline industry, which argued it would be too costly because most screening machines cannot handle the bulky packages.
 Mr. Markey said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Ridge had ''an extremely tough job.'' Ticking off the concerns over air cargo, ports and chemical plants, he added that ''much remains to be done.''

HEADLINE: A Subway Seat Is No Footstool, Transit Officials Say

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Janon Fisher contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Darwinian world of the New York City subways is not known for its gentility. Riders charge into cars before passengers have a chance to exit. An empty seat can set off a sharp-elbowed scramble. Grown men have been known to refuse to give up seats for pregnant women. 
 Yet a code of conduct has existed for decades, with occasional revisions. It bans graffiti, drinking alcohol, smoking, littering and panhandling. Listening to a loud radio is forbidden. So is lying down or taking up more than one seat. 
 To this list of rules governing behavior in the subways, transit officials want to add this: Do not place your feet on the seats. 
 The prohibition is included in a set of regulations, published last week in the weekly New York State Register, that would update the laws of subway and bus use for the first time since 1994. While an average subway user may never have heard of the Rules of Conduct -- part of Title 21 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York -- they are enforceable by police officers and transit workers, and violations can result in a summons and a fine, or prosecution and a jail sentence.
 The rule banning the use of seats as footrests, which would also apply on buses and subway platform benches, seemed to strike a chord among subway riders fed up with seat-hogging.
 ''These seats are not ottomans,'' said Joseph Walls Jr., 30, a mailroom worker from Brooklyn. 
 Stephanie Peterkin, 39, a bartender from Staten Island, said it was common sense that putting one's feet on the seats is rude. ''I'm a grown woman, but my mother would still smack me for that,'' she said. 
 The proposed regulations, totaling 3,900 words, traverse the fuzzy boundaries between public and private space, extending rules of etiquette into the realm of mass transit and specifying proper conduct with a degree of precision that may surprise many passengers. 
 Riding a bicycle in the subway has long been prohibited. Now, straddling a bicycle while the subway or bus is moving will be banned too. The use of skateboards, skates and scooters will also be proscribed.
 Passengers, who are already not allowed to ride between subway cars, will be prohibited from moving directly from one car to the next, except when directed by transit or police officials. 
 Not all of the proposed rules would add restrictions. Some would clear up vaguely worded guidelines that may have long mystified the law-abiding rider. For example, although riders may not take up more than one seat, the new rules state that they can indeed place a package or bag on an empty seat, if no one else wants it.
 And while unauthorized commercial activity is banned, the new rules make it clear that registering voters is permitted. (Think of your civic duty the next time the bus is stalled.) 
 The president of New York City Transit, Lawrence G. Reuter, said in May that new rules were needed ''to enhance safety and security.'' A spokesman for the agency, Paul J. Fleuranges, would not elaborate on that statement yesterday. ''We've said our piece about the rules changes,'' Mr. Fleuranges said.
 An assortment of passengers interviewed on five subway lines said the new rules came as a surprise. Some spoke passionately about their need to rest their weary feet.
 ''That's ridiculous,'' Monica Hunken, 23, said of the proposed ban on using seats as footrests.
 ''I work until 4:30 in the morning, and I put my feet on the seats because I'm tired and there's no one else there,'' said Ms. Hunken, who works at a bar in the East Village. ''It's not harming anyone.''
 Thomas Perone, 23, an unemployed chef from Brooklyn, rested his size 11 1/2 feet on the end of a row of empty seats as he napped on his way to Manhattan. ''I put my feet up all the time,'' he said after awakening. ''As long as nobody needs the seat, it's no big deal.''
 James Santana, 19, who planted his Timberland boots on a seat on a Q train near Times Square, looked annoyed when he was asked about his posture. ''I'm just tired,'' he said, eyelids drooping. ''I work the overnight shift. Sometimes people just like to punch out.'' 
 Penalties for violating the Rules of Conduct range from a fine of up to $100 to a jail term of up to 10 days, but some riders questioned the transit agency's ability to monitor passenger behavior. ''There are thousands of rules, but nobody to enforce them anymore,'' said Joe Lieb, 80, a retired transit police officer from Brooklyn.
 In addition to codifying subway etiquette, the rules would prohibit the jumping of turnstiles, even by a passenger with a valid fare card who leaps a gate because it has malfunctioned. '''Turnstile jumping' and related conduct, whatever the stated rationale, create an environment of disorder,'' the proposed rules state.
 Rider advocates have focused their ire on a proposed ban on photography, filming and videotaping on subways, buses and Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. ''There are important values in having photographers document life and conditions on the subways and buses,'' said Neysa C. Pranger, an organizer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group. Journalists with Police Department credentials and people with written authorization from the transit agency would be exempt from the ban.
 Members of the public have until Jan. 8 to submit comments on the proposed rules, listed on the Web at www.mta.info/nyct/rules/nyct.htm. The rules will then be subject to a final vote by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent agency of New York City Transit.

HEADLINE: Report Urges Big Changes For the U.N.

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The United Nations on Tuesday proposed the most sweeping changes in its history, recommending the overhaul of its top decision-making group, the Security Council, and holding out the possibility that it could grant legitimacy to pre-emptive military strikes.
 The changes were outlined in a much-anticipated report commissioned by Secretary General Kofi Annan a year ago after bruising division over the Iraq war left the United Nations feeling ill-equipped to meet modern challenges represented by terrorism, failed states, nuclear proliferation, poverty and violence. 
 In its most attention-getting recommendation, the panel called for an expansion of the Security Council to 24 members from 15. But the panel was unable to agree on one proposal and ended up suggesting two options. Both are intended to broaden the membership of the Council to reflect the world of today rather than the one that existed at the United Nations' beginning nearly 60 years ago. 
 The Council now has 5 veto-bearing permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- and 10 members elected to two-year terms.
 One alternative would add 6 new permanent members -- the likely candidates are Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Egypt and either Nigeria or South Africa -- as well as 3 new two-year term members.
 The other would create a new tier of 8 semipermanent members chosen for renewable four-year terms and one additional two-year term seat to the existing 10.
 The right to cast vetoes, a power coveted by the nations seeking permanent status and one they are likely to press for, would continue to be limited to the 5 original permanent members.
 The panel's 101 recommendations will inform a report in March from Mr. Annan, who is expected to refine them to 8 to 10 principal subjects to be taken up at a summit meeting of heads of state at the United Nations in September before the opening of the General Assembly.
 Many of the recommendations in the 95-page report can be put into effect by the secretary general or the parts of the United Nations that would be affected. The new makeup of the Security Council, however, would require an amendment to the United Nations Charter, which requires approval in the General Assembly by two-thirds of the 191 member states, including all 5 permanent members, and ratification by the legislatures of their governments. 
 While the report created new offices and positions, it cast a critical eye on the stultifying bureaucracy of the United Nations, calling for a one-time voluntary retirement buyout for many staff members.
 Asked what led to the proposal, a senior participant who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity said, ''The sense that looking around the Secretariat, there is a lot of, frankly, dead wood, and that secondly there is a whole new generation within the Secretariat who are younger -- in their 30's and 40's -- who have an immense amount of field experience for the last 15 years. They're finding themselves feeling very frustrated and unable to advance.''
 The panel was very critical of the Human Rights Commission, a body that has often brought the United Nations into disrepute by incorporating some of the worst rights violators like Cuba, Libya and Sudan into its membership. The commission, which is based in Geneva, ''suffers from a credibility deficit that casts doubt on the overall reputation of the United Nations,'' the report said. The official who briefed reporters added that too often the chief motivation for countries to join was to deflect attention from deplorable rights conditions at home.
 Addressing the critical issue of the legitimacy of the use of force, a source of crippling tension at the United Nations last year when the United States was seeking Security Council authorization to go to war in Iraq, the panel said it found no reason to amend the charter's Article 51, which restricts the use of force to countries that have been attacked. The report said the language did not constitute, as some have asserted, a demand that nations wait to be attacked. And it said many countries had exercised the right to attack when they had felt threatened.
 But it acknowledged that a new problem had risen because of the nature of terrorist attacks ''where the threat is not imminent but still claimed to be real: for example, the acquisition, with allegedly hostile intent, of nuclear weapons-making capability.''
 It said that if the arguments for ''anticipatory self-defense'' in such cases were good ones, they should be put to the Security Council, which would have the power to authorize military action under guidelines including the seriousness of the threat, the proportionality of the response, the exhaustion of all alternatives and the balance of consequences.
 Apparently in anticipation of objections from Washington over that requirement, the report said, ''For those impatient with such a response, the answer must be that, in a world full of perceived potential threats, the risk to the global order and the norm of nonintervention on which it continues to be based is simply too great for the legality of unilateral preventive action, as distinct from collectively endorsed action, to be accepted. Allowing one to so act is to allow all.''
 Though the bitter dispute over whether to go to war in Iraq was a principal reason for the institutional crisis at the United Nations that persuaded Mr. Annan to appoint the panel, the official said members did not discuss it. He declined to speculate whether the recommended changes would have forestalled the diplomatic fallout over Iraq. ''This was a forward-looking panel,'' he said.
 The official said that at the outset, some of the panel members had been in the habit of faulting the United States for exaggerating the threat of terror and seeking what they called ''perfect security.'' But he said the members had come to a sharp new appreciation of the menace of nuclear and chemical agents and how easily they could be infiltrated into Western societies.
 The report addressed six specific and interconnected threats to international peace -- ''interstate conflict, civil war, economic and social threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and organized international crime.''
 Addressing a long sought codification of terrorism that would not allow people to class it as an acceptable act of national resistance, the panel suggested defining it as any action ''that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or noncombatants, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act.''
 In a sentence that may have been directed at members of the United Nations who habitually condemn violence by Israel while making no mention of attacks on Israel, the report said, ''There is nothing in the fact of occupation that justifies the targeting and killing of civilians.''
 One area where the report criticized the United Nations was the ineffectiveness of existing conventions to curb the spread of nuclear material, and the report predicted that the ''erosion of the nuclear regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.'' Noting that at least 40 nations have the capacity to build nuclear weapons on short notice, it said that a way had to be found to make the nonproliferation treaty an effective constraint. 
 The panel also urged a more aggressive approach to interventions when states fail in their primary responsibility to protect their own citizens. ''There is a collective international responsibility to protect, exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing or serious violations of international humanitarian law which sovereign governments have proved powerless or unwilling to prevent,'' the report said.
 The panel was headed by Anand Panyarachun, a former prime minister of Thailand, and included Brent Scowcroft, the United States national security adviser under the first President Bush; Yevgeny Primakov, a former prime minister of Russia; Qian Qichen, a former foreign minister of China; and Amr Moussa of Egypt, secretary general of the League of Arab States.

HEADLINE: Global Forecasts for 2005 Growth Are Reduced

BYLINE: By BRIAN CHILDS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Prospects for the global economy next year are growing dimmer as high oil prices hurt consumption and the unchecked rise in the United States trade deficit depresses the dollar, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday.
 The O.E.C.D., a Paris-based economic forum for 30 leading industrial nations, cut its forecast for growth in the United States in 2005 to a 3.3 percent annual rate from the 3.7 percent rate that it predicted six months ago. 
 The group's report was even more downbeat on prospects for America's main trading partners. It warned that growth in the 12 nations that use the euro could slip to a mere 1.9 percent rate, more than half a percentage point below the 2.5 percent rate expected in May. Japan, despite a ''spectacular comeback'' this year, may experience growth of no more than 2.1 percent in 2005, the O.E.C.D. said. 
 Despite a year of record growth in world trade, Continental Europe is merely ''plodding along,'' said the O.E.C.D.'s chief economist, Jean-Philippe Cotis. With internal demand weak and economic activity overly reliant on exports, little improvement is likely in Europe, and Germany in particular, without more stability in oil prices and the dollar, Mr. Cotis said. The dollar's decline hurts the profit of many companies when they convert export earnings.
 Soaring consumption in developing countries like China and India, meanwhile, is expected to underpin demand.
 ''Future oil prices will crucially depend on further progress in energy conservation in emerging economies as well as the United States,'' the report said.
 If oil price stability seems unlikely, dollar stability looks even less so.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told Europeans this month that they could expect no help from Washington in slowing the rise of the euro, which hit a record of $1.3335 on Tuesday before pulling back to around $1.3280. The O.E.C.D. report made clear the agency saw no early prospect of a narrowing in the United States trade deficit, which economists say is a leading cause of the dollar's slide.
 The O.E.C.D. estimated that the United States current-account deficit, the broadest measure of trade, would rise steadily over the next two years to 6.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2006, from an already large 5.7 percent this year.

In early November ''No. 6 (Yellow, White, Blue Over Yellow on Gray)'' by Mark Rothko was auctioned at Sotheby's for a record $17.4 million, almost 50 percent above the top end of Sotheby's estimate. ''The Ninth Hour,'' a room with a lifesize wax pope felled by a meteorite, by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, fetched $3 million at auction at Phillips, de Pury & Company, also exceeding its top estimate by half. 
 Not only are modern and contemporary artists being treated like pop stars, but earlier American masters are also soaring like late-1990's Internet stocks. Today Sotheby's is putting ''Group With Parasols (a Siesta),'' by John Singer Sargent on the block with a top estimate of $12 million. This would be a record for the artist at auction. 
 ''We have more collectors today willing to spend more money than we've ever had,'' said Dara Mitchell, a director of the American paintings department for Sotheby's. 
 These rates of return are now attracting the interest of financial investors. In Britain, there is the Fine Art Management Fund, which has been in the market since March. A former co-owner of Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg established Artvest, an art investment company, in the spring. The New York-based Fernwood Art Investments plans to establish several funds next year to buy and manage art portfolios. And virtually every bank on Wall Street has an art advisory group to assist rich clients. 
 The renewed appetite for art as an investment is rekindling interest in developing systematic ways to assess the value of art and is drawing attention to a small number of scholars who have been applying economics to this new asset class. 
 Two pioneers are Michael Moses and Jianping Mei of the Stern School of Business at New York University. Mr. Moses and Mr. Mei developed an index of repeat sales of the same work of art, compiled from the prices of thousands of artworks sold at auction since 1875. They found that the compound annual rate of return of art from 1953 to 2003 was 12.1 percent, slightly higher than the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index. 
 Mr. Mei and Mr. Moses also found that art prices have a low correlation with stocks, so art can enhance the performance of a portfolio of equities. Perhaps most interestingly, they found that the art-dealer maxim that masterpieces are the best investment is wrong. According to their index, masterpieces -- usually meaning the most expensive works of art -- tend, instead, to appreciate less, or depreciate more, than the art market as a whole. 
 Economic analysis has also exposed some other peculiar behavior. Two economists from Oxford University have found that presale estimates by auction houses have some systematic biases. In contemporary art, for some reason, the most recently executed artworks are overvalued. For Impressionist and modern art, physically wider paintings may be underestimated.
 David Galenson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, has been using the prices of artworks at auction to study patterns of creativity. His findings include useful insights into what makes art valuable. For instance, collectors might think again before paying big prices for late pieces by Pop artists. Their most expensive and critically acclaimed work, according to Mr. Galenson's analysis, was done at the beginning of their careers, when the breakthrough idea that took them to the top -- the mechanical reproduction of serial images, for example, or blowing up cartoon frames -- was still fresh. The Abstract Expressionists, on the other hand, might be better bought old -- once they have experimented enough.
 Mr. Galenson splits creativity into two camps, inductive and deductive. Inductive-minded artists -- say, Claude Monet or Jackson Pollock -- will experiment endlessly, with no precise endpoint in mind. Deductive conceptualists, on the other end, rely on the great revolutionary idea that springs forth fully formed -- Marcel Duchamp's 1917 urinal, ''Fountain,'' for instance, or ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' which Picasso painted when he was 26. ''With conceptual artists you can usually express their real contribution in a sentence,'' said Mr. Galenson. Mr. Galenson also picks out a broad shift in the market's taste over the last half century, as the appetite for innovation favored the quicker, deductive approach and thus tended to reward younger artists. In particular, he found that artists born before 1920 tended to do their most important work after the age of 40, while those born after 1920 peaked before hitting 40. 
 ''A persistently high demand for artistic innovation has produced a regime in which conceptual approaches have predominated,'' Mr. Galenson wrote in a paper. ''The art world has consequently been flooded by a series of new ideas, usually embodied in individual works, generally made by young artists who have failed to make more than one significant contribution in their careers.''
 Todd Millay, vice president in charge of strategy and product development at Fernwood Art Investments thinks this economic approach is helpful. ''It's taking the tools and techniques which have been useful to understand other sectors of the economy and applying them to the art market,'' he said. Mr. Millay is developing quantitative techniques that Fernwood will use to build its art portfolio. Mr. Moses said he and Mr. Mei are also putting together a pricing model based on variables including the number of times an artwork work has been exhibited, written about or sold. And their analysis can provide some benchmarks.
 For instance, the Sargent up for auction today will be sold, by Sotheby's estimate of $9 to $12 million, at a price somewhere between 375 and 500 times what it fetched in 1962. But Mr. Mei's and Mr. Moses's index of American art has appreciated only 136-fold in that period. ''If I'm looking for a financial return, maybe these prices are a bit high,'' Mr. Moses said. ''If you tend to buy above the index-inflated purchase price, your future returns are going to suffer.''
 Ms. Mitchell of Sotheby's stands by the value of the Sargent nonetheless. ''Paintings of uniquely superior quality appreciate to a greater degree,'' she said. ''Great paintings have a different curve.'' She argued that auctioneers have a pretty good handle on what an artwork is worth, benchmarking against other recent works by the artist sold and the overall state of the art market.
 Auction houses have a big advantage: they already know the fairly small number of people who can spend a few million dollars on a painting. That means they have a pretty good idea of who is likely to bid how much for the next big artwork to be put on the block. ''We have relationships with collectors seeking works from certain artists,'' said Matthew Carey-Williams, senior specialist for contemporary art at Sotheby's. ''The first thing we say when we look at a piece of art is 'who is going to buy this?'''
 Indeed, many art dealers tend to mistrust these economic approaches to art. Andre Emmerich, the New York collector and dealer, argues that there is no systematic method that can measure the shifting tastes that ultimately dictate the value of art in the market. ''I'm not very good at these abstract theories at all,'' Mr. Emmerich said. ''Art has much more to do with gut than with anything else.''
 Even some of the proponents of a more analytical approach to art say it is uncertain how much these ideas will help investors beat the art market. Merely measuring the market is tough, because there are so few public transactions to base any analysis on. And many deals take place privately between dealers and collectors, so their details are frequently not known.
 Mr. Galenson argues that the art auction market is pretty efficient. Indeed, prices tend to reflect what art critics like and dislike. Orley Ashenfelter, a professor of economics at Princeton who studies art auctions, said all this analysis wass interesting, yet ''I don't know how you can make money from this.''

HEADLINE: In Falluja's Ruins, Big Plans and a Risk of Chaos

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: FALLUJA, Iraq, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Standing in the rubble outside an empty medical clinic here, Dr. Basam Mohamed, dressed in a blue blazer and work boots, gazed out at the ruins of his native city. He had just heard a group of American civil affairs officers explain their plans to rebuild the clinic and install a huge water tank behind it until the water pipes -- smashed by bombs -- could be fixed. 
 But Dr. Mohamed, a Health Ministry official in the Iraqi interim government, had other worries. His parents are among the residents who fled Falluja just before the American military offensive here earlier this month, he said. They are eager to return but have no idea how badly the fighting damaged the city.
 ''They will feel hard toward the Americans,'' Dr. Mohamed said with a wince, as his American guides led him off to look at another ruined clinic. 
 As military officials here prepare to start letting the first residents return to Falluja, possibly as soon as mid-December, they face an unusual challenge: how to win back the confidence of the people whose city they have just destroyed. Their task will be made harder by the need to deter returning insurgents, who will try to sabotage the reconstruction with attacks, commanders say. 
 American officials say they cannot afford to let this former insurgent bastion become a microcosm of the broader struggle in Iraq -- a rapid military victory followed by a lapse into violence and chaos.
 Yet even some American officers here are skeptical about their ability to bring back safely more than a small number of residents in time for the national and provincial elections in January -- a central goal of the offensive. Fighting goes on in the city's southern neighborhoods, where small groups of guerrillas are still holding out. American troops have found an unexpectedly large number of weapons storehouses, commanders say, and the need to dispose of them safely has delayed rebuilding efforts in those areas. 
 The full extent of the damage inflicted by American bombs, tanks and artillery is only now becoming apparent. The number of buildings destroyed in the fighting is far higher than 200, the figure released last week by the Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, engineers and commanders say. The city's power lines are so badly damaged that in most of the city, they will have to be ripped out and rebuilt from scratch -- a project that will take six months to a year, American engineers say. Damage to the city's water and sewer pipes, already badly corroded before the invasion, is milder but will also take months to repair.
 The coordination of all this work will be hard enough, with the Americans saying they will pour in money and expertise but will cede major decisions to the Iraqi interim government. American planners also say it is essential that much of the actual rebuilding work be given to Iraqi contractors but acknowledge that those contractors will be subject to intimidation and that qualified Iraqi engineers may be hard to find. Just last week, as water from broken pipes created chest-deep floods in Falluja's streets, American officers had trouble persuading any of the Iraqi engineers who knew where the valves were located to venture into the city and help shut them off. 
 The role of the city's roughly 250,000 residents, now mostly scattered in other towns throughout the region, may be the most crucial and unpredictable part. It is still far from clear how the military will communicate its neat plan to repopulate the city sector by sector, or how the returnees will react once they arrive. Falluja, where resistance to the American occupation ran high, has a long history as a rebellious city.
 American officials say they fully understand the risks, and have been planning for them since last spring. Already, American civil affairs teams have begun making condolence payments to residents who were injured or had their houses destroyed in the attack, up to a maximum of $2,500 per person. The interim Iraqi government has also promised $100 to each returning family.
 The American plan here involves a carefully phased renewal. The city will be opened to residents sequentially, starting in the north and moving southward as basic services are restored to 16 separate areas designated by American military planners, said Col. John R. Ballard, the commander of the Marine Fourth Civil Affairs Group, based in Washington. Generators will supply power, and water tanks placed along the city's main boulevards will provide water, at least for the moment. 
 To prevent looting, the head of every household will be asked to wear an identification badge, Colonel Ballard said, and American and Iraqi troops will be given special rules of engagement to deal with theft. No cars will be allowed in the city at first, to prevent car bombs. Instead, a bus system will provide free transportation. 
 Within two or three months, Marine officials say, bigger projects will be set in motion: a new $35 million wastewater treatment plant, four new school buildings, several new health clinics. Badly damaged homes will be bulldozed and rebuilt, or owners will be compensated. To help revive the city's economy, the Marines will ask all returning residents with relevant skills to take a job in the reconstruction projects. 
 In short, the Marines envision a huge effort of social and physical engineering, all intended to transform a bastion of militant anti-Americanism into a benevolent and functional metropolis. There are even plans to build new housing projects on the city's outskirts while the central areas are being rebuilt. 
 ''The best place to bring a model town into place is Falluja,'' Colonel Ballard said. But if similar rebuilding efforts in Najaf and elsewhere are any guide, the project under way here -- far more ambitious than anything yet tried in this country -- will be more expensive and time-consuming than its planners think. 
 Reconstruction projects undertaken in Najaf since the fighting there in August, for instance, have been plagued by corruption, overpayment and shoddy work, relief officials said. After an American corporation there began rebuilding a wastewater treatment plant, they found a lack of local people with the training to operate it, said Lt. Cmdr. Michael Woltz, a member of the team of Navy Seabees helping rebuild Falluja.
 In Falluja, too, there are questions about how many Iraqi engineers are available to help figure out the city's antiquated infrastructure. 
 ''Before the battle, Iraqi engineers were not willing to talk to us, and I have not been able to get a good list yet,'' said Lt. Col. Leonard J. DeFrancisi, a Marine civil affairs officer. ''I'm confident that when we put the call out we will find good people to help run the city.''
 All these plans, military officials say, are predicated on Iraqi security forces successfully keeping insurgents out and preventing violence. If they fail, as they did in April, the whole project could unravel.
 American and Iraqi forces will provide security for all the reconstruction projects, at least initially, Colonel Ballard said. They will also form a cordon around the city, screening anyone who enters and checking for weapons.
 While some Iraqi companies have already been taken on, none wanted their names disclosed because of security concerns. Officials would not comment on whether any American contractors had been hired. 
 So far, it is far from clear that the Americans can keep insurgents out of the city. Some appear to be living there now, relying on the Americans for emergency food and water during the day and attacking them by night, according to both American commanders and Iraqis living in the area. All of them are young men, some with suspicious wounds, and all have the same story: they stayed in the city to protect their family's property. Some even wear the distinctive black clothes and tennis shoes favored by the insurgents. 
 Nor is it clear that the city's residents will favor the Americans over their enemies. Last week, Hamid Humood, a 38-year-old cigarette seller who had stayed in the city during the battle, was one of those seeking American food and water at the Hadra mosque.
 ''They are all liars, the government and the Americans,'' Mr. Humood said. ''The mujahedeen didn't hurt us. They helped us.''
 Others are friendlier to the American presence. But most are waiting in small towns or rural areas outside the city, and they are growing impatient. Just east of Falluja, several hundred exiled residents are now living on the grounds of a cement plant. During a visit there on a day when the temperature was just above 40 degrees, many displaced residents were dressed in light summer clothing and complained that they had no blankets and had left their winter clothing in Falluja. Americans who brought them emergency food and water could only apologize and explain that they had no blankets.
 ''They need help,'' said Dr. Mohamed, the Health Ministry official whose own parents are waiting to return, speaking of Falluja's scattered residents. ''They are suffering. But when they return, they will suffer even more.''

HEADLINE: CITY SCHOOLS NEED $5.6 BILLION MORE, COURT PANEL SAYS

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
In a report that could transform New York City's public schools, a court-appointed panel has found that an additional $5.6 billion must be spent on the city's schoolchildren every year to provide the opportunity for a sound, basic education that they are guaranteed by the State Constitution. 
 Beyond that, the panel found that $9.2 billion worth of new classrooms, laboratories, libraries and other facilities were needed to relieve overcrowding, reduce class sizes and give the city's 1.1 million public school students adequate places to learn. 
 The report is a major turning point in a lawsuit that could reshape the way education is financed in the state, and is being watched closely by politicians and educators around the nation. Nearly every state has battled over school spending in court, but the case in New York is one of the country's biggest, both in terms of the money at stake and the number of children affected. 
 Justice Leland DeGrasse, the judge overseeing the case in State Supreme Court, appointed the panel this summer after lawmakers in Albany missed a one-year deadline imposed by the state's highest court to stop shortchanging the city and fix what it called the ''systemic failure'' of New York's schools. 
 It is widely assumed that Justice DeGrasse will now draw heavily from the panel's findings as he decides how much more money the city's schools are owed. The state could then appeal, though New York's highest court largely upheld Justice DeGrasse's earlier rulings.
 The figure the panel recommended -- a 43 percent increase to the city's $12.9 billion school budget -- came very close to what the city said it needed. It was almost identical to the amount sought by the plaintiffs in the case and nearly tripled what Gov. George E. Pataki's lawyers had proposed in court. But how much of the money should come from the state or from the city itself the panel did not say, leaving unanswered one of the most daunting and contentious questions facing the lawmakers responsible for coming up with the money. [News analysis, Page B4.]
 ''We're ecstatic,'' said Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that brought the case on the ground that the city's lack of money, especially in light of the poverty of its students, deprived children of an adequate education. In the 1999-2000 school year, for instance, New York City spent an average of $10,469 per student, state records show, compared with the $13,760 per student spent in the wealthier surrounding suburbs.
 ''Now,'' Mr. Rebell said, ''we need to roll up our sleeves and make sure the Legislature enacts this reform so that the children can get what they need.'' The report is a significant step toward a court takeover of what has traditionally been a legislative role: deciding exactly how much money should be spent on schools. 
 Throughout the 11 years that the case has wended its way through the state's courts, judges have taken pains not to dictate exactly how much extra money should be spent on the city's schoolchildren. But the Legislature essentially forfeited that prerogative by its own inaction, the panel said. ''It therefore falls, by default, to the judiciary to fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure that the sound basic education constitutional mandate is honored,'' wrote the panel of referees, selected by Justice DeGrasse.
 Its members are E. Leo Milonas, a former state appellate judge and past president of the City Bar Association; William C. Thompson, a former New York City Council member, state senator and appellate judge, who is the father of the city's comptroller; and John D. Feerick, the former dean of Fordham University School of Law, who was also a president of the City Bar Association.
 In its report, the panel called for an unusually aggressive timetable, giving the state no more than 90 days to devise and begin enacting a plan that would eventually put an extra $5.6 billion every year toward running the city's schools. It gave the state four years to reach the full amount, starting with $1.4 billion in the first year, $2.8 billion in the second, and $4.2 billion in the third. The governor has said that the state can eventually raise as much as $2 billion a year from video lottery terminals. How the rest -- which would have amounted to an average of an extra $339 on every state income tax return in 2001 -- would be raised remains an open question. 
 The panel also gave the state only 90 days to figure out how to put an extra $9.2 billion towards school construction and repairs, but allowed that money to be phased in over five years. The plan calls for about $1.8 billion in each of the five years. 
 On virtually every major issue, the panel -- which sought dozens of opinions during three months of public hearings -- sided with the plaintiffs and dismissed the state's arguments. On the question of running the schools, the state argued that an extra $1.93 billion would suffice, but the panel chose a figure that exceeded what either the plaintiffs or the city demanded. 
 In fact, the referees said that the governor's methodology was so flawed that when they corrected it, they came up with a number that looked remarkably similar to what the plaintiffs were requesting.
 As for school construction, the state argued that it did not need to spend any more than it had been spending. In response, the panel said the state was ''refusing to squarely address'' the issue and essentially adopted the plaintiffs' proposals whole.
 And while the state argued that more layers of oversight would be necessary to ensure that any additional money was well spent, the panel rejected the state's idea to set up a new statewide office that would monitor spending and wield the power to shut down failing schools. 
 The governor's office called that aspect a particular failure of the report. ''We are particularly concerned that the recommendations appear to reject any type of real reform and fail to overhaul the current accountability system, while recommending a substantial infusion of new spending,'' said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Governor Pataki. 
 Mindful that the report was coming, the governor pushed for a settlement of the case in recent days, but the question of where the extra money should come from continued to be one of the biggest obstacles to a resolution. 
 Just this week, as settlement talks proceeded, the issue surfaced again. Both the plaintiffs and the governor's lawyers had tentatively agreed to an extra $5 billion a year for the city's schools, according to those involved in the negotiations, but the talks stalled when the state insisted that 40 percent of the money come from city taxpayers. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg refused, arguing that the city should not have to contribute anything more, a position that even the plaintiffs think is untenable. They have argued that the city should pay about 23 percent of the increase. 
 But the mayor repeated his stance after the report was issued.
 ''For the city to fund even a portion of this $5.63 billion would require us to cut after-school programs, close libraries and make severe cuts to essential city services, even in the area of public safety,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Such actions would harm the very children this lawsuit is designed to help.''
 The plaintiffs and the governor's office said that they were eager to continue negotiations. Both parties have repeatedly stated that they want a solution that applies to the entire state, not just to the city's schools, which the courts have focused on. A settlement may be the surest way of achieving that, they say.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Set to Expand Turnpike

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
For the first time in 20 years, New Jersey officials have proposed a significant expansion of the New Jersey Turnpike, an estimated $1.3 billion project that would add lanes to a stretch of roadway long known as an infuriating bottleneck.
 The proposal, expected to be announced Wednesday by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, would add additional truck lanes in both directions between Exit 8A in Jamesburg and Exit 6, where the highway connects with the Pennsylvania Turnpike, according to state transportation officials.
 Trucking industry officials and others said the proposal, coming at a time when the state faces budget deficits and is unable to get federal funding for toll roads, was likely to require increases in highway tolls and possibly an increase in the state fuel tax. 
 Mr. Codey is scheduled to announce the proposal in Cherry Hill at a speech to Pennsylvania and New Jersey business groups. According to transportation officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Codey considers the corridor ''one of the worst congestion spots in the state.'' Some 120,000 vehicles a day pass through the 21-mile stretch of roadway.
 The southbound side is notorious because it is where two truck lanes and three car lanes slim down to just three lanes in all and trucks are fed into the car lanes. At all hours of the day or night, backups can stretch for miles to the north. The problem is made worse because there is a rest stop on the southbound side, where the lanes come together. On the northbound side, where the turnpike has three lanes up to Exit 8A, the problem stems from both congestion and lane jockeying by drivers anticipating the widening of the roadway.
 Transportation officials said the governor's proposal to expand the roadway was spurred last month by Pennsylvania's decision to build a new interchange where the Pennsylvania Turnpike enters New Jersey and meets a spur from the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 That interchange is expected to funnel even more truck and automobile traffic onto the 52-year-old New Jersey Turnpike, along a booming corridor of warehouses and distribution centers that is already increasing traffic in the central New Jersey area.
 One state transportation official who requested anonymity said the need to fix the problem in that area was widely recognized as long overdue. 
 ''You have to think about the importance of this corridor to the state's economy, because it carries commuters and trucks from the port loaded with goods going to distribution centers for the whole region,'' the official said. ''You can not overstate its importance.''
 News of the expansion plan was greeted happily, though with some caution, by trucking industry officials and representatives of drivers' groups in the state.
 Gail Toth, a spokesman for the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, said the news was ''a welcome surprise'' to an industry that had watched various other proposals to ease the congestion fail amid budgetary and environmental concerns.
 She said that by a conservative count, 147 warehouses and distribution centers have grown up around Exit 8A in recent years and that some employed as many as 400 people. Because there is little or no public transportation in that part of the state, she said, most of those workers must drive to work.
 At the same time, she said, residential development is also booming in the area. ''And all you have is the little old turnpike going through there,'' she said.
 She said the industry was willing to pay increased tolls and even higher fuel taxes, so long as ''they are properly phased in'' to allow the industry to adjust.
 Steve Carellas, the president of the New Jersey Motorist Association, said his group liked ''the idea of increased capacity when there is a need'' but was concerned about higher tolls. Further, he said, the debt service on the bonds for such an expansion was at least three times what the state was projecting.
 Environmental groups and others said an additional benefit of the expansion was that it might eliminate the need for a proposed 6.5-mile spur at Exit 8A to carry truck traffic west to Route 1, Interstate 295 and other roadways into Pennsylvania. Environmentalists had opposed that long-planned road, listed as Route 92, arguing that it would destroy several acres of wetlands. Local residents also fear it will seed even more development in an area where there are still farms. 
 But Gov. James E. McGreevey and labor union supporters had long fought to keep the road proposal alive, and $244 million was set aside for it in the New Jersey Turnpike Authority budget.
 One state transportation official cautioned, however, that there has been no change in the state's support for Route 92 and that it remained part of the state's ''strategic plan'' for easing congestion. He also said there were no plans to use the money set aside for that road to help pay for widening the turnpike.
 That official said the first step in the project was to spend up to $10 million in existing New Jersey Turnpike Authority funds on an 18-month study of the cost, environmental and right-of-way barriers and construction schedule. Only then, he said, would officials focus on how to pay for the work.
 ''The very preliminary view is that a shovel might go into the ground in three years with completion in 2012 to 2015,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Social Security: Questions to Ask

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Since President Bush has not backed a specific Social Security plan, we consider the statement from your Nov. 28 front-page article -- ''A reasonable amount of borrowing now, the proponents say, would avert a much bigger financial obligation decades later'' -- in light of the two leading plans of Mr. Bush's Social Security Commission. 
 In these plans, Social Security borrows at a higher interest rate than the rate charged to workers who divert their payroll taxes into their individual accounts. Borrowing at 3 percent in order to lend at 2 percent is not a recipe for curing financial ills. To actually address financial needs, the commission plans to cut benefits drastically, for example, by about $4 trillion over 75 years in the plan that substitutes price indexing for wage indexing. 
 Individual accounts financed by borrowing are a costly fig leaf, trying to hide the truth of excessive benefit cuts.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart's Talk of Price Cuts Pulls Market Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, dragged down by retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, after data indicated that the holiday shopping season got off to a sluggish start as high oil prices lowered confidence. 
 Shares of Wal-Mart lost 2 percent after the retailer signaled that it would cut prices in the weeks before Christmas. Wal-Mart had cut its forecast for November sales over the weekend and said sales last Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving and one of the year's biggest for retailers -- were disappointing. 
 ''We've seen more of a pullback in retailing today; I think people are starting to question how strong the holiday really was,'' said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the United States Equity Group, Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.88 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,428.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.75 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,173.82. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.06 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,096.81. 
 For the month, the Dow gained 4 percent and the S.&P. 500 was up 3.9 percent, with both indexes turning in their best performance so far this year. The Nasdaq rose 6.2 percent in November, its biggest gain since October 2003. 
 Gains by Pfizer, up 44 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $27.77, helped limit losses in both the blue-chip Dow and the S.&P. 500, as the drug maker reaffirmed to industry analysts that it expected 2004 earnings to be over 20 percent higher than last year. 
 Three indexes of retailers' performance, including one from the International Council of Shopping Centers, indicated a slow start to the holiday shopping season. The Standard & Poor's retailing index was down nearly 2 percent. 
 In addition, consumer confidence slipped to an eight-month low in November, according to the Conference Board, a private research company. Its consumer confidence index slipped to 90.5 in November from 92.9 in October. 
 Wal-Mart fell $1.09, to $52.06, while Home Depot declined 2.8 percent, or $1.19, to $41.75, and the discount retailer Target shed 1.3 percent, or 68 cents, to $51.22. 
 ''Today the whole group is falling,'' said Robert Drust, managing director for listed trading at Wedbush Morgan, a regional investment bank. ''Retail really was the factor that, coming into this weekend, everyone was hoping would lead the market higher -- so it's quite a disappointment.'' 
 Semiconductor stocks also slid. Intel, which was expected to give a midquarter update tomorrow, was down nearly 3 percent, or 68 cents, to $22.38. Texas Instruments decreased 1.6 percent, or 39 cents, to $24.18. 
 An executive of the Dutch company, Royal Philips Electronics, told Reuters in an interview that the company expected a flat global chip market next year -- a view more cautious than that of many of its rivals. 
 LSI Logic, which was removed from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index, fell 20 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $5.29. 
 Another drop in the dollar to a new low against the euro also pulled on stocks. The euro was trading around $1.3280 after hitting a record $1.3334 before noon.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to a price of 996/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.35 percent from 4.32 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Retiring in Chile

BYLINE: By Jose Pinera. 
Jose Pinera, president of the International Center for Pension Reform and co-chairman of the Cato Institute Project on Social Security Choice, was Chile's secretary of labor and social security from 1978 to 1980.

DATELINE: Santiago, Chile 

 BODY:
During his visit here last month, President Bush pointed out that the Chilean pension model was a ''great example'' for Social Security reform in the United States. 
 For 24 years, I have championed the Chilean retirement system, which is based on ownership, choice and personal responsibility. Having discussed our reforms with Mr. Bush as long ago as 1997 when he was governor of Texas, and having spoken at the White House Summit on Social Security in 1998 during the Clinton administration, I believe there is now an opportunity for a bipartisan agreement in the United States in this crucial area of public policy. 
 The Chilean retirement system was originally based on exactly the same principle that guides the United States' system. It originated in 19th century Prussia, where Bismarck created a pay-as-you-go-system. But such a defined-benefit system is not only hostage to demographic trends, it also has a fatal flaw: it destroys the link between individual contributions and benefits, or, in other words, between personal effort and reward. 
 Chile's Social Security Reform Act of 1980 allowed current workers to opt out of the government-run pension system financed by a payroll tax and instead contribute to a personal retirement account. What determines those workers' retirement benefit is the amount of money accumulated in their personal account during their working years. Neither the workers nor the employers pay a payroll tax. Nor do these workers collect a government-financed benefit. 
 Instead, 10 percent of their pretax wage is deposited monthly into a personal account. Workers may voluntarily contribute up to an additional 10 percent a month in pretax wages. The invested amounts grow tax-free, and the workers pay tax on this money only when they withdraw it for retirement. 
 Upon retiring, workers may choose from three payout options: purchase a family annuity from a life insurance company, indexed to inflation; leave their funds in the personal account and make monthly withdrawals, subject to limits based on life expectancy (if a worker dies, the remaining funds form a part of his estate); or any combination of the previous two. In all cases, if the money exceeds the amount needed to provide a monthly benefit equal to 70 percent of the workers' most recent wages, then the workers can withdraw the surplus as a lump sum.
 A worker who has reached retirement age and has contributed for at least 20 years but whose accumulated fund is not enough to provide a ''minimum pension,'' as defined by law, receives that amount from the government once funds in the personal account have been depleted. (Those without 20 years' contributions can apply for a welfare-type payment at a lower level.) 
 Workers may choose any one of several competing private pension fund companies to manage their accounts. Those companies can engage in no other activities and are subject to strict supervision by a government agency. Older workers have to own mutual funds concentrated in short-term fixed-income securities, while young workers can have most of their funds in stocks. The law encourages a diversified portfolio, with no obligation to invest in government bonds or any other security. 
 Each worker receives a statement from the manager every three months, and can keep track of the retirement capital at any moment. Workers with enough savings in their accounts to buy a ''sufficient'' annuity (50 percent of their average salary, as long as it is 20 percent higher than the minimum pension) can stop contributing and begin withdrawing their money. But there is no obligation to stop working, at any age, nor is there an obligation to continue working or saving for retirement once a worker has met the ''sufficient'' benefit threshold.
 Because the personal retirement accounts are tied to the workers, not the employers, workers can take their accounts with them when they move to other jobs, keeping the labor market flexible. The system does not penalize or subsidize immigrants, who receive what they have contributed, even if they return to their homelands. We set three basic policy rules for the transition to personal accounts: the government guaranteed retirees that their benefits would not be affected by the reform; everyone already in the work force could stay in the government system or move to the personal retirement account system (those who opted out were given a ''recognition bond'' calculated to reflect the money the worker had already accrued); and all new workers were required to enter the personal account system. 
 With this system, we ended the illusion that both the employer and the worker contribute to retirement. As economists know well, all the contributions are ultimately paid by workers, since employers take into account all labor costs in making their hiring and salary decisions. To protect the net wages of workers, we initially recategorized the employer's contribution as an additional gross wage. 
 There was no ''economic'' transition cost, because there is no harm to the gross domestic product from this reform (on the contrary, there is a huge benefit). A completely different issue is how to confront the ''cash flow'' transition cost to the government of recognizing, and ultimately eliminating, the unfinanced Social Security liability. The implicit debt of the Chilean system in 1980 was about 80 percent of the G.D.P.
 We used five ''sources'' to generate that cash flow: a) one-time long-term government bonds at market rates of interest so the cost was shared with future generations; b) a temporary residual payroll tax; c) privatization of state-owned companies, which increased efficiency, prevented corruption and spread ownership; d) a budget surplus deliberately created before the reform (for many years afterward, we were able to use the need to ''finance the transition'' as a powerful argument to contain increases in government spending); e) increased tax revenues that resulted from the higher economic growth fueled by the personal retirement account system. 
 Since the system started on May 1, 1981, the average real return on the personal accounts has been 10 percent a year. The pension funds have now accumulated resources equivalent to 70 percent of gross domestic product, a pool of savings that has helped finance economic growth and spurred the development of liquid long-term domestic capital market. By increasing savings and improving the functioning of both the capital and labor markets, the reform contributed to the doubling of the growth rate of the economy from 1985 to 1997 (from the historic 3 percent to 7.2 percent a year) until the slowdown caused by the government's erroneous response to the Asian crisis.
 Personal accounts have become the ''third rail'' of Chilean politics and the system has been accepted, and even marginally improved, by the three center-left governments of the last 14 years. But it must be said that some labor market problems have increased unemployment and short-term labor contracts, reducing participation in the system and making the future safety net more expensive to maintain. 
 When the system was inaugurated, one-fourth of the eligible work force signed up in the first month. Today 95 percent of covered workers participate. For Chileans, their retirement accounts represent real property rights. Indeed, the accounts, not risky government promises, are the primary sources of security for retirement, and the typical Chilean worker's main asset is not his used car or even his small house (probably still mortgaged) but the capital in his retirement account. 
 Since they have a personal stake in the economy, workers cheer the stock market's surges rather than resenting them, and know that bad economic policies will harm retirement benefits. When workers feel that they themselves own a part of their country's wealth, they became participants and supporters of a free market and a free society.

HEADLINE: Bush, Visiting Canada, Aims to Smooth Ruffled Relations

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Toronto for this article.

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
President Bush on Tuesday thanked Canadians who waved a welcome to him ''with all five fingers'' on his first official visit to their country, but he also appeared defensive at a time when he was expected to reach out and try to repair the rift over the war in Iraq.
 When Mr. Bush was asked by a Canadian reporter at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Paul Martin why public opinion polls showed the two countries drifting apart, and whether he bore any responsibility, he responded, ''You know, I haven't seen the polls you look at, and we just had a poll in our country where people decided that the foreign policy of the Bush administration ought to be -- stay in place for four more years.''
 Americans have an ''obligation to defend our security,'' he said, and ''I made some decisions obviously that some in Canada didn't agree with.'' 
 A large majority of Canadians opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq last year, and Jean Chretien, who was prime minister at the time, refused to send troops.
 But Mr. Bush added that on the first official visit of an American president to Canada in nearly a decade, ''I frankly felt like the reception we received on the way in from the airport was very warm and hospitable, and I want to thank the Canadian people who came out to wave -- with all five fingers -- for their hospitality.'' 
 The crowd laughed as Mr. Bush smiled at his own joke.
 Later, several thousand demonstrators, most of them visible to the president's motorcade, marched on Parliament to protest Mr. Bush's visit. At the news conference, Mr. Bush also said he could understand Mr. Martin's ''level of frustration'' over the ban on Canadian beef imports into the United States since May 2003, when a calf in Alberta was found to have mad cow disease. 
 Mr. Bush vowed to resolve the matter ''as quickly as possible'' -- almost the same words he used when Mr. Martin visited Washington in the spring. The president insisted that his hands were tied by the American regulatory process, but he said he had asked the White House budget office, which is reviewing an Agriculture Department proposal to lift the ban, to move fast.
 American and Canadian officials portrayed Mr. Bush's overnight trip to Canada as primarily an effort to improve the image of the United States amid anger over the war in Iraq, and as a warm-up to a visit the president is to make to European capitals early next year. 
 Mr. Bush has had far better personal relations with Mr. Martin than he had with Mr. Chretien, whose communications director publicly called Mr. Bush a ''moron.'' Mr. Martin, who has met with Mr. Bush four times previously, is politically more conservative than Mr. Chretien, and has pledged to improve relations between the countries.
 Mr. Bush offered no timetable for allowing Canadian cattle across the American border. The ban has angered Canadian cattle ranchers, who say Canadian cattle are as healthy as their American counterparts, and it has cost the industry billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.
 But Mr. Bush evidently had no qualms about eating Canadian beef himself. In his toast at an official dinner given by Mr. Martin at the Canadian Museum of Civilization on Tuesday, Mr. Bush noted, ''I was pleased to see when I opened up the menu that we'll be eating Alberta beef.''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin made no progress on a long-running fight over an American tariff on imports of softwood lumber from Canada. 
 Washington has long argued that because most Canadian timberlands are owned by provincial governments rather than by private companies, as is the case in the United States, the Canadians can set prices that are artificially low. The United States adds an average of 27 cents to every $1 worth of softwood lumber imported from Canada.
 But the World Trade Organization has sided with Canada and, in August, a panel of the North American Free Trade Agreement ruled against the tariffs, saying Canadian pricing policies did not threaten American lumber. The Bush administration is challenging the ruling.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin focused instead on the benefits of the $1.2 billion in business conducted daily between the United States and Canada, the world's largest trading partnership. Canada, which sends more than 80 percent of its exports to the United States, had a $70 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, the main reason for its surging economy.
 The two leaders also discussed border security and Iraq. Canada has pledged $200 million in relief and reconstruction aid for Iraq and is expected to offer to send Canadian observers to help oversee elections scheduled for January.
 In addition, Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin discussed Canada's possible future involvement in a continental antiballistic missile defense system. This is a sensitive issue in Canada because the government and public opinion have long opposed ''the weaponization of space.'' 
 Mr. Martin had wanted Mr. Bush to speak to the House of Commons, as is customary for visiting American presidents, but Mr. Bush declined. Hecklers are not uncommon in Parliament.
 Instead, Mr. Bush plans to make a speech on Wednesday in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to thank the people of the maritime provinces who took in nearly 33,000 Americans when planes were diverted there after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he had not discussed with Gov. George E. Pataki a strategy on how to prevent fare increases when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority takes up the issue in two weeks. 
''I've not talked to the governor about it,'' the mayor said at a Harlem news conference when asked if he had encouraged the governor to instruct his M.T.A. appointees to vote against fare increases. ''The governor has the same kind of economic problems at the state level that the mayor has at the city level, and he's got to work with his board members and see what he can do to make sure we have good, safe, reliable, affordable mass transit. I'll leave it to him.'' Mike McIntire (NYT)

HEADLINE: A New Index for Social Security

BYLINE: By John Kasich. 
John Kasich, a Republican representative from Ohio from 1983 to 2000, was chairman of the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: Columbus, Ohio 

 BODY:
In all the confusion surrounding the current Social Security debate, there is one inescapable truth: Social Security is broken, and it's headed for disaster unless serious changes are made now. 
 While President Bush's commitment to saving the program was evident during the campaign and during his press conference after the election, his plans remain too vague to be called a solution. Similarly, there is no consensus in Congress to indicate that its members are willing to attack this problem. 
 To repair Social Security, we have to be clear about what's destroying it. We'll soon be taking more money out of the system than we're putting into it, which means that one day it will go broke. In 1945 there were about 42 workers paying into the system for each person receiving benefits. Today that ratio is 3.3 to 1, and by 2040, there will be just two workers for each beneficiary. 
 At the same time, Americans are living longer. That's good news, but it means retirees will receive benefits for longer, putting further pressure on the fund. Americans are also having fewer children, which means fewer workers will be paying the taxes that help finance benefits. 
 Furthermore, benefits are growing faster than inflation. First-time Social Security benefits are now tied to wage growth, and wages are rising faster than prices. The result: over the next 75 years, benefits are expected to increase nearly eighteenfold, while prices will go up less than half that rate. In order to keep pace, our children and their children will have to work longer hours and pay more taxes. Between now and 2080, benefits will most likely exceed payroll taxes by $120 trillion. 
 How do we get out of this mess? To preserve the system for the long term, we must change the way first-time benefits are calculated. Growth in initial benefits should be linked to the consumer price index -- not to wage growth. 
 A switch to price-indexing from wage-indexing would accomplish two things. It would eliminate the need for future payroll tax increases, and it would still allow initial benefits to rise over time, albeit at a slower rate. Instead of rising eighteenfold over the next 75 years, benefits would likely increase by a factor of eight.
 We should also create Social Security savings accounts for those under 55. Workers could invest some of their payroll taxes in their own savings account in a mixture of conservative stocks and bonds, much as members of Congress and federal employees do. In exchange for investing a part of their payroll taxes, workers would give up some of their future Social Security benefit -- probably about 25 cents for every dollar invested. 
 Older Americans would be exempt from both changes for a simple reason: our country's greatest legacy is that one generation sacrifices for the next. These people have already made their sacrifices on behalf of the baby boom generation. Now it's our turn. While this sacrifice is small compared to the sacrifices made by those who came before us, it's one that will safeguard Social Security for years to come. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 17, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on Dec. 1 about Social Security indexing referred imprecisely to federal employees' retirement options. Federal employees can contribute earnings to personal retirement accounts; they cannot contribute part of their payroll tax to such accounts.

HEADLINE: Calpers Ouster Puts Focus On How Funds Wield Power

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The ouster of the president of California's public pension fund has raised questions about whether pension funds, endowments and other big activist investors will be able to keep wielding influence in corporate governance campaigns.
 The change at the top of America's largest pension fund also underscores a growing awareness of the political and economic power lying largely untapped in the nation's retirement money -- roughly $6 trillion -- and an escalating dispute over how that power should be used.
 The fund president, Sean Harrigan, was removed yesterday from the $178 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, America's largest pension fund. He said his ouster was retaliation for the campaigns that he and others had been leading to change behavior at companies like Disney, Safeway, the New York Stock Exchange and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 
 Even when the initiatives failed they often pitted Mr. Harrigan, a union official, against business groups.
 Mr. Harrigan, who had expected to lose his job, remained defiant. ''Removing one person will not reduce the strength, the commitment nor the resolve to fight for our members,'' he said in a statement.
 But other activists saw a much broader effort under way to change the leadership of many pension funds, which in the last few years have struggled because of market losses and increasing obligations to retirees. 
 Richard Ferlauto, director of pension investment for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said Mr. Harrigan's ouster was an early success in a campaign to wrest control of pension money from a Calpers board now controlled by Democratic trustees and put it to work in projects more in keeping with Republican ideals. 
 ''Clearly, we're seeing a Republican attack on public pension systems,'' Mr. Ferlauto said. ''And California has been targeted in a very strong way.'' 
 The 13-member Calpers board has been dominated by Democrats in recent years. Mr. Ferlauto said he thought that if Republicans could regain control, they would seek to make two fundamental changes: put an end to the corporate activism of Calpers and reshape the traditional defined-benefit pension fund as something more akin to a 401(k) plan.
 ''There will be a legislative attempt this spring to mandate that all plans in California become defined-contribution plans,'' he said. ''This mirrors what's happening nationally, around Social Security.''
 A spokeswoman for the California Republican Party, Karen Hanretty, said the party had no position on how the state pension fund ought to be structured, but that one Republican state legislator is planning to introduce a bill in 2005 that would make it more like a 401(k) plan.
 A spokesman for California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declined to comment on the broader implications of the change. 
 Calpers has long sought ways to use the power of its holdings to influence corporate behavior. Its trustees have argued that doing so is a crucial part of their fiduciary duty, because insisting on good corporate governance is likely to bring about more valuable shares. 
 In addition to providing pensions for about 1.4 million current and future retired public workers in California, Calpers provides health insurance for the state's work force.
 Under Mr. Harrigan's leadership it has begun to challenge hospitals over the price of their services. It also promoted an unsuccessful ballot initiative in the last election to provide health insurance for the approximately 6.5 million Californians who do not receive coverage at their jobs.
 Alan Hevesi, New York State's comptroller and the trustee of the state's public pension fund, said Mr. Harrigan's ouster would not deter the corporate governance movement. 
 ''The corporate governance movement is bigger than any one individual,'' said Mr. Hevesi, who has worked with Calpers trustees on many shareholder initiatives. 
 Ms. Hanretty said she doubted that the shareholder campaigns by Calpers and other public pension funds would end soon, because the Calpers board was still dominated by trustees with ties to organized labor or the Democratic Party. She reiterated the party's belief that the activism was counterproductive and inappropriate for pension trustees.
 Ms. Hanretty said the party believed that other Calpers trustees besides Mr. Harrigan had been misusing their positions, to promote agendas that she said had little to do with building shareholder value. 
 At the same time, Ms. Hanretty said the Republican Party had not engineered Mr. Harrigan's removal and had no power to produce such an outcome. 
 Mr. Harrigan was removed from the Calpers board by a government body, the State Personnel Board, which handles labor-management issues for California's civil service. The Personnel Board has the authority each year to elect one trustee to the pension fund's 13-member board, and it had originally elected Mr. Harrigan in 1999 and returned him each year since then, until now. He was elected president in 2003.
 The Personnel Board voted three to two against Mr. Harrigan. The two Republicans who voted against him were joined by one of three Democratic members, Maeley Tom, who had supported Mr. Harrigan in the past. 
 To succeed Mr. Harrigan, the Personnel Board elected Ron Alvarado, a 55-year-old Republican who has already been a Calpers trustee, from 1996 through 1999.
 Business groups in the state and the Republican Party have been monitoring Calpers's activities in recent months, and have expressed concern that the shareholder initiatives were counterproductive, making California seem a difficult place to do business and possibly driving away new investment.
 A bulletin posted on the state Republican Party's Web site noted that Calpers had increased its investment in hedge funds, which are risky investments open only to accredited investors who can afford large losses. It said this investment had cast a shadow over Calpers's commitment to its retirees' interests.
 But Frederick E. Rowe, a money manager in Dallas and the chairman of the Texas Pension Review Board, said that while he did not agree with everything Calpers had been doing under Mr. Harrigan's leadership, he thought that on the whole Calpers was performing a useful service by representing retirees when few others did.
 ''President Bush talks about transitioning to an ownership society,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''Well, we already have an ownership society, and the people who are owners don't know they're the owners. The owners are the people in America who hope to retire, and who are retired, and who depend upon a stream of income that their deferred investments generate. And they don't have many advocates.''

HEADLINE: Hiring Spurt Helps Sustain U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer spending accelerated in October as a surge in hiring led to the biggest rise in incomes in five months, the government reported yesterday. More orders flowed into the nation's factories last month, helping manufacturing expand at a faster pace.
 In addition, the Federal Reserve said in its latest regional survey that the economy expanded from mid-October through mid-November with ''numerous reports of hiring'' and ''increased cost pressures'' the Federal Reserve said in its latest regional survey. 
 Eleven of the Fed's 12 regional districts reported an expanding economy. Cleveland indicated ''little change,'' according to the report. The Minneapolis Fed described the region's expansion as ''broad based.'' The San Francisco Fed said growth was ''solid'' and St. Louis cited ''modest'' economic activity.
 ''We are starting off the fourth quarter on better footing than we expected,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Connecticut. Mr. Stanley said he was considering raising his fourth-quarter growth estimate to 4.75 percent to 5 percent, from 4.5 percent.
 The Commerce Department said the 0.7 percent rise in consumer purchases followed a 0.6 percent gain in September. Incomes increased 0.6 percent. 
 Spending on durable goods like autos, furniture and other long-lasting items -- adjusted for inflation -- rose 0.1 percent after rising 1.1 percent. Cars and light trucks sold at a seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate of 17 million in October, down from 17.5 million a month earlier. 
 Spending on nondurable goods rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.7 percent. Spending on services, which account for about 60 percent of outlays, rose 0.4 percent for a second month.
 In its report on construction spending, the Commerce Department said yesterday that October held steady at $1.01 trillion. Home construction waned, the report said, while government spending increased on streets and highways.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its factory index rose to 57.8 last month from 56.8. Readings above 50 signal expansion. The data on manufacturing showed more factories reported an increase in orders and in hiring in November. The orders index, which accounts for about a third of the total, rose to 61.5 from October's 58.3. The employment gauge increased to 57.6 from 54.8.
 With signs that growth is strong, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to raise the overnight bank lending rate -- the nation's benchmark -- by a quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent at their next meeting on Dec. 14, according to the median forecast of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
 ''We have been seeing more positive signs in the economy and now can have greater confidence that the economy is on course for self-sustaining growth,'' the San Francisco Fed president, Janet L. Yellen, said in a speech in Phoenix yesterday. 
 The Fed's beige book survey -- known for the color of its cover -- was prepared by the Dallas Fed using data collected before Nov. 22. The report found that some producers were able to pass along higher energy and other raw materials costs to customers.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Fall Drains Profit of European Small Business

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
To get a sense of how fast the falling dollar can ruin a European businessman's day, talk to Udo Pfeiffer, the chief executive of a small German machinery maker in the industrial Ruhr Valley.
 Mr. Pfeiffer's company, SMS Elotherm, builds machines that forge crankshafts for cars. He exports many to the United States and Mexico, selling them for dollars to manufacturers like DaimlerChrysler. 
 In recent weeks, the euro has been rising so rapidly against the dollar that Mr. Pfeiffer lost $10,000 in profit in the three days between shaking hands on a $1.5 million deal for a machine and signing the contract. The profit on these machines, he said, will be no more than $30,000.
 As the euro and other currencies climb into rarefied territory -- the euro reached another record on Wednesday, settling in New York at $1.3319, and the British pound rose to $1.9327, a 12-year high -- exporters are expressing more and more fear about how it will affect their businesses.
 For every familiar name like Mercedes-Benz or Louis Vuitton, there are scores of much smaller enterprises, making everything from crankshafts to concert pianos, that are being buffeted as shifting currency values make their products more expensive in the American market. 
 Some are even more dependent on the United States and other dollar-dominated markets than Daimler or LVMH of France. And they do not have the financial resources of these big companies to engage in complex currency hedging.
 The distress in European industry is increasing pressure on the European Central Bank to respond, either by intervening in the currency market to curb the rise of the euro or by lowering interest rates. The bank's governing board meets here Thursday, but it is expected to do neither.
 ''The dramatic fall of the last couple of months has really set off alarm bells,'' said Karl Kadar, a vice president at the Standard Federal Bank in Troy, Mich., who advises German automotive suppliers in the American market. ''A lot of these are smaller, family-owned private companies.''
 Auto parts suppliers already had it rough. The price of steel, their basic raw material, has soared, largely as a result of demand from China. And their primary customers, the carmakers, have been squeezing them hard for price cuts as they struggle with their own weak sales.
 Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler, Mr. Pfeiffer, the machinery maker, said, ''are having big trouble selling cars in the U.S.'' He said their ''financial situation has worsened dramatically, so they put extra pressure on us.''
 His company, with 280 workers and annual sales equivalent to about $66 million, has little margin to absorb the shocks. It emerged from bankruptcy only 18 months ago. If the euro rises next year to $1.40 or $1.50, which Mr. Pfeiffer said he expected it would, SMS Elotherm will have to cut its costs drastically, perhaps by moving jobs to Eastern Europe or China.
 Many European exporters, even small ones, have built factories in the United States, mainly to be near their customers. These plants can serve as a natural hedge against the effects of a rising euro. But in some cases, the American operations are proving to be a burden.
 Keiper, a maker of metal frames for automobile seats, built a plant in London, Ontario, in 2001 to supply Chrysler. At the time, the company, based in Kaiserslautern, in southwestern Germany, was expecting the euro to trade at roughly $1.
 Now, Keiper has had to arrange hedges -- transactions that are essentially bets on the future movements of exchange rates -- to insulate it from the effects of a euro that is worth one-third more. Keiper was able to hedge at a rate of $1.25, which means it is still losing money at the current exchange rate above $1.33.
 ''These companies have become very well informed about influences and trends in the dollar-euro world,'' said Max Dietzsch-Doertenbach, a banker who advises the small and midsize family-owned companies that are the bedrock of the German economy.
 While Keiper assembles its seat frames in Canada, it still uses components exported from Germany. Like SMS Elotherm, it is being pressed by its customers to cut prices, even as its costs rise.
 ''It has had a severe impact on earnings,'' said Guido Schon, the head of foreign operations for Keiper, declining to give figures for the company, which is family-owned. ''It is not easy to manage all the bad factors in the world,'' he remarked.
 That sentiment would probably resonate with the 18 governors of the European Central Bank. They will gather to deliberate on interest rates, faced with fresh evidence that the euro's high exchange rate is starting to bite.
 Exports, which have fueled a fragile recovery of European economies, are losing steam, according to a survey of purchasing managers by Reuters. The index for new orders in the 12-nation euro zone, a crucial measure of export strength, has fallen below 50 for the first time since July 2003. 
 The European Central Bank is expected to lower its forecast for the euro zone's economic growth in 2005, to 1.9 percent from 2.3 percent. But it may raise its inflation forecast.
 With the bank's bedrock goal of keeping prices stable, most economists do not expect it to lower interest rates. But a minority has begun calling on the bank to do so, saying it must respond to the problems created by the strong euro.
 ''Given the lack of momentum in economic activity,'' said David Walton, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, in a report to clients, ''easier financial conditions are called for, not tighter.''

HEADLINE: The Giants' Desperation Is a Player's Opportunity

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The all-hands-on-deck philosophy has been the operating principle for the Giants' defense for several weeks now, so it no longer seemed unusual to see a new guy show up in the meeting room on Wednesday needing a crash course in the game plan.
 The Giants players do not care that defensive end Regan Upshaw's once-promising career had been derailed by injuries, or that he had spent most of this season chasing his three children around the house waiting for another chance, which the Giants granted him this week. As long as Upshaw, a former first-round draft pick, is willing to throw himself into the game alongside them, he is welcome.
 ''All we know is to go out there and fight with all we have,'' linebacker Kevin Lewis said. ''No matter how many bullets you've got in the chamber, you want to fight and you want to shoot everything you have.'' 
 Upshaw became the latest roster addition after Chuck Wiley, a defensive end pulled out of unemployment three weeks ago, was lost for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The Giants also signed defensive tackle Davern Williams off their practice squad.
 On Wednesday, Upshaw was parked at a locker, joking about taping a list of the Giants' plays to his arm so he could help the team Sunday against the Washington Redskins.
 ''Once I know where I need to be, with a nice little cheat sheet on my wrist, I can do anything,'' Upshaw said. ''I know how to play ball. I just have to line up right. Once I line up right, it's just a matter of running around making plays.''
 No matter how ragtag a group this appears, it has remained the strength of the Giants, who despite being 5-6 are one of only three National Football Conference teams to give up less than 200 points.
 Upshaw is a veteran who will use his experience to help him blend into the Giants' defense quickly. In his eight years in the N.F.L., Upshaw, 29, has played for four teams, including the Redskins last season, but injuries have taken their toll. The latest, a right knee injury, prompted the Redskins to waive him before this season.
 One of Upshaw's stops was in Jacksonville in 1999, where he played for Giants Coach Tom Coughlin and the defensive line coach Mike Waufle. That might help shorten his learning curve.
 ''I think he can be ready to contribute in some fashion,'' Coughlin said of Sunday's game. ''I don't know that he will master everything, but perhaps we can get him ready to contribute in a specific area. We will have him concentrate on that.''
 Upshaw finds himself surrounded by a batch of Giants fighting a rising tide of injuries any way they can. Players have continually shifted positions, particularly on the defensive line. In addition to Wiley's injury, defensive tackle Norman Hand is unlikely to play after sustaining a strained groin muscle against Philadelphia on Sunday. Safety Gibril Wilson's recovery from a nerve injury in his shoulder is still going slowly, so the Giants are moving cornerback Terry Cousin to safety.
 And they are relying on even more unlikely contributors. Safety Curry Burns was on the Patriots' practice squad until the Giants signed him in October. Cornerback Curtis Deloatch, a rookie free agent out of North Carolina A&T, was assigned to cover Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens for several plays Sunday and helped hold Owens to four catches. Defensive tackle Kenderick Allen spent 9 of the Giants' first 11 games on the inactive list, but he had four tackles and a sack against the Eagles.
 ''I think the coaches are doing a good job preparing the players, and the players are accepting the challenge of playing new roles,'' Lewis said.
 Upshaw draws the latest challenge, trying to learn a defense in four days before his first game. But for him, it is a welcome change to sitting at home wondering what happened to his career. He sees the Giants' desperation as his opportunity.
 ''I just want to go play, get my career back on target,'' he said. ''I'm not done yet. I'm not old. I was sitting out and kind of thrown by the wayside, so it will be nice getting something back going for me.''
 The Giants will take whatever he can give.

HEADLINE: Powell Visits Haiti, a Nation Kept on Edge by Persistent Violence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KAMBER

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with Haitian politicians Wednesday morning inside the National Palace, gunfire erupted outside, setting off gun battles throughout the day that left three Haitians dead and nine injured. 
 Mr. Powell's one-day visit was intended as a show of support for the interim government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, which has been struggling to halt political and gang violence that has claimed an estimated 173 lives since September. It was not clear whether the gunfire had anything to do with Mr. Powell. 
 About noon, nearly an hour and a half after the gunfire, Mr. Powell emerged to address reporters, saying: ''We have to forcefully take on the people like those who did the shooting this morning. We have to disarm. We have to get all weapons out of the hands of those except the government.''
 He called for a meeting of Haiti's opposing factions in January. ''All the different groups and parties throughout Haiti cannot continue to just go off on their own way,'' he said. ''They have to find a way to communicate with each other as part of a national dialogue.''
 Since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted in an armed uprising in February, Haiti has been gripped with violence. Near daily gunfights pitting Haiti's police and the United Nations peacekeepers against the Aristide supporters known as chimeres have filled hospitals to overflowing, severely damaged Haiti's economy and kept schools closed for weeks. A wave of kidnapping aimed at Haiti's business class has forced many to emigrate.
 Exactly what happened Wednesday morning was unclear. Students in a school in the nearby neighborhood of Bel Air, a flashpoint of violence in recent months, said that chimeres came near the school building and told them to get down, and that the gunfire broke out immediately. United States security personnel and United Nations peacekeepers guarding the palace dropped to the ground and took up firing positions behind Mr. Powell's motorcade, training their guns on targets in Bel Air. Peacekeepers, visible from a window in the palace, opened fire. The Haitian police also responded, according to students at a Bel Air high school, Lycee Petion, who said the officers fired on their school, injuring three. 
 The State University Hospital reported three dead and nine injured, including the three students. 
 One of the three told of the rebels' arrival. ''The chimeres warned us to lay down on the school floor,'' said Alexis Cheker, 18, as he lay on a gurney, a bullet lodged in his shoulder. Then, he said, the shooting started. 
 During his visit, Mr. Powell met with Haitian politicians as well as with civil society and religious leaders. He also met with young peer counselors in an H.I.V. prevention program during his visit, which coincided with World AIDS Day. 
 Mr. Powell warmly praised Prime Minister Latortue. ''The U.S remains committed to your effort,'' he said. ''Much progress has been made under your leadership. We know much more needs to be done. We are with you all the way.'' 
 Mr. Latortue has come under heavy criticism recently because of the unabating violence, with calls for his resignation beginning to be heard. Efforts to hold elections next year are in disarray, with the electoral council torn by scandal and infighting almost since its inception. Its leader recently resigned. 
 Mr. Powell said the elections, slated for next November, must be free and fair and open to all Haitians. ''Haitians are once again being given an opportunity,'' he said. ''The challenge is for Haitians to take advantage of it.''

HEADLINE: No Relief Seen In the Growth Of Employers' Health Costs

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
The growth in health care spending by private employers slowed in recent years, creating some optimism that the employers had turned the corner in their struggle with rising costs. But any relief appears to have been short lived, according to a study to be released today.
 Growth in spending in the first half of 2004 was about the same as it was in 2003, according to the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group in Washington that tracks spending levels. Largely driven by the growth in hospital costs, total health care spending increased 7.5 percent. 
 ''The cost-growth decline that we hoped was starting has basically stopped,'' said Dallas Salisbury, chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, which financed the research. 
 And the steps now being taken by employers and health plans are not likely to halt spending growth, which continues to increase much faster than overall inflation, said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the center and an author of the study. ''I don't see a catalyst,'' he said. 
 Spending started to take off in the late 1990's, after consumers rebelled against managed care plans that prevented them for gaining easy access to hospitals and doctors, Mr. Ginsburg said. After slowing, it may now be approaching its normal level under the current system. 
 While many employers have started asking their workers to bear more of the cost of health care, this shift is unlikely to have a significant effect in the future, Mr. Ginsburg said, because patients are already paying so much. ''We're already using up that tool in the arsenal,'' he said.
 Plans that require people to pay big deductibles are unlikely to become popular enough to make a difference, said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist, who says health care spending will continue to rise. ''I just don't see anything in the wings,'' he said.
 Even as employers have had some success in stemming their costs -- inducing workers to use cheaper generic drugs, for example -- they face higher costs from new, more expensive medicines and devices, said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, an employer group in Washington. 
 ''The underlying cost drivers are really, frankly, terrible,'' she said. 
 The trend is leading some employers to say that they cannot afford to cover their workers, and more people end up without coverage.
 Dr. Arnold Milstein, medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health in San Francisco, said, ''You're on the track toward the medical impoverishment of more and more Americans.''
 Much of the higher costs result from increased spending at hospitals, both for overnight stays and outpatients. Inpatient visits cost 5.1 percent more, while costs for outpatients, including those treated at facilities not associated with hospitals, jumped 11.4 percent, the study said. 
 Hospitals say that much of the higher spending is a result of better care and medical advances. The hospitals have accomplished a lot in the last decade, said Caroline Steinberg, an executive with the American Hospital Association, pointing to shorter hospital stays and fewer empty beds. 
 Some of the increases in prices may also reflect cuts in payments from Medicare and Medicaid, as the government pays less for services, and the hospitals in turn seek higher payments from private insurers. Hospitals say these state and federal insurance programs pay them less than the cost of delivering care, and they say the payments fell even further behind in 2003 -- with Medicare, the federal program for the elderly, providing only 95 cents out of every dollar of costs, and Medicaid, the state and federal program for the poor, paying 92 cents, according to the American Hospital Association. 
 ''Government needs to confront the challenge of paying their fair share,'' said Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a Washington trade group.
 The boom in hospital construction is also fueling higher spending, Mr. Salisbury said. ''You build a new facility and you fill it with state-of-the-art equipment,'' he said, adding that modernizing creates other costs.
 Ms. Ignagni acknowledged that health plans have had some success in controlling the cost of prescription drugs. The growth in such spending reached a peak in 2001 and is down from the previous double digits, increasing 8.8 percent for the first half of 2004. Health plans used a variety of tools, including formularies -- lists of drugs approved for reimbursement -- and, Ms. Ignagni said, will be able to apply some of those tools to hospital spending.
 But other people are not as optimistic. ''They're missing the underlying dynamic,'' said Dr. Milstein, maintaining that so much of hospital care was being delivered on an emergency basis that there was little ability to exercise any control.

HEADLINE: After Musical Chairs, Jets Get Their Conductor Back

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The inexperienced third-string quarterback was still giddy about his first opportunity to contribute on the field.
 The veteran backup was grateful for a second chance in the N.F.L.
 And the injured starter was just happy to be back where he belonged.
 Order was restored to the Jets' quarterbacking universe on Wednesday when Chad Pennington returned to practice with the first team, all but assuring that the Jets' game on Sunday against the Houston Texans will be his first start after missing three games because of a strained rotator cuff. 
 While the Jets' injury report still indicated that there was just a 50 percent chance that Pennington would play, Coach Herman Edwards said that, barring any setbacks, he would call on Pennington when the Jets (8-3) face the Texans (5-6). Edwards said that he would announce his decision on Pennington's status on Friday once team doctors see how his shoulder responds to practices.
 ''Obviously, if he's ready to play, he should play,'' Edwards said. ''Then you go from there.''
 Even without an official announcement, there were signs at team headquarters that Pennington was back.
 Players spoke in the past tense when referring to the backup quarterback Quincy Carter as a starter. ''Quincy, he came in and did a good job,'' running back Curtis Martin said. ''He basically held the fort down until Chad got back. But Chad is the captain and the leader of this team. We want him back.''
 Carter and the third-stringer Brooks Bollinger slid back into their familiar roles, taking fewer snaps during practice. Carter, who was 2-1 in Pennington's absence, spoke of how he appreciated the opportunity the Jets had given him after he was cut by Dallas. 
 Bollinger, who played three series Sunday in the 13-3 victory over Arizona after Carter sustained a head injury, still seemed to be buzzing from his first N.F.L. regular-season action.
 But virtually all the attention of the day turned to Pennington, whose locker was ringed by reporters as he returned from the field and changed out of his sweat-soaked red practice jersey.
 Pennington said he took most of the repetitions with the first team the way he would during any other practice. Although he acknowledged feeling ''a little rusty, kind of like a creaky door,'' he said he was able to complete all of the pass patterns in the Jets' offense without discomfort. In fact, he opened the session with a long pass to Justin McCareins on a go route.
 ''It kind of raised your eyebrow,'' Pennington said. ''Like, 'Oh, O.K., got through that one O.K. Let's move on to the next one.'''
 McCareins said, ''He looked like the normal Chad.''
 Pennington seemed happy simply to have resumed practice and was excited about the prospect of leading the Jets through the regular season's final five games and into the playoffs.
 ''It's not like we're trying to move mountains and swim oceans as far as getting into the playoffs,'' he said, alluding to the 2001 and 2002 seasons when the Jets overcame sluggish starts to make postseason runs. ''We have a great chance.''
 Pennington, who missed the first six games last year after breaking his wrist in the preseason, said he was using that experience as a guide. ''I learned a lot from last year and how to bounce back from injury,'' he said.
 If nothing else, the past three weeks would suggest that the Jets have beaten back one of the remaining ghosts from their miserable 2003 season: their inability to win without Pennington. Last year, with Pennington hurt, the Jets started 2-4 en route to a 6-10 record. This season, they won two of the three games that Pennington missed after injuring his right shoulder on Nov. 7.
 The Jets seemed far better equipped this time to withstand the calamity of losing a quarterback. That was especially apparent on Sunday when Carter went down on the Jets' third play from scrimmage and Bollinger entered the game. The offense did not seem to miss a beat behind Bollinger, who completed 5 of 9 passes for 60 yards.
 ''It was fun, man,'' said Bollinger, who joked that he would no longer have to take a ribbing from his fantasy football-playing friends about not having a passer rating; after Sunday, it is 76.2.
 ''When you're used to playing all the time and then it's such a long time in between, to contribute to a win -- it's just a good feeling,'' he said.
 But of all the quarterbacks, Carter may have felt the most gratified. After being released by Dallas last summer amid reports that he had failed a drug test, Carter was unemployed for 20 days -- almost unheard of for a player of his experience in the quarterback-starved N.F.L. -- until signing with the Jets on Aug. 24.
 ''It was a big deal for me personally just to get myself back out there on the football field after what happened in Dallas,'' he said. ''I just can't stop thanking the Jets. A lot of guys don't get a second chance like I did.''

HEADLINE: Europeans Set To Succeed NATO In Bosnia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Just over nine years after it first deployed troops to help bring an end to the civil war in Bosnia, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is winding up its peacekeeping operations here and making way for a new European-led force.
 In a ceremony scheduled for Thursday, the dark blue flag of the alliance will be lowered and much of its responsibilities will be handed over to the European Union, which has never before taken on a military operation on this scale. 
 While a small contingent of NATO troops will remain, the transfer marks the end of an era that NATO officials view as a success. But others are less enthusiastic. 
 Bosnian Muslims in particular take the alliance to task for its failure to arrest top war crimes suspects, including Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander during the war, and Radovan Karadzic, who was the Bosnian Serb political leader. Both are sought by an international tribunal in The Hague.
 In late 1995, 60,000 troops were deployed to help enforce the Dayton peace accords, the agreement that brought an end to fighting between Serbian, Croatian and Muslim forces in Bosnia. Now just 7,000 troops remain, including more than 900 Americans, most of whom are to return home in mid-December.
 ''We brought stability to the region,'' said Brig. Gen. Steven Schook of the United States Army, commander of the NATO Stabilization Force. ''That is a resounding success.''
 The alliance's presence is credited with ensuring the demobilization of three armies and stabilizing Bosnia to the extent that almost a decade after the war's end, the probability of renewed conflict appears remote. 
 ''It shows we had the determination to do this and stick it out,'' General Schook said. 
 Bosnia has seen significant changes. While the country is still sharply divided along ethnic lines, many refugees -- more than a million -- have returned to their homes, and the economy has grown steadily over the past four years. 
 The peacekeeping operations that helped foster that transition have in turn evolved. Heavily armored patrols have given way to groups of soldiers often driving around in sport utility vehicles, some armed only with pistols. In many areas, troops have been billeted in private houses to foster closer relations with local communities. 
 While there has been progress, the commander of the new European force, Maj. Gen. David Leakey of Britain, says a limited military presence is still needed to forestall violence. ''The risk is low,'' he said. ''But it is low because the international community is engaged, and that gives people reassurance.'' 
 The 80 percent of current forces in Bosnia that are European are to stay on, making the departure of American soldiers the most obvious change. Only 250 United States troops will remain in Sarajevo, mostly to support a reduced NATO headquarters responsible for pursuing war criminals. 
 NATO is still responsible for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, the mostly Albanian-inhabited southern province of Serbia, where it has just over 17,000 troops.
 The European Union force has a new mandate to tackle organized crime, which Lord Ashdown, the international high representative for Bosnia, cites as one of the country's biggest obstacles to political and economic progress.

HEADLINE: Panel to Review Drug for Low Female Sex Drive

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Men have Viagra and other pills to fight sexual impotence. Now women might soon have something roughly equivalent. 
 Procter & Gamble will try today to persuade a federal advisory panel to recommend approval of the first drug to increase a woman's sex drive. 
 The company plans to tell the committee, which advises the Food and Drug Administration, that the drug Intrinsa increases the sexual desire of women and the frequency with which they have ''satisfying'' sex. Some experts say approval of Intrinsa would bring a new era in the handling of women's sexual problems. 
 ''It's a big breakthrough in acknowledging there are medical aspects to sexual dysfunction in women,'' said Jennifer R. Berman, director of the Female Sexual Medicine Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a consultant to Procter & Gamble. ''It's not all in our heads.'' 
 But Intrinsa might not sail smoothly toward a positive recommendation from the advisory committee, which will meet in Gaithersburg, Md. The F.D.A.'s own staff, in its review of the data, questioned whether the benefits of Intrinsa were ''clinically meaningful'' because the drug increased the number of times women had satisfying sex by only once a month compared with a placebo. 
 In documents posted on the F.D.A. Web site yesterday along with the company's data from clinical trials, the agency's reviewers also said they had concerns about the long-term safety of the treatment, which consists of the hormone testosterone. 
 Other hormone therapies, involving estrogen and progestin, were widely used in the past by women after menopause, but were later found to raise the risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer, they wrote. Intrinsa has been studied for longer than a year only in a small number of women.
 The F.D.A. staff often tends to be more critical of drugs than the advisory panels, which are made up mostly of practicing physicians. 
 Elaine Plummer, a spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble, said the company was ''prepared to address those questions'' at the meeting. 
 The shares of Procter & Gamble gained $1.18 yesterday, to close at $54.66. Part of that run-up could be a result of positive economic news about consumer spending that spurred strong gains in the overall stock market. 
 Intrinsa, which Procter & Gamble developed with Watson Pharmaceuticals, involves a patch, worn on the abdomen, that delivers a steady stream of testosterone. While that hormone is usually associated with men, women also make lesser amounts of it and it helps stimulate sexual desire. Some women already use testosterone products approved for men, but those products contain far too much testosterone for women, experts said. 
 Women produce about half their testosterone in their ovaries, so Procter & Gamble is initially seeking F.D.A. approval for Intrinsa as a treatment for women who have had their ovaries removed. It said that 17 to 30 percent of the 10 million women who have undergone such surgery have ''hypoactive sexual desire disorder,'' meaning low sex drive that they find distressing. 
 But the company is also testing the drug in women who undergo natural menopause. 
 In clinical trials, women who used Intrinsa had an increase in the number of ''satisfying episodes'' of sex to five a month, from three. But women who received the placebo also had an increase -- to four a month, from three. The definition of satisfying sex was left to the women, who kept log books during the clinical trials.
 Some experts say they worry that Intrinsa will be used as a means of enhancing sex by women who are not post-menopausal or do not suffer from hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
 ''The off-label uses of this is obviously where they are heading,'' said Leonore Tiefer, a psychologist and sex therapist at New York University. While Viagra is also misused, she said, it is taken occasionally while the Intrinsa patch would be worn continuously, posing more possible risk from side effects. 
 Dr. Tiefer said she did not believe that ''hypoactive sexual desire disorder'' was even a condition that could be treated with drugs. ''There's an endless number of reasons that people can lose their sexual desire'' she said. Intrinsa, she added, is a ''not-well-understood drug for a not-well-understood condition.'' 
 But Sheryl A. Kingsberg, a psychologist at Case Western Reserve Medical School, disagreed. 
 ''This is not a manmade disorder to create a market,'' said Dr. Kingsberg, who was an investigator in the Intrinsa clinical trials and is paid by Procter & Gamble to educate physicians about sexual dysfunction. ''Women come into my office every day complaining they've lost sexual desire and they want it back.''
 While Intrinsa is sometimes popularly called the ''female Viagra'' it is not really equivalent. Viagra deals with a physiologic problem involved in arousal while Intrinsa is meant to restore desire.
 ''Desire was not the problem for men -- erections were,'' said Dr. Kingsberg. ''For women, desire really is the problem.'' Indeed, Pfizer, which makes Viagra, gave up trying to broaden the drug's use to women this year, saying it did not work. 
 But Intrinsa and other drugs for women are like Viagra in that manufacturers hope they will attain big sales. Viagra had sales of $1.9 billion worldwide last year and analysts estimate sales of Intrinsa will be several hundred million dollars a year. 
 About 10 companies now developing drugs for female sexual dysfunction, whether other forms of testosterone like gels and sprays, or other drugs. They include small companies like BioSante, Cellegy, and Vivus. But Procter & Gamble appears to have at least an 18-month lead.
 Procter & Gamble has said it wants to expand more into prescription drugs, which carry higher profit margins than products like Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers.
 Prescription drugs last year accounted for $1.67 billion of the company's $51.4 billion in revenue, a spokesman said. The company currently sells seven prescription drugs, according to its Web site, with the biggest seller being Actonel, for osteoporosis. It also sells over-the-counter medicines, including Prilosec for heartburn.

HEADLINE: Ford and G.M. Sales Slide Despite Generous Rebates

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Despite a crop of new car models and a still-generous supply of rebates, sales fell for the Ford Motor Company and General Motors in November. 
 Both companies said they would cut production in the first quarter of 2005 from levels of the same quarter this year, the latest troubling sign for job growth in Michigan and other states where the companies operate. G.M. said Tuesday that it was accelerating a plan to stop production at a plant in Linden, N.J., and would lay off nearly 1,000 workers at the plant early next year. 
 A Ford executive also said Wednesday that high gas prices were beginning to affect the perceptions of buyers -- a controversial notion in Detroit, which has long leaned heavily for profits on large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
 ''We've been up around $2 for a while now,'' Phil Martens, Ford's vice president for product creation, said of gasoline prices. He added that the company's recent polling data showed that the prices were ''creeping into people's consciousness.'' 
 Gary Dilts, the chief industry sales analyst at the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler, disagreed, saying, ''it's not hitting the radar here.''
 Jason Vines, the chief spokesman for Chrysler, added that ''historically, higher gas prices impact lower-income families who have a tendency to drive used vehicles anyway. It's not the new vehicle purchasers.''
 Overall auto sales across the industry have been robust this year, but cooled off last month, declining 4.9 percent, or about 1 percent when adjusted for the same number of selling days as November 2003, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
 G.M. and Ford have long been struggling to hold onto customers as Toyota and other foreign competitors take more of the market. Now they also face a reinvigorated Chrysler, lifted by its relatively new vehicle lineup, particularly the 300 Series sedan, a car with an expansive grille that has been a rare attention-getter among domestic cars. Sales at DaimlerChrysler, which includes Mercedes, rose 8.8 percent in November, according to Wards.
 Sales were down 13.2 percent at G.M., which has recently introduced several new passenger cars but is saddled with an aging lineup of large pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles. The company has been spending more on rebates and low-rate financing deals than any other automaker, but moderated its deals somewhat last month. Its latest promotion, called Lock 'n' Roll, which promised many buyers the chance to lock in low interest rates for two consecutive vehicle purchases, had a limited effect on sales. 
 One financial analyst, Ronald Tadross of Bank of America, questioned the company's approach during a conference call held by G.M. on Wednesday. 
 ''Your sales are worse than expected, but you're not doing anything about that,'' Mr. Tadross said. ''You're not cutting your prices, the production cut in the first quarter is at the low end of the range I expected. What's your strategy?'' 
 Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, said, ''You have to come out with best-in-class products, you have to make sure you're developing best-in-class brands, continue to cut costs and remain aggressive'' in offering incentives. 
 ''The marketplace right now is pretty unforgiving and we're in there slogging it out,'' Mr. Ballew added. 
 All of G.M.'s brands, except for its Isuzu affiliate, posted declines last month. Buick and Pontiac were hardest hit, with sales down 33.5 and 31.4 percent. 
 Ford sales fell 4 percent in November, with sales gains by two of the company's European brands, Volvo and Land Rover, helping to offset losses at the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands. 
 Results for several crucial Ford and G.M. models are still too early to judge, since they only recently made their debuts. G.M. sold about 4,400 Pontiac G6 sedans last month, about half of the volume it hoped to eventually sell of the car that was to replace the Grand Am. Ford's Freestyle wagon and Five Hundred sedan are also new to the market; the company's redesigned Mustang has been a clear early bright spot. 
 Ford said it would cut its first quarter North American production by nearly 8 percent, to 930,000 vehicles. G.M. said its initial first-quarter production forecast of 1.25 million cars and trucks was down 7.1 percent from a year earlier. Next month, G.M. is expected to try to vault its Chevrolet brand past the Ford brand as the nation's top-selling line. 
 Toyota sales of all models rose 8.8 percent in November, according to Ward's, while Nissan had a particularly strong month, with sales of all models up 31 percent. 
 Not all Asian automakers are prospering. Mitsubishi continues to be in a freefall after a string of scandals and lagging product development. Sales fell nearly 51 percent last month. The company's latest executive departure came late last month as Ian Beavis, the company's United States marketing chief, left after just a year on the job.

HEADLINE: Deal Done, With Perseverance and a Poker Game

BYLINE: By NEIL A. MARTIN

 BODY:
By early 2004, Umang Gupta, the chairman and chief executive of Keynote Systems, had acquired 10 companies since the Internet bust. But the one he wanted the most had eluded him. 
 Then he was invited to a poker game.
 Mr. Gupta had built Keynote, which helps some of the world's largest businesses manage and improve the efficiency of their Web sites, from a fledgling Web-site management business with $150,000 in revenue in 1997 into a player with $46 million in revenue in 2001. 
 Then the dot-com bubble burst. In 2002, Keynote's revenue fell 17 percent, its bottom line turned a deep red and the company lost nearly a fourth of its customers. Mr. Gupta decided that the way to revive it was to go on an acquisitions spree.
 He was especially interested in diversifying from Keynote's specialty of measuring the technical performance of Web sites into the fast-growing business of supplying e-businesses and Internet service providers like Yahoo or Google with analysis showing them how their customers interacted with and rated their sites. 
 Keynote, based in San Mateo, Calif., already had established a toehold in this highly profitable market niche with the acquisitions of two small California companies, Enviz in Redwood City in October 2002 and NetRaker in Mountain View in April 2004. But the quarry he coveted most was the Vividence Company.
 With the growing volume of e-business sales, companies need research to help them understand online user behavior, spot market trends and develop new strategies. Adding Vividence, the leader in the field as well as a business posting sales growth of about 30 percent a year, would give Mr. Gupta's company an overwhelming dominance in the market.
 Mr. Gupta had approached Vividence several times, only to be rebuffed by its executives. Then came an invitation in April of this year to join a poker game with a group of his Silicon Valley peers, including Peter Watkins, who a few days earlier had been appointed the president and chief executive of Vividence.
 Mr. Watkins, a longtime executive of Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer, was helping the firm's venture capital backers to decide whether to pour more money into the company or to sell it.
 Mr. Gupta, who usually enjoys poker, found it difficult to concentrate. ''It was a friendly, low-stakes game with regular players,'' he confessed, ''but I frankly was more interested in making an approach to Peter than winning the pot.'' 
 After cashing out, the two executives retired to a lounge where they talked for about an hour, concluding that there was more to discuss and promising to meet in a few days. They did, and five months later, after sometimes contentious negotiations that at one point nearly fell apart over price, agreed to merge. 
 On Sept. 16, Mr. Gupta announced that Keynote had acquired the privately held Vividence for around $20 million in cash, with another $6 million to be paid a year later if certain performance targets were achieved.
 ''From a financial and strategic sense, it was the right decision,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''We were cash-flow negative at the time and growing the business with Keynote seemed more sensible that taking on additional debt or financing it ourselves.'' 
 By gaining Vividence's more than 130 customers, including Citicorp, FedEx and Microsoft, and by absorbing its 50 employees, Keynote became the leading provider of online research services. More important, Mr. Gupta said, Vividence's purchase was expected to add $11 million to $14 million to Keynote's revenue over the next 12 months, and provide a lift to its operating income. 
 The merger was also the culmination of a carefully planned strategy. ''In the aftermath of the Internet bubble collapse in 2000, we suddenly found ourselves in a situation where demand was declining,'' Mr. Gupta recalled. ''We felt by acquiring companies with new services and technology needed by our customers, we would be able to stabilize our business and get it growing again.''
 He and his lieutenants aimed at two kinds of companies -- those like Velogic, bought in April 2000, which augmented Keynote's core menu of monitoring services, and those like Vividence, which enhanced Keynote's growing expertise in e-business performance management.
 ''The last four years have been all about restoring nearly $20 million annually of revenues lost due to the technology crash caused by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, while at the same time reducing our annual operating costs by an additional $12 million per year,'' Mr. Gupta said. The strategy worked. Keynote, he said, is ''solidly profitable'' and has posted positive cash flow from operations for 11 straight quarters.
 Today, many of Keynote's 2,100 corporate clients are big names in e-commerce, like Amazon.com, Blockbuster, I.B.M., Dell, Cisco and eBay. For example, Keynote might track Amazon's Web site to gauge the time required for a customer to purchase a book, or watch American Express's site to check how long it takes to process a customer charge. 
 Mr. Gupta, a native of India, worked at I.B.M. and Oracle in the late 1970's and early 1980's. In 1984, he founded Gupta Technologies, which built database software and tools for personal computers. Although the company was successful, competing against his former employer and Microsoft proved too formidable, and Mr. Gupta sold in 1997.
 At the same time, he invested $200,000 in Keynote and joined its board. The board, which was looking for an executive to run the company, soon asked him to take command.
 Mr. Gupta's penchant for gobbling up companies as a path to growth reflects a recent revival in mergers and acquisitions. According to Thomson Financial, a provider of financial information, the number of all deals through Sept. 15 of this year nearly doubled to 7,500, with a total value of $800 billion, from 4,000, with a value of $400 billion, for all of 2003.
 Pat La Vecchia, managing director of the Viant Group, an investment bank that works with many small businesses involved in mergers, said the market was hot and getting hotter. ''Our business is up 250 percent from last year and we expect to repeat that growth next year,'' he said.
 Mr. Gupta said Keynote has mostly avoided the pitfalls that plague many mergers, like management disputes and cultural conflicts. Even so, Vik Chaudhary, the company's senior director of corporate development, said that preliminary talks occasionally got off to a bumpy start because the acquisition target's management often had initial suspicions about Keynote's intentions. 
 For example, he said, NetRaker, a competitor that Keynote acquired in April, proved to be a tough fish to reel in. To keep negotiations going, Keynote executives had to separate its marketing and engineering people from Keynote executives and managers during the talks to reassure NetRaker that no proprietary information might be inadvertently passed to Keynote employees.
 ''The NetRaker managers were suspicious that some of the people we were bringing into the talks to help us evaluate their business were really just trying to learn about their technology,'' Mr. Chaudhary said. ''So we promised to keep them at arm's length and out of the loop on certain matters.''
 Mr. Gupta sees more acquisitions ahead, as many as two or three a year. ''I believe we can build a $200 million business out of a combination of internal growth and acquisitions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A hurdle faced by Southwest Airlines shows the drawbacks of protectionist legislation.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (www.dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness,'' just published in paperback by Perennial.

 BODY:
WHEN I asked my editor whether I could be reimbursed for my travel to the American Economic Association meetings this year in Philadelphia, he agreed, with a caveat.
 ''Please try to get the cheapest air fare you can,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Southwest flies Dallas-Philly doesn't it?''
 Well, no. It doesn't, even though both the company and its passengers wish it did. 
 Southwest is based at Love Field, not far from downtown Dallas. But it cannot fly from Dallas to Philadelphia -- or Chicago or Las Vegas or Los Angeles or Baltimore-Washington or a host of other popular destinations -- without violating federal law.
 Like my editor, most people outside Dallas have no idea of this peculiar restriction. The so-called Wright Amendment, named for the longtime congressman from Fort Worth, Jim Wright, was intended to protect the newly built Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. What it did was limit not the amount of traffic at Love Field (local rules take care of that) but where the airplanes could fly. It is a costly example of protectionist legislation.
 In mid-November, Southwest called for the repeal of the law, reversing its longtime ''passionately neutral'' stance and igniting a heated local debate.
 Air travelers flooded The Dallas Morning News with pro-repeal letters, while Dallas-Fort Worth airport officials and many local politicians lined up to support the Wright Amendment.
 Under that 1979 law, full-size planes may fly from Love Field only to adjacent states, plus Alabama, Mississippi and Kansas, which were added in 1997. (Planes with fewer than 56 seats are exempt.) Anyone wanting to travel somewhere else has to drive another 20 miles to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport and pay the higher prices that American Airlines charges at what industry analysts call its ''fortress hub.'' Both Dallas-Fort Worth and American Airlines support the Wright Amendment.
 Although originally enacted to help the fledgling Dallas-Fort Worth airport, the law has outlived that purpose. Today, that airport is one of the world's largest, while Love's capacity is severely limited by its size and location.
 ''The premise of the Wright Amendment was an infant-industry argument,'' said Steven A. Morrison, a transportation economist at Northeastern University.
 ''That's 25 years ago,'' he said. ''That's some infant.'' 
 In September, the Tennessee Congressional delegation proposed a bill that would allow flights to their state from Love Field as well. Southwest flies into Nashville, and the airport there would like to offer flights to Dallas.
 It is easy to understand why travelers would like more chances to fly Southwest. Competition from the low-cost airline drives down fares.
 Indeed, Professor Morrison and a Brookings Institution economist, Clifford Winston, have estimated that competition from Southwest accounted for $9.7 billion of the annual fare savings from the change in real fares since deregulation -- nearly 40 percent of the total. Their estimate was published in the 2000 book ''Deregulation of Network Industries: What's Next?'' (Brookings Institution).
 Although the Tennessee lawmakers reopened the subject, their action was not what precipitated Southwest's new opposition to the law. Rather, Delta Air Lines is eliminating most of its flights from Dallas-Fort Worth, and Southwest sees a new opportunity.
 ''Delta's planned exit will leave a void that we could fill, except for the Wright Amendment,'' Gary C. Kelly, the chief executive of Southwest, wrote in a recent op-ed piece for The Dallas Morning News.
 ''Consumers would benefit twice because we could add flights to new markets from Love at significantly lower fares, and DFW fares would then come down, too,'' he said.
 While self-serving, that claim is borne out by recent economic research.
 In an October working paper, Professor Morrison, Dr. Winston and Vikram Maheshri, also of the Brookings Institution, looked at what happened to fares and flight frequency when an airline left a market.
 Economists studying competition usually assume all companies are the same, leading to the simple conclusion that more competitors equals more competition. In this research, however, the economists examined the differences among specific airlines, calculating how they responded to the entrance or exit of other companies.
 Using data from 1990 to 2000, they were able to calculate how much travelers would gain or lose if a given airline left the market. That calculation depends not just on which airline is in the market but on which airline might enter to fill a newly opened niche.
 ''Your value is in a sense determined by how replaceable you are,'' Dr. Winston said. ''Or more to the point, who are you keeping out of markets?''
 The differences are dramatic. Southwest adds nearly $20 billion a year to consumer welfare, while American subtracts $3.7 billion, the economists concluded. In theory, at least, travelers would be better off if American (or US Airways) disappeared altogether.
 ''I would be cautious about immediately jumping up and down and saying, 'Let's force some of these guys out of there,''' Dr. Winston said. But, he said, the result is ''a signal saying, 'Look, you guys cut your costs and earn a place at the table or if you're going to go, good riddance.'''
 Certainly the message to Dallas lawmakers is clear: If you care about your constituents, the traveling public, repeal the Wright Amendment and give real competition a chance. Stop propping up American's fares and limiting Southwest's schedule.
 Whether local politicians will listen remains to be seen. In the past, American's political influence has defeated attempts to repeal the Wright Amendment. But American, based in Fort Worth and a unit of AMR, is not what it used to be. Southwest, also a big local employer, has passed it as the largest airline transporting passengers within the United States. The low-cost airline's consistent profits contrast sharply with American's near bankruptcy after Sept. 11.
 Still, Dr. Winston cautions, Dallas travelers should not hope for much lobbying from Southwest. The airline, he said, ''did not grow up spending their whole time lobbying the government and seeing the government as their way to become competitive.'' He said he suspected that ''Southwest is going to make their position known and let the chips fall where they may.''
 ''There has got to be an elected official who jumps on this and says, 'I really want to push this forward,''' he added, ''or it isn't going to happen.''

BYLINE: By Joseph Siano; Michelle Slatalla is on vacation.

 BODY:
A MEASURE of the Internet's influence is its ability to transform even low-tech activities, the kind where the word digital applies to your 10 fingers. 
 Consider model-car building. People of a certain age can remember leaving most of their allowance at the neighborhood hobby shop in the 1960's for mass-produced kits of the latest American cars. Those who have stuck with this hobby (or, like me, have come back to it after a few decades in search of a hands-on, nonvirtual pastime) now refer to their allowance as discretionary income. Adult budgets feed adult tastes, and meeting those tastes are dozens of boutique kit makers in Europe, Japan and the United States, who make the sort of kits requiring over 300 parts to build a car less than four inches long. 
 The most exotic of these can cost upward of $500, depending on foreign-exchange rates, but most cost $100 to $200. And the best place to shop for these specialized kits is on the Internet, with its ability to reach numerically small and geographically far-flung customers. Think of it as AutoTrader.com in miniature.
 Traditional hobby stores are stocked with mass-produced car kits in 1/24 or 1/12 scale made primarily from styrene plastic, the easiest material for high-volume production. At roughly $15 to $40 a kit, these are much cheaper to build (and, it should be noted, much easier) than the pricier kits, which typically have bodies and engines molded in resin or cast in white metal, with other parts produced by photo-etching, a technique that creates highly detailed parts out of a thin sheet of brass in the same way that computer circuitry is made.
 Such methods make limited production economically viable; a boutique kit maker can use silicone-rubber molds for resin parts rather than the costly tooling that the big companies need for styrene moldings. But the high prices and vast choices make it unprofitable for traditional hobby stores to keep such kits in their inventory.
 That's where people like Ed Cervo come in. Since 2000, Mr. Cervo has run Island Collectibles (www.islandcollectibles.net) out of his home in Massapequa Park, N.Y. He sells models from dozens of manufacturers around the world. If a model is out of stock, he said, it takes him four to six weeks to reorder.
 ''Most of my customers are outside of New York, and there are a lot of Europeans, also,'' he said. ''Southern California makes up quite a bit of it, too. That's where the guys have all the money, with their Ferraris and Porsches.'' 
 Mr. Cervo was talking about people who own full-scale modern Ferraris and Porsches and who have an eye for classic sports cars, like the Ferrari 166MM Barchetta, which in 1949 became the first Ferrari to win the Le Mans 24-hour race. Mr. Cervo can sell you the 1/24-scale kit of this car made by Model Factory Hiro, a Japanese company, for $215. Among its nifty features are classic wire wheels a little larger than a dime, made from 11 different pieces. The black knobs on the engine's cylinder heads are about the size of poppy seeds, and they sit atop metal inserts with the name Ferrari perfectly etched in letters about an eighth of an inch high.
 Model Factory Hiro (www.modelfactoryhiro.com) is particularly customer-friendly. When I dropped one of those seed-size knobs into my broadloom, an e-mail message to the company owner brought a bag full of spare parts -- free -- in a couple of weeks. Even if your computer cannot translate its site, the photos sell the kits. 
 For those who prefer to put their creative energies into detailed painting instead of painstaking assembly, there are curbside kits, whose name is derived from the fact that the models turn out looking like a car parked by the curb with the doors locked. In other words, there's no engine or complex suspension to build. The Fisher Model and Pattern Company, owned by Paul Fisher and based in Paradise, Calif., makes curbside models of sports cars that raced in the 1960's and 70's, including a couple of the Chaparrals built by the Texan Jim Hall, and numerous racing Porsches and Ferraris.
 You can buy these from Island Collectibles or at www.fishermodels.com (Island Collectibles' prices, as listed on their site, are generally lower than Fisher's). Mr. Fisher, who does all the pattern-making for his cars himself, is helpful; he answered several of my questions when I started to build one of his kits. These easy-to-build models consist primarily of resin parts, with the moldings generally clean and precise. 
 Some modelers don't see much challenge in building a regular 1/24 scale car, preferring instead 1/43, a milieu in which a steering wheel shrinks to three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Ultimodels (www.ultimodels.com), based in Torrance, Calif., sells a variety of products, including highly detailed 1/43 kits from Tameo, an Italian company that does not sell directly to the public. Although it had few in stock recently, they were bought before the worst of the dollar's recent setbacks against the euro.
 Buying directly from the kit maker can reduce the waiting time if a United States Web retailer is out of stock, but it has its pitfalls. I am finishing a 1/43-scale kit of a 1954 Maserati from a French producer called Feeling 43 that sells for 336 euros (about $447) at www.feeling43.com. But the kit I had originally ordered (and paid for) was a more detailed model that cost 430 euros ($572) -- $125 more than the one I received. 
 When I pointed out the error, Feeling 43's owner offered to exchange the kit or refund the difference, but I thought the quickest, most convenient solution was to ask for something else from his catalog to make up the difference. I still haven't received it. Maybe it is better for my sanity, though, not to have another Feeling 43 project to tackle: the company's kits have a well-deserved reputation as hard to assemble.
 Many of the kits listed here require a fair amount of skill -- and more than anything, lots of patience -- to build successfully. For the inexperienced who want to try, the Web offers help. The Modeler Site, www.modelersite.com, a Webzine published out of Spain (which explains its sometimes fractured English), carries numerous articles with step-by-step assembly journals of experienced modelers. The site also has tips on painting, but some articles in the large archive must be purchased. Mr. Fisher suggests www.hyperscale.com and the Grand Prix Modelers Association site (www.gpma.org) for tips.
 And for novices, the aforementioned styrene-plastic kits are a cheap way to gain some experience. Many of these kits can be found at megahobby.com at competitive prices.
 I don't know which Web site you can go to for help if you accidentally glue your fingers together (as I nearly have numerous times) with the fast-bonding glue that is used with these kits. But it will be easier to use a mouse than a track ball under such circumstances.

HEADLINE: Web Sites Satisfy Late-Night Campus Snack Attacks

BYLINE: By RACHEL METZ

 BODY:
ONE rainy night this fall, Krissy Canavan, a 21-year-old George Washington University student, had a craving for Diet Dr Pepper and an ice cream sandwich. She was loath to leave her friend's apartment -- or the couch, for that matter. So she went online, and soon her soda and ice cream arrived at the door. 
 Campus Snacks, which has been delivering late-night snacks to George Washington students since March 2003, is one of many such businesses started by students to serve their peers. At the click of a mouse, they deliver items from freshly baked cookies to tampons, often after most local businesses have locked up for the night. 
 Unlike Pink Dot, a Web-based Southern California delivery service, and failed dot-com services like Kozmo and Webvan, these companies focus on a fairly small array of products and cater almost exclusively to a single college. 
 Those who have created the businesses say that using the Web cuts costs and increases efficiency. They can find fellow students to act as Web developers for far less than the cost of hiring a professional. With orders coming in through the Web site, they avoid having to staff telephone lines, and there is no storefront to maintain. 
 Some of these companies -- CU Snacks, a late-night service at Columbia University, and DormSnacks, a bulk-delivery grocer at Brown -- don't even take cash. Instead, they let customers pay online using debit or credit cards. 
 ''As far as efficiency goes, and economic efficiency, it's prime,'' said Brandon Arbiter, 20, a co-founder of CU Snacks.
 Gerry Hills, a University of Illinois professor and founder of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization, estimated that tens of thousands of college students are running businesses of various sorts, at least half with a Web presence. The risk of failure is low, as most college-run businesses start out as simple part-time enterprises requiring less than $5,000 to get off the ground.
 ''The attitude of a lot of the students, a lot of these student entrepreneurs is, just give it a go, see what happens, and if the response is not what they hoped for, so be it; no big loss,'' he said.
 Matthew Mandell is one recent college graduate banking on success. In March 2003 Mr. Mandell and a friend, Ed Cody, 22, started Campus Snacks at George Washington University, just blocks from the White House.
 The required capital was small -- about $1,000, from Mr. Mandell's savings and a loan from his parents, which they spent on supplies like a few cases of soda, some cookies, muffins and Vitamin Water, and some advertising brochures. Other online student delivery services reported similar or even lower costs.
 ''It started as just one HTML basic page, started with a laptop my father lent me and a freezer that my parents said, 'Yeah, you can borrow this because we don't need it right now,''' Mr. Mandell said. ''And it's grown far beyond that.''
 Now the service carries close to 50 different drinks and around 30 types of ice cream and other novelties, as well as cigarettes, frozen foods and some pharmacy items. Products are stored in a nearby off-campus office. 
 Delivery people, who are paid by the hour, wait at Campus Snacks' office for orders to come in, then make deliveries by bicycle.
 It's an easy way for students to get snacks ''because stores close kind of early around here -- well, early for a student's time schedule,'' said Ms. Canavan, the Diet Dr Pepper customer.
 The Internet has been an integral part of Campus Snacks from the start. Orders by phone are accepted, but most come in through the Web site, Mr. Mandell said. For certain items like condoms, the anonymity afforded by ordering online may have added appeal.
 Campus Snacks' prices are a bit higher than those local retailers charge, but Mr. Mandell pointed out that there is no minimum order size and delivery is free.
 Unlike the George Washington service, CU Snacks, which started on Oct. 14 at Columbia, is financed and owned by the university it serves. Last year, Mr. Arbiter and a fellow student, Jordan Davis, 21, submitted their business plan for CU Snacks to a Columbia entrepreneurial contest and emerged as runners-up. As their prize, the university's Center for Career Education made a $1,000 grant to start their service.
 So far, business is booming, Mr. Arbiter said. One advantage over other delivery services, he said, is that because their delivery people are all students, they can bring snacks right to students' dorm doors. In secure student housing like Columbia's, students typically have to go to the building entrance to accept such items.
 On the first night, CU Snacks received about 25 orders for products like soda, juice and chips. Now they're getting 30 to 50 each night, he said, a step up from his first business venture as a third grader, selling decal tattoos and slap bracelets.
 Monica Betancourt, a 20-year-old Columbia student, has used CU Snacks about 10 times so far and thinks its popularity will grow. ''I think it's definitely something that was lacking on campus,'' she said.
 For students at the University of Texas in Austin, however, the munchie niche has been filled since 1999. That was when Leon Chen, 25, and his friend Tiffany Taylor, 25, started Tiff's Treats, a service that delivers freshly baked cookies daily until about midnight.
 At first, the Internet didn't play a big part in their business, Mr. Chen said, but now he believes that without a Web presence it wouldn't have survived. Internet orders make up 30 percent of the total orders, but Mr. Chen expects they will increase.
 ''My parents probably would never have ordered online, and they probably wouldn't now,'' he said. ''But the college students today -- it's easy for them, and they've done it before, and it's something expected.''

HEADLINE: Broad-Based Rally Leaves S.&P. Index at Year's High

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Shares rose sharply yesterday, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to a high for the year and lifting the three main market gauges by 1.5 percent or more.
 The broad rally came after a 7.4 percent plunge in the price of oil, to $45.49 a barrel, and new economic data showing a jump in consumer spending in October and the strengthening of the manufacturing sector in November. 
 But the dollar, despite the stronger-than-expected economic data, fell against the euro and the Japanese yen and dropped to a 12-year low against the British pound -- another sign that the American currency could be falling for some time. Bond prices slipped slightly, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 4.36 percent, the highest in four months. 
 For stock investors, the economic data provided some indication that the economy would continue to grow at a self-sustaining pace next year, despite the fact that oil prices were still high. A big test of that confidence will come tomorrow, when the government releases the November employment report.
 Forecasters are expecting the report to show that 190,000 jobs were created last month, after a surprisingly large 337,000 jobs were created in October.
 ''The economic data has been good and people are bracing for a strong number,'' William Prophet, interest rate strategist at UBS, said of the jobs report. ''So the real surprise would be a weaker-than-expected number.''
 Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said the plunge in oil prices was the biggest influence on the stock market. The price dropped after the Energy Department reported that inventories for crude oil and distillate fuel, which is the source of home heating oil, rose more than expected in the week ended Nov. 26.
 Other positive news came from the Federal Reserve's beige book report on economic conditions around the nation. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 57.8 in November, from 56.8, a much bigger increase than forecast. And the Commerce Department said that personal spending jumped 0.7 percent in October, almost twice what was expected.
 While Mr. Caffrey said the reports were positive, he said ''we don't have enough data yet'' to prove that the slowdown of the last two quarters is over. In addition, the more that the economy looks to be on a sustained growth path, the more likely it is that the Federal Reserve will keep pushing its benchmark short-term interest higher.
 Fed policy makers are expected to raise the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, when they meet later this month. And forecasters are expecting the Fed funds rate to be about 4 percent by the end of next year -- a move that could push the yield on the 10-year Treasury note well above 5 percent, more than a percentage point above current levels.
 In addition, the decline in the dollar, which slipped 0.3 percent yesterday and is down 3.4 percent against the euro since Nov. 4, is beginning to worry investors in the bond market. The concern is that a weak dollar will make bonds less attractive to foreign investors, pushing interest rates even higher.
 The S.&P. 500 climbed 17.55 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,191.37, its highest close since August 2001. Twenty-eight of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average rose, pushing the average up 162.20 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,590.22. The Dow is 147.48 points from its February high for the year. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 41.42 points, or 2 percent, to 2,138.23.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Suit Seeks to Block U.S. Curbs on Chinese Textiles

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A coalition of American retailers said yesterday that it had filed a lawsuit to block the Commerce Department from imposing curbs on imports of textiles from China.
 The retail group, the Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, said it had filed the case at the United States Court of International Trade. 
Retailers and apparel companies are seeking to block requests by textile makers that would set new limits on imports from China.
 Four-decade-old quotas on textile trade are set to expire at the end of the year, ending a system that limited trade in 2,400 items, including cotton shirts and denim. 
 The expiration pits American textile makers, who fear more competition from China, against retailers, who want cheaper products. 
 The Commerce Department bowed to textile makers last month, saying it would consider separate restrictions on $1.3 billion in clothing from China.
 That prompted yesterday's lawsuit, which contends the government's process for settling the quota issue is secretive and arbitrary. 
 The quotas threaten to raise prices for retailers, and would disrupt plans to shift purchases from higher-cost producers in Mexico and Turkey to China, the biggest clothing exporter. 
 The retail group, based in New York, said the government's Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements accepted petitions by textile makers to block imports based on arbitrary factors. 
 The Commerce Department, which leads the government's textile review process, says it is reviewing those petitions. American textile, apparel and shoe imports from China grew to more than $27 billion last year, a 50 percent jump from 1999.

HEADLINE: Turnpike Widening May Mean Higher Tolls, Codey Says

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL, N.J., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said on Wednesday that his proposal to widen a 21-mile-long, perennially clogged stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike might require increases in tolls on the road within the decade.
 At the same time, the widening, which is estimated to cost about $1.3 billion, could be eligible for some federal financing, Mr. Codey said. 
 Even as legislators, environmentalists and drivers were digesting news of the first major expansion of the turnpike in 20 years, the question of how to pay for so large a public works project loomed as a major political and fiscal issue at a time when the state is in financial straits. 
 The expansion plan, which was formally announced by Mr. Codey on Wednesday at a meeting of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware business leaders, calls for lanes to be added to both sides of the turnpike from Exit 8A in Jamesburg to Exit 6 at the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Mr. Codey and state transportation officials said the project as now envisioned would probably not be completed until 2012.
 The 52-year-old roadway is the spine of the state both geographically and economically, and Mr. Codey said the growth in traffic it carries -- particularly in that strip, which is heavy with warehouses and shipping depots -- made it imperative to act now.
 ''If we don't act over the next several years, the traffic growth in New Jersey combined with the expansion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike will cause virtual gridlock on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' Mr. Codey said in a speech before the business leaders. ''Regional cooperation will only benefit our three states, and we must work together to lobby for federal funding.''
 Mr. Codey's plan would eliminate a bottleneck at a southbound merge at Exit 8A where two separate truck lanes and three car lanes funnel into only three lanes. 
 Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere said that the choke point was on a list of about eight transportation problems facing the state that he presented to Mr. Codey just before he took office Nov. 15. He said there were backups of three miles or more at the 8A merge on 87 days in June, July and August this year. 
 An estimated 120,000 vehicles a day travel on the 21-mile stretch, according to Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
 The authority, which has bonding authority backed by toll payments, would ultimately finance the expansion project. Mr. Codey said he did not expect tolls to rise to pay for it for about five years, since he assumed that the work would be stretched out over a number of years and not require one sudden, single expenditure.
 For now, the authority has been asked by Mr. Codey to spend up to $10 million over the next 18 months to make engineering studies of the proposal.
 According to state transportation officials, the rough cost of a new road built to federal interstate standards is $3 million per mile per lane. But rebuilding bridges and reconfiguring interchanges costs much more.
 State Senator Leonard Lance, the State Senate Republican minority leader, said he was eager to see how the Democratic administration would propose to pay for the expansion. With the state facing a governor's race next year, he said, he doubted that anyone would propose to increase the state's fuel tax to help cover the cost.
 ''That's something that should be debated among the candidates for governor, and I would hope that it would be,'' Senator Lance said.
 The project has also attracted some objections on environmental grounds. Kate Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Tri-State Transportation Commission, a mass transit advocacy group, said the problem of too much truck traffic might be better addressed by spending a billion dollars or more on greater rail freight capacity instead.
 Environmentalists, like Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said the widening project could eliminate the need for another road proposal that his and other environmental groups oppose for its effect on wetlands and its contribution to sprawl. In that proposal, a 6.5-mile spur called Route 92 and costing $400 million would extend from Exit 8A west across farmland and towns to Route 1. The proposal has been bottled up in court and hearings for permits for years.
 While the turnpike widening is not the perfect solution for the congestion, Mr. Tittel said, ''it is smart politically,'' since it addresses a problem many New Jerseyans experience, removes Route 92 and satisfies the labor unions that supported Route 92. 
 Mr. Codey said that the Route 92 proposal ''is not off the table, but it is not on the front burner, either.''

HEADLINE: A $6 Billion Hole In Albany's Pocket Is Expected to Grow

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
With state spending sharply outpacing revenues, New York faces a budget deficit of at least $6 billion in its $100 billion budget for the next fiscal year, according to the Pataki administration, a problem made worse by the loss of billions of dollars in one-shot sources of cash. 
 The state's budget situation became even more precarious this week, with a court-appointed panel's ruling on Tuesday that an additional $5.6 billion a year must be spent to improve New York City schools. 
 While the panel did not specify how much of the money should come from Albany, the state's portion of the bill is likely to double or triple while the spending is phased in over four years. And the state could end up having to increase spending on schools statewide by $1 billion to $2 billion or more as other districts demand corresponding increases in aid. 
 Compounding Albany's problems are demands that the state increase aid to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to prevent drastic service cuts and fare increases that are to be voted on this month. And the state will soon have to figure out how to pay for a $4.5 billion health care program that was essentially pushed off the state budget and fed with pots of money from cigarette taxes, hospital surcharges and $1.2 billion from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield into a for-profit company, among other things. The law that set up that spending arrangement expires in June.
 Gov. George E. Pataki is to deliver his budget plan next month for the fiscal year that begins in April, and he has not signaled how he plans to close the gap. 
 But so troublesome is the state's fiscal predicament that many budget watchdogs and lawmakers say the state may be forced to rely on some unpalatable alternatives, like a combination of deep spending cuts on core services and tax increases.
 One likely tool would be extending a surcharge on taxable earnings of more than $100,000 for single people or more than $150,000 for married couples. That surcharge, which raised the state tax rate to 7.5 percent from 6.85 percent, was to expire at the end of next year.
 Extending the surcharge, and extending the sales tax on clothing items costing less than $110, could yield a combined $1 billion next year and $2 billion the following year, said Colleen Woodell, the managing director in public finance at Standard & Poor's rating agency. She said she fully expected the state to go that route.
 Another option being mentioned by lawmakers and others is borrowing against projected revenues from casinos planned for the Catskills, although Pataki administration officials say that is not being considered at this time.
 The state faced an even larger budget gap of $11.5 billion two years ago, but then it was coming off the economic downturn from the Sept. 11 attacks and was able to close much of the gap by borrowing more than $4 billion against its share of future tobacco revenues, a remedy unavailable this time around. 
 Fiscal analysts say that while the projected budget deficit is not as bad as it was in 2003, it may be more difficult to shrink because the state has largely run through its bag of budget tricks, having already raised taxes, borrowed money, refinanced some debt and exhausted a number of one-time revenue sources it cannot return to for continuing costs.
 The events leading to the state's predicament are partly the handiwork of the triumvirate that has run Albany for the past decade -- Mr. Pataki, Joseph L. Bruno, the state Senate's Republican majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly. Fiscal analysts say the state leaders increased spending during tough economic times, spent down reserves and depleted a surplus that had been built up during the good times. 
 With the national economy looking better, many states have gotten their fiscal houses in order, while New York, with its looming $6 billion budget gap and the other pressures, may be facing its day of reckoning.
 ''All the ingredients are there for a really big mess,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group. ''I think it is easily building up to one of the worst situations we have seen in recent history. We're looking at a bad situation in a growing economy, which is really pathetic.''
 Mr. McMahon said that the last time the state's finances appeared this precarious was about 10 years ago, just as Mr. Pataki first took office and inherited a $5 billion deficit. 
 Politically, however, the times could not be more different. Then, the little-known Mr. Pataki had just vanquished Mario M. Cuomo and was trying to make his mark as a fiscal conservative, leading a charge to cut spending and working for the first time with a relatively new set of legislative leaders in the Assembly and Senate.
 This time, the relationship among all three leaders in Albany has eroded; there is incessant speculation about Mr. Pataki leaving office; and many of his top advisers have left. In fact, there is no budget director at the moment, only an acting director of the state Division of the Budget.
 Still, the Moody's credit rating agency upgraded New York's bond rating on Nov. 9 for the first time in 14 years, saying it saw a strengthening economy as a factor. But Moody's also changed the way the way it views New York, giving more weight to the broad legal power the state has to raise revenues and adjust spending, said Tim Blake, the senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's. But he added that everything is made more difficult in New York because of its persistent ''political polarization.''
 Michael Marr, a spokesman for the state Division of the Budget, said the Pataki administration was well equipped to deal with the impending budget problems, noting that the governor had led the state out of the fiscal crisis when he took office and the one that occurred after Sept. 11.
 ''New Yorkers know that Governor Pataki has led this state out of two of its worst fiscal crises -- the $5 billion deficit the governor inherited when he first took office and the severe immediate fiscal fallout in the weeks and months following Sept. 11,'' he said. ''Building on this historic record, we remain confident in the state's future and the governor's ability to lead the state through the fiscal challenges that we currently face.''
 Republicans in the State Senate, who are the closest thing the governor has to allies in Albany, have contended that the deficits Mr. Pataki has projected in the past have been too high. ''We would say we are more realistic,'' said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno. ''Still, it's a precarious situation.''
 Others, including Charles Brecher, a research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, said that while there are some big numbers to contend with, the state's ability to sidestep fiscal problems could never be overestimated. Among tools in the state's arsenal are fighting the school financing decision in court, pushing costs off to the future or to localities and counting on the economy to further improve.
 ''You push in one place, you can move it around for a while,'' Mr. Brecher said of the fiscal pressure on the state. ''If I had my druthers, it should be dealt with directly.''

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

 BODY:
The United States Department of Agriculture has lifted almost all the restrictions on imports of Mexican avocados, the Mexican Agriculture Ministry said. 
Beginning Jan. 31, Mexican avocados will be allowed to enter all states year-round except California, Florida and Hawaii. By 2007, those states will also be opened. Mexican avocados are now allowed in only 31 states in the months from October to April. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the measure will cost California growers $71 million. Mexico exported $52 million worth of avocados to the United States last year. Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

HEADLINE: Colombia Passes Change in Charter Permitting President to Run Again

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Colombia's Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution late Tuesday that would permit President Alvaro Uribe, the Bush administration's most reliable ally in Latin America, to run for re-election in 2006.
 The main article in the five-point amendment, approved by a vote of 113 to 16, lifts the ban on re-election, leaving it up to the country's highest court to decide if the change is constitutional. Political analysts believe that the nine-member Constitutional Court, among the more independent judicial bodies in Latin America, would be likely to approve the change after some debate. 
 The Bush administration has quietly but steadily supported a re-election drive by government supporters who argue that Mr. Uribe needs four more years to help extricate Colombia from its long, drug-fueled conflict with Marxist rebels. American officials believe that he has shown himself to be an effective leader in Washington's two-pronged effort to eradicate drug crops and pacify a country riven by chaos.
 Since 2000, the United States has provided Bogota with $3.3 billion in mostly military assistance, and President Bush promised more when he visited Colombia on Nov. 22.
 Mr. Uribe remains immensely popular 28 months after his election, with polls in urban areas showing that up to 70 percent of Colombians approve of his hard-line policies against Colombia's two rebel groups and his efforts to revive the economy.
 The policies, part of Mr. Uribe's so-called Democratic Security program, are starting to pay off. War-related deaths have dropped, American-backed fumigation efforts are curtailing the coca crop, and the economy is expected to grow nearly 4 percent this year.
 ''Re-election is an instrument that permits a continuation of the Democratic Security policies, which is the priority in this country,'' said Senator Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, who has worked in the re-election effort. 
 The vote has been met with disdain by some lawmakers. Gustavo Petro, a left-leaning congressman, pledged to denounce the decision before the Organization of American States, arguing that Mr. Uribe, in using state money and the power of the presidency to seek re-election, strong-armed the Congress and violated democratic principles.
 Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group, said, ''He's made a lot of commitments and promises that could affect his effectiveness in the remainder of his term and also contribute to the perception that he's just another politician.'' 
 Opposition parties are now focusing on choosing a candidate to counter Mr. Uribe in 2006. Among the hopefuls are Senator Antonio Navarro Wolff, a popular former leftist guerrilla; Horacio Serpa, Mr. Uribe's challenger in the last presidential election; and two former Bogota mayors, Antanas Mockus and Enrique Penalosa.

HEADLINE: The 9/11 Bubble

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The Washington Post had a story on Monday that contained possibly the greatest hint to a sitting cabinet secretary to start looking for another job that has ever been printed. The article reported, ''One senior administration official said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow can stay as long as he wants, provided it is not very long.''
 Provided it is not very long! 
 Yo, Mr. Secretary, I'd say someone in the White House wants you gone! If I were you, I wouldn't renew any leases for more than a month at a time -- or buy any really green bananas for the office. And those books you checked out of the Treasury library? Could you, like, maybe return them in the next few days? You know, just in case. I mean, it all depends on what the meaning of ''long'' is. 
 I feel sorry for Mr. Snow. Reading your career obituary over breakfast can't be much fun. But I feel even more sorry for the country. I can't recall a time when the Treasury Department has been so emasculated by a White House. I went by the Treasury the other day and noticed a big sign outside saying it was being remodeled. Why bother? Who would know if it was gutted? The country would get more fiscal benefit by renting out the Treasury rooms for weddings, graduations and bar mitzvahs than it's gotten in the past four years from any advice coming from there.
 Here's a trivia question for you: Who is the deputy Treasury secretary? It's a pretty important job, but I have no clue who it is.
 This is a time when we really need a strong Treasury secretary capable of speaking up for fiscal sanity. We are about to embark on a 10-year period in which recent tax cuts and runaway spending are expected to add $5 trillion to the cumulative deficit. In my lifetime we will have gone from the Greatest Generation to the Profligate Generation to the Bankrupt Generation. Yes, I'm talking to you 20-year-olds. President Bush has called for sacrifice -- but not by his generation. He's passing the bill onto your generation.
 ''The 9/11 crisis has been used as a license to spend and cut taxes rather than to set priorities and focus our resources on what is critically important to our nation's security,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
 And Congress has played right along, as have people like Josh Bolton, Stephen Friedman and Gregory Mankiw -- Mr. Bush's key White House economic advisers. ''You know that all these guys know better,'' said Clyde Prestowicz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute.
 There have been lots of strong Republican and Democratic Treasury secretaries in recent years: George Shultz, Nick Brady, Jim Baker, Bob Rubin, Larry Summers. But right when we really need one with common sense and the will to set priorities, all indications are that this White House is looking for someone even weaker than Mr. Snow.
 David Rothkopf, a former Clinton Commerce Department official who just wrote a history of the National Security Council, said that President Bush is obviously ''seeking consensus and homogeneity. But the system works better when the president gets choices. If everyone is on the same page and it turns out to be the wrong page -- you're really up a creek.''
 The very reason Mr. Bush had the luxury of launching a war of necessity in Afghanistan and a war of choice in Iraq, without a second thought, was because of the surpluses built up by the previous administration and Congress. Since then, the Bush team has been slashing taxes in the middle of two wars, weakening the dollar and amassing a huge debt burden -- on the implicit assumption that nothing will go wrong in the future.
 But what if there is another 9/11 or war of necessity? We're cooked. The tax revenue won't be there, so the only option will be more borrowing and a weaker dollar. But what happens if the Chinese and other foreigners, who now hold over 40 percent of our Treasury securities, decide they don't want to hold these depreciating dollars anymore, let alone buy more? 
 It is now clear to me that we have followed the dot-com bubble with the 9/11 bubble. Both bubbles made us stupid. The first was financed by reckless investors, and the second by a reckless administration and Congress. In the first case, the public was misled by Wall Street stock analysts, who told them the old rules didn't apply -- that elephants can fly. In the second case, the public was misled by White House economists, peddling similar nonsense. The first ended in tears, and so will the second. Because, as the dot-com bubble proved, elephants can fly -- ''provided it is not very long.''

HEADLINE: Russian Talk on Ukraine Recalls Cold War

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The Kremlin's words reached a shrill peak on Wednesday over the election crisis in Ukraine, as Russian officials here dusted off cold war vocabulary and summoned bitter visions of lost imperial ambitions and fears of Western meddling in Russia's sphere of influence. 
 The words began flowing in earnest over the weekend, as a Kremlin political strategist, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, voiced what many Russians fear is the true cause of the Ukrainian political crisis: that the West is using Ukraine as a testing ground for a ''revolution'' that may subsequently spread to Russia.
 ''We will have to prepare ourselves to deal with not political technologies, but revolution,'' Mr. Pavlovsky warned Sunday in an interview with NTV television. 
 Sergei V. Yastrzhembsky, Russia's representative to the European Union, echoed Mr. Pavlovsky, and hinted that who was behind all this was no secret. 
 He pointed to what he said was the similarity between street rallies in Kiev in support of the opposition candidate, Viktor A. Yushchenko, and earlier demonstrations in Poland and Belgrade. ''Possibly, the money came from the same purse, and there were the same puppeteers behind the scene.'' 
 The Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin is vastly different from what it was in the early post-Soviet years under Boris N. Yeltsin, who embraced the West and broke with traditional allies such as Belarus. Mr. Putin served in the security services and has publicly rued the end of the Soviet Union, and the Kremlin today views Ukraine in many ways as belonging to Russia.
 Even young, successful Russians, whose memory of Soviet times is mostly of product shortages, share Mr. Putin's political views on Ukraine. ''My Russian colleagues completely bowled me over, saying things like 'Russia should be sending the tanks into Ukraine -- right away,''' said a British-born banker who works at a Russian company here. 
 At a more basic level, events in Ukraine have crystallized fears in Russian society, which is trying desperately to rebuild law and order, maintain economic growth and stem endemic corruption. Culturally and historically, Ukraine is ''in many ways the mother of Russia,'' explained Oleg D. Kalugin, a former Soviet-era K.G.B. general who fled to the West and now lives and works in Washington. 
 Those fears are deeply rooted, a United States official said. ''There is a real fear that if Ukraine turns away from Russia, Russia's physical security is put at greater risk,'' he said. ''It involves centuries of wounded imperialism, foreign invasion, centuries of fears of foreign influence and that the West can't be trusted.''
 Some of that mood seemed to be captured in the words of Kirill A. Frolov, a conservative commentator and Ukraine specialist. He said outsiders must understand that Mr. Yushchenko and his supporters are not democrats. While conceding that Russia and the West ''are not still enemies,'' he said, ''the main mistake of the West is helping Yushchenko and a new socialist regime.''
 ''They don't want to understand Ukrainian nationalism is the enemy of democracy,'' he said. ''Yushchenko is the banner of this nationalism. It's a brown regime. The West will help Yushchenko and have a great problem. It's a mistake.''

HEADLINE: Nothing Ventured, Everything Gained

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
A new trading tactic that could tip proxy fights and takeover battles has emerged from the shadows of the hedge fund industry, igniting outrage among some investors and corporate governance experts.
 The tactic is a complex hedging technique that allows an investor to buy a voting stake without actually holding an economic interest in the company. While Wall Street has long speculated about such a tactic, it was not until this week that the first signs of such a strategy were disclosed amid a takeover fight for King Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug maker, by its larger rival, Mylan Laboratories.
 The Perry Corporation, a New York-based hedge fund, owns seven million shares of King, hoping to profit from the spread between the price Mylan offered for King shares, $16.49, and King's actual share price, which closed yesterday at $12.42. If the deal is completed, Perry stands to make over $28 million, based on figures in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. 
 Perry appears to have set up a sophisticated swap trade with Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs so that it now controls about 10 percent of Mylan's votes, with limited or no exposure to fluctuations in Mylan's share price. While the language in the filing is opaque, Perry seems to have accomplished this by buying 26.6 million shares of Mylan while having Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs sell the same number of shares short, removing any risk for either side.
 The move, which leaves Perry as the largest, if indirect, shareholder of Mylan, could help ensure that Mylan receives enough shareholder votes to approve the deal for King at a time when the next-biggest shareholder of Mylan, Carl C. Icahn, is trying to block the merger. 
 If other investors were to employ the same trading method, it could have far-reaching implications on corporate elections and shareholder votes because sophisticated investors could effectively buy shareholder votes without putting money at risk. There has been talk on Wall Street that similar tactics may have been used in the 2002 proxy fight over the $24 billion merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer and the $1.5 billion acquisition of MONY by AXA of France this year. 
 ''It's a little scary what is going on here,'' said Nell Minow, editor of Corporate Library, an independent research firm specializing in corporate governance. ''You're allowing someone to manipulate the market. It undermines the whole concept of linking ownership and control. It is not illegal, but the question is, 'Should it be?' I say, 'Yes.' The vote should accompany some kind of underlying interest.''
 George Travers, director of compliance for Perry, declined to comment. Perry, with about $8 billion under management, is run by Richard C. Perry, a former banker at Goldman. 
 Mr. Icahn is furious about the Perry trade, which would have the result of negating his own 10 percent stake in Mylan.
 ''If this is true, in our opinion, this maneuver is rigging an election, plain and simple, and robbing shareholders of the right to have a meaningful vote -- one of the few rights they have left,'' Mr. Icahn said. ''If hedge funds or any other investors are permitted to dictate the outcome of corporate elections without having economic interest in the companies, then any semblance of corporate democracy we still have in our country would become a travesty.'' 
 The apparent use of such a tactic will only help fuel the debate over whether there should be more regulation of hedge funds, which are privately managed pools of assets that are typically open only to wealthy investors. Their secretive practices have been questioned as the assets and influence of such funds have grown sharply in recent years.
 To be sure, investors -- not just hedge funds -- have long tried to game the system of owning shares to influence votes. Indeed, shareholders often buy shares for only a brief period before a record date or deadline that gives them the right to vote and then they immediately sell the shares. 
 But the technique seemingly being applied by Perry would take gaming the system to a new extreme because the company would be getting the opportunity to vote without ever having a true economic interest in the shares.
 Still, some experts are not sure the technique should be made illegal. ''I agree it's a new unprecedented factor, but I'm hesitant to say the law could manage this,'' said John C. Coffee, a specialist on securities law at Columbia. ''A shareholder has no fiduciary duty to other shareholders.''

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Limits Cities In Offering Net Access

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
In a victory for Verizon Communications, a measure in a new Pennsylvania law will make it harder for cities to build high-speed Internet networks that compete with major telecommunications providers.
 The measure, part of a broad telecommunications law that was signed late Tuesday by Gov. Edward G. Rendell, has been watched closely by telephone companies and cities across the country. The industry and municipal governments have increasingly found themselves at odds, as cities try to spur the growth of high-speed Internet access by building their own networks -- often in competition with the dominant local phone company. 
 Under the new law's Internet provision, cities in Pennsylvania that want to build their own high-speed data networks must first give the main local phone company the right to build such a network within 14 months. If the phone company proceeds, the city must drop its plans to build a broadband network. 
 Governor Rendell, a Democrat, signed the law despite his objections to the municipal Internet provision, said David Myers, the governor's deputy chief of staff. Mr. Myers said the governor, while generally favoring the overall legislation, thought the provision could hamper the ability of residents to have high-speed Internet access and, in turn, could make those cities less economically competitive.
 ''We've got municipalities that are not being served by broadband,'' Mr. Myers said. ''This precludes them from one option'' for obtaining it.
 But Verizon, by far the state's dominant telephone company, asserted that the provision was essential for it to compete. 
 Under the law, the dominant telecommunications provider in a region is required to provide high-speed Internet access across its territories over the next decade. In Verizon's case, such access must be made available by 2013, Mr. Myers said.
 Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon, said that if cities could also build networks, Verizon could effectively be required to construct a network that would compete with a municipal network subsidized with tax dollars and offered at lower prices.
 ''They're asking us to jump in the pool,'' he said. ''We want to make sure there's some water in there.'' 
 Mr. Rabe said the provision might actually give cities greater leverage, by permitting them to force Verizon and other dominant telecommunications companies to hurry up their broadband efforts or step aside. 
 Just before the legislation was signed, Verizon removed a potential sticking point by agreeing not to block an effort already under way by the city of Philadelphia to build its own wireless high-speed network. Philadelphia plans to spend $10 million to $12 million to provide Wi-Fi access throughout the city. The system is already operating in an area of about two square miles.
 For now, the service is free. But eventually, Philadelphia plans to charge residents $15 to $25 a month for access, said Dianah Neff, the city's chief information officer. Ms. Neff said the city was building the network because it thought that such high-speed access was essential to keep the community modern and economically competitive.
 But critics say that other Pennsylvania cities will not have the same ability now, and they say that the issue extends beyond the borders of the state.
 Gerard L. Lederer, a lawyer for the National League of Cities, said a growing number of cities want to build their own networks, in some cases for city business and in other cases to sell or give away access to residents. 
 Ron Sege, the chief executive of Tropos Networks, the company providing equipment for Philadelphia to deploy its Wi-Fi network, said Tropos was working with 100 other cities to build such networks.
 Mr. Lederer said telecommunications companies were using political influence to block municipalities' efforts, typically at a state level. ''We've seen a significant increase in the last year to outright ban or place prohibitions on the municipal efforts,'' Mr. Lederer said.
 He said the telecommunications companies had stepped up their efforts in the last year, after a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States. In that case, Mr. Lederer said, the court interpreted existing law in a way that gives municipalities less authority than they had hoped to have in building telecommunications networks.
 The concern of telecommunications companies, while not new, has taken on newfound vigor in the era of wireless communications. In the past, some cities sought to build wire line networks, digging up the streets and laying down fiber optic cables, but they can now build wireless networks far less expensively. 
 Mr. Myers, the deputy chief of staff for Governor Rendell, said he expected the issue that arose in Pennsylvania to ''play out a lot of places.''
 But the Pennsylvania solution may not wind up as a national template -- at least as it is now worded. Mr. Myers predicted that the language of the provision could well lead to lawsuits.
 Under the measure, a local telecommunications provider has the right of first refusal if a city wants to build its own telecommunications network.
 But, Mr. Myers said, the language of the law is so vague that it is not clear whether the telecommunications provider would have to use the technology favored by the city, like wireless Internet access, or whether it could provide Internet access using a different technology.
 ''We're going to have litigation over the language,'' Mr. Myers said. ''It is subject to interpretation.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel Recommends No Protection for Grouse

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Amid an intense lobbying effort by energy and ranching interests in the West, a team of Interior Department biologists has recommended that the sage grouse, a bird whose sagebrush territory has been vastly reduced by farming and development, is not threatened with extinction and does not for the moment need to be protected under the Endangered Species Act.
 Craig Manson, the assistant Interior secretary in charge of the Fish and Wildlife Service, gave word of the recommendation on Thursday to Representative Richard W. Pombo of California, the chairman of the House Committee on Resources and a fierce critic of the Endangered Species Act, Mr. Pombo's press secretary, Brian Kennedy, said.
 Steve Williams, the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, must make the final decision about whether to put the bird on the endangered list by Dec. 29. 
 Not since the spotted owl achieved protected status, prompting a 1991 court ruling that vastly curtailed logging in Northwestern forests, has a proposed listing had as much potential economic impact. The petition to have the government protect the sage grouse has provoked energetic lobbying and legal maneuvering, with much of the biological science about its population trends and habitat coming under concerted attacks.
 The recommendation, which will be announced at the Western Governors' Association meeting in San Diego on Friday, followed the recommendations of the Western governors' group, the oil and gas industry and cattlemen's groups. In the 11 states that are home to the sage grouse, energy companies and ranchers would have faced significantly increased costs and regulatory delays if it had been listed as endangered. 
 Environmentalists had sought the listing, saying that sage grouse populations, while now stable, are poised for a catastrophic decline because of development and invasive species like cheatgrass, which combines with wildfires to consume their habitat, as well as diseases like West Nile virus.
 In recent years, partly because of the increasing possibility that the sage grouse would be granted federal protections and partly because of their own concerns about the health of the species, various states, private landowners and scientists formed local and regional partnerships to improve conditions for it, several scientists said Thursday.
 A few weeks ago, the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, the largest single landowner in the West, which controls about half of the 258,000 square miles of existing sage grouse territory, announced its own conservation plan.
 While Mr. Kennedy said the agency was likely to accept the recommendation not to list the bird as endangered, he added that the fight was likely to continue in court. 
 Mark Salvo, director of the Sagebrush Sea Project, an Arizona conservation group that had petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to grant federal protection, said, ''By not listing the species, damaging activities will be allowed to continue on much of the sagebrush steppe, to the detriment of sage grouse and scores of other species.''
 Mr. Salvo said no decision on legal action could be made until the final ruling from the Interior Department.
 ''We will with our attorneys review the decision,'' he said. ''However, it would appear in our opinion that the only science that the Bush administration has based this decision on is political science. It would appear they are paying back their political base in the grazing and oil and gas industries.''
 Jeff Eisenberg, a director of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said: ''The livestock producers are grateful that cooperative conservation efforts will be given a chance to show that they are a viable solution for conserving species. Should the department follow the recommendation, the cattlemen think this will carve new territory in species conservation and we will work hard to make sure it succeed.''
 This summer, several of the leading wildlife biologists who study the sage grouse and its habitat produced a 610-page ''conservation assessment,'' reviewing the available scientific evidence about the bird. 
 While the populations have been relatively stable since two decades of steep and steady decline ended in 1985, they wrote, ''we are not optimistic about the future of the sage grouse because of long-term population declines coupled with continued loss and degradation of habitat.''
 The Partnership for the West, a coalition of industry and property-rights groups, called the report a biased document based on ''unreliable and inaccurate data.''

HEADLINE: How a Struggling Colony Became an Economic Colossus

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

An Empire of Wealth
The Epic History of American Economic Power
John Steele Gordon
460 pages. HarperCollins. $26.95.
 The United States occupies 6 percent of the world's land mass and has 6 percent of its people, but it accounts for nearly a third of the world's gross domestic product and leads in nearly every category of economic competition. How did this happen?
 That is the question addressed by John Steele Gordon in his colorful, entertaining history of the American economy, ''An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power.'' Mr. Gordon, a columnist for American Heritage who has written a history of Wall Street and the laying of the trans-Atlantic cable, does not offer much in the way of analysis. Rather, he presents the essential ideas and innovations that have propelled the American economy since its earliest days, and illustrates them with striking examples. He has produced the written equivalent of a PBS ''American Experience'' documentary, a gaudy cavalcade of facts, outsize personalities and fascinating inventions that moves along at a brisk clip.
 From the outset, Americans had money on their minds. Jamestown, as Mr. Gordon reminds us, was founded not by the English state but by a profit-seeking corporation. The early Puritan merchants would often write, at the head of their ledgers, ''in the name of God and profit.'' It was John Winthrop, son of the great Puritan who spoke of creating ''a city upon a hill,'' who saw in America's forests the foundation for an iron industry, which at that time relied chiefly on charcoal rather than coal. Armed with a business plan, he raised 15,000 pounds from investors, a sum that Mr. Gordon helpfully translates by noting that the highest annual salary in Massachusetts in 1648 was 90 pounds.
 Mr. Gordon relishes the stories of big men with big ideas that produced big economic results. His hero is Alexander Hamilton, father of central banking, ensurer of a sound money supply, queller of panics, enemy of shady speculators. His bete noire is Thomas Jefferson, whose misguided populism and hatred of banks led him to dismantle Hamilton's elegant financial regulatory system, condemning the American economy, for nearly 200 years, to a volatility unknown elsewhere in the Western world. ''American monetary authorities would not -- indeed could not -- intervene decisively to abort a market panic before it spiraled out of control for another 195 years,'' Mr. Gordon writes. 
 The booms and the busts were stupendous. The empire of wealth grew, like a teenager, in astounding, uncontrolled bursts, which Mr. Gordon measures enthusiastically. Already, in the colonial era, America was rich. Only about 8 percent of colonists in their 40's were poor, and even fewer in their 50's. Native-born American soldiers in the Revolutionary War were on average a full two inches taller than their British opponents. With the opening of the Erie Canal, the same ton of flour that took three weeks to move from Buffalo to New York, at a cost of $120, made the trip in eight days, at a cost of $6, and New York almost overnight turned into the economic powerhouse that Oliver Wendell Holmes, in Boston, called ''that tongue that is licking up the cream of commerce and finance of a continent.'' 
 Invention and expansion moved full speed ahead, even though many of the country's financial structures were primitive. On March 16, 1830, the New York Stock and Exchange Board, precursor to the present-day New York Stock Exchange, traded a grand total of 31 shares. Financial panics ended not with government action, but when plutocrats like J.P. Morgan stepped in and flooded the market with cash. The monetary system was chaotic. In the 1850's there were more than 7,000 kinds of bank notes in circulation, and more than 5,000 fraudulent or counterfeit notes. A semblance of order came in March 1865 when Congress passed a bill to tax bank notes issued by state-chartered banks. By the end of the Civil War, the country had only two forms of paper currency, national bank notes backed by bank reserves, and greenbacks, so called because they were printed with green ink on the back. 
 Mr. Gordon, in telling his tale, keeps a sharp eye out for the unintended consequences of economic change. They provide some of his most arresting facts. The McCormick reaper, by throwing farm laborers off the land, provided the manpower for the expansion of American industry after the Civil War. The high prices for horses during the First World War caused American farmers to adopt tractors much faster than they otherwise would have. Technology gives with one hand and takes away with the other, however. The rise of the automobile created a crisis for American farmers, who in 1900 had devoted fully a third of their land to growing oats and hay for horses. By 1929 the horses were almost all gone, and the land set aside for fodder now produced food crops, driving down prices.
 This is popular history, written almost entirely from secondary sources, with a bare sprinkling of footnotes. The facts are not always correct. The quick-lunch counters frequented by Wall Street brokers were old news by the 1860's, when Mr. Gordon claims they were invented. It is simply bizarre to state that railroads never make an appearance in the works of Dickens; in ''Dombey and Son,'' the railroad is virtually a character. And the ''Mr. Carlisle'' in William Jennings Bryan's ''Cross of Gold'' speech is not Thomas Carlyle, but John G. Carlisle, Grover Cleveland's secretary of the treasury. 
 These are small bumps on an otherwise smoothly paved superhighway that whooshes the reader onward, ever faster, toward a glorious American future. In his breathless conclusion (e-mail! the integrated circuit! online pizza delivery! the 
 Drudge report!), Mr. Gordon envisions more, much more, of the same, despite the shadows of war. As Cicero put it, ''The sinews of war are infinite money,'' and that's what the American empire, the first to rely on economic power rather than conquest, is uniquely capable of creating.

HEADLINE: Tribes Argue Catskills Casino Plan in TV Ads

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
The fight between two rival Indian tribes over casinos in the Catskills -- largely conducted by lobbyists out of the public view -- has finally spilled into the open, in the form of competing, hard-edged advertising campaigns.
 The Oneida Indian Nation of New York, which operates the highly profitable Turning Stone Resort and Casino in central New York, is opposed to a deal between the state and the Seneca-Cayuga Indians of Oklahoma that, if approved by legislators, would permit the Oklahoma tribe to build a casino in the Catskill Mountains.
 About two weeks ago, the New York tribe began a media campaign, which included a television advertisement asserting that the Oklahoma tribe planned to take its casino proceeds out of New York. The message was underscored by a grim black-and-white image of a padlocked storefront and a narrator's stentorian voice. 
 In response, the Seneca-Cayugas' investment partner, Empire Resorts, began its own advertising this week that features cheerful people, robust construction activity, a bald eagle in flight and an upbeat narrator who hails a ''historic agreement'' that will create jobs.
 The dueling media blitzes reflect the bitter rivalries among the various tribes competing for the gambling market. Given the Catskills' proximity to New York City, the notion of a casino there has long been viewed by developers, Indian tribes and the Pataki administration as a potential economic jackpot.
 The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has been negotiating for years to settle land claims with half a dozen New York tribes. It has been trying to use the promise of casinos, rather than taxpayer dollars, to persuade the tribes to drop their claims.
 Earlier this month, the governor announced separate deals with the Seneca-Cayugas, who trace their lineage to New York, and the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York, essentially settling the tribes' land claims against the state in exchange for their right to build casinos in the Catskills. The deals still have to be approved by the State Legislature and the Congress, but they have already come closer than any other casino plans in the Catskills.
 The deals represent an economic threat to the Oneidas, who for years have cornered part of the regional gambling market with Turning Stone, in Verona, N.Y., off the New York State Thruway near Syracuse. The Mohawks have a casino in northern New York, and the Seneca Nation has casinos in Niagara Falls and Salamanca, N.Y. But analysts have said that a large Catskills casino could overshadow them and pose significant competition to casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut.
 The Oneidas began their media campaign, which also included newspaper advertisements, after Governor Pataki's announcement of the two casino deals last month. A 10-day campaign ended on Monday, but the tribe released a second television commercial this week. 
 An Oneida spokesman, Mark F. Emery, insisted that the tribe was not motivated by fear of competition but was only trying to defend the state's economic sovereignty against a group it viewed as interlopers.
 ''The New York Oneidas have no problem with New York Indian nations having casinos,'' he said. But, he added, allowing the Oklahoma tribe to operate a New York casino would ''open up a Pandora's box because at that point any Indian nation could petition the state to come here.'' 
 The Seneca-Cayugas, who are based in northeastern Oklahoma, and their development partner, Empire Resorts, say the Oneidas are employing scare tactics. ''It struck us as extremely disingenuous,'' said Charles A. Degliomini, vice president of Empire Resorts, which is based in Monticello, N.Y. The company plans to add print and direct-mail advertisements to its publicity campaign.
 Todd Alhart, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said the Oneidas' ads were "grossly inaccurate.'' Members of the tribe, he said, ''should be ashamed of themselves.'' 
 Mr. Degliomini pointed out that the Seneca-Cayugas have a historic land claim in the state, as recognized in a 2001 federal court ruling that awarded $247.9 million to the Cayugas and the Seneca-Cayugas as compensation for the state's illegal purchase of tribal land about 200 years ago. Additionally, he said, the deal with the Pataki administration guarantees the sharing of slot machine revenue with the state and $8 million in annual payments to Sullivan County, and it promises thousands of temporary and permanent jobs.
 Mr. Emery dismissed those proceeds as ''operating costs'' and said they amounted to only a fraction of a Catskill casino's total expected profits -- ''and that's what's going back to Oklahoma,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 3 about an advertising battle between two Indian tribes over casinos in the Catskills misstated the amount that one tribe, the Seneca-Cayuga of Oklahoma, has agreed to pay Sullivan County in annual casino fees. It is $15 million, not $8 million.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rose 0.5% in October

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Strong demand for military aircraft increased overall orders to factories by 0.5 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted $371.51 billion, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, though orders were unchanged when military goods were excluded. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that new applications for jobless pay jumped by 25,000 last week, to 349,000. The data came just before Friday's closely watched report on job creation in November, but analysts noted that the monthly employment survey was completed well before the rise in claims. 
 The October increase in factory orders topped Wall Street forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain. While orders for quickly used nondurable goods like paper products climbed 2.4 percent, demand for more costly and longer-lasting durables fell by a revised 1.1 percent instead of the 0.4 percent decrease previously reported. Analysts said the drop in durables orders could be an indication of some softening in demand ahead.
 ''It shows that apart from the government, which drives defense spending, and aircraft, which can be very volatile, this really shows an underlying trend,'' that has been showing some moderation recently, said Elisabeth Denison, economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York.
 The gain in overall October factory orders followed a flat performance in September, though that was an upward revision from a previously reported 0.4 percent decline.
 The war in Iraq appeared to be a significant factor in October demand, as orders for military capital goods jumped 18.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $12.67 billion after an even larger 27.5 percent surge in September. Excluding military goods, factory orders were unchanged in October after declining 0.6 percent in September.
 The Commerce Department said orders for military aircraft rose by 35.3 percent, to $3.26 billion in October, after falling 13.4 percent in September.
 The Labor Department said its closely watched four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smoothes out weekly fluctuations, rose to 336,500 from a four-year low of 332,250 the previous week.
 Still, the total number of people who remained on the benefit rolls after claiming an initial week of aid fell 20,000, to 2.72 million, in the week ended Nov. 20, the latest week with available data, its lowest since April 2001.
 ''I would never overemphasize one week's numbers, I would look at a four-week average, but I see these initial claims figures being right on target with substantial new job creation,'' said Ken Mayland, president of Clearview Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Congressional Caprice

 BODY:
The pork-stuffed omnibus spending bill that Congress rushed to passage without reading largely remains a $388 billion national secret. But laugh lines are gradually leaking out. For instance, why not spend $100,000 for the Punxsutawney Weather Museum in Pennsylvania, considering the annual drollery of Groundhog Day? And once the lawmakers put the taxpayers in for $25,000 to finance mariachi music in Nevada, hey, why not go for $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland? As for that $50,000 for wild hog control in Missouri, it's in the same spirit as the $335,000 to protect sunflowers from blackbirds in North Dakota. 
 If only the bill were a mere laugh riot. But the truth is that the measure, cobbled together from 13 bills that Congress failed to weigh separately and thoughtfully, legislates the costs of next year's government by blindfold and bludgeon. 
 Nowhere is this more graphic than in the shocking cut that Congress levied on the National Science Foundation, the research dynamo that does so much to feed the nation's economic growth through breakthrough advances in science and technology. Its budget will be $105 million less than last year's, even as lawmakers spared an estimated $15.8 billion for a record 11,772 pet projects. This binge of bipartisan pandering to voters includes such national priorities as renovating the Hot Springs bathhouses in Arkansas and bolstering the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame in Wisconsin. 
 The science cut may seem minor in the context of the foundation's total, more than $5.4 billion. But it signals harsher times to come. For the past two years, a profligate Republican Congress has allowed the deficit to balloon by papering over such factors as the open-ended cost of the Iraq war and the revenues lost because of the Bush tax cuts. Now leaner, meaner government has become the rhetorical rage, with basic institutions like the Environmental Protection Agency and the affordable-housing program joining the science foundation in taking hits. 
 The science foundation may have helped to pay for research on Web browsers and search engines, among countless innovations, but it doesn't seem to be holding its own against Punxsutawney Phil.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Players Seeking New Talks With League

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS

 BODY:
On the 77th day of the N.H.L. lockout and with the season in jeopardy, the league and players union announced yesterday that they would hold negotiations next week for the first time since Sept. 9.
 The National Hockey League Players' Association released a statement that said its executive director, Bob Goodenow, had sent a letter to Commissioner Gary Bettman to invite the league's negotiating committee to attend a meeting in Toronto next week with the union's executive committee and senior officials.
 The statement also said the union was working on a new proposal. 
 ''Almost three months have passed since the players made their last proposal, and we have yet to receive a counteroffer from the league,'' Goodenow said in the statement.
 ''We have been working hard at other creative solutions and believe our new proposal will provide a basis to end the owners' lockout and resume N.H.L. hockey,'' he said.
 Bill Daly, the league's executive vice president, released a statement, saying: ''We are hopeful that the N.H.L.P.A.'s offer will be a meaningful effort to address the league's economic problems. When we receive the proposal, we will evaluate it closely and respond appropriately.''
 During the 1994-95 lockout, the N.H.L. played a 48-game schedule, down from its usual 82 games, starting in January.
 That lockout lasted 103 days.
 Since this year's lockout began Sept. 15, 334 regular-season games have been wiped out.
 The union previously offered concessions that included a 5 percent rollback on salaries, further restrictions on rookie pay, a luxury tax and revenue sharing.
 The owners, who said they lost $223 million last season, want to cut player salaries to about $1.3 million a season from an average of about $1.8 million through a formula that links wages to revenue. 
 The league's general managers met with Bettman last night for an update during a dinner meeting in Manhattan.
 Bettman has said that a luxury tax would not work for the 30 N.H.L. teams and that management would not agree to a deal without a defined relationship between revenue and salaries.
 In announcing the lockout, he cited $1.8 billion in losses by the owners over the past decade.
 ''I'm pleased that the union has finally decided it makes sense to go back to the bargaining table,'' Bettman said after last night's session, which included 26 of the 30 general managers. ''Beyond that, let's see what the offer is like.''
 Bettman said the calendar is not an issue.
 ''It's about making the right deal,'' he said.
 The league has operated under the same collective bargaining agreement since 1995.
 That deal was extended twice.
 League officials have said that 76 percent of all revenue goes to player salaries, far more than the percentage for the other major team sports.
 The union has questioned many of the league's financial numbers.
 Florida General Manager Mike Keenan described the latest developments as encouraging.
 ''Hopefully Bob and Gary will put something together for us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: TV Time, Unlike Child Care, Ranks High in Mood Study

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
A team of psychologists and economists is reporting today what many Americans know but do not always admit, especially to social scientists: that watching television by oneself is a very enjoyable way to pass the time, and that taking care of children -- bless their little hearts -- is often about as much fun as housework. 
 Those findings, published in the journal Science, run contrary to previous research about what makes people happy and why. 
 The study also suggests that the fundamental realities of marriage and job security have far less to do with daily moods than factors like deadlines on the job and quality of sleep.
 The study looked at 909 working women in Texas, though the researchers said the results probably applied more broadly. 
 It found that in general the group woke up a little grumpy but soon entered a state of mild pleasure that increased by degrees through the day, punctuated by occasional bouts of anxiety, frustration and anger. Predictably, the researchers found that commuting to work, housework and facing a boss rated as the least pleasant activities, while sex, socializing with friends and relaxing were most enjoyable. 
 Yet contrary to previous research on daily mood, the study found that the women rated television watching high on the list, ahead of shopping and talking on the phone, and ranked taking care of children low, below cooking and not far above housework. 
 The study marks the debut of a novel questionnaire that probes the subtle, moment-to-moment emotions that constitute an ordinary day. In the new approach, called the Day Reconstruction Method, people keep a diary of everything they did during the day, from reading the paper in the morning to arguing with children or co-workers over lunch, from running to catch the 6 p.m. bus home to falling asleep with their socks on.
 The next day, consulting the diary, they relive each activity and, using seven-point scales, rate how they felt at the time relative to each of a dozen feelings like annoyed, criticized, worried, warm, friendly or happy. 
 Customarily, researchers who study well-being have asked sweeping questions about contentment or dissatisfaction. In contrast, the new survey method prompts people to relive a normal day, rating how pleased or annoyed, depressed or competent they felt in specific activities. 
 Reimagining the day's activities, rather than reporting what they could or should be feeling about them, allows people to be more honest, some psychologists said. 
 ''This is a measure of people's mood in the moment,'' though ''that doesn't mean it's the best thing they could be doing,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Daniel Kahneman, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University. For example, had the study asked respondents to rate how thrilled they were at a given moment rather than simply how happy, it would have come up with different answers, Dr. Kahneman said.
 ''But we are trying to get a better idea or sense of what people's daily lives are actually like,'' he added, ''what it is they do with their time.''
 One of the most consistent findings in studies of well-being is how little difference money makes. As long as people are not battling poverty, they tend to rate their happiness in the range of 6 or 7, or higher, on a 10-point scale.
 After controlling for other factors, Dr. Kahneman and his colleagues found that even differences in household income of more than $60,000 had little effect on daily moods. Job security, too, had little influence. 
 By far the two factors that most upset daily moods were a poor night's sleep and tight work deadlines. According to a scale the researchers developed, women who slept poorly reported relatively little enjoyment even when relaxing in front of the TV or shopping.
 Dr. Richard Suzman, associate director for behavioral and social research at the National Institute on Aging, which helped finance the study, said that if the new survey method proved sensitive to life changes in further studies, it could also establish quality-of-life measures firmly in mainstream medicine. Researchers would then have a more complete picture of how new drugs or medical technologies might enrich or dull the small pleasures of daily life.
 ''This instrument should give us a much improved measure of well-being,'' Dr. Suzman said. ''At the broadest level, it could help us set up a national well-being account, similar to the gross national product, that would give us a better understanding of how changes in policy, or social trends, affect quality of life.''

HEADLINE: A New Issue That Failed to Sell in 2000 Becomes a Hit in 2004

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WALL STREET can be moody. Sometimes it will finance anything, and at extraordinarily high prices. Sometimes it will not finance anything.
 It was less than five years ago when the greatest bull market ever for small technology stocks came to an abrupt end. At the peak of the market in early 2000, a venture capitalist told me that there was no such thing as a company that was not ready for a public offering. He had learned that if an investment banker said a company was too young, what the banker really meant was that his people already had all the offerings they could handle. In that case, he said, he just called another bank. 
 A few months later, there was no shortage of available investment bankers. But with prices plunging, there was a shortage of customers willing to take a chance on unproven companies, no matter how enticing their forecasts.
 Now, there is a lively market in initial public offerings. It is not as crazy as the one that was rocketing five years ago, but it does not lack for speculation. The best-performing offering sold in the American market this year is Shanda Interactive Entertainment, which bills itself as the largest Internet-based game company in China. The shares are up 268 percent since it went public in May, and in October the company was able to borrow $275 million without interest for 10 years in a convertible bond offering. It is growing rapidly, but it requires some optimism to value at $2.9 billion a company whose quarterly revenues have yet to reach $50 million.
 One of the more successful new offerings of this year is RightNow Technologies, a software company in the hot area of customer relationship management; its previous effort to go public, in 2000, did not succeed.
 It went public in August at $7 a share and within a couple of days the price was trading below the offering level. But it has risen to $18.93, a gain of 170 percent. Back in 2000, RightNow was tiny, with lifetime revenue of $6 million. But it had the hot underwriter of the era, Frank P. Quattrone's team at Credit Suisse First Boston, and they valued the company at $228 million.
 Then the bubble burst. RightNow was able to raise money from venture capitalists, who valued it at less than half Credit Suisse's figure, but it had to slash expenses and lay off employees. Still, revenue kept rising.
 ''We grew through the nuclear winter for the software industry,'' said Greg R. Gianforte, RightNow's founder and chief executive, in a telephone interview this week. RightNow is based in Bozeman, Mont. But when I caught up with him he was in Cambridge, Mass., taking part in a Harvard Business School class studying his company's history, including his decision to turn down a takeover offer last year in hopes of going public this year. 
 The offering price in this year's deal, with Morgan Stanley as the lead underwriter, was 22 percent below the lowest price contemplated in 2000. RightNow's annual revenue was up to $47 million, and it had reported two profitable quarters, with a third added since the offering. Investors now value the company at more than $600 million.
 The history of technology stock investing is one of big swings in psychology. This is an industry in which companies that start in a bedroom with one employee -- as RightNow did -- can rise to challenge established companies, and one in which rapid growth can end abruptly when someone else comes up with a better product.
 Sometimes Wall Street focuses on the growth potential, and at other times -- the last one around 1990 -- it can see little but the risk of devastating new competition. In retrospect, 1990 was a phenomenally good time to invest in technology stocks, and 2000 a horrid one. Looking at this year's crop of new issues makes it appear that 2004 is not nearly as bad as 2000, but it is also a long way from 1990.

HEADLINE: Music Industry Turns to Napster Creator for Help

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
As a teenager, Shawn Fanning brought free music to the masses, creating the Napster file-swapping program and unleashing a technological genie that granted the wishes of fans seeking virtually any song at any time -- gratis. Now, the recording industry is turning to the college dropout turned cult hero, with dreams of putting the genie back in its bottle. 
 The major record corporations, who accused Mr. Fanning's Napster of ravaging CD sales and weakening the underpinnings of the industry, now say that a licensed file-sharing system could bolster their position in their legal fight against piracy as well as increase digital music sales. 
 Mr. Fanning, now 24 and part of a new venture called Snocap, has lately written software that would recognize songs being made available on a peer-to-peer network and let copyright holders set terms for its price and its use by consumers who wish to download them. 
 Snocap and the music corporations are envisioning an online community where visitors could trade songs without violating copyright laws. 
 Mr. Fanning's San Francisco-based venture has attracted support from the industry's heavyweights. Vivendi Universal, the record conglomerate, has struck a deal to let Mr. Fanning's company add the music corporation's online catalog of songs to Snocap's database. 
 But if the industry has managed to set aside any differences it had with Mr. Fanning, it still faces troublesome questions. 
 Foremost among them is that for the plan to work, a peer-to-peer network still must decide to adopt Snocap's technology. And then, as it reduces the amount of free music available, the network must find a way to attract paying music fans.
 ''If what they're looking for is free, then they're not likely to participate,'' said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''There's going to have to be some sort of uniqueness to a system like this that goes beyond it being a peer-to-peer system.''
 The existing networks have attracted millions of fans hungry for free music and movies, and their parent companies have generated revenue by showering users with advertisements. Snocap executives, who declined to comment for this article, argue that the network operators are, in the end, entrepreneurs who will be persuaded that changing to a Snocap-driven business is a wiser path to profit. 
 For the moment, however, there appears little chance that the most popular file-sharing networks, like Kazaa, will embrace the software, which means the industry may have to rely on an upstart network with few customers. One network in development, Mashboxx, has been in discussions to plug Snocap's software into its system, according to people in the music industry involved in the talks. 
 But even if licensed file-sharing fails commercially, music executives are privately delighting in the public-relations value of working with their onetime legal nemesis. 
 ''We sort of liked the irony of the whole thing,'' said one executive, recalling an early meeting with Mr. Fanning, who declined to comment for this article. 
 Perhaps more important, the rollout of Snocap may figure in the industry's bid to reverse a series of losses in court, where the major labels have been seeking verdicts to hold the companies behind the Grokster and Morpheus networks liable for copyright violations.
 The networks have long argued -- and a federal appeals court has agreed -- that they cannot monitor their users. But the music companies may argue that Snocap proves that it is possible to track and block the transmission of unauthorized content.
 ''I just view this as an exercise in R.I.A.A. propaganda,'' said Fred Von Lohmann, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, referring to the Recording Industry Association of America. Mr. Von Lohmann represents StreamCast Networks, the company that releases Morpheus software. ''If you care about copyright,'' he added, ''why would you want to drive people to more offshore, encrypted, anonymous kinds of networks? That's all this would accomplish.'' 
 There is no dearth of examples of how technological shifts have left the recording industry unsure of where to turn. In 1998, the major music corporations sued (unsuccessfully) to block the release of Diamond Multimedia's portable MP3 player, saying it ''promotes the illicit use'' of digital music files.
 Six years later, the industry is gleefully promoting Apple Computer's iPods, even placing them in music videos. The rock band U2, in a deal brokered by its record label, endorsed a line of iPods. 
 The industry's turnabout with Mr. Fanning is not much different. Months after Napster Inc., which he helped found, emerged in 1999, the major labels sued it for copyright infringement. 
 Napster tried to filter out some unauthorized songs using an acoustic ''fingerprinting'' technology not unlike the sort that Snocap relies on -- a technique that tracks the sonic characteristics of music files. 
 But a judge's ruling forced the network out of service in mid-2001. Mr. Fanning became a consultant for Roxio, which bought Napster's famous name at a bankruptcy auction and transformed it into a subscription music service. 
 When Mr. Fanning began making the rounds of the major labels to talk up his newest creation in the middle of last year, he was greeted with skepticism in some quarters. But several executives said the lasting power of Mr. Fanning's original file-sharing concepts intrigued them enough to listen to his latest idea. 
 ''This is a world of very short memories,'' one music executive said. ''If you held grudges you wouldn't last two minutes in this industry.'' 
 Mr. Fanning ''was popularly thought of as a dragon slayer, when in reality that wasn't his intention'' with Napster, said Larry Kenswil, president of Universal Music's eLabs division. ''He's taken that experience, taken a step back and thought of a way that everyone can benefit.'' 
 Mr. Fanning also had the advantage of coming in with better connections than the ones he had as a Northeastern University dropout surrounded by Silicon Valley venture capitalists in the dot-com boom. Snocap has been receiving advice from Hilary Rosen, the longtime chief executive of the R.I.A.A. who is a political commentator and strategist.
 Said David Munns, vice chairman of the music giant EMI Group, ''It's never too late to go straight.''

HEADLINE: Will New Mayor Sweep Away Vice? You Could Bet on It

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Jorge Hank Rhon gambling tycoon, racetrack operator, son of a legendary politician and collector of exotic animals -- took office this week as mayor, another sign of the resurgence of Mexico's once all-powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party.
 Mr. Hank is carrying more baggage than most politicians. Over the past 15 years, his political enemies and United States law enforcement officials have suspected him of links to the killings of journalists, laundering money for drug cartels and smuggling wild animals, among other deeds of questionable virtue. 
 Yet most accusations have never been proved, and they did not seem to bother his supporters. After all, Tijuana has long been a bastion of vice, where the underworld economy is fueled by gambling, drugs, prostitution and the smuggling of migrants across the border to San Diego. 
 A majority of the good citizens of Tijuana seemed so fed up with the previous mayor that they were willing to overlook Mr. Hank's apparent shortcomings after he campaigned as the man who, of all things, would clean up the streets. 
 Tijuana's sordid side seems to many here to have grown unbearable. Thousands of small-time drug dealers have set up shop, creating legions of addicts who commit petty crimes. Prostitutes in leather miniskirts line the streets even at midday around the north end of town, a stone's throw from a rusting wall that separates Mexico from the promised land of the United States. 
 Dozens of strip clubs have sprung up alongside the curio shops and tequila bars that attract tourists. Killings have become more and more common, most linked to drugs. 
 For some voters, Mr. Hank's vices were a virtue. The fortune he amassed as the owner of gambling parlors, some said, meant he was less apt to take bribes than other politicians. Others said that even if he had done business with drug dealers, as some United States law enforcement officials assert, it did not necessarily disqualify him from being a mayor for the people. 
 ''You could say that about all Tijuana,'' said Jose Perez, a 58-year-old carpenter who said he voted for Mr. Hank. ''He's going to be an exemplary mayor, because he doesn't want money. He wants power.''
 Another supporter, Raul Perez, a 31-year-old hawker of souvenirs, said, ''I don't know if he's guilty or not, but I think he can do a better job than the last mayor.''
 Mr. Hank, who declined a request to be interviewed, has denied any involvement in criminal deeds, maintaining he is the victim of vicious rumors. Every investigation has cleared him of wrongdoing, he told reporters during the campaign. ''They never, never had anything,'' he said. ''Never. It was pure, as the Americans say, gossip.'' 
 He has said it is true that two of his bodyguards shot and killed an investigative journalist back in 1988, but the authorities never proved he had any knowledge of it. More recently, federal investigators identified him as a suspect in the killing of another journalist in June, but later dropped that line of investigation. 
 Other scandals seem to swirl around Mr. Hank like mosquitoes. His chauffeur was arrested in November 1995 while trying to smuggle 126 pounds of cocaine across the border, according to court records. United States law enforcement authorities have also implicated his family's shipping company, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, in several big drug smuggling cases, though Mr. Hank has never been charged. 
 ''He has never been indicted because he insulates himself very much like a traditional mafia don,'' said one former United States law enforcement official who is knowledgeable about drug investigations on the border over the last decade. 
 The Mexican Congress investigated Mr. Hank after he somehow managed to obtain from the government a 25-year extension on his franchise to operate the Agua Caliente racetrack before the last franchise had expired. Lawmakers later found irregularities in the awarding of the extension and pronounced it patently illegal. He still has the franchise.
 Some of Mr. Hank's political enemies joke that his victory is analogous to having John Gotti, the former head of the Gambino crime family, become mayor of New York. 
 Mr. Hank, who is 51 and the father of 18 children, is the second son of Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a longtime stalwart in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, who was mayor of Mexico City and governor of the State of Mexico. 
 Mr. Hank has said his father taught him the importance of party loyalty. Nineteen years ago, Mr. Hank moved to Tijuana, where his proclivity for the high life led him into the gambling business. In addition to the racetrack, where they run only dogs these days, he owns dozens of off-track betting parlors.
 Mr. Hank ran a bread and circuses campaign. He avoided taking part in many debates with his main opponent, Jorge Ramos, of the National Action Party. Instead he offered lavish concerts for people at the racetrack, with free beer and well-known musicians. His opponents accused him of breaking campaign spending limits, but a special electoral court certified the election in any case.
 ''There has been a resurgence of the old PRI, the party of cunning tricks and electoral traps,'' said Mr. Ramos, who lost the Aug. 1 election by two percentage points. ''What happened here in Tijuana could be a reflection of the kind of PRI, the old PRI, we are going to see in 2006. Far from changing, they've gone backward.'' 
 The concerts were an extension of Mr. Hank's usual largess. He is known as a philanthropist who gives money to charities and hospitals. He also stages parties at the racetrack for mothers on Mother's Day and lets children tour his private zoo, which includes bears, a snow leopard, camels and gazelles.
 Nor did Mr. Hank, who likes to present himself as a simple man of peasant values, spare any expense on his swearing-in this week, spending more than $200,000. The event was more like a carnival than a solemn transfer of power. There were mariachi singers, amusement park rides, cotton candy and vendors of all manner of food and drink. 
 ''I want to see everyone happy,'' Mr. Hank told the cheering crowd of supporters after taking the oath. ''I want to see everyone decent. I want to see everyone with a conscience, like all Mexicans.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Said to Be Scrutinizing Wall St. Data-Sharing

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about half a dozen Wall Street firms to see whether information is being shared improperly, people who have been briefed on the investigation said yesterday. Investigators want to know if the information is being used to curry favor with clients or is being given to the firm's own trading desk. 
 Information requests were sent out two weeks ago, these people said, seeking details on how Wall Street's biggest trading firms manage an inherent conflict in a full-service securities company: how traders, who spend the day talking with both buyers and sellers of stocks and bonds, protect that information from other clients who could benefit from such information or prevent it from leaking to the firm's proprietary traders who use the firm's capital to make bets on the market. 
 S.E.C. examiners have sent letters to firms asking them to explain what controls they have to prevent the misuse of information, especially with respect to the records for the firm's own trading, also called the ''back book.'' 
 More specifically, regulators appear to want to know how trading is supervised, what controls are in place to protect information and how customer trading and proprietary trading are separated. Under a change to the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act, adopted in the wake of the insider trading scandals of the 1980's, firms were required to have policies in place to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. 
 ''The S.E.C. is now demanding that proprietary traders operate without foreknowledge of order flow. I assume they are seeking a Chinese wall between proprietary traders and third party traders similar to the Chinese wall between research departments and investment banking,'' said Richard X. Bove, a securities analyst at Punk Ziegel. 
 It is not clear which firms were sent letters. An S.E.C. official declined to comment. 
 Proprietary trading has been an increasing source of the profit as investment banking has ceased being the primary money maker. 
 According to estimates prepared by Guy Moszcowski, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch, investment banking in 1999 generated 24 percent of the profit at five firms, while principal transactions (trading, both for customers and for proprietary accounts) generated 38 percent. By 2003, investment banking had fallen to 15 percent of total revenue while principal transactions had leapt to 47 percent. 
 The five firms were Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley, minus its credit card business; Bear Stearns & Company; Goldman Sachs; and Lehman Brothers. 
 More specifically, announced mergers and acquisitions in the United States, one of the most profitable areas in periods of economic growth are down 74 percent from 2000 and 2002, Thomson Financial reported. 
 The investigation stems from a top-down conflict review mandated by the S.E.C. earlier this year. As a result of that request, executives on Wall Street went to Washington over the summer to explain the many conflicts inherent in Wall Street's business. Among them are how market makers -- traders who buy and sell stock in an effort to maintain orderly markets who spend the day brokering information -- manage it from competing clients and information-hungry proprietary traders.
 While proprietary trading has been a driver with Wall Street profit, it has also hurt a few firms. J.P. Morgan announced its fixed-income trading profit plunged 44 percent, a figure management attributed to a drop in client trading as well as worse results in its proprietary trading portfolio. Morgan Stanley announced tough third-quarter results, mainly from a wrong bet on interest rates which affected its trading results. 
 Traders expect regulators to take a look at bond trading desks where there are fewer clear separations between customer accounts and a firm's own trading.

HEADLINE: Hot Year for Mexican Stocks; Outlook Still Upbeat

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Mexico's stock market has had a solid run-up this year, far exceeding forecasts.
 Though stocks fell on Thursday, the Bolsa index remains 38 percent ahead this year in dollar terms, compared with an increase of less than 1.3 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Investors anticipate year-end results to remain strong after third-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, and economic growth is on track to reach 4 percent this year.
 Global investors are busy buying in emerging markets, including Mexico, where there are higher returns than in the United States. But investors also appear to be anticipating the entry of a new player in Mexico's stock market next year: beginning in January, the country's private pension funds -- known as Afores -- will be allowed to invest in equities and foreign assets. 
 ''There are some people out there who think that the entry of the Afores will be a positive for the market,'' said Mario Epelbaum, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. ''They have been buying with the expectation of this entry.'' 
 The funds, which will manage some $43 billion by year-end, are the largest savings pool in Mexico.
 Set up when the main state pension system was privatized in 1997, they manage individual accounts that are the only pension most workers will receive. The funds' investments have been confined by regulators almost exclusively to Mexican government bonds. 
 Though the limits are cracking open, regulators are moving cautiously. The Afores will be allowed to invest a maximum of 15 percent of assets under management in the Mexican stock market; foreign investments are limited to 20 percent. 
 Nor can they buy Mexican stocks freely. Instead, they must structure complex financial instruments called principal-protected notes to ensure that workers do not lose their investment. These notes back the equity purchase with anticipated returns on bonds. 
 While expectations that the entrance of the Afores next year will bolster the market seem to be galvanizing investors, analysts differ on how great an effect their entry will have. 
 Carlos Peyrelongue, a Merrill Lynch analyst in Mexico City, says that the Afores will invest $1 billion to $2 billion in the Mexican equity market next year, mostly in the first quarter. Because the Mexican Bolsa's size and trading volume are relatively small, such an amount could drive the market index higher. 
 In a recent report he wrote that close to half the assets the Afores invest in Mexican equities will go to the four largest companies in the index: the telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico; Latin America's largest wireless company, America Movil; Wal-Mart de Mexico; and Cemex, one of the world's largest cement companies. Together, they account for 47 percent of the index. 
 ''It's attractive for the Afores,'' he said. ''They have to diversify.'' 
 But other analysts are more skeptical that the Afores investment will have much impact. 
 Francisco Rivero, the head of Mexican research for Santander Investment here, said the complex derivative structure of the investments would limit equity investments.
 ''Just because the Afores management can buy equities doesn't mean they will do it,'' he said. ''I believe there is a risk that people will be disappointed in the end, and the effect might not be as big as people think today.''
 Mr. Epelbaum at Morgan Stanley said that the Afores might prefer to diversify first by buying foreign assets rather than investing in the Mexican stock market. He estimates that at most $1.4 billion could flow into the market in 2005 from these funds, but says he expects the entry will be gradual and so will not have a big effect on prices. 
 Flows from the United States -- particularly from hedge funds, which often are comfortable with the kind of volatility associated with emerging markets -- will be more important to the Mexican market, he said. ''With expectations of further dollar weakening,'' Mr. Epelbaum said, ''international assets are becoming much more interesting to the United States investor base.''

HEADLINE: Central Bank Remains Silent as the Euro Rises

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Will the European Central Bank intervene in the world's currency markets to put a lid on the euro?
 It has become a tantalizing prospect for many Europeans, who are nervous about the economic impact of their rapidly rising currency and frustrated by Europe's seeming inability to do anything about it.
 Rumors that the bank might enter the market surfaced this week after a senior official in the Japanese finance ministry, Hiroshi Watanabe, was quoted as saying Japan and Europe could take ''harmonized action'' to temper the appreciation of their currencies against the dollar.
 Central banks typically intervene by using their reserves to buy or sell currencies in huge amounts to influence their value. The pressure to mount such a rescue operation has grown, as the euro rises to new heights against the dollar, denting Europe's exports in the United States. 
 If the European Central Bank is planning an operation, however, it is not about to advertise it. Beyond saying that interventions are a useful weapon, the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, while speaking at a news conference Thursday, declined to comment on the possibility of a such a move.
 ''Verbal discipline, at the present time, is really of the essence,'' Mr. Trichet said. 
 He also stuck to previous statements about the rise of the euro against the dollar, saying that rapid shifts in exchange rates were ''not welcome.'' The euro reached another record of $1.3383 on Thursday, its fifth of the week, before falling back in trading in New York.
 Against this volatile backdrop, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent. Mr. Trichet noted that the governing council had considered raising rates, but opted to stand pat because the euro, and rising oil prices, are putting a crimp in Europe's growth.
 The bank lowered its 2005 growth forecast for the 12-nation euro zone to 1.9 percent, from 2.3 percent. It raised its inflation forecast to 2 percent, from 1.8 percent, which he said warranted vigilance.
 Mr. Trichet's extreme caution, analysts say, underscores Europe's limited options. The rise of the euro is not a home-grown phenomenon, but a result of the dollar's decline. That trend is not likely to reverse, as long as the Bush administration is ready to tolerate a weaker currency.
 Recent statements by the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, have been treated as a green light for speculators to bet against the dollar.
 Intervening in the face of such market forces would be a highly risky undertaking, analysts say. While Europe might find an ally in the Bank of Japan, it would almost certainly not have the support of the Federal Reserve, which would reduce the effectiveness of the action.
 Mounting an intervention that failed would tarnish the credibility of the European Central Bank, which has won praise for its steady stewardship of the euro, but is still a fledgling institution.
 ''They are concerned about getting in front of this freight train, which is dollar depreciation, and not being run over by it,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.
 The Fed and the European Central Bank intervened successfully in 2000 to stem the decline of the euro, which had fallen to 82 cents against the dollar. But by then, the currency was nearing the end of its downward cycle. Many analysts say the dollar could slide another 20 percent against the euro, given the ballooning trade deficit in the United States.
 ''It's like pushing a car that's at the top of the hill, and letting it roll down the hill,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''If the car is not at the top of the hill, and you give it a push, it may roll back on you.''
 Mr. Trichet, a Frenchman who speaks fluent but formal English, has tried to talk down the euro -- a practice known as verbal intervention -- without much success. On several occasions, he described the swings in exchange rates as ''brutal,'' which left traders scratching their heads.
 Did he mean brutal, as in ruthless or cruel? Or was he using the word in its French context, in which it can also mean sudden or unexpected? Whatever the case, the euro kept rising, and Mr. Trichet retreated to the phrase ''not welcome,'' which is less open to interpretation.
 Even in his caution, however, Mr. Trichet has invited conflicting interpretations. Some currency traders said intervention was now less likely, while others said it remained a possibility.
 Much will depend on how far the euro goes.
 ''$1.35, here we come,'' said Michael Schubert, a currency analyst at Commerzbank. ''But at $1.40, it becomes a political hot potato, and the Europeans, the Americans and the Asians have to huddle and come up with a solution.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Technology Is a Promise Unfinanced

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
From the president on down, the Bush administration has been a proponent of modernizing the nation's creaky health care system with information technology.
 But while the administration's words of support for a high-technology future for health care have been plentiful, the dollars, it seems, are scarce.
 The huge federal spending bill recently approved by Congress eliminated a seemingly modest $50 million request for the office of Dr. David J. Brailer, who was appointed the national health information technology coordinator in May. 
 Dr. Brailer acknowledged his disappointment in an interview yesterday. ''The money is important,'' he said. ''This was a bad bounce, and it shows how big our education challenge is.''
 One critic of the action was less guarded in his comments. ''Congress, in its infinite wisdom, zeroed-out David Brailer's office,'' said Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, who is the founder of the Center for Health Transformation, a health policy group. ''They couldn't find $50 million to signal that David Brailer has a real job and what he's doing is important. Frankly, I think it's a disgrace.''
 The Bush administration, Mr. Gingrich said, bore most of the responsibility. ''No one in the White House or in the senior staff of the Department of Health and Human Services fought for this,'' he said.
 Most of the investment for electronic health records and networks for sharing information will now have to come from private industry, probably billions of dollars over the next several years.
 The $50 million requested for Dr. Brailer's office was to have been used to provide seed money for health information demonstration projects that would encourage the industry to agree on technology standards, hasten investment by private companies and accelerate the adoption of modern information technology by doctors and hospitals.
 Bringing patient records and prescriptions out of an era of ink and paper into the computer age, health experts agree, would make health care more efficient and reduce medical errors, saving lives and dollars.
 President Bush repeatedly sounded that theme this year, starting with his State of the Union address. ''By computerizing health records,'' he said, ''we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs and improve care.''
 In a debate with Senator John Kerry in October, Mr. Bush said that much of the high and rising cost of health care resulted from hospitals, clinics and doctors' not using ''any information technology.'' Health care, he asserted, was trapped in the past, the ''equivalent of buggy-and-horse days, compared with other industries here in America.''
 ''We've got to introduce high technology into health care,'' the president added. ''We're beginning to do it.''
 The Department of Health and Human Services played host in July to a three-day conference in Washington to promote investment in health information technology. ''Electronic health information will provide a quantum leap in patient power, doctor power and effective health care,'' Tommy G. Thompson, the health secretary, said.
 But the appropriations setback for the national health information technology office raises questions about the administration's commitment. 
 Dr. Brailer, a physician and economist who joined the administration in May, said that he was not an expert in the ways of Washington and was not involved in the budget negotiations. ''But I have absolute confidence that the president is totally behind what we are doing,'' he said, ''and it is far more than a rhetorical commitment. And I've been given assurances that the momentum we've built up will not be lost.''
 Dr. Brailer, who reports to Secretary Thompson, will not lose his job. His principal role is to coordinate and encourage the efforts of government and the health care industry to adopt digital records that share standards.
 The budget of the Department of Health and Human Services is more than $500 billion a year. Most of that is pledged to federal obligations like Medicare, but the department does have more than $60 billion in discretionary funds. So it is possible that money could find its way into Dr. Brailer's office to finance some of its favored projects.
 Industry executives, meanwhile, said the decision in Congress was disappointing, but probably not a serious blow or a reason yet for companies to rethink their plans to invest in health care information technology. 
 ''This comes after real progress this year under David Brailer,'' said Michael Raymer, a senior vice president of IDX Systems, a maker of health information technology software. ''And after all, the $50 million would have been mostly a symbolic down payment.''
 Jon Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Siemens Health Services, a supplier of information technology for health companies, said: ''The Bush administration showed real leadership with the appointment of David Brailer, but Congress and the administration missed an opportunity to continue its leadership by funding his office. This is not a show stopper, though.''
 Dr. Brailer's $50 million request lost out in a year of concern about the widening federal budget deficit and Bush administration priorities like tax cuts and the Iraq war. And further funds for the Department of Health and Human Services were going to be difficult to justify in place of the hundreds of smaller local projects that were earmarked for special attention by senators and representatives.
 ''It looks like classic micropolitics,'' said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. ''If you don't have someone at the table, defending your request in the final negotiations, you lose. Brailer didn't have somebody at the table.''

HEADLINE: Dealing Bloomberg a Setback, Senate Balks at U.N. Project

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
The Republicans who control the State Senate dealt a rebuke to a fellow Republican, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on Thursday, scuttling legislation he had long championed to allow the United Nations to move forward with a planned renovation and expansion of its headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan.
 Passage of a bill to let the United Nations expansion project go forward had been high on the mayor's list of priorities in Albany. But anti-United Nations sentiment among Senate Republicans, who cited everything from diplomats who do not pay their parking tickets to what they called its anti-Israel and anti-American stances, has stopped the proposal for now. 
 Mayor Bloomberg has been a strong backer of the United Nations and its expansion efforts. He appointed his sister, Marjorie Tiven, as commissioner for the United Nations Consular Corps and Protocol, the principal liaison between the diplomatic community and the city. And the mayor speaks with pride of his opportunity to address the General Assembly. 
 But as they returned for a special legislative session next week, the Senate Republicans questioned how they could authorize $600 million in bonds to pay for the project, particularly since it would be backed by fees from United Nations member nations who reportedly owe more than $195 million in fines from violations of city parking laws.
 ''How can we trust the U.N. nations to pay the fees to pay off this debt when they don't even pay their parking fines?'' said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's Republican majority leader. 
 Other Senate Republicans expressed anger at the United Nations over charges that Saddam Hussein had abused its food-for-oil program.
 In announcing the Senate's intentions, Mr. Bruno left open the possibility that the legislation might be reconsidered once concerns are addressed.
 Gov. George E. Pataki has said he will probably sign the bill if it is passed.
 Andrew M. Alper, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the United Nations is a valuable asset that ''makes a major contribution to New York City's reputation as an international city.'' He said that ''the Bloomberg administration is committed to working with the U.N. and the surrounding community to develop an acceptable renovation plan.''
 The move was a blow to Mr. Bloomberg in Albany, and could reflect a changed atmosphere in the Senate. The number of Republican senators from New York City was reduced on Election Day to four members, from six, so there are two fewer Republicans from the city whom Mr. Bloomberg can lobby to push items on his state agenda.

HEADLINE: A False Start on Social Security

 BODY:
Even before the debate has truly begun over the centerpiece of President Bush's second-term domestic agenda -- creating private retirement accounts within Social Security -- White House and Congressional budget leaders have been floating the idea that it won't require a major increase in the federal budget deficit. This is dangerously misguided. Unwilling to raise taxes, Congress and the administration will have to borrow well over $1 trillion to turn the president's wish into reality. 
 For a country that already needs to borrow $2 billion a day just to stay afloat, that gargantuan price tag for privatization is one reason it's a bad idea. It is far from the only reason, and arguably not even the main one. Yesterday, for instance, the president's top economist said privatization would very likely lead to major benefit cuts, which could be devastating for people who lost money in their private accounts. For now, however, the cost issue is moving to center stage in Washington. It is imperative to refute the suggestion that private accounts would somehow, magically, pay for themselves. 
 The issue is how to pay full benefits to people at or near retirement if Social Security money starts going into private accounts. Since current wage earners cover the benefits for current retirees, every dollar workers invest elsewhere has to be replaced. This is the so-called transition cost, estimated at $1 trillion to $5 trillion. 
 To convince the public that those costs won't matter, privatization advocates are concocting a ruse something like this: Borrow, say, $2 trillion today to establish private accounts, with the expectation that they'll generate such tremendous personal savings that the government will be able to cut future Social Security benefits by an even larger amount and use the savings to erase the debt, plus interest, some 40 years down the line. By this sleight of hand, the money borrowed is not new debt, and there's no need to count it toward the deficit. 
 Remember how Enron used off-the-books maneuvers to pretend it had no debt? Remember how well that worked out?
 For privatization advocates who have been stumped by how to pay for the transition to private accounts, this ploy has significant political advantages: creating the illusion that Social Security privatization entails no cost would bolster the case for privatization for an unwitting public. It would also give political cover to legislators and other policy makers who want to be on the president's team but may otherwise balk at the huge deficits that come with playing along. 
 What accounting gimmickry won't do -- and this is crucial -- is fool America's lenders, like the central banks of China and Japan, and other participants in the financial markets. Whether it's recorded on the nation's books or not, ever more government borrowing will, sooner or later, reduce lenders' appetite for Treasury debt, forcing up interest rates as the government scrambles to attract the money it needs. 
 This is not a distant and theoretical danger. Last month, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, flatly stated that America's lenders would eventually tire of financing our deficits. Underscoring his comments, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a four-month high this week, as the ever-weaker dollar continued to lure investors away from dollar-based debt.
 The immense additional borrowing envisaged by privatization advocates would accelerate and intensify these disturbing trends, precisely the opposite of what the government should be doing. Trying to hide the borrowing would create the impression -- an accurate one, as it turns out -- that our government is fiscally irresponsible. The global financial community would respond by upping the pressure because lenders demand tougher terms from feckless borrowers. 
 Privatization advocates will tell you that the cost of creating private accounts today must be compared with the cost of doing nothing to reform Social Security. This is specious. First, no reasonable person is suggesting that nothing be done. The proper comparison is between a plan to borrow trillions and a plan to phase in slowly a modest package of tax increases and benefit cuts that would preserve the current system's essential protections without borrowing or dubious accounting.
 Second, borrowing to finance the transition to private accounts could very well cost more than doing nothing. If private accounts didn't perform as well as their proponents hope -- and the proponents are by and large a very optimistic bunch -- the government might need to take on even more debt decades hence to rescue the old people who ended up without adequate retirement income.
 Solid accounting must underlie Social Security reform. Once that's in place, let the debate begin.

HEADLINE: From Bush Aide, Warning on Social Security

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Calling the current system of Social Security benefits unsustainable, a top economic adviser to President Bush on Thursday strongly implied that any overhaul of the system would have to include major cuts in guaranteed benefits for future retirees.
 ''Let me state clearly that there are no free lunches here,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, at a conference on tax policy here.
 ''The benefits now scheduled for future generations under current law are not sustainable given the projected path of payroll tax revenue,'' he added. ''They are empty promises.'' 
 Mr. Mankiw's remarks suggested that President Bush's plan to let people put some of their Social Security taxes into ''personal savings accounts'' would have to be accompanied by changes in the current system of benefits. 
 Throughout the presidential campaign and in remarks after he was re-elected, Mr. Bush focused almost exclusively on these accounts as a crucial way to shore up Social Security. Most experts have said that the accounts must be accompanied by other belt-tightening measures. When asked about cuts in future benefits, Mr. Bush, however, has said only that any overhaul should make no changes in the benefits for people in retirement or near retirement. The president has said that overhauling the Social Security system would involve ''costs,'' but so far he has not indicated what those might be. 
 In his speech, Mr. Mankiw flatly rejected raising taxes as a means of saving the federal retirement system, which government actuaries say is on track to become insolvent by 2042 if no changes are made to the current law. Instead, he took particular aim at a specific feature of current law under which retirement benefits are linked to the rise in wages rather than the rise in consumer prices.
 ''Each generation of retirees receives higher real benefits than the generation before it,'' Mr. Mankiw said. Because wages typically climb faster than inflation, he said, an average worker retiring in 2050 would get benefits that are 40 percent higher, after inflation, than a comparable worker who retires this year. 
 Mr. Mankiw emphasized that Mr. Bush has yet to decide on a specific proposal for fixing Social Security, except that it would have to include personal accounts and that it would not include raising taxes. But the issue he highlighted is at the center of a major debate within the administration and among Congressional Republicans.
 Policy analysts say changing the way benefits are calculated could save trillions of dollars in decades to come. But it would imply significant reductions from the benefits promised under today's laws. The idea behind personal accounts is that workers, by making investments in stocks and bonds, could more than make up the difference with extra earnings. 
 In what seemed an effort to anticipate complaints that a new system would reduce future benefits, Mr. Mankiw warned that the benefits promised under current law are fictitious because they cannot be afforded.
 ''Be wary of comparisons between a new, reformed Social Security system and current law,'' Mr. Mankiw said. ''Unless a listener is discerning, empty promises will always have a superficial appeal.''
 Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Bush had not decided on a specific plan and refused to comment on any need for reductions in future benefits.
 ''The president is committed to strengthening Social Security for younger workers so they don't face the massive tax increases or benefit reductions that are certain with inaction,'' Ms. Buchan said. 
 The specific issue that Mr. Mankiw highlighted on Thursday, though seemingly obscure, involves the level at which a person's initial benefit is set at the time he or she retires. Under the current formula, which was established by Congress in 1978, the annual benefit is pegged to increases in average wages while the person was working.
 The idea was to keep retirement incomes in line with overall wages from generation to generation, and analysts said the formula was far more generous than simply pegging benefits to inflation.
 Kent Smetters, a former Treasury official under President Bush who is now an associate professor at the Wharton School of Business, said linking benefits to inflation would in itself save trillions of dollars. But Professor Smetters said the idea was not as tame as it sounded. Although retirement incomes would not be eroded by inflation, the guaranteed benefits of retired people would be lower, and lower than average incomes, as time went on.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Fall Tests Nerve of Asia's Central Bankers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE and KEITH BRADSHER; James Brooke reported from Tokyo for this article and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
As Americans embark on another season of debt-supported holiday spending, they might want to give thanks that Masatsugu Asakawa is still buying in America, too.
 Mr. Asakawa, 46, is the top official at the Finance Ministry here responsible for managing the largest portfolio of United States government securities in the world, worth a staggering $720 billion. As the dollar has slumped this fall, many investors have started to worry that Mr. Asakawa and his counterparts elsewhere in Asia will be tempted to pare their holdings, perhaps causing the currency to plunge much further and setting off a round of interest rate increases in the United States that could send the global economy into a tailspin.
 But Mr. Asakawa, at least for now, says that he intends to keep right on adding American holdings to Tokyo's portfolio. 
 ''We've heard the rumors in the last few days that the Chinese guys, the Indian guys, the South African guys are diverting from dollars,'' Mr. Asakawa said. ''We have no plan at all to divert from our dollar-denominated assets.''
 Still, Mr. Asakawa admits that he has not been sleeping so well lately.
 ''This thing wakes me up; it is terrible,'' Mr. Asakawa said in excellent American-accented English -- he once studied at Princeton -- as he toyed with a blue plastic portable currency monitor. After hours, the wireless device beeps by his bedside whenever the dollar strays beyond a set range. ''Fortunately,'' he said, ''my wife is very understanding.''
 Mr. Asakawa has been waking up a lot more often because the long-running symbiotic relationship between Asia and the United States has started to fray. 
 For years, manufacturers in Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan have been selling far more to Americans than Asians have been buying from the United States. As a result, Asians have accumulated huge quantities of foreign exchange, which they have used mostly to buy American government securities.
 By doing so, they helped keep interest rates in the United States low and the dollar relatively strong. That allowed Americans to borrow cheaply and fill their shopping bags with yet another load of well-priced goods imported from Asia. Low interest rates also enabled Washington to readily finance the federal government's gaping budget deficit.
 But as borrowing by the United States from abroad has soared this year to $620 billion, a record 5.7 percent of overall economic activity, many foreigners have become reluctant to keep accumulating dollars at the same pace. That has left officials like Mr. Asakawa and others at central banks elsewhere in Asia holding America's purse strings.
 Japan's total stockpile of foreign currency, at $817 billion, is still the largest in the world, but China, which now owns about $600 billion, is catching up fast.
 Among countries that are accumulating dollars -- especially China -- grumbling is on the rise that Washington should do more to protect the value of their investments by cutting the budget deficit and adopting other policies to slow or reverse the dollar's decline.
 ''Shouldn't the relevant authorities be doing something about this?'' asked Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China at a conference in Laos last Sunday.
 In Beijing these days, one of the fastest-growing fortunes the world has ever seen is managed by fewer than two dozen traders, chosen for showing mathematical brilliance at China's top universities.
 Generally lacking any financial experience outside China, they sit at trading stations around a gold stand bearing a jeweled globe, two feet in diameter and with seas of lapis lazuli, in a rented room on the fourth floor of an insurance building. 
 Most of the money in China's central bank coffers has accumulated in the last four years, the product of an investment torrent washing over China and the ever-expanding flood of goods pouring out of Chinese factories.
 As in Japan and China, small groups of civil servants in Taiwan and South Korea are struggling to invest sizable foreign currency reserves of $235 billion and $193 billion, respectively. For years, all four countries have held the bulk of their reserves in the Treasury bills, notes, and bonds that finance the federal budget deficit, leaving American consumers and companies free to spend more on other things and invest their spare cash in more promising ventures. 
 Together, these Asian institutions are responsible for holding roughly 40 percent of the American government's public debt. 
 In contrast to Japan, China's money managers, while selling little of their existing Treasury holding, have not been buying much more. China's foreign currency reserves rose by $111.3 billion in the first three quarters of the year, according to official Chinese data. But its Treasury holdings, American filings show, climbed by only $16.4 billion.
 Instead, officials at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in Beijing have been seeking higher yields by plowing billions of dollars a month into bonds backed by mortgages on houses across the United States, according to bankers who help Beijing manage the money. By helping keep mortgage rates from rising, China has come to play an enormous and little-noticed role in sustaining the American housing boom. 
 The proportion of China's hoard in Treasury securities has dropped to about 35 percent, they say, compared with the roughly 90 percent of Japan's foreign currency reserves still parked in Treasury securities.
 Some bankers and economists say that dollar-denominated securities over all represent a slowly declining share of China's recent purchases. But no figures are available on how quickly Beijing may be shifting to other currency holdings, so its effect on the underlying demand for dollars is unclear.
 Still, the American reliance on foreign money and the investment decisions of bankers halfway around the world underline a serious risk for the economy: What would happen if this deep investment pool was used to fill coffers elsewhere in the world, perhaps in Europe or in Asia itself?
 With the dollar trading in recent days around five-year lows against the Japanese yen, Russia's central bank unnerved currency markets last week by revealing that it was considering diversifying from dollars to euros. 
 A Chinese central banker, Yo Yongding, also caused a brief dive for the dollar on Nov. 26 by making remarks that were initially translated as a statement that Chinese dollar holdings were dropping. The banker later issued a statement that he had noted only that the value of Chinese-held Treasuries had dropped with the falling value of the dollar.
 For all the interest in the other players, currency markets remain focused on Japan, which has aggressively bought dollars, doubling its investment in Treasuries over the last two years. During a 15-month period that ended in March, the Japanese government bought $340 billion of dollar-denominated securities with its yen. The buying spree so stunned speculators that Japan has not had to intervene in the markets since. 
 But now with Japan's huge stake in the dollar losing value, the question is, What will Tokyo do next?
 The problem for Japan is that it is in so deep that to a large degree it is chained to its American debtor.
 ''Imagine that tomorrow people hear, 'Hey, Japan has decided to divert from U.S. dollars to euros,''' Mr. Asakawa said. ''That would create a hugely undesirable impact on the U.S. Treasury market, and we have no intention at all to make an unfortunate impact on the U.S. Treasury market.''
 Any selling move by Japan would move the entire market -- and cut further into the value of Japan's own portfolio. 
 Richard Koo, chief economist for the Nomura Research Institute, is one of many financial soothsayers in Tokyo who work to divine the thinking behind the shabby door on the fourth floor of the gray pre-World War II Finance Ministry building marked Director of Foreign Exchange Markets.
 As he sees it, anything Japan might do to slow its dollar purchases would only create a self-inflicted wound. ''If they could move it all out of dollars in one day, I am sure they would do it in an instant,'' Mr. Koo said. ''But if they move 10 percent, and the dollar goes down 20 percent, they are stuck with 90 percent of the portfolio worth 20 percent less.''
 Others in Japan are not happy about how much the dollar has already weakened. Toyota, Japan's largest company and its biggest exporter, complains that for every 1-yen gain against the dollar, the company's annual profit falls by 20 billion yen, currently $195 million. With Japan's economic recovery still lagging, its dollar buying serves to help keep its exports more competitive.
 This week, Japanese officials have been talking up the dollar and leaving the door open to a resumption of specific dollar-strengthening moves. On Wednesday, Mr. Asakawa's boss, Hiroshi Watanabe, vice minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry, responded to a question at a news conference about intervention saying, ''There is nothing to limit our actions; there are no such concerns.'' 
 Japan and China hold too much American debt to be able to diversify discreetly. Instead, they are urging the Bush administration, in public and private, to get the American budget into better balance and to improve American saving rates.
 ''What China and Japan are trying to do is say, 'Please get back on track with fiscal reform,''' said Robert A. Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Japan. 
 China, more than many countries, treats its foreign currency reserves as not just a way to control the value of its currency in international markets but also as a form of national savings. That is one reason its traders are encouraged to take greater risks in search of higher returns.
 China used $45 billion from its stash to bail out the state-owned Bank of China and the China Construction Bank last winter. People close to Chinese policy makers predict that another $50 billion to $60 billion will be used this winter to bail out the much larger Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, also state-owned, and possibly a smaller sum to help the Agricultural Bank of China.
 The Chinese government currency traders, bankers say, have refrained from the kind of highly speculative trading that led to the $550 million in losses disclosed this week by the China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation, which is majority owned by a state-run Chinese company. But the fees and commissions associated with doing business with the Chinese has prompted many big Western banks to set up special trading teams in Hong Kong just to handle transactions for Beijing.
 An important job for such teams involves taking Chinese traders to dinner, Western bankers say, as the Chinese are not allowed to accept gifts. So fee-hungry bankers fly regularly to Beijing from Hong Kong -- some making the trip practically every week -- to take traders out for lavish evenings.
 For some, one banker said, this duty can become wearisome. The Chinese traders enjoy bowling, he said, but they also have a reputation for wanting to attend Mandarin romantic operas, an acquired taste at best.

HEADLINE: Britten's Venice Is Eclipsed By the Wonders of Colon

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
The Teatro Colon is grand opera all by itself. Enter its front door to an ensemble of Italian marbles singing to the eye in five-part harmony. Follow the march up a grand staircase between towering Corinthian columns, Versailles-esque ornament and a squadron of busts. Not a note has been heard, but simply going into the Colon has become, for sheer size and decorative extravagance, like a first-act finale to a Verdi opera.
 The theater proper is parterre seats in red plush and gilt surrounded by five tiers of boxes: 2,500 seats and 700 additional places for standing room. Every facade offers filigree run wild. Acousticians dream of walls like these: thousands of small protuberances to deflect sound in different directions, and paint dried and hardened to a reflective liveliness over almost a century of use. The curtain, again red and gold, is reminiscent of Covent Garden's in London, but here upgraded according to a New World exuberance. 
 If the drapery surrounding individual boxes looks faded, if wood surfaces seem to have grayed in their long wait for refurbishment, if the eye strays to small deposits of garbage in Arturo Toscanini Park across from the Colon's main entrance, what is for some neglect and distress will be for others a comforting patina.
 Dilapidation and decay, where they exist in this enormous and often elegant city, will never be confused with the hopeless, the morose or the depressing. Despite a crushing international debt, economic near-chaos and an ugly political history, this city is a place of staggering energy, from the traffic that races up and down some of the widest boulevards in the world to the successive managements of this opera house since 1908, whose attention to Latin American composers and embrace of the new and exciting from the rest of the world have made it something we in New York might envy.
 Recent productions have included Rossini's ''Elisabetta'' and Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut,'' but less traditional opera composers like Wolfgang Rihm (''Jakob Lenz'') and Krzysztof Penderecki (''Ubu the King'') have been found on the premises in the last few months. Despite money problems, the Colon clings to an obligation to live in its own time. 
 On Nov. 26 the house was presenting its new production of Britten's ''Death in Venice.'' The flat sets and modest back-lighted projections looked economical to a fault. Indeed, this production will, for the eyes at least, have trouble competing with the extravagant opera house in which it finds itself. But then there was Britten's music, with its delicacy, its pouncing moments of high drama and its wholly original, percussion-driven ending. This is one of his most beautiful creations, and I hope the Metropolitan Opera has not forgotten its own production of it.
 Indigenous talent has been imported to handle a British take on Thomas Mann's German novella. Nigel Robson is the admirable Aschenbach, in a performance helped not a little by the Colon's natural acoustical presence. Jason Howard took the seven changing baritone roles and did so strongly. Franco Fagioli was the clear, clean countertenor.
 Steuart Bedford conducted a Colon orchestra not wholly articulate in Britten's details but capturing his tone very well. Alfredo Arias's direction uses dancers in anonymous black to set a mood and busy gymnasts in underwear to keep our minds on the homoerotic implications. Neither device worked particularly well.
 You can admire the Colon's intentions while wondering whether ''Death in Venice'' will ever be at its best here or in an opera house like this. Britten's piece is like a dream lived through only the eyes and ears of Aschenbach. Thus, Mr. Howard's changing roles are less a convenience for budget-minded producers, more a dramatic necessity: a blurring of identities essential to the egocentric, wandering vision of one man onstage.
 I also wonder whether Mann's prose or Britten's music really have sex at their center. ''Death in Venice'' may be about larger ideas, including a recurring theme in Mann's work: the clash of the intellectual life -- protective and defensive -- with a corrupting, exalting yet ultimately fatal surrender to the senses. 
 Argentines put that message over just as well at their vast and aging tango palaces, places like the Confiteria Ideal around the corner from the Colon. Here the more agile citizens of this city, young and old, dance away their own obsessions of love, violence, submission and aggression, all under a white enamel ceiling turned caramel by 100 years of cigarette smoke.

HEADLINE: One State Talks About Shifting Out of Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Just days after the president of a huge California pension fund was ousted, some California officials are proposing that the state get out of the pension business and give state and municipal workers a 401(k) plan instead. 
 Such a move would echo proposals by the Bush administration and some members of Congress to divert a portion of the Social Security payroll tax away from the federal trust fund and into individual savings accounts. Rather than paying retirees a pre-determined benefit based on a common formula, as Social Security now does, the administration is proposing to give workers the opportunity to manage some of their retirement money themselves.
 On Monday, Dr. Keith S. Richman, a Republican member of the California Legislature, plans to introduce a bill that would begin the process of closing California's giant public pension funds to new employees, and giving public workers the 401(k) type of benefit in the future. 
 The bill is certain to run into resistance from the unions that represent various public employees in California and from Democratic politicians, who control both houses of the Legislature. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined, through a spokesman, to comment on the plan. 
 Dr. Richman says he is getting support from a number of county and local officials around the state, who are running into serious trouble making their required pension contributions.
 ''He has a lot of support,'' said Chris Norby, an Orange County supervisor and delegate to the California State Association of Counties. ''If it doesn't get through the Legislature, he can put it on the ballot'' in a future ballot initiative. 
 The push to change the way California provides state workers with retirement benefits follows the ouster this week of Sean Harrigan as president of the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, a $178 billion fund. Mr. Harrigan was removed amid complaints that he had used his position as a big institutional investor to advance causes favorable to organized labor. Mr. Harrigan, who is also a union official, was succeeded by Ron Alvarado, a Republican businessman, on the board of Calpers.
 Mr. Alvarado said Thursday that he did not yet have an opinion on the 401(k) proposal. ''It never hurts to look at new ideas,'' he said, ''but I have not dug into it sufficiently to make any pronouncement about how I would vote on that.''
 The staff of Calpers, apparently seeking to throw cold water on such an idea, distributed data at a briefing yesterday that indicated that 401(k) plans were more profitable for the money managers who handle the accounts than pension funds are. A spokeswoman, Patricia K. Macht, also challenged what she called the ''myth'' that the current system pays excessive pensions. 
 The average Calpers beneficiary retires at age 60, after 22 years of service, with a pension of $1,860 a month, she said. She called traditional pensions an important recruiting tool for cities and the state, which are not able to compete with private-sector employers on the basis of salary.
 Thousands of companies in the private sector have replaced their traditional defined-benefit pension plans with 401(k) plans in the last two decades. The trend has drawn criticism from many actuaries and economists, who say pensions are a superior benefit, and from older workers, who tend to appreciate the advantages of pensions more keenly as they approach retirement. Traditional pensions shield retirees from investment risk and eliminate the possibility of outliving one's assets. 
 California would not be the first state to consider such a change. The state of Nebraska offered public employees the chance to opt out of its pension plan and go into a plan similar to a 401(k) in 1964. 
 Nebraska later found that from 1970 to 2000 -- a period encompassing the longest bull market in history -- the typical worker earned just 6 percent to 7 percent a year, on average. The pension plan, meanwhile, returned 11 percent a year. Nebraska is no longer letting new employees into the 401(k) plan because of the results.
 Dr. Richman, who is a physician as well as a legislator, said California was in the same fix as some companies with pension plans, having promised more than it can afford. He said the state and its local and county governments must stop promising pensions to public employees. 
 ''There is a very broad problem throughout the state of California, due to the increasing cost of pensions,'' said Dr. Richman, who represents a district that covers north Los Angeles County and parts of eastern Ventura County. Dr. Richman has already announced his intention to run for state treasurer in the next election, in 2006. The state treasurer automatically sits on the boards of both Calpers and a sister pension fund for teachers, known as Calstrs.
 Many local governments in California were having so much trouble making their required contributions to the central funds in Sacramento that they had been issuing a steady stream of bonds, to produce the cash, Dr. Richman contends. That left them responsible for both the remaining pension contributions in subsequent years, and the interest on the bonds, he said. The cost of servicing all the outstanding pension bonds was about $800 million a year. 
 Dr. Richman's bill would not cancel any existing pensions or eject public employees from Calpers or any of the other state and local pension funds in California. Workers who are already in such pension plans would have the option of staying until retirement or switching over to the new 401(k) plan for the remainder of their careers. Only new public employees would be required to join the 401(k) plan.
 Even so, winding down the practice of offering pensions to public workers would be a big change in California--and in some ways, for the rest of the country. Calpers is the nation's largest pension fund, with about 1.4 million participants. It has been outspoken on shareholder-rights issues like executive compensation and rubber-stamp boardrooms, and it is seen as a bellwether by other, smaller pension funds. If it were closed to new participants, its influence would gradually decline. 
 Calstrs, the $100 billion pension fund for California's teachers, and America's fourth-largest pension fund, would also be covered by Dr. Richman's bill. So would other pension funds for California's larger cities and counties, which operate independently rather than participating in Calpers.
 Closing Calpers and Calstrs to new employees would require an amendment to the state Constitution, and Dr. Richman's bill proposes to do that. The amendment would require approval by the voters, in a ballot initiative. If things get that far, there would also have to be separate legislation laying out the design of the new 401(k) plan.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Down Sharply From Pace Set in October

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The economy added 112,000 payroll jobs in November, far fewer than the month before and not enough to keep up with average increases in the adult population, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
 The gain was well below Wall Street forecasts, and employment in manufacturing was flat for the third consecutive month.
 The modest pace of job creation, along with a small decline in the number of hours worked, reinforced the image of an economy that is expanding more slowly and in which companies remain skittish about hiring more people.
 Many analysts were stunned last month when the government reported a spectacular jump of 337,000 jobs in October. But on Friday, many said that the October jump was mostly an aberration in the more enduring trend of slow growth in jobs and wages. 
 The report cast a shadow on expectations for holiday spending this year, given that consumers face higher gasoline and heating prices without much rise in real personal income.
 Three years after the last recession officially ended in November 2001, the rebound in jobs remains slower than in any previous economic recovery since World War II. 
 Unemployment inched down by 0.1 percentage point last month, to 5.4 percent, but the United States still has at least 200,000 fewer jobs than it did before the recession began. At the same time, the adult population has grown by about four million. 
 ''The economy is adding jobs, but not at a feverish pace,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, an economic research firm in New York. ''Economic growth is not expanding at a pace that can engender stellar job growth, and I think you have to get used to these kinds of numbers.'' 
 The biggest areas of hiring last month were at financial companies and in health services like nursing and home health care. But retailers, who had been a primary source of lower-paying jobs, actually shed 16,000 positions in November and have essentially done no net hiring since July.
 Manufacturers, who have shed over 2.5 million jobs over the last four years, added no additional workers for the fourth consecutive month. 
 The biggest weakness among manufacturers was among computer and electronics companies, which have been stymied by an unexpected sluggishness of corporate spending on information technology. Computer companies dropped 3,800 jobs last month and total employment in that sector is exactly even compared with one year ago.
 Bond investors reacted to the disappointing report by pushing up the price of Treasury securities, on the expectation that economic growth will be more moderate and that the Federal Reserve will be under less pressure to raise interest rates.
 But the Fed is almost certain to raise short-term rates by another quarter-point at its next policy meeting on Dec. 14. 
 The central bank has been raising rates since June at what officials call a ''measured pace,'' and officials have given no hint that they are ready to pause in that process. Indeed, economic growth is likely to reach 4 percent in 2004, well above the long-term growth rate, and ''real'' interest rates are still about zero after subtracting the effects of inflation.
 Most analysts said the economy was still poised for moderate employment growth over the next year.
 So far this year, the economy has added about 2 million jobs, an average of about 185,000 jobs a month. 
 Economists estimate that the nation needs to generate about 150,000 jobs a month to keep up with the increase in population, which means that employment is keeping slightly ahead of job seekers.
 ''Available data suggest the recovery remains surprisingly resilient, despite concerns about energy costs,'' wrote Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Citigroup. ''Gains in employment of 185,000 per month suggest an expansion proceeding at cruising speed.''
 Month-to-month changes in payroll employment are notoriously volatile and defy consensus forecasts on Wall Street more often than not.
 On Friday, the Labor Department revised down its October estimate to 303,000 jobs from 337,000. But analysts said even that number was exaggerated by special events and statistical issues.
 ''October now clearly stands as an outlier, partly thanks to the hurricane effect and partly, we think, to plain old sampling error,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, a liberal research group in Washington, said the overall pace of hiring still appeared steady.
 But he said he was concerned about weak growth in wages. Average hourly wages rose only 1 cent in November, and the October figure was revised down. Over the last year, wages have climbed 2.6 percent slower than the inflation rate.
 ''With limited job growth and falling real wages, heavily indebted consumers will have difficulty maintaining a healthy pace of consumption growth,'' Mr. Baker said.
 David Kelly, chief economist at Putnam Investments, said consumers, who have been the driving force of growth for the last four years, are pushing themselves to the limit.
 Mr. Kelly estimated that the personal savings rate this year would drop to .8 percent, the lowest level since 1933.
 ''It's all pointing to an economy that is slumbering down to third gear,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''It's a mature expansion, but I think it's self-sustaining.''

HEADLINE: Shares Up a Bit as Treasuries Rally and Dollar Tumbles

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday while bonds rallied after the government reported that fewer jobs than expected were created last month.
 Stocks ended slightly higher, while the price of crude oil dropped for the fourth consecutive day. It is now down 14.5 percent since Monday.
 The Labor Department reported that 112,000 jobs were created last month, about half the consensus forecast of 200,000. Although the figure is not a signal that the economy is in trouble, it did suggest that growth could be a little weaker than other recent data has indicated. And recently, just about any data has been turned into an excuse to sell the dollar. 
 The outlook for the dollar turned starkly negative after the election, with analysts concluding that the Bush administration would not fight a decline in its value and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warning that the nation's record current-account deficit could lead to further drops. 
 After a 1.4 percent decline in the value of the dollar, the euro was valued at $1.3452 in afternoon trading yesterday. Against the yen, the dollar fell 1.1 percent, to 102.09. The American currency is the weakest it has been against the euro since the 12-nation currency was introduced in 1999. The dollar is at its weakest against the yen since January 2000.
 Asraf Laidi, chief currency strategist at the MG Financial Group, said that the dollar could bounce back a little next week as investors anticipate another rate increase from Federal Reserve policy makers when they meet Dec. 14. But he expects the dollar to resume its decline later in the month.
 In the bond market, the weaker jobs report was welcomed after the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note had jumped almost a third of a percentage point to 4.41 percent in the previous two weeks. The rise came amid concerns about stronger economic growth and fears that the dollar's decline would discourage foreigners from investing in Treasuries.
 ''Nobody saw a weak number coming,'' said William Prophet, interest rate strategist at UBS. ''I think people were gearing up for a big number, for 300,000 new jobs.''
 He said that the weaker jobs data also raised questions about the Federal Reserve's future decisions on raising interest rates. Policy makers are still expected to increase their benchmark short-term rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, when they meet later this month. But Mr. Prophet said the new data meant that the Fed could skip a rate increase at one of its future meetings. 
 While the bond market sold off Monday because of fears that a weaker dollar would lead to high interest rates, that concern seemed to have little weight yesterday.
 The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.25 percent, from 4.41 percent on Thursday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 8/32, to 100. Shorter-term securities also rallied on the change in expectations about Fed rate increases, with the yield on the two-year note dropping to 2.92 percent, from 3.04 percent.
 In the stock market, the three main market gauges were up more than 0.5 percent in early trading, but gave up most of their gains by the close as investors took in good news from Intel and the oil market and bad news on jobs and the dollar.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,592.21, and was up 0.7 percent for the week.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.84 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,191.17, and was up 0.7 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,147.96 and was up 2.2 percent for the week.
 I.B.M. rose 1.4 percent, to $97.08, on news that the company was putting its PC business up for sale. Intel rose 5.2 percent, to $23.91, after reporting late Thursday that it was raising its sales forecast for the fourth quarter. 
 The price of oil for January delivery dropped 71 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.54 a barrel. That is the lowest price since the end of August.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of eight-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Seeks Tax Increases Over 5 Years

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Moving to address its financial crisis, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is proposing to increase a half-dozen business, real estate and fuel taxes to raise $900 million a year to help pay for the transit network's five-year rebuilding program.
 The proposal by the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, is being presented to the Pataki administration and the State Legislature as a way to deal with the authority's crushing debt and capital costs, a financial burden that has forced the authority to consider a mix of transit fare increases and service cuts when the authority's board meets Dec. 16. Mr. Kalikow is an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki, and his plan presents a challenge to the Republican governor, an ardent opponent of higher taxes who has yet to come up with his own plan to meet the expenses. 
 The proposal includes raising the real property transfer tax and mortgage recording taxes, new levies that could cost homeowners and businesses hundreds if not thousands of additional dollars during property transactions. Mr. Kalikow also proposed raising corporate taxes and the petroleum business tax, a tax paid by importers of foreign fuel. The new taxes, to be applied statewide, would not prevent the fare increases or cutbacks that are being considered this month, but by supplying the debt service on a bond issue, it could improve the authority's financial situation in future years. 
 In an effort to demonstrate the authority's desperate financial situation and gain support for a plan that could be politically volatile, Mr. Kalikow and Katherine N. Lapp, the authority's executive director, have been meeting quietly over the past two weeks with business leaders from groups like the Real Estate Board of New York and the Partnership for New York City.
 The authority needs to come up with $16 billion in new revenue over the next five years to cover planned capital improvements, like bringing the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal and buying new rail cars for the Metro-North system. Of that, $11 billion is needed just to keep the system in good repair. The authority has also announced that it will need a series of additional fare increases starting in 2007 to cover multibillion-dollar operating deficits projected for the coming years.
 Mr. Kalikow developed his plan partly because of the lack of action in Albany to deal with the authority's fiscal problems. The new capital plan starts in January, and any plan to raise taxes would have to gain approval from the Legislature and the governor.
 People who have spoken with authority executives say the tax increases, which would be earmarked exclusively for transportation, would provide a stream of cash enabling the authority to float up to $13 billion in bonds.
 Mr. Kalikow and Ms. Lapp yesterday confirmed that they had begun talking to civic and business groups about a solution to their fiscal woes. But they declined to go into detail. The authority is expected to deliver the proposal on Monday to the Capital Program Review Board, which is made up of appointees of the governor, the legislative leadership and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Although civic and business groups have generally been united in their support for the transportation authority's rebuilding program, Mr. Kalikow's proposal is getting mixed reviews even before it reaches Albany.
 ''We're not thrilled at higher taxes,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. But, he added: ''The capital plan is important, and we recognize that the industry is going to have to share in the pain. This seems to be a fair attempt to have everyone participate in the pain of raising $12 billion.''
 Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, and Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman, expressed strong support for the plan, because, they said, the region needs a thriving public transportation system to prosper.
 Mitchell Pally, vice president for government affairs for the Long Island Association, a business group, did not disagree, but he opposed increasing business taxes.
 ''I don't think there's any question that the business community is going to have to pay a larger share than it pays now,'' Mr. Pally said. ''The question is what is equitable and what that share should be. I would say, at least in relation to the corporate surcharge, that is going to be a very difficult sell.''
 Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, which met with Mr. Kalikow and Ms. Lapp on Thursday, said that Mr. Kalikow was ''absolutely right to be fighting for whatever resources are necessary'' to keep the region's subways and trains running. But, she said, her group also opposes increasing business taxes.
 She said her group favored reinstating a commuter tax, which would effectively ask people in the outlying suburbs to pay their share of the costs. But, she said, Mr. Kalikow believes that the commuter tax is not viable politically. That tax, in any event, would raise less than half the amount in the authority's proposal.
 ''The commuter tax is the fairest way to go,'' Ms. Wylde said, ''but if it's not feasible, we'll have to go to Plan B.''
 At a hearing sponsored by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky last month, Mr. Kalikow promised to put forward his own plan to revitalize the authority.
 ''Peter Kalikow is keeping not just a promise he made to my committee but to everybody,'' Mr. Brodsky said yesterday. ''He's made a lot of people very uncomfortable. If you don't have a good subway and commuter system, the economy will falter. The leaders of the private sector will have to make some harder choices.''
 The decision by the authority to peddle its own plan to pay for its capital program is an unusual one. Those plans have traditionally been left to politicians to devise. The one notable exception came in the 1980's, when the system was on the verge of collapse and Chairman Ravitch came up with the idea to issue a five-year capital program to pay for repairs and lobbied for a slew of dedicated taxes to pay for it.
 Portions of six separate taxes are already dedicated to the authority. Mr. Kalikow is proposing a 50 percent increase in the amount of money generated by these taxes. For instance, under the proposal, the one-quarter-percent portion of the mortgage recording tax and the transfer tax on commercial buildings that goes to the authority would be increased to three-eighths of a percent.
 Beverly Dolinsky, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the authority, said, ''Usually, the M.T.A. states the problem and leaves it up to their funding partners to come up with the solutions.'' But, she added: ''The funding partners have not been forthcoming. At least this starts the discussion.''

HEADLINE: Don't Let Banks Turn Their Backs on the Poor

BYLINE: By Robert E. Rubin and Michael Rubinger. 
Robert E. Rubin, a director of Citigroup who was Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999, is the chairman and Michael Rubinger is the president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a community development support group.

 BODY:
FOR more than 25 years, a little known federal law has helped low-income communities get the bank loans and services they need to rebuild their neighborhoods. But that law, the Community Reinvestment Act, is being threatened by proposals from two federal bank regulators.
 Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 as a response to the practice of redlining -- the refusal by banks to extend loans or banking services in poor, and predominantly minority, urban areas. Today, the law is equally important to distressed rural communities. In low-income areas throughout the United States, this law -- which encourages banks to serve low-income communities in their markets -- has increased homeownership and small-business growth, enabling the revitalization of entire communities. Under the act, regulators consider reinvestment performance when a bank seeks permission to expand or merge. Since its inception, the law has prompted banks to channel more than $1 trillion into reinvestment projects -- without requiring a single dollar of Congressional spending. 
 Now, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, one of four agencies responsible for enforcing the act, is proposing to relax enforcement of the law at almost 1,000 banks. The Federal Office of Thrift Supervision, another overseer of the law, has already finalized a similar proposal for savings and loans institutions. These new rules may be the first step in an effort -- long pursued by some in Congress -- to dismantle the act, piece by piece.
 Under the law now, banks with assets of more than $250 million undergo full periodic reviews of their lending, services and investments in low-income communities. At smaller banks, examiners limit their review to lending practices only. 
 The F.D.I.C. proposal would raise the asset level for this limited scrutiny to $1 billion, making many fewer banks fully accountable. The F.D.I.C. claims that the new rule is aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on banks. The Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency, the law's other two enforcers, have not proposed new rules. 
 But there is a real question as to whether changing the rule would result in any meaningful savings for banks. And communities will suffer if enforcement is curtailed, because the act has been working. A Treasury report presented in 2000 to the Congress concludes that mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers and areas rose substantially in the 1990's. 
 The capital made available under the act has helped to rebuild entire communities -- in rural Maine as well as in the South Bronx. At the same time, banks have learned that lending, investing and providing basic services in low-income communities can be good business. A 2002 Harvard University study found that the law significantly changed the way banks do business in and relate to the communities they serve. As a result, the report stated, ''The lower-income mortgage market has become demonstrably mainstream and more competitive over the last decade.'' The Federal Reserve Board, too, has deemed this lending to be safe and profitable. 
 Low-income families can be part of the mainstream economy only if they can buy homes, start businesses and live in stable, vibrant communities. If the United States is to compete globally, we need everyone to contribute. In these uncertain economic times, keeping the Community Reinvestment Act strong is in the interest of all Americans.

HEADLINE: Amid Talk of Deal With I.B.M., Lenovo of China Sheds Some Obscurity

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Keith Bradsher, in Hong Kong, and John Markoff, in San Francisco, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Lenovo. Who?
 Although virtually unknown in the United States, Lenovo -- said to be in talks to buy I.B.M.'s personal computer business -- is China's largest PC maker and the world's fastest-growing one. And it is emblematic of the ambitions of emergent Chinese industrial giants to create global brand names and capture market share beyond their own borders. Formerly relegated to a low profile as the cheap assemblers for the rest of the industrialized world, Chinese companies now have their sights set on becoming global powers in their own right. 
 The Lenovo Group, partly owned by the Chinese government, had sales of over $3 billion last year and is currently ranked eighth globally among PC makers. It is the overall leader in Asia outside Japan, where NEC and other Japanese companies dominate. (I.B.M.'s Japan unit is in the top five there, though, adding to I.B.M.'s allure for Lenovo.) 
 Based in Beijing and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Lenovo has made its mark by producing a line of low-cost PC's, some selling here in China for as little as $360. With huge sales to Chinese government agencies and schools, and immune from the tariffs levied against foreign brands like Dell, Hewlett-Packard and -- so far -- I.B.M., Levono now controls about 27 percent of the Chinese PC market, which is about to pass Japan to become the world's second-largest personal computer market after the United States. 
 But the company is experiencing growing pains as it tries to hold onto market share at home while also venturing into Western markets. 
 The company's stock price recently plummeted after Lenovo reported worse-than-expected earnings, citing a price war in China with Dell, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. 
 Lenovo may not end up acquiring I.B.M.'s PC business, as at least one other potential buyer is also in negotiations. And other bidders may emerge. 
 But if Lenovo succeeds, acquiring the I.B.M. unit would ease some of the competitive pressure domestically. Recognizing that profitable growth within China may be increasingly hard to come by as outsiders flock to the world's potentially biggest consumer market, Levono also knows it needs to expand its global share of the market beyond its current 2.6 percent. Acquiring the I.B.M. business, now ranked third globally, would raise that share to 8.6 percent -- still third, but a bit closer to Dell (18 percent) and Hewlett-Packard (16.1 percent). 
 As part of its global campaign, the company earlier this year shed its longstanding name, Legend, in favor of the current one, then promptly entered the global brand sweepstakes by signing on as a sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. 
 To what extent, and for how long, Lenovo or another buyer of I.B.M.'s PC business would be able to make use of the I.B.M. name would be a crucial question in any negotiations. But the company has made it known that it is open to deals. ''Acquisition is one of the possibilities,'' Mary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer, said in an interview last year. Founded in 1984 by a group of Chinese scientists with government financing, the company then known as Legend started out as a distributor of computers and printers, selling I.B.M., AST and Hewlett-Packard models in China.
 In the late 1980's, however, as an exemplar of a trend that would play out in many Chinese industries, the company moved higher up the food chain by beginning to design its own personal computers. By 1997, it had passed I.B.M. to become the largest seller of personal computers in China.
 But competing globally on its own, especially against Dell's vaunted manufacturing efficiencies, could be a stretch for Lenovo. An American venture capitalist who recently toured the Lenovo factory in Shanghai said that he had been surprised that it lacked the bustling, just-in-time urgency that he had observed on a similar tour of a Dell assembly line in Round Rock, Tex. 
 At the Lenovo site, pallets of computers were stacked high to the ceiling, according to the investor, who insisted on not being identified, and he said the production line was moving slowly compared with Dell's.
 Moreover, with China's economy growing rapidly, increasingly affluent and brand-conscious people are turning to Dell, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard computers. Executives at Lenovo are intent on competing with those better-known brands, saying Lenovo is not interested in simply being known as the lower-cost supplier. I.B.M.'s product line would automatically push Lenovo up the cachet curve. 
 Most crucial to Lenovo's worldwide aspirations, analysts say, would be I.B.M.'s ThinkPad line of portable computers, which even among American customers has a much more devoted following than many of the other products in I.B.M.'s line. 
 ''This is their steppingstone to a global market,'' said James Mulvenon, a China researcher who is deputy director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, a Washington research center. 
 Otherwise, he said, Lenovo faces the same brand-recognition problem that has plagued the Taiwan computer maker Acer, which ranks fifth globally, but is an also-ran in the United States market. ''This a story about a Chinese company adopting an American brand,'' Mr. Mulvenon said.

HEADLINE: Rell's Usual Caution Is Apparent in an Execution Debate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The escalating controversy surrounding the pending execution of the serial killer Michael Bruce Ross has presented Gov. M. Jodi Rell with perhaps her first truly uncomfortable moment in the spotlight.
 The governor, who has the power to grant a temporary reprieve to Mr. Ross but has yet to decide if she will, faces the prospect of presiding over the first execution in the state since 1960. The controversy, however, could evaporate at any moment. 
 A court considering whether to allow public defenders dismissed by Mr. Ross to appeal his death sentence again could potentially stay his execution, dragging the 20-year case on for several more years. Or Mr. Ross, who has insisted he will pursue no more appeals, could simply change his mind, sparing himself until at least the next court decision.
 But for now, Mr. Ross, 45, appears resolute, the court has not acted, and as the days dwindle before the scheduled lethal injection, on Jan. 26, his case has expanded from being a complex legal matter to a complex political one. 
 ''I do think it's probably the first high-profile issue that she's faced,'' said Robert M. Ward, a Republican, like the governor, who is the House minority leader and a longtime friend of Mrs. Rell. ''It probably will be the highest-profile issue she does face, and I think she's handled it correctly.''
 Known for her cautious, read-every-bill style as a former state lawmaker, the governor has suggested she is applying the same deliberate approach to this decision. Her office is consulting with outside lawyers to study her options and scouring the history of what roles Connecticut governors may have played in past execution cases. 
 ''I will listen to everyone that has something to say on this issue,'' the governor said Friday, ''and the decision will ultimately be mine, based on the research that I am currently undertaking,'' 
 Among those trying to influence her is Mr. Ross, who confessed in 1984 to strangling eight girls and young women and would be the first person executed in the Northeast in more than 40 years.
 ''I am asking you not to exercise your executive power to grant a temporary reprieve because I truly believe that the best chance for an honest debate on the issue of the death penalty can only happen after my execution,'' Mr. Ross said in a handwritten letter to the governor dated Nov. 28. 
 ''After all the people who say that the state of Connecticut is too liberal and will never allow an execution to take place are proven wrong. After all the people who claim that I am simply a 'media hound' seeking attention and will change my mind before my execution are proven wrong.''
 A judge on Friday scheduled a hearing for next Thursday to further examine Mr. Ross's mental competency before his execution, underscoring that possibility that the courts could prevent Mrs. Rell from having to make a decision.
 The governor has said she has received calls and letters from people for and against the execution. She has suggested her decision hinges on whether the legislature would consider revising or repealing the law. She has heard conflicting signals from legislative leaders. Donald E. Williams Jr., the Senate president pro tempore, has encouraged the governor to grant a reprieve to allow the Senate to reconsider the death penalty law.
 ''And you got an equally clear signal from the House that they did not want to discuss it,'' Mrs. Rell noted Friday, referring to comments by incoming House Speaker James A. Amann that he supported allowing the execution.
 Few lawmakers believe the legislature will repeal the death penalty, but legislation to abolish executions is likely to be introduced.
 Mrs. Rell took office July 1, after the resignation of former Gov. John G. Rowland amid a corruption scandal. She has proved a stunningly popular replacement.
 She has held open houses at the Capitol and across the state, parceled out money for education and economic development, resurrected the state's embattled auto emissions program, fired administrators tainted during the Rowland administration and extolled ethics and good government. A poll by Quinnipiac University put her job approval rating at 80 percent, a record in the state.
 The governor has yet to say whether she will run to retain her office in 2006. Some political observers have speculated that granting a reprieve to Mr. Ross, potentially allowing the issue to resurface in an election year, could complicate things for Mrs. Rell. But others say Mrs. Rell may be immune from much political fallout, regardless of what she does. 
 Michael P. Lawlor, a Democrat who is the House co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee and who opposes the death penalty, was one of few lawmakers willing to speculate openly on Friday about what might come next.
 ''I think the most likely thing is the judge postpones it,'' he said. ''Then the next most likely thing is Ross changes his mind. Then it's that he gets executed. Then the next most likely thing is the governor postpones it.''


CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a request by Michael Bruce Ross, a serial killer, to be executed as scheduled by the State of Connecticut on Jan. 26 misstated the precedent his execution would set if it occurred. (The error has also appeared in four other articles since Dec. 2 about efforts to stay the execution.) Mr. Ross would be the first person executed north or east of Pennsylvania in more than 40 years not the first anywhere in the Northeast. (Pennsylvania has executed three inmates since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.)

HEADLINE: White House Defends China on Currency

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The Bush administration once again declared that China is not manipulating its exchange rate, dismissing loud complaints from some manufacturers and members of Congress that the country's undervalued currency is badly worsening the United States' trade deficit.
 In a report released late Friday afternoon, more than a month after a Congressional deadline, the Treasury Department said China was ''laying the groundwork for a shift to a market-based flexible exchange rate.''
 Though not unexpected, the decision appeared timed to attract as little attention as possible on an issue that has provoked political debates in many states that have been hard-hit by imports from China.
 The report also came at a moment when Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is widely rumored to be on his way out. White House officials have let it be known they do not want Mr. Snow to stay more than six months, even though Mr. Snow has made it clear he would like to stay on for a good portion of President Bush's second term. 
 The Treasury Department was supposed to deliver the report in October, but officials said at the time that they would not deliver it until after the elections.
 By law, the administration is required to begin exploring sanctions against any country that it deems to be manipulating its currency to gain an ''unfair trade advantage.''
 But Mr. Snow has adamantly rejected all proposals to threaten China with retaliation, contending that the only way to persuade Chinese leaders would be with arguments that flexible exchange rates are in their own interest. 
 The United States' trade deficit with China is expected to exceed $120 billion this year -- by far the biggest trade imbalance that the United States has with any other country and bigger than that with the entire European Union.
 That trade deficit could grow even larger next year, as longstanding restrictions on a broad array of textiles and clothing are scheduled to expire.
 China has pegged its currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar for nearly 10 years. Many economists contend that the fixed exchange rate has caused the yuan to become increasingly undervalued -- perhaps by as much as 40 percent -- and made Chinese exports to the United States cheaper than they would be otherwise.
 Though China's biggest competitive advantage is its vast pool of low-wage workers, an undervalued currency makes a country's products cheaper in foreign markets.
 To keep the yuan's value locked at the rate of 8.3 to the dollar, the Chinese government has bought up vast sums of dollars and dollar-denominated securities over the last two years. Its foreign reserves grew by $47 billion in the first half of 2004, hitting a total of $471 billion.
 China's fixed peg to the dollar has caused other Asian nations, especially Japan, to prop up their own currencies by buying up hundreds of billions of dollars more. Japan bought up $138 billion in foreign reserves in the first three months of this year, and its foreign exchange reserves total more than $700 billion.
 In the report, the Treasury Department repeated its position that the administration is trying to persuade China to adopt a more flexible exchange rate for its own good. 
 ''The administration has urged Chinese leaders to move as soon as possible to greater flexibility, and has initiated an unprecedented level of engagement,'' the report contended.
 As evidence that its strategy of financial diplomacy was making progress, the administration said that Chinese leaders have publicly pledged to push ahead with a market-based exchange rate, though Treasury officials have been berating China for more than a year and Chinese leaders have refused to say how fast they will move.

HEADLINE: U.S. HEALTH CHIEF, STEPPING DOWN, ISSUES WARNING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, announced Friday that he was resigning, and he expressed grave concern about the threat of a global flu epidemic and the possibility of a terrorist attack on the nation's food supply.
 ''For the life of me,'' he said, ''I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do.''
 Mr. Thompson's departure was the latest indication of how President Bush intends to shape his cabinet in his second term. A senior administration official said Friday that Mr. Bush had asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to stay in his position, a sign that the president intends to stick with his military strategy in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. [Page A14.] 
 Mr. Thompson, freed from the constraints of administration policy, gave candid, unexpected answers to questions posed to him at a news conference at his department.
 He said he wished Congress had given him the power to negotiate with drug manufacturers to secure lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The White House and Republicans in Congress have insisted that the government should not have that power because it would lead to price controls, reducing the revenues that drug companies need for research.
 Mr. Thompson also said he tended to favor creation of an independent office to monitor the safety of prescription drugs after they are approved for sale to the public. Critics of the Food and Drug Administration have long called for such an office. After initially opposing the idea, Bush administration officials and managers at the F.D.A. have said they will examine any proposals.
 Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the federal official in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Thompson, administration officials said. Dr. McClellan, a physician and an economist, worked at the White House in the first two years of the Bush administration and was commissioner of food and drugs from November 2002 to February of this year. His brother Scott is the White House press secretary.
 Mr. Thompson said Dr. McClellan ''would be a great secretary.'' But Mr. Thompson said that the deputy secretary, Claude A. Allen, and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, were also qualified. In addition, Mr. Thompson said he had heard that Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, was interested in the job.
 Mr. Thompson, 63, the eighth member of the Bush cabinet to resign since the election, said he tried to resign a year ago but agreed to stay at the White House's request. 
 Now, he said, after 20 years in the Wisconsin Legislature, 14 years as governor and four years as secretary, ''it's time for me and my family to move on to the next chapter in our life.'' He said he wanted to work in the private sector, but would stay in office until Feb. 4 or until the Senate confirmed a successor.
 Kevin W. Keane, a spokesman for Mr. Thompson, said the secretary simply ''went with the flow'' at the news conference, offering candid responses to a wide range of questions.
 Before leaving office, Mr. Keane said, Mr. Thompson wants to issue a plan to ''beef up our ability to review the safety of drugs after they have been approved.'' 
 Asked what worried him most, Mr. Thompson cited the threat of a human flu pandemic caused by mutations in a strain of avian influenza virus, known popularly as bird flu. 
 ''This is a really huge bomb that could adversely impact on the health care of the world,'' killing 30 million to 70 million people, he said.
 Although the government has increased inspections of imported food, Mr. Thompson said he worried ''every single night'' about threats to the food supply.
 ''We are importing a lot of food from the Middle East and it would be easy to tamper with that,'' he said.
 He called for better technologies to detect contamination.
 Mr. Thompson said his greatest accomplishment was to secure passage of a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare, the federal insurance program for 41 million people who are elderly or disabled. This, he said, was ''the most historic improvement in Medicare since it was created in 1965.''
 The new law prohibits the government from negotiating prices with drug companies on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. But Mr. Thompson said, ''I would like to have had the opportunity to negotiate.''
 He learned the value of such negotiations in 2001, when the nation was responding to anthrax attacks. Mr. Thompson negotiated with the maker of Cipro, an antibiotic used to treat anthrax, to obtain the drug for 95 cents a tablet, far less than the $1.77 the government had been paying.
 Mr. Thompson was a conservative Republican but also a pragmatist, more interested in solving problems than in scoring political points. Democrats liked him because they saw him as an advocate for domestic programs in an administration that seemed to devote more attention to foreign and military policy. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, often disagreed with Mr. Thompson, but said it had been a privilege to work with him. ''He's always been a straight shooter, was always willing to try to tackle issues objectively, and always had good ideas and a common touch,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 In his letter of resignation, addressed to the president and dated Friday, Mr. Thompson said: ''You put forth the vision of a compassionate conservative. And our department takes great pride in being your Department of Compassion.''
 The department has more than 60,000 employees and spent $543 billion in the last year, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the federal budget.
 Mr. Thompson listed accomplishments of his tenure: The number of community health centers has increased. Immunization rates for children have reached a record high. The government has increased its defense against bioterrorist attacks and its ability to respond to public health emergencies. 
 Asked if he might run for governor of Wisconsin, Mr. Thompson said: ''It's entirely possible. I happen to love politics. Why would I say no?'' Also, ''there's a Senate seat open,'' he said, alluding to the seat now held by Herb Kohl, a Democrat. 
 The terms of Mr. Kohl and the current governor of Wisconsin, James E. Doyle, also a Democrat, expire in January 2007.

HEADLINE: Let My People Go

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine 

 BODY:
Here's a suggestion for President Bush from the protesters behind the democratic ''orange revolution'' here: Wear an orange tie.
 ''If he wore an orange tie, people here would be crying,'' said Yuri Maluta, a protester from Lviv. ''It would show that the American president supports democracy here.''
 The request says something about the lighthearted and pro-American spirit on the streets. Since my father grew up in what is now southwestern Ukraine, I decided to come here to join my people -- and I found that waging revolution has rarely been such fun. 
 Young people enveloped in orange scarves, hats and ribbons alternately chant slogans for freedom, boogie to rock music, eat oranges, warm up and flirt at McDonald's, and disappear into their downtown ''tent city'' to make love, not war.
 The protest organizers have placed gorgeous young women in the vanguard of confrontations with troops, so the troops will be too dazzled to club them.
 Most Ukrainians love the U.S., and to be an American here -- any American -- is to be a rock star. Protesters overhear me speaking English and line up to ask me to autograph their orange ribbons with a big ''U.S.A.'' (For an audiovisual tour, go to www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds.) 
 Yet for all the giddiness among the protesters here, particularly after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in their favor yesterday, this is as much about Russia as it is about Ukraine. And the first thing to say is that Vladimir Putin has behaved utterly disgracefully.
 Mr. Putin seems to regard the Ukrainians as Russia's serfs, bound to obey the will of their master. Mr. Putin was a co-conspirator with Ukraine's outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma, to tilt the campaign and fix the election in favor of the pro-Moscow candidate, Viktor Yanukovich, whose criminal history (he served almost four years for robbery and assault as a young man) would make him a fine Putin stooge.
 Mr. Putin visited Ukraine twice during the campaign to help Mr. Yanukovich, used the Russian news media to promote him and then congratulated him publicly before the results of the stolen election had even been completely counted. President Bush and other Western leaders need to make it clear to Mr. Putin that he has no right to extend his quasi dictatorship to other peoples.
 Sure, it's traumatic for the Russians to have seen their country sink from a superpower to a third-rate economy whose old colonies are now busy joining NATO. But Mr. Putin has undermined Russian democracy, brutalized Chechnya and barely helped in curbing weapons of mass destruction. We don't need to be so solicitous of such a bully.
 I was among the crowds in Independence Square when images of Mr. Putin were shown on the huge screens. The crowd yelled a deafening ''boo.'' We should be joining in.
 Colin Powell strongly denounced the rigged election, and Ukrainians will remember that American support with gratitude for a long time to come. But Mr. Bush and the White House haven't been as outspoken as either Mr. Powell or the Europeans, and that's a mistake.
 Mr. Bush is working through the Europeans, and especially the Poles, to achieve a solution, and he may fear that too public an American role would anger the Russians and revive the cold war. Those are fair concerns.
 But this is the moment of truth for Ukraine, when Mr. Putin is trying to thwart the challenger, Viktor Yushchenko, by squelching a democratic election, and we need to stand foursquare with the democrats. 
 ''Bush has to push more strongly and decisively on Ukraine to be democratic,'' said Bogdan Prysyazhnyuk, a young lawyer who is backing the orange revolution.
 ''The Europeans are doing something, much more than Bush is,'' noted Natalya Slobodyan, a journalism student who, like many young women, has dyed her hair orange. That's a common view on the street, where the Europeans are seen as standing up to Mr. Putin. Mr. Bush's behind-the-scenes role is less appreciated.
 I'm glad that Europe is finally getting its act together, after bungling the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990's and studiously ignoring the catastrophe in Darfur this year. But when a historic tide is running in our favor, our president should be riding it at least abreast of the Europeans, not cheering them from the shore.
 Or he might at least choose an orange tie.

HEADLINE: Officials Lay Groundwork For Cleanup of Great Lakes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Dozens of officials from the United States and Canada signed a declaration on Friday that outlines a comprehensive plan to clean up the Great Lakes and the major waterways that feed them.
 As one of President Bush's major environmental initiatives, the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration combines federal, state, local and tribal resources to broaden the continuing restoration efforts that have lacked such coordination.
 ''This is the largest formal collaboration of its kind focused on the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes Basin,'' said Michael O. Leavitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who presided over the signing ceremony in Chicago. ''Today, we are committing our collective organizations to protecting and improving this national treasure.''
 With cabinet officials, governors, mayors and lawmakers from Great Lakes States in attendance, the signing ceremony represented at least a symbolic success for the administration, which is generally viewed by environmental groups as having been a poor steward of the nation's natural resources. 
 The new collaboration has won early praise from environmental groups, large and small, however, for seeking input from an array of sources beyond a tight circle of policy makers in Washington.
 In response to President Bush's executive order in May calling for a ''regional collaboration of national significance'' to clean up the Great Lakes, E.P.A. officials leading the effort have included tribal leaders, small-town mayors and local environmental groups in addition to elected officials from the eight states that border the five Great Lakes.
 ''This is a good idea. It's the right process at the right time,'' said Andy Buchsbaum, director of the Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation.
 ''Dozens of other processes have been started by subsets of the participants here,'' Mr. Buchsbaum said, ''but we've never wound up with everybody pulling in the same direction. This is designed in the right way to do that.''
 Will Cwikiel, policy director of the Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council, a small environmental group in northern Michigan, said: ''I'm cautiously optimistic. The last thing anyone wants to see happen is a collapse, just grips and grins, pomp and circumstance, without anything really happening on the ground.''
 The collaboration sets forth a framework for establishing committees, lines of communication and overarching goals leading to cleaner water -- the Great Lakes contain about 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply and serve as a source of drinking water for more than 30 million people in the United States and Canada.
 Specific targets include pollution controls for agricultural and industrial runoff into the lakes; new efforts to restore and protect wetlands, forests and indigenous species; and the elimination of invasive species, like the Illinois carp, which Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois called ''a terrorist of the Great Lakes ecosystem.''
 The framework also proposes deadlines, with a preliminary plan due in six months and a final strategy to put the plan fully in motion due six months after that. Mr. Leavitt describe the program as ''not a redoing, but a redoubling'' of existing efforts. 
 What the framework does not provide, however, is a financing scheme, asserting that those who signed the declaration acknowledge that participation ''is subject to funding availability.'' 
 That raised concerns for some participants. 
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago Democrat who has introduced legislation that would provide $4 billion over five years for essentially the same goals as those in the framework, said the new effort would fail without adequate money. The bill, a bipartisan effort sponsored by more than 100 House members, and a companion Senate bill are languishing in committee. 
 In an interview, Mr. Emanuel criticized Mr. Bush as promising more money for Great Lakes cleanup projects, only to back off in his budget requests. Mr. Emanuel also said that the framework's goals and partners were virtually the same as those in an effort proposed in 2002 by Mr. Leavitt's predecessor, Christie Whitman. 
 ''If there are resources, then great,'' Mr. Emanuel said of the latest effort. ''But if this is in lieu of resources, it's a cruel hoax and leaves us years behind.''
 Neither Mr. Leavitt nor any of the 46 officials who spoke at the signing ceremony discussed financing. That was deliberate, Mr. Leavitt told reporters after the event. He said, ''No one knows how much money is currently being spent'' on Great Lakes cleanup efforts.
 Rather, he said, the intent of the framework is to expand on programs of the last 30 years, build coalitions and rank goals so that whatever money becomes available is spent appropriately.
 ''The type of collaboration we are launching is messy, messy and hard,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''But it's absolutely necessary.''

HEADLINE: Stop the Stadium in Its Tracks

 BODY:
New York City is hurtling toward the construction of a $1.4 billion Jets football stadium in Manhattan. But New Yorkers seem to have little say in this enormous commitment of public money for what would be the most expensive professional football stadium ever, although they have been subjected to a crop of he-said, he-said TV commercials. The approval process is on something beyond a fast track -- it's more like a runaway train. And it's time to pull on the brakes.
 The stadium is deeply entwined with Mayor Michael Bloomberg's hopes for development on the far West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg is right to focus on this large chunk of underused real estate, now sparsely populated by rail yards and light industry. We agree with his conviction that the area should have subway service, parks and the other things that will make developers want to construct splendid buildings where people can live and work and enjoy the riverfront. We admire the vigor with which the mayor has pursued his vision. We just don't believe that a hulking box of a football stadium, built with the help of millions of dollars in public money, is the way to make it happen. 
 Virtually every big city from Seattle to Miami has been engulfed in a stadium debate at one time or another. Such a debate generally features grand promises for an urban renaissance that never quite comes true and cost projections that very frequently turn out to be wildly optimistic. The backers create a sense of desperate urgency, dredging up the specter of lost opportunity if the city fails to act right away. In New York, however, the threat isn't that a professional sports team will depart, or fail to arrive, if the proper stadium isn't available. For the Jets, leaving the New York metropolitan area would mean abandoning the biggest media market in the nation.
 This is about the 2012 Olympic Games. The spades for a giant stadium on the Hudson River must be in the ground by next spring, the advocates say, or the Games -- and a long list of desirable public works projects they would entail -- will be lost to Paris or Moscow. That means committing to a stadium before the International Olympic Committee decides next July on the host for 2012.
 Nice as it would be to have the Games, they don't justify the stadium. Here are some of the reasons we believe it's a bad idea.

THE STADIUM -- As a piece of architecture, it would be clunky and unattractive. A really bad design can, of course, always be reworked -- although the Jets have so far shown no sign of falling out of love with their current plan. But even an inventive proposal, which must account for the luxury boxes that are the economic drivers of any modern football stadium, would lead to a mammoth structure, which would overwhelm anything built nearby. The tract of land along the Hudson River where the Jets want to build is a site of extraordinary potential. We don't believe that a stadium would be its optimal and best use. A study released this week by the nonpartisan Regional Plan Association found that a mixed-use redevelopment of the proposed site, including residential and commercial projects, would provide a better return for the city.
 The Bloomberg administration argues that the area needs a jump-start, and that the stadium would provide the right jolt. To us, the stadium seems more likely to thwart what could become one of the city's most glorious neighborhoods.

THE MONEY -- The Jets are supposed to put in some $800 million toward the stadium and cover cost overruns, with the city and state each pledging $300 million. Both governments are desperately overextended when it comes to borrowing power. So is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the railroad yards where the stadium would be built. Some estimates say the M.T.A. could reap well in excess of a billion dollars for the property and the air rights above it. The Jets are unlikely to pay anywhere near that. The public money would be used to build a platform over the rail yards where the stadium would stand, and to cover the facility with a roof to make it more adaptable for uses other than football. Advocates say it would then provide desperately needed additional space for the Javits Convention Center, which would be expanded and linked by a passageway to the new stadium.
 We agree that the convention center needs more space, but we doubt that a football stadium is the right way to provide that, even if it has a roof, a drop ceiling and retractable seating. In one city after another, promoters of huge sports stadiums have promised that they could be used for everything from huge conventions to high school track meets, but the results have almost invariably been disappointing.

THE SUBWAY -- The No.7 subway line currently runs from Queens across Midtown Manhattan, stopping at Grand Central Terminal before coming to an abrupt end at Times Square. Logically, the line should continue across the West Side, then ultimately connect to Penn Station. That service is crucial to Mr. Bloomberg's development dreams. But the M.T.A. has other priorities, most notably the expansion of the No.2 subway line on the East Side. That's the longtime dream of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who happens to represent the Lower East Side. Rather than wait for the No.2 to be finished or for Mr. Silver to retire, neither of which seems likely to happen in Mr. Bloomberg's political lifetime, the mayor's team has decided that the city should use its own money.
 We appreciate the mayor's pragmatism. The extension of the No.7, more than anything else, would draw developers and tenants. But the M.T.A. should be a partner in this kind of ambitious undertaking. It's time for the public to revisit the whole wish list for public transportation, along with the way the service is financed. Both the city and the state could best serve the area's mass transit needs by providing more support for the M.T.A.'s operating costs and allowing the authority to set priorities for its capital plans along a more rational line.

THE PROCESS -- There has been an air of inevitability surrounding the stadium, and pitifully few opportunities for genuine public input. The City Council has the power to approve a rezoning of the larger far West Side area -- and rezoning is critical for the right kind of redevelopment. The Council could put limits on density to prevent overbuilding, but the Council is shut out of the stadium deal itself. Opponents of construction have, inevitably, threatened legal action. But this is the kind of project that should be decided by the political process, not the courts.
 In the end, the only people who can stop this train are at the state level. In New York, that means three men -- Mr. Silver, Gov. George Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. There's been a lot of talk lately about reforming the deeply dysfunctional state government. Taking a firm stand on the stadium would be a good way to begin letting in some light. 

THE OLYMPICS -- We have always supported big ventures like the Olympics in New York City, but the great selling point for the Games was that they would encourage the construction of needed public works like parks, housing and smaller athletic sites that could be used later by local schools. To argue that in order to get the Games, the city must use one of its most valuable waterfront sites to build a huge, ugly stadium for eight football games a year turns that rationale backward. We wanted the Games to get good facilities. We don't want to build bad facilities in order to get the Games.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An editorial published on Saturday about the proposal to build a football stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan suffered from a geographic malapropism in a reference to the New York subway. The line proposed for the East Side is known as the Second Avenue line, not the No.2 line. The No.2 line runs up the West Side of Manhattan, as it has for, oh, 100 years. We not only approve of its existence -- we applaud it. Some of us even ride it.

HEADLINE: Interior Aide and Biologists Clashed Over Protecting Bird

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: LA JOLLA, Calif., Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The scientific opinions of a Bush administration appointee at the Interior Department with no background in wildlife biology were provided as part of the source material for the panel of Fish and Wildlife Service biologists and managers who recommended against giving the greater sage grouse protection under the endangered species act.
 The appointee, Julie MacDonald, a senior policymaker, criticized studies showing widespread loss of grouse territory and sporadic declines in grouse populations.
 Recommendations by the department's panels of experts are usually followed. Steve Williams, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, must make a final decision by Dec. 29.
 The sage grouse, whose habitat overlaps areas of likely oil and gas deposits across states like Wyoming and Montana, would likely become an economic headache to the energy and cattle industries if it were listed. A listing can trigger extensive regulation and increase costs and delays. 
 Mr. Williams, who is attending a Western governors' conference on the Endangered Species Act in San Diego, said on Friday that the scientists and bureau personnel who made the recommendation not to protect the greater sage grouse were given two extensive internal reviews of the state of scientific knowledge on the grouse and its sagebrush territory.
 One was done by federal biologists. Another version was provided by Ms. MacDonald, deputy assistant interior secretary and their political overseer, who peppered the biologists' draft with barbed commentary and made wholesale changes. ''What was provided to the panel,'' Mr. Williams said, ''was both the unedited version and the version with comment.''
 Ms. MacDonald's critique of sage grouse biology and the biologists who work for an agency she oversees showed flashes of her strong property-rights background and her deference to industry views. 
 Among other comments, Ms. MacDonald called science saying the birds had numbered in the millions before settlers arrived in the 19th century ''simply a fairy tale, constructed out of whole cloth.'' She also questioned whether the grouse was dependent on sagebrush during the winter, saying ''they will eat other stuff if it is available.''
 Mr. Williams and two specialists on grouse said that its seasonal dependence on sagebrush was uncontested among biologists.
 Ralph Morgenweck, the head of the service's Denver regional office, which supervised the scientific field work and analysis by bureau biologists, said in an interview Friday that challenges from nonbiologists were ''very common'' and beneficial to scientists. 
 . Williams, the service director, emphasized that the decision-making involving the grouse has been open and that the biologists' own review of the science was forwarded to the panels involved in the decision along with Ms. MacDonald's critique. And, he said, ''the important thing in my mind is that we haven't tried to hide any information.'' 
 He added that after the final decision on the grouse's status was published in the Federal Register, the underlying record, including the dueling reviews of the available science, would be available in the service's Denver office.
 A partial copy -- 48 of about 80 pages -- of Ms. MacDonald's editing and commentary on the biologists' mid-October draft review of the science was provided to The New York Times by an environmental group, the Sagebrush Sea Project, which has sought protection for the bird; it matched a copy that Mr. Williams said he had sent to the panel responsible for making recommendations. 
 The issue of political overseers modifying information from federal scientists that conflicts with policy goals has arisen periodically in recent years, most notably in the area of climate change. It has not been as visible in biology, an arena important to conservation groups, extractive industries and others concerned with the Endangered Species Act.
 The consistent thrust of Ms. MacDonald's critique was to dismiss the methodology behind studies that indicated significant declines in grouse population or habitat, to denigrate many studies as mere ''opinion'' and to seek inclusion of industry comments that she found compelling.
 She eliminated, in her editing, more than half of the references to the most recent ''conservation assessment,'' a 610-page compilation and partial analysis of all available data on sage grouse populations, territory, historical trends and adaptability by a group of experts written for the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.
 ''We should treat it as we would treat an industry publication,'' she wrote. Ms. MacDonald also recommended deleting extensive sections on the loss of sagebrush habitats to agriculture. And after the biologist-authors from Fish and Wildlife summarized studies showing population decline, Ms. MacDonald inserted a passage beginning ''all of these data are badly flawed in some manner.''
 She also objected to a reference to a study that found a population of 4,000 birds in one Utah valley dwindled to less than 200 after their habitat was fragmented. ''Citing examples like this, which are extreme, do not elucidate the issues we are faced with,'' the editor wrote. ''This example should be deleted.''
 Terry Rabot, an assistant regional director with the Fish and Wildlife Service who served on the panel making the recommendation, said in an interview on Saturday, ''About the comments Julie made -- some were good, but they didn't change the outcome.''
 Ms. MacDonald's immediate superior, Craig Manson, the assistant secretary with oversight over the Fish and Wildlife Service, defended her approach. She is, Mr. Manson said, ''highly qualified, an engineer, extremely competent, and reads every single paper cited'' by federal biologists in their reviews. ''When she reads a characterization of a document, she knows if you're citing it accurately.''
 At least one of Ms. MacDonald's pointed objections to the text was vouched for by the scientist whose work was, Ms. MacDonald said, ''mischaracterized'' in the biologists' synthesis: Elizabeth Crone, an author of a study analyzing statistically what seems to affect grouse populations. Ms. Crone, an assistant professor of qualitative ecology at the University of Montana, agreed with Ms. MacDonald's objections. ''I would be comfortable with the editor's comments,'' she said.
 Other biologists, however, were more surprised at Ms. MacDonald's interpretation of their work. Mike Schroeder of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said that she had misinterpreted his 1999 study when she said it showed that grouse could survive without sagebrush. 
 ''Sage grouse clearly depend on sagebrush to survive on a year-round basis,'' Mr. Schroeder said.
 On the issue of population counts, he said there were flaws in the data, but ''we're in a far better position of knowledge with the sage grouse than the vast majority of species in North America.''

Opposing Views of Sage Grouse Danger

The panel that made the recommendation that the greater sage grouse was in no immediate danger of extinction was provided with two competing reviews of the available science. One was the work of career biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service. The second was a caustic critique of this work by Julie MacDonald, the deputy assistant secretary of the interior. Here are comparisons of the two documents.

On the former range of the bird, the biologists wrote: ''Prior to the settlement of the Western United States by European immigrants in the 19th century, sage grouse lived in 13 states and 3 Canadian provinces. Sagebrush habitats that potentially supported sage grouse occupied approximately 463,509 square miles.''
Ms. McDonald wrote in rebuttal: ''This entire discussion of estimated habitat, estimated range, estimated population should be eliminated as it is 1) not supported by contemporary accounts, 2) not supported by data and 3) simply a fairy tale, constructed out of whole cloth, based on a series of arbitrary assumptions.''

On whether sage grouse need sagebrush to survive during the winter, the career biologists wrote: ''Sage grouse depend entirely on sagebrush throughout the winter for both food and cover.''
Ms. MacDonald wrote: ''I believe that is an overstatement, as they will eat other stuff if it's available.''

HEADLINE: The Hidden (In Plain Sight) Persuaders

BYLINE: By Rob Walker. 
Rob Walker writes the Consumed column for the magazine.

 BODY:
Over the July 4 weekend last summer, at cookouts up and down the East Coast and into the Midwest, guests arrived with packages of Al Fresco chicken sausage for their hosts to throw on the grill. At a family gathering in Kingsley, Mich. At a small barbecue in Sag Harbor, N.Y. At a 60-guest picnic in Philadelphia. 
 We know that this happened, and we even know how various party guests reacted to their first exposure to Al Fresco, because the Great Sausage Fanout of 2004 did not happen by chance. The sausage-bearers were not official representatives of Al Fresco, showing up in uniforms to hand out samples. They were invited guests, friends or relatives of whoever organized the get-togethers, but they were also -- unknown to most all the other attendees -- ''agents,'' and they filed reports. ''People could not believe they weren't pork!'' one agent related. ''I told everyone that they were low in fat and so much better than pork sausages.'' Another wrote, ''I handed out discount coupons to several people and made sure they knew which grocery stores carried them.'' Another noted that ''my dad will most likely buy the garlic'' flavor, before closing, ''I'll keep you posted.'' 
 These reports went back to the company that Al Fresco's owner, Kayem Foods, had hired to execute a ''word of mouth'' marketing campaign. And while the Fourth of July weekend was busy, it was only a couple of days in an effort that went on for three months and involved not just a handful of agents but 2,000 of them. The agents were sent coupons for free sausage and a set of instructions for the best ways to talk the stuff up, but they did not confine themselves to those ideas, or to obvious events like barbecues. Consider a few scenes from the life of just one agent, named Gabriella.
 At one grocery store, Gabriella asked a manager why there was no Al Fresco sausage available. At a second store, she dropped a card touting the product into the suggestion box. At a third, she talked a stranger into buying a package. She suggested that the organizers of a neighborhood picnic serve Al Fresco. She took some to a friend's house for dinner and (she reported back) ''explained to her how the sausage comes in six delicious flavors.'' Talking to another friend whom she had already converted into an Al Fresco customer, she noted that the product is ''not just for barbecues'' and would be good at breakfast too. She even wrote to a local priest known for his interest in Italian food, suggesting a recipe for Tuscan white-bean soup that included Al Fresco sausage. The priest wrote back to say he'd give it a try. Gabriella asked me not to use her last name. The Al Fresco campaign is over -- having notably boosted sales, by 100 percent in some stores -- but she is still spreading word of mouth about a variety of other products, and revealing her identity, she said, would undermine her effectiveness as an agent. 
 The sausage campaign was organized by a small, three-year-old company in Boston called BzzAgent, but that firm is hardly the only entity to have concluded that the most powerful forum for consumer seduction is not TV ads or billboards but rather the conversations we have in our everyday lives. The thinking is that in a media universe that keeps fracturing into ever-finer segments, consumers are harder and harder to reach; some can use TiVo to block out ads or the TV's remote control to click away from them, and the rest are simply too saturated with brand messages to absorb another pitch. So corporations frustrated at the apparent limits of ''traditional'' marketing are increasingly open to word-of-mouth marketing. One result is a growing number of marketers organizing veritable armies of hired ''trendsetters'' or ''influencers'' or ''street teams'' to execute ''seeding programs,'' ''viral marketing,'' ''guerrilla marketing.'' What were once fringe tactics are now increasingly mainstream; there is even a Word of Mouth Marketing Association. 
 Marketers bicker among themselves about how these approaches differ, but to those of us on the receiving end, the distinctions might seem a little academic. They are all attempts, in one way or another, to break the fourth wall that used to separate the theater of commerce, persuasion and salesmanship from our actual day-to-day life. To take what may be the most infamous example, Sony Ericsson in 2002 hired 60 actors in 10 cities to accost strangers and ask them: Would you mind taking my picture? Those who obliged were handed, of course, a Sony Ericsson camera-phone to take the shot, at which point the actor would remark on what a cool gadget it was. And thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event.
 This idea -- the commercialization of chitchat -- resembles a scenario from a paranoid science-fiction novel about a future in which corporations have become so powerful that they can bribe whole armies of flunkies to infiltrate the family barbecue. That level of corporate influence sounds sure to spark outrage -- another episode in the long history of mainstream distrust of commercial coercion and marketing trickery. Fear of unchecked corporate reach is what made people believe in the power of subliminal advertising and turn Vance Packard's book ''The Hidden Persuaders'' into a best seller in the 1950's; it is what gave birth to the consumer-rights movement of the 1970's; and it is what alarms people about neuroscientists supposedly locating the ''buy button'' in our brains today. Quite naturally, many of us are wary of being manipulated by a big, scary, Orwellian ''them.'' 
 In this case, however, it is not just ''them.'' It turns out that Gabriella and the rest of the sausage agents are not paid flunkies trying to manipulate Main Street Americans; they are Main Street Americans. Unlike the Sony Ericsson shills, Gabriella is not an actress. She is an accountant, with full-time work and a 12-year-old daughter, living in Bayonne, N.J. Aside from free samples, she gets no remuneration. She and her many fellow agents have essentially volunteered to create ''buzz'' about Al Fresco sausage and dozens of other products, from books to shoes to beer to perfume. BzzAgent currently has more than 60,000 volunteer agents in its network. Tremor, a word-of-mouth operation that is a division of Procter & Gamble (maker of Crest, Tide and Pampers) has an astonishing 240,000 volunteer teenagers spreading the word about everything from toothbrushes to TV shows. A spinoff, Tremor Moms, is in the works. Other marketers, particularly youth-oriented firms, have put up Web sites recruiting teenagers to serve as ''secret agents.''
 Given that we are a nation of busy, overworked people who in poll after poll claim to be sick of advertisers jumping out at us from all directions, the number of people willing to help market products they had previously never heard of, for no money at all, is puzzling to say the least. BzzAgent, which has a particularly intense relationship with its fast-growing legions of volunteers, offers a rare and revealing case study of what happens when word-of-mouth theory meets consumer psychology in the real world. In finding thousands of takers, perfectly willing to use their own creativity and contacts to spread the good news about, for instance, Al Fresco sausage, it has turned commercial influence into an open-source project. It could be thought of as not just a marketing experiment but also a social experiment. The existence of tens of thousands of volunteer marketing ''agents'' raises a surprising possibility -- that we have already met the new hidden persuaders, and they are us. 
Dave Balter, the 33-year-old founder of BzzAgent, is a smart guy, but he would be poorly cast as a slick, Madison Avenue mastermind. He's fresh-faced, good-humored, almost goofy. And he will cheerfully tell you that he has no definitive explanation for the number of average citizens who want to be, in company parlance, BzzAgents. In the beginning, he had a theory about what would motivate average citizens to generate word of mouth for his clients, but that theory was full of holes. It assumed, for instance, that agents would require some kind of quasi-financial motivation to do legwork for consumer companies.
 Dave Balter's background was in loyalty marketing -- those frequent-flier-style programs that give rewards to dedicated users of a particular product, service or credit card. He read up on word-of-mouth-marketing theory, raised some money, hired a right-hand man and put the word out among family and friends that he was looking for ''agents.'' The idea was to build a network of people who would get points for spreading ''honest word of mouth'' and could cash in the points for cool products. ''The whole concept,'' he said, ''was rewards, rewards, rewards.''
 The first full-fledged Bzz campaign was for a book called ''The Frog King.'' It lasted one month and focused on New York City. Balter persuaded Penguin Publishing to let him do it by charging the publisher nothing. 
 ''The Frog King'' was a quirky, comic first novel by a young writer named Adam Davies. Davies had some connections in New York publishing (including Liz Smith, the gossip columnist), but he wasn't exactly going to get a giant publicity blitz. ''We didn't expect much'' from the buzz campaign, recalled Rick Pascocello, a Penguin vice president.
 The guide for the agents, a no-frills seven-page document in those early days, welcomed them as members of ''an elite group'' of word-of-mouth spreaders and listed the contact information for ''your BzzLeader,'' BzzAgent JonO. (That was Jon O'Toole, Balter's right-hand man.) It summarized some of the novel's highlights, noting a few passages in particular that might be useful ''conversation points,'' and suggested tactics like reading the book on mass transit with the cover clearly visible, posting a review on Amazon.com and calling up bookstores and chatting with the clerk about this great new book about New York publishing with lots of sex and drinking whose title you can't quite recall. JonO signed the cover letter assuring agents that the folks back at the hive found the book laugh-out-loud funny. 
 Local events for ''The Frog King'' drew larger-than-expected crowds of 100 or 150 people, according to Pascocello, who said that thanks to the word-of-mouth campaign, the book sold in three months what he had hoped it would sell in a year. There are now more than 50,000 copies of ''The Frog King'' in print, and it's still selling. BzzAgent has had a steady flow of paying clients ever since (including Penguin, which has used BzzAgent to promote other books, like the novel ''The Quality of Life Report''). The fee it charges varies according to the size and nature of the campaign, but Balter said a 12-week campaign involving 1,000 agents would now cost $95,000. 
 BzzAgent has fewer than two dozen paid employees, though it is growing and recently moved to a larger office. These people are mostly young, without backgrounds in traditional marketing. When the company takes on a new client, they huddle to figure out whatever is most buzzable about the product at hand. This summer, for instance, they handed around and discussed a new line of Johnston & Murphy dress shoes, which feature a fiberglass shank, rather than a traditional metal one, so they won't set off metal detectors at airports. A whiteboard was filled with suggested conversation starters and likely sites for word-of-mouth opportunities, which later was transferred to a slick ''Bzz Guide'' for the agents. 
 As the number of agents has grown, the company can meet increasingly specific requests for, say, agents of a certain age or income level, or who live in certain parts of the country. It has done campaigns for a wide array of goods, and for major companies and brands like Anheuser-Busch, Lee Jeans, Ralph Lauren, even DuPont. Recently the company has also begun working with clients to begin converting existing loyal customers into private, well-organized, word-of-mouth missionaries. 
Although Balter says he was pleased with his agents' efforts from the start, he did worry early on that the system could not be sustained. The problem was that while agents were spreading buzz and thus earning and piling up points, most were not cashing them in. That is, they weren't bothering to collect their rewards. ''We've built a broken model,'' Balter remembers thinking. He asked his colleagues from his loyalty-marketing days: Is it that the rewards aren't good enough? Are they too hard to get? After many hours of listening to the conflicting analyses of experts, he and O'Toole decided to ask the agents themselves about the points. ''We didn't realize the agents would want to talk to us,'' Balter said. This was another miscalculation; many of the agents very much did want to talk. In essence, they told Balter that there was nothing wrong with the rewards; it was just that the rewards weren't really the point. Even now, only about a quarter of the agents collect rewards, and hardly any take all they have earned.
 Karen Bollaert, who is 32 and lives in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, was among the firm's earliest agents, and became one of its most effective. When she signed up for her first BzzAgent campaign -- ''The Frog King,'' in fact -- she was working with a pharmaceutical researcher, mostly doing paperwork, and thinking about finding a more fulfilling way to spend her days. Like everyone who signs up at the BzzAgent site, she was accepted. 
 During active stretches, Bollaert puts in between 5 and 10 hours a week talking up products and writing reports about her activities. (She has signed up for many campaigns, including a perfume called Ralph Lauren Blue, a line of jeans for Lee and something called No Puffery, a gel to soothe skin below the eyes.) What, I asked her, if not the potential to get some free prizes for effort, made her bother to volunteer with BzzAgent? First, she told me, she gets the chance to sample new products shortly before they hit the stores, so she gets to feel a bit like an insider. Second, she has always liked to give people her opinion about what she's reading or what products she's using, and BzzAgent gives her more to talk about. Third, if she does like something, then telling other people is helpful to them. So participating is both a chance to weigh in and be heard, and also something close to an act of altruism. 
 What Balter said he learned from his agents is that lots of people like to tell others what they are reading and what restaurant they've discovered and what gizmo they just bought. In his view, BzzAgent is simply harnessing, channeling and organizing that consumer enthusiasm. This is presumably why it's so easy, so natural, for someone like Karen Bollaert to work word-of-mouth efforts into daily life. When, for example, a friend mentioned to Bollaert that she would have to get up early after a late night out on the town, she brought up No Puffery. When a pharmaceutical representative visiting her office worried about looking lousy at a meeting she had to fly to, Bollaert mentioned No Puffery. At her grandfather's wake, ''a relative told me how well I was looking,'' she wrote in one report back to the BzzAgent hive, ''and I mentioned that No Puffery helped to keep me looking calm instead of puffy-eyed and as horrible as I felt.''
The endless chatter of American consumer life that BzzAgent has infiltrated is not simply a formless cacophony; it has its structures and hierarchies, which have been studied exhaustively for decades. Tremor, the Procter & Gamble word-of-mouth unit, which also does work for a variety of non-P.&G. clients, was founded four years ago with those structures in mind. A key Tremor premise is that the most effective way for a message to travel is through networks of real people communicating directly with one another. ''We set out to see if we could do that in some systematic way,'' Steve Knox, Tremor's C.E.O., said recently. He added a second, closely related premise: ''There is a group of people who are responsible for all word of mouth in the marketplace.'' In other words, some friends are more influential than others, and those are the ones who are chosen to join Tremor. 
 Who are they? Check out the word-of-mouth industry's favorite graph. The graph is meant to show the pattern by which ideas or products or behaviors are adopted, and it looks like a hill: on the left are the early adopters; then the trend-spreaders; the mainstream population is the big bulge in the middle; then come the laggards, represented by the right-hand slope. This is not new stuff -- Knox himself cites research from the 1930's, as well as the 1962 academic book ''Diffusion of Innovation,'' by Everett Rogers -- but it has become extremely popular over the past five years or so. Seth Godin, who wrote ''Permission Marketing,'' ''Unleashing the Ideavirus'' and other popular marketing books (and whose ideas partly inspired BzzAgent), uses it, as do dozens of other marketing experts. Malcolm Gladwell's ''Tipping Point'' made an argument about these ideas that was simultaneously more textured and easier to digest than most of what had come before (or since), and it became a best seller. But whatever the intentions and caveats of the various approaches to the subject, the most typical response to the graph is to zero in on the segment that forms the bridge over which certain ideas or products travel into the mainstream -- influentials, trend-translators, connectors, alphas, hubs, sneezers, bees, etc. Let's just call them Magic People.
 Knox said that Tremor's approach to finding the Magic People is intensively researched. The company tries to isolate the psychological characteristics of the subset of influential teenagers, and has developed a screening process to identify them. The details of this are a secret, but as an example, Knox noted that most teenagers have 25 or 30 names on their instant-messaging ''buddy list,'' whereas a Tremor member might have 150. Tremor recruits volunteers mostly through online advertisements and accepts only 10 or 15 percent of those who apply. The important thing, Knox said, is they are the right kind of kids -- the connected, influential trend-spreading kind. Knox mentioned a focus group of Tremor kids in Los Angeles, where several teenagers showed up with business cards. Magic.
 Janet Onyenucheya was chosen by Tremor, and she is pretty much what you picture when you picture a trend-influencer. She is 18, African-American, beautiful, smart and, on the day I met her, was wearing a really cool pair of sneakers. An intern at an independent music publishing company in Manhattan, she is preparing to enter the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the spring. She got involved with Tremor a couple of years ago, while attending LaGuardia High School. 
 Onyenucheya gets free stuff from Tremor, and sometimes even a small check for taking surveys and participating in focus groups. She got to vote on the design for a T-shirt for the 10th anniversary of the Vans Warped Tour and for the design of a Crest toothbrush. This past July, she was invited to an advance viewing of two television shows, ''Lost'' and ''Complete Savages,'' at the Millennium screening room in downtown Manhattan. There were about 70 teenagers there, and pizza and sodas for everybody. Onyenucheya particularly loved ''Lost.'' ''When I came home,'' she said, ''I immediately told my five closest friends, like: 'Oh, my God, you just missed the greatest shows. I got to go down to the Millennium and saw a show called 'Lost' and it was so good, and we have to watch it when it comes out.' And I felt like I had the upper hand. Like, 'You don't know what I know.' ''
 By and large, the word-of-mouth literature tends to describe our influence and degree of connectedness as something hard-wired. Magic People like Onyenucheya are born, not made, is the idea, which is why companies spend so much effort developing psychological profiles to find them. But the BzzAgent experiment largely discards that premise. Its agents are not screened. They are not chosen. They simply sign up. They are all kinds of people, all over the country: a 50-something bookstore owner in suburban Chicago, a young housewife near Mobile, Ala., a college student in Kansas. Many are teenagers, or even younger. At least one is 86 years old. And yet, it seems, they are able to persuade.
 Jason Desjardins is a regular guy, a good guy, accommodating and polite. Twenty-eight, slim, clean-shaven, with close-cropped hair, he is the dairy manager at a supermarket in rural New Hampshire, part of the same supermarket chain he has worked for since high school. While he was wearing a Brooklyn T-shirt when we met, the truth is he bought it at the Old Navy in the Concord mall, and has never been on an airplane or even traveled outside of New England. Jason Desjardins is sweet and guileless, but he is not, by any expert definition, a Magic Person. 
 Desjardins stumbled across a reference to BzzAgent online, and he was interested. How could this thing work? He signed up, and soon after, they sent him ''Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable'' -- Seth Godin's most recent book at the time, which was written with a BzzAgent marketing plan in mind -- and his life changed. It's hard to overstate how enthusiastic Desjardins is about BzzAgent. He joined campaigns for several other books, as well as for a beer called Bare Knuckle Stout, a spam-blocking service called Mail-Block and, yes, Al Fresco sausage. He figures he spends about 10 hours a week either buzzing or writing reports about buzzing. I visited him at his apartment in Bradford, N.H. We were joined by his wife, Melissa, a pretty woman with a stylish haircut and a big smile, and their 2-year-old daughter. I wondered how Melissa felt about her husband spending so much time on a no-money hobby. In fact, she was thrilled. She said she thought it had made him more open to other people. He used to be the kind of guy who just hated to call a mechanic about a noise the car was making; he would wait until the car actually broke down and he had no choice but to bother someone about it. He was in a shell. But that has changed -- partly because of Melissa, Jason wisely interjected -- but also partly because of his involvement in BzzAgent.
 For starters, Desjardins said, BzzAgent ''turned me on to reading.'' And having enjoyed ''Purple Cow,'' he wanted to do his best to spread the word. The Bzz guide suggested he call a bookstore. For a while, he put it off. He would look at the phone and tell himself, I can do this, and he would try to rehearse what he would say, and this would go on for 15 or 20 minutes. ''I thought: What have I got to lose?'' he said. ''I'm never going to see this person.'' And finally he called and pretended he did not know the name of Seth Godin's new book. ''He'll call anybody now,'' Melissa said, smiling. 
 He printed slogans from ''Purple Cow'' (''Be Remarkable or Be Invisible'') onto card stock and hung them where his fellow employees could see them. He posted reviews on Amazon. He started conversations with co-workers, customers, strangers. He submitted a rave review for a fantasy novel he was buzzing called ''Across the Nightingale Floor'' to The Concord Monitor, and it was published; there's a laminated copy of the review on the fridge. He wrote to the governor touting Mail-Block. At the grocery store, when a co-worker moaned about not liking her job, Desjardins practically turned into a motivational speaker, waving his hands and quoting from another book called ''Five Patterns of Extraordinary Careers,'' telling her that if she wasn't happy she needed to take control of the situation. ''She did end up finding another job after that,'' he observed. Desjardins is ranked the 45th most effective BzzAgent, out of 60,000 nationwide, and proud of it. He has learned to influence.
This was all good for Desjardins, but it complicates what we thought we knew about word-of-mouth influence. The whole premise of the Magic People is that the rest of us take our cues from them because they have some special credibility, in the form of reputation or expertise or connections. In April 2003, that premise was put to the test when BzzAgent began a 13-week campaign for a restaurant chain called Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery, which has about 30 locations around the country. This particular campaign was studied by two academics: David Godes, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, and Dina Mayzlin, an assistant professor at Yale's School of Management. The experiment involved more than 1,000 subjects; some were devoted Rock Bottom customers, and the rest were BzzAgents -- none of them Rock Bottom loyalists, and only a few had even heard of the chain. Rock Bottom wasn't running any other significant marketing program at the time. 
 Sales increased markedly. Godes and Mayzlin found that, consistent with past research, word of mouth traveled more effectively when it was spread not through close friends but through acquaintances (meaning that networkers -- the people with the big Buddy Lists -- are more valuable). But curiously, it turned out that the agents -- the ''nonloyals'' -- were more effective spreaders of word of mouth than the chain's own fans. Godes and Mayzlin hypothesize that the Rock Bottom's most devoted customers had probably already talked up the restaurant to all the friends and acquaintances that they were likely to tell. 
 The researchers also looked at the tendency of marketing efforts to focus on ''opinion leaders,'' who often gain that social status by way of expertise. The results here were somewhat mixed, in an interesting way. A loyal opinion leader -- someone who was seen by her social network as an expert on restaurants and who was also a Rock Bottom fan -- was pretty effective; if that restaurant expert was ambivalent about Rock Bottom, she was of little use. In contrast, it didn't really matter if the nonloyal agents knew much about restaurants. What mattered was that they told a lot of people (and presumably that they were enthusiastic). The implication is that it doesn't matter if you know what you're talking about, as long as you are willing to talk a lot. 
 Godes offered some caveats to that particular conclusion. He pointed out that expertise may be much more important to real-world word of mouth -- the kind that occurs absent an orchestrated effort to create buzz from scratch. He also emphasized that willingness to talk doesn't mean much if you have no one to talk to. Maybe so. But when Dave Balter saw the results, it provided strong evidence for a position he had been coming to for a while: he doesn't quite believe in Magic People anymore. BzzAgent's system does, of course, try to identify who has a large network of friends, who is an expert, who is outspoken, just as Tremor does in its screening. (Actually, several BzzAgents are Tremor members, as well.) ''But we also know that sometimes those people aren't the best at spreading word of mouth,'' Balter said. ''We all get information from people around us who don't fit any type of profile that would make them more intelligent or more focused on products than someone else.'' And the information we share changes, too. ''We might go from influential to noninfluential, from trendsetter to nontrendsetter all year long,'' he suggested, ''because we have continued interactions that change our opinions.''
 On some level, then, participating in a voluntary marketing army serves as a kind of consumer-status enabler. You weren't the first on your block with Moon Boots; at least you can be the one to tell your friends about Al Fresco sausage. The more people you can persuade that Al Fresco sausage is good, the better you'll feel about your discovery. BzzAgent, in turn, will help you be a better persuader. Pretty much everyone likes the feeling of having ''the upper hand,'' as Janet Onyenucheya put it. Even in the small orbit of your own social circle, knowing about something first -- telling a friend about a new CD, or discovering a restaurant before anyone else in the office -- is satisfying. Maybe it's altruism, maybe it's a power trip, but influencing other people feels good. As an example of how powerful the desire to have the upper hand can be, consider that some participants in a campaign for a new scent called Ralph Cool simply could not wait for their free sample to arrive and rushed out to buy the $40 product so they could start buzzing. Word-of-mouth marketing leverages not simply the power of the trendsetter but also, as Balter puts it, ''the power of wanting to be a trendsetter.''
BzzAgents are under no obligation to push a product they don't like. In fact, if they think it's awful, they're encouraged to say so. Yet, of all the agents I spoke to, and the hundreds of reports I read, there were hardly any examples of outright dissatisfaction with a product. Most of the agents seemed genuinely excited about most of what they were buzzing. 
 Part of the reason is that people tend to join campaigns for things that interest them. Perhaps just as important is that the volunteers, hearing that BzzAgent turns down 80 percent of potential clients, seem to believe that the folks at BzzAgent spend their days sorting through the morass of consumer culture, choosing only the best of the best. BzzAgent does want to keep lousy products out of the system, of course, but it also wants to make money. It's a business. And its ability to keep the system relatively free of awful products probably has much less to do with acting as a consumer-culture curator than with the simple fact that there are probably more perfectly good products being sold in America now than at any time in history. 
 Barry Schwartz, a psychology professor at Swarthmore, is the author of ''The Paradox of Choice,'' a book that addresses the incredible (and at times paralyzing) abundance of options available to the contemporary consumer. In the past, Schwartz notes, the challenge for the consumer was navigating a world of faulty, shoddy or unsafe products. That's not much of an issue anymore. Now, Schwartz told me, Consumer Reports might test 40 stoves, find that 38 of them are pretty good and then resort to sifting among increasingly minor differences to decide which one is the very best value of all, by however narrow a margin. The ''Pretty Good'' Problem complicates our lives as consumers and makes it increasingly difficult for one of those 38 stoves to stand out. But it gives BzzAgent plenty of work. 
 Still, people's tastes differ, and it seems remarkable that agents are so rarely disappointed. One oddity that Schwartz notes in his book is the ''endowment effect.'' This is one of the many discoveries of the behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They found that when two items of equal value are handed out randomly to a group of people and those people are given the opportunity to trade, hardly anyone does. It's very unlikely that all the participants were randomly handed the objects they would have preferred had they been asked in advance, so the economists concluded that once something has been given to us, we value it more. In another experiment, conducted in the early 1990's by a psychology professor at the University of Louisville, two groups of subjects were given nine similarly valued objects and asked to rate the desirability of each. The group that was informed in advance it would get to keep one of the items (one of those insulating tubes that keeps canned drinks cold, as it happens) gave that item a more desirable rating than the other objects. The group that didn't get to keep anything rated them all the same. A follow-up experiment found that this ''mere ownership effect'' was essentially instantaneous. Other studies have shown that we like things more simply by virtue of repeated or prolonged exposure to them. (Which could explain why, during the course of that Johnston & Murphy meeting, I gradually went from being indifferent to the shoes to wishing I could get a pair.) 
 This research on how we value -- or irrationally overvalue -- things that are given to us might help explain why BzzAgents and other word-of-mouth volunteers get excited about whatever they are asked to push. (And if you're curious why, in light of this, you're not crazy about every product you've ever bought, the answer may be adaptation -- our tendency to get used to our possessions and, in effect, fall out of love with them. For the word-of-mouth volunteer this hardly matters, since by the time it happens the campaign is over.) But it doesn't address another mystery: Why would the volunteers work so hard to get other people excited about these products? Another line of research suggests a possible answer. This school of thought would characterize word-of-mouth volunteers as operating not in a traditional money-in-exchange-for-effort ''monetary market,'' but rather in a ''social market.'' A social market is what we engage in when we ask our friends to help us load up the moving van in exchange for pizza. The research suggests that we are likely to get a better effort out of our friends under the social-market scenario than by offering the cash equivalent of the pizza. (A recent article in the journal Psychological Science finds that ''monetizing'' a gift, like the pizza, by announcing how much it is worth, effectively shifts the whole situation from social market to monetary market.) Under some circumstances, we will expend more effort for social rewards than we will for monetary rewards. This suggests that the agents may do more to spread word of mouth precisely because they are not being paid. 
 Add to all of this the idea that they have been granted status as ''agents'' in an ''elite group'' that most of the world doesn't even know about, and have received a free sample of a brand-new product from a source that they trust, and they are almost certain to expend some kind of effort, unless the product is truly awful.
There is another advantage to the social market. Since the agents are not being paid, and have the option to ignore any Bzz object they don't like, they tend to see themselves as not being involved in marketing at all. Almost all of the BzzAgents I interviewed made this point. ''In marketing, obviously, those people are paid to pump a product, whereas I'm not really getting paid to do this,'' Bollaert, the agent from Brooklyn, explained. ''I don't talk about a product if I don't feel strongly about it. I'll give my honest opinion.''
 The notion of the ''honest opinion'' came up again and again in conversations with the agents and with Balter. Seth Godin, the writer and speaker on marketing whose ideas partly inspired BzzAgent, agrees that the agents' honesty is crucial. Paying people to promote products, hiring supermodels to show up in a bar and request a particular vodka, is ''disingenuous, dishonest and almost unethical,'' and it represents a subversion of honest peer-to-peer communication. And honest peer-to-peer communication, he maintains, is the future of marketing. 
 Godin is not just a BzzAgent fan -- he's also a client. ''Purple Cow'' was marketed through BzzAgent, and Godin quietly plugs the company at the end of the book. He describes BzzAgent as a company at the center of a conversation between its corporate clients and thousands of agents who serve as a kind of guild of consumers. ''I think this is a new kind of media,'' he said. Specifically, this new kind of media is people like Gabriella, or Desjardins, or Bollaert, chatting with friends and strangers.
 This argument requires you to accept that a conversation can be honest even if one participant has a hidden agenda. Whether that's possible is something I asked several agents, and Balter himself several times. Of course the agents believe in their own integrity, but that's the easy part. Do we really want a world where every conversation about a product might be secretly tied to a word-of-mouth ''campaign''? Doesn't that kind of undermine, you know, the fabric of social discourse? 
 ''The key is,'' Balter said, ''people already talk about this stuff. They already talk about things they love.'' Manufactured word of mouth is indeed a bad and scary thing, he maintains, but that's not what his company is doing. ''For whatever reason, we have this natural instinct to tell a friend about a product -- and to get them to believe what you believe. We're not trying to change that. All we're trying to do is put some form around it, so it can be measured and understood. That's not changing the social fabric.''
 It is certainly easier to defend the voluntary buzz-spreaders as less devious than the paid model pretending to like a product in public -- but the honesty and openness come with an asterisk or two. Those suggestions in the Bzz guides to call bookstores and pretend you don't know the exact title or author you're looking for are pretty hard to define as ''honest.'' Similarly, it's most unlikely that Amazon.com (let alone The Concord Monitor) would consider the reviews of a BzzAgent quite as unbiased and helpful to readers as a review from someone who hadn't consulted talking points compiled with input from the publisher. The whole tone of the Bzz guides -- which read like a cross between a brochure and a training manual -- is a bit difficult to square with the idea of genuineness. 
 Finally, while BzzAgent tells its volunteers that they are under no obligation to hide their association with the company and its campaigns, the reality is that most of them do hide it most of the time. They don't tell the people they are ''bzzing,'' that they really found out about the sausage, or the perfume, or the shoes, or the book, from some company in Boston that charges six-figure fees to corporations. ''It just seems more natural, when I talk about something, if people don't think I'm trying to push a product,'' Karen Bollaert explained to me. Other agents said the same. Gabriella, for instance, insisted that she really does think Al Fresco makes the best sausage around. Basically, they trust BzzAgent, and they trust themselves, so they don't see a problem. 
 Nevertheless, Jason Desjardins has told a few people about his efforts for BzzAgent, with mixed results. Some people thought it sounded exciting. Others, however, said they felt ''used.'' One friend he tried to recruit now responds with suspicion when Desjardins talks up something he has done: ''Are you buzzing me?'' the friend will ask. Desjardins shrugs. ''I've been honest about everything.'' 
 One reward Bollaert did collect from BzzAgent was, of all things, the William Gibson novel ''Pattern Recognition'' -- an actual paranoid science-fiction novel about a future in which corporations have become so powerful they can bribe flunkies to infiltrate your life and talk up products. ''It made me think, when somebody says something about a product - I wonder. That gave me a little pause,'' she said. Earlier in our conversation, I touted my iPod. Wouldn't she feel differently about my comments, I asked, if it turned out that I'd gotten it from Apple or a BzzAgent equivalent? ''That's true,'' she said. ''But you know what? If you start questioning everyone's motives, then you'll be in a home with tinfoil on your head.''
 The motives of chattering consumers can, of course, be biased in all kinds of ways. If your friend is bragging about his great new cellphone, he may not be a buzz agent, but he may not be the purely rational information source you assume. He says it's the best phone around, and maybe he even believes it -- but the truth may be that he bought it because it looks cool and he read that Jake Gyllenhaal has one just like it. It may be true that we trust our friends more than TV ads, but that doesn't actually mean they've become more reliable.
 ''I think we all do this naturally anyway,'' Bollaert concluded. ''If you find something you like and somebody asks your advice and you have a product, good or bad, you'll say don't get it or do get it. We're a consumer society.''
Crucial to the BzzAgent system is the small team of young people in Boston who read and answer every single Bzz report. They offer encouragement, tips on how to improve word-of-mouth strategies. Every report is rated and every agent ranked according to a complicated formula, one that is constantly being tweaked, taking into account everything from how often the agent reports to how many people they tend to buzz to the quality of their summaries -- plus intangibles like originality. (This system is part of BzzAgent's defense against people signing up for free stuff and simply making up fake reports about their buzz activities; the home office is trained to spot such things.) Along with the feedback, they almost always throw in a joke or a comment so it's clear that they have actually read the report. 
 No doubt because of this, many agent reports are full of personality. Some are almost confessional; others are revealing perhaps without intending to be. Casual mentions of boyfriend or girlfriend problems come up, as do complaints about bosses, friends, strangers. One of the most memorable was from a young BzzAgent who reported that a man she met in a bar complimented her on her Ralph Cool perfume, one thing led to another and they spent the night together. The next morning he asked about the perfume again and said he liked it so much he might have to buy some for his wife. (These reports are ultimately handed over to the client -- a trove of anecdotal research from the front lines of consumption.)
 Along the way, Agent JonO has become a kind of celebrity, or at least a figure of mystery. There are more calls and e-mail messages and instant messages to ''JonO'' than Jon O'Toole himself can possibly deal with, so lately JonO has become more of a construct than a person. Jason Desjardins sounds honored to have had a chance to meet the real JonO not long ago: O'Toole lined up a dinner in Cambridge with several BzzAgent volunteers, to meet them and hear their thoughts and ideas. Desjardins was so excited about this that at first he overlooked the fact that it was on the same night as his wedding anniversary. (Melissa encouraged him to go anyway. ''But we'll see if JonO is still there for you 10 years from now,'' she said.) 
 Balter did not count on the agents taking BzzAgent so seriously. He still doesn't seem to know quite what to make of it. He has met only a handful of agents, and while he said he intends to meet more, he sounded almost nervous about it. A number of those he has met have been almost apologetic about not doing more -- about not buzzing enough on this or that campaign. The biggest complaints come from people who say they have not been invited to join enough campaigns. One agent resigned because he said he was unsure whether he could live up to BzzAgent's ethical standards. 
 This might be the most peculiar thing about BzzAgent: not only are its volunteer agents willing to become shock troops in the marketing revolution, but many of them are flat-out excited about it. At his apartment, Desjardins told me about another book he had read because of BzzAgent. Called ''Join Me,'' it's about a guy who decides he wants to start some sort of voluntary group -- a commune, a cult, whatever you want to call it. He puts an ad in the paper that just says, ''Join me,'' and to his surprise, people are interested. They didn't know what they were joining, or why, but they joined anyway. The guy, whose name is Danny Wallace, decided to turn his followers into a good-deeds army, basically on the ''Pay It Forward'' method. The book is nonfiction. 
 Why, I asked Desjardins, did people join a group without even knowing what it was? Well, he explained, Wallace's theory was that they just wanted to be part of something. That made sense to me. After all, some people are lucky enough to find meaning and fulfillment through their work, family or spirituality. But many people don't. Many people have boring jobs and indifferent bosses. They feel ignored by politicians. They send e-mail to customer service and no one responds. They get no feedback. It's easy to feel helpless, uncounted, disconnected. Do you think, I asked Desjardins, that there's some element of that going on with BzzAgent? 
 ''I think for some people it probably is,'' he answered. ''For me, it's being part of something big. I think it's such a big thing that's going to shape marketing. To actually be one of the people involved in shaping that is, to me, big.'' That made sense to me too. After all, there is one thing that is even more powerful than the upper hand, more seductive than persuading: believing.

HEADLINE: Natives' Land Battles Bring a Shift in Canada Economy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: SKIDEGATE, British Columbia 

 BODY:
In this rainy land of scarlet dawns and big black bears, workers are busy constructing a 40,000-square-foot extension to a museum that sits in a bushy cove where gray whales come to eat herring and roll over the shell beach to scratch barnacles off their bellies.
 It is an ambitious project, not least because the hundreds of traditional masks, carvings and blankets the building is meant to display for the native Haida people still belong to some of the world's most prestigious museums. Resistance to the return of artifacts is likely, but the Haida have become used to challenging the rich and powerful, and winning.
 Today they are in the vanguard of what appears to be a renaissance of Indian nations in Canada that legal scholars and others say could determine ultimate control over many resources vital to Canada's future, including oil, timber and diamonds.
 The Haida won a landmark case in November in Canada's Supreme Court obliging British Columbia to consult with them over land use anywhere on their traditional homelands here on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The decision is expected to have a sweeping impact on similar Indian claims across Canada. 
 Adapting their old warrior ways to federal and provincial courtrooms, the Haida have already managed to slow efforts to clear-cut their lands by Weyerhaeuser and other companies. They have stalled plans by Petro-Canada and other companies to drill in ancestral waters should a government moratorium be lifted along the coast.
 They are not alone in their efforts. Native bands are similarly exerting increasing control over natural resources across vast stretches of northern Canada that promise to be vital economically in a future of global warming. The developments have pleased environmentalists. But some legal experts warn that the stirrings represent a danger to the unity of a nation already struggling to keep separatist leanings in Quebec under control. There has not been a full-blown public debate on the issue, partly because most Canadians agree that native people deserve better conditions. 
 ''When you wed the notion of sovereign self-governments to land claims that are far-reaching and poisonous to investors, you create an ungovernable, uneconomic and unharmonious community of Canada,'' John D. Weston, a constitutional lawyer who has worked for the British Columbia government, said in an interview. 
 The balance of power is already tipping in a nation where a vast majority of the population lives within 100 miles of the United States border and rarely thinks about developments in the far north. In the Northwest Territories, the 4,000-member Dogrib band last year won the right to control fishing, hunting and industrial development over 15,000 square miles of territory.
 The nearby Deh Cho band has managed to stall a $6 billion gas pipeline project planned by ExxonMobil and several other companies through its traditional lands until Ottawa makes major financial and environmental concessions.
 In the snowy woods of northern Quebec, the Cree made a deal three years ago with the provincial government giving them full autonomy and substantial powers to help manage mining, forestry and hydroelectric energy development.
 After Eskimos gained their own Arctic territory, Nunavut, in 1999, they have since won self-rule in northern Quebec and logging rights over a vast forest in Labrador.
 ''The groundwork is being laid for the possibility that aboriginal people will have more power and real participation in national politics,'' said Dara Culhane, an anthropologist at Simon Fraser University. 
 For the Haida, their revival has yet to penetrate the consciousness of most Canadians. But already their efforts have produced a bright new chapter in a history of highs and lows that stretches back many centuries.
 The Haida carved the mightiest totem polls and swiftest canoes out of giant cedar trees before the Europeans arrived in the mid-18th century on this remote archipelago. They were fierce conquerors and vibrant storytellers, and their rich culture spread up and down the coast. 
 While never conquered in war, they were nearly wiped out by smallpox -- reduced from a population of 6,000 or more to 500 by the late 19th century. Canadian government policies until the late 1960's focused on forcing them to assimilate, leaving only a handful of people speaking Haida and a sad tableau of poverty and addiction.
 There is still a lot of unemployment and substance abuse here, but there are signs of a rebirth. While the elders are taping 25,000 Haida idiomatic expressions to save the language, the use of Haida phrases in everyday conversation has become fashionable at the local high school. There is a boomlet of construction in totem poles and longhouses. Women are spearing abalone again. 
 In the village of Massett, the first Haida canoe wedding in the traditional style in 80 years was held last year, with the groom not permitted to paddle ashore with his family and friends for the ceremony until he agreed to love his bride forever and serve her breakfast in bed for the rest of her life.
 The Haida, like many native groups, has a high birthrate, and the population has grown again, to about 4,000 on the islands. A resurgence in handicrafts and spiritual healing has bolstered self-esteem.
 When Ottawa created a new $20 bill this summer decorated with a print of a Haida myth depicting a raven, a frog, a grizzly bear and his human wife, the Bear Mother, the government intended to honor the ascendant band.
 ''We've come into a new age,'' said Gilbert Parnell, a 39-year-old guide. ''There's so much strength we find in our songs, dances and stories and we need to keep up the momentum to clean up our nation.''
 When the provincial government withdrew financing for a local program to maintain the salmon population three years ago, the Haida Nation took over operations to save jobs and keep Pallant Creek teeming with chum and coho salmon. The Haida are pushing forward with a land use program, using computer software to map surveys of bear dens, seabird nesting areas and other habitat to protect them from logging. 
 ''We're a few thousand people with no resources except a stubborn belief that we are the owners of this land just as our parents and grandparents believed,'' said Guujaaw, the charismatic Haida president who uses only one name, while sitting on a log along a forest river. ''If they fly the Canadian flag over the land, they think they have the right to spoil it. For us, that is unacceptable.''
 Much of the renewed energy was generated in recent years by a successful effort to repatriate 500 ancestral remains from private collections and major museums in Canada and the United States, including the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
 Village youth took part in making and painting burial boxes, cedar mats and button blankets to properly lay to rest ancestors who had been taken off the islands by researchers and thieves.
 Harold Williams, a 20-year-old student, said he was so inspired when he painted burial boxes and made cedar mats for the burials that it changed his life. He went on to make an animated movie of a Haida warrior capturing and slaying an escaped slave.
 ''Its part of our history after all,'' he said. ''We have the weight of the culture on our shoulders.''

HEADLINE: Frances Chaney, 89, Rising Star Blacklisted Along With Lardner

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Frances Chaney, a radio star whose budding film career was stifled after she and her husband, Ring Lardner Jr., were placed on a Hollywood blacklist, died on Nov. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 89. 
 Ms. Chaney, who had Alzheimer's disease, died in her sleep, said her son James. 
 Mr. Lardner was one of the Hollywood 10, jailed in 1950 for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer whether they were Communists. Ms. Chaney was blacklisted because she was correctly assumed to be, as Mr. Lardner's wife, a Communist.
 Ms. Chaney found herself unemployed after years appearing on popular radio series like ''Topper,'' ''Gangbusters'' and ''Mr. District Attorney.'' At one point, she spent her mornings playing an ingenue in ''House in the Country'' and her afternoons playing the worldly Burma in ''Terry and the Pirates.''
 She had parlayed her radio work into a few screen parts before the blacklist started costing her jobs, but she was able to win parts in Off Broadway and Broadway plays, including understudying for Maureen Stapleton, Kim Stanley and Claudette Colbert.
 By the time the blacklist's power faded, Ms. Chaney was entrenched as a stage actress. She worried that she was being typecast as a Jewish mother, a part she played in ''Golda'' on Broadway with Anne Bancroft, in James Lapine's Off Broadway ''Table Settings,'' and in three separate productions of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing.''
 Born Fanya Lipetz on July 23, 1915, in Odessa, Ukraine, Ms. Chaney immigrated with her parents to the Bronx when she was a child. After briefly attending Hunter College, she studied on a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. 
 In the 1960's, she had a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night.'' 
 Ms. Chaney's first husband, David Lardner, was a younger brother of Ring Lardner Jr.'s. David Lardner died in 1944. Ring Lardner Jr. died in 2000. 
 In addition to her son James, of Manhattan, Ms. Chaney is survived by a daughter, Katharine, of Manhattan; another son, Joseph, of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Peter, of St. Augustine, Fla., and Ann Waswo, of Oxford, England; seven grandchildren; and eight great-granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Chief's Retrial, 146 Years in the Making

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
There are no living witnesses, and the defendant himself has been unavailable since 1858, when he was hanged before a crowd after being convicted of capital murder. 
 But 146 years later, the chief justice of the Washington State Supreme Court has convened what for this state may be the ultimate trial in absentia: a new day in court for Chief Leschi, a revered icon of the Nisqually Indians of Washington and a celebrated American Indian martyr who was convicted in the killing of a white militiaman in an 1855 war.
 The trial, to begin here on Friday, should determine, after a century and a half of debate, whether Chief Leschi was wrongly put to death for killing A.B. Moses, a volunteer colonel, in what historians say was the first recorded case of capital punishment in Washington territory. The chief's descendents and some historians insist he did not kill the colonel. 
 ''This really is uncharted territory,'' said the chief justice, Gerry L. Alexander, who convened the court after the State Legislature last March asked the court to reexamine Chief Leschi's case, following lobbying by descendants of the chief and others. ''It's got real challenges and greater difficulty.'' 
 The judges will have to step back into the 19th century and make sense of a dusty historical record rife with gaps and unanswered questions and containing dense trial minutes scrawled by hand. The witnesses to be called are historians, military law experts and a few of the chief's 100 or so descendants. But the case will be tried by prosecutors and defense lawyers, including a county official here who supports the death penalty but is defending Chief Leschi. 
 ''We can't even reconstruct this because nobody is living,'' said Justice Alexander, who declined to have the Supreme Court retry the case but created a special court instead. ''The passage of time makes it extremely difficult to do this. But it is like a regular trial, because what you are doing at a trial is searching for the truth. So we're searching for it as best as we humanly can.''
 Such re-examinations of trials and other historical events are not unheard of, and re-enactments are common. They have ranged from bar association mock trials to official inquiries, addressing questions like whether Mrs. O'Leary's cow really did start the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 or whether John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln. They included a 2001 case here in which the State Supreme Court ruled that a Japanese-American law school graduate who was denied entry to the state bar in 1902 should be posthumously admitted. 
 In the Leschi case, Washington's Historical Court of Inquiry and Justice, as the one-time court here has been christened, will have no legal authority to reverse the chief's murder conviction. But even if only symbolic, the findings of this court, comprised of seven active and recently retired Washington judges, may provide Chief Leschi's descendents with the exoneration they have long sought.
 ''We finally have a generation that's willing to listen clearly to the evidence,'' said Cynthia Iyall, a descendent of the chief and an economic development planner for the Nisqually Tribe, on a visit this week to his grave here. 
 If Chief Leschi (pronounced LESH-eye) is found not guilty, Ms. Iyall said some members of the Nisqually tribe of about 500 would try to update the many history books and other pieces of literature that mention him in Washington, where one tranquil lakeside Seattle neighborhood, Leschi, is named after him, along with schools and a waterfront park. 
 ''At least we will be able to add a chapter or a paragraph to every story that is out there, a correct ending to every story, added in 2004,'' Ms. Iyall said. 
 The chief was hanged after two federal territorial court trials. After the first resulted in a deadlocked jury, he was convicted in the 1855 killing. The victim was a militiaman, and he was shot to death in an ambush on a prairie in western Washington in Indian-settler wars, according to historical accounts. Questions were raised from the outset about whether Chief Leschi was even at the ambush, said Melissa Parr, a curator at the Washington State History Museum and member of the Committee to Exonerate Chief Leschi, which lobbied the Legislature for a re-examination of the case and an official apology to the tribe. 
 Even if the chief did kill the man, the descendents and some historians say that as a lawful combatant in war, Chief Leschi should never have been accused of murder. They also say that the second jury was not instructed to consider the laws of war, which could have exonerated him even if he had been found to have killed the militiaman. 
 And the chief's descendents, who live on a small reservation 30 miles south of here and who grew up hearing stories about him, said only a judicial exoneration, not a re-enactment of a trial or even a pardon from a governor or president, would bring the case to a close for them.
 ''I think he's watching from up above and he's clapping his hands and saying, 'Well, you finally did it,''' said Cecelia Svinth Carpenter, 80, a Nisqually Indian elder, historian and author, who wrote a biography of Chief Leschi, and with Ms. Iyall and Ms. Parr led a two-year effort to get the case reopened. ''My dream was always to clear his name. Even as a child I thought about it, that it was a necessary thing to do.''
 Chief Leschi's gravestone, on a hill in a small tribal cemetery here, has regular visitors, who have left necklaces, flowers and baskets of pine cones around the small granite monument. An inscription on the back of Chief Leschi's stone, written in 1929, says the chief was ''judicially murdered Feb. 19, 1858, owing to misunderstanding.''
 Two prosecutors from the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney's office who volunteered to argue in the new trial in support of the chief's conviction will try to prove that he was given his due process, including an appeal. 
 One of the prosecutors, Carl T. Hultman, said he once lived in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle and was stunned later to discover that it was named after a convicted murder. Mr. Hultman said he was still preparing his arguments for the trial but that his basic approach was that cases have to end some time.
 ''We have a process that's supposed to allow for a fair ending, but it's also supposed to allow for the ending of conflicts, a finality,'' he said. ''You don't just argue on forever about things.'' 
 But one of the lawyers defending Chief Leschi, John W. Ladenburg, the Pierce County executive who supports the death penalty, said he felt the case had long cried out for re-examination. 
 ''We can't un-hang him,'' Mr. Ladenburg said. 
 But, he added: ''I think it is important to set the record straight in these kinds of cases. It will be a challenge to make it come alive for people, as if Leschi were there in the courtroom and we were arguing over his life.''

HEADLINE: A Working Minimum Wage

 BODY:
Last summer, with an eye to this year's election, the New York Legislature decided the time had come to lift the state's minimum wage above the $5.15 an hour provided under federal law. While legislators did not exactly offer a Wall Street bonus to those working at grocery checkout counters or anywhere else on the lower rungs of America's economic ladder, they did approve a $2 increase over the next year and a half. This modest increase, following similar increases in other states with high costs of living like California, was intended to help workers without overburdening businesses. 
 The Democratic Assembly and the Republican Senate both passed the bill with plenty of votes to spare. Then Gov. George Pataki vetoed it, arguing that the state should wait for Washington to raise the minimum wage for the whole country at once. But the new Congress -- which could be more conservative than the one that is about to leave Washington -- appears unlikely to concern itself with wages for the poor or near-poor anytime soon. So it is up to New York's Legislature to override the governor and give this state's working poor a raise.
 The Democrats in the Assembly have already voted to override. That leaves the Republican Senate -- where members voted for the increase 51 to 7 on the first round -- to come back and do it again. Only 42 votes in the Senate are needed to override, but Joseph Bruno, the majority leader, refused to allow his members to address the matter again before the November election. Mr. Bruno's delaying tactics made it hard not to conclude that the Senate Republicans wanted to have it both ways. They wanted a recorded vote in favor of increasing the minimum wage to impress voters who liked the idea. But they could tell their more conservative constituents that the bill had not actually become law.
 Mr. Bruno now says he hopes to have a minimum wage increase in effect by January. If he is serious, a vote could occur as early as tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to go back to work. There are lots of items members should address, like budget reform, rules reform, electoral reform and an expanded lobbying law to cover state contracts. But the first and easiest piece of business to dispense with is the minimum wage. It would take just a few minutes to give a holiday gift to millions of people who labor so hard in this state for so little money.

HEADLINE: Secret City In the Clouds

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
TRIBECA, a longtime artists' neighborhood turned real estate magnet for the rich and fabulous, doesn't wear its wealth on its sleeve. It wears it on its head. While Wall Street millionaires and media celebrities live in relative anonymity behind the area's unostentatious 19th-century commercial facades, TriBeCa's rooftops are being dressed up in remarkable fashion.
 Even some TriBeCan old-timers, when they climb to a roof to survey the area, are surprised to discover how much of the neighborhood appears to have been furtively outfitted by a luxury haberdasher. From Canal Street south to Murray, from Broadway west to West Street, every third building seems to be topped with a fancy hat.
 Set back from the facades of the buildings they sit on, and thus largely hidden from the street below, these private rooftop structures range from the quietly whimsical to the gleefully sybaritic: an exotic Moroccan tent in red, green and gold; a 75-seat outdoor movie theater with a bubbling hot tub; lush gardens evocative of the English countryside; a private lap pool set into a 2,200-square-foot terrace. 
 ''They're these oases that nobody knows anything about,'' said Richard Reichgut, a software marketing executive who lives in hedonistic splendor with his partner, James Ronald Whitney, in a penthouse duplex on Duane Street. ''Unless you or a friend has a rooftop, you would have no idea these spaces exist.''
 The past five years have seen dozens of additions to the neighborhood's rarefied skyline civilization. But because much of TriBeCa lies within city-designated historic districts and is controlled by a variety of zoning and landmark restrictions, TriBeCa's secret city in the clouds has burgeoned largely out of view of hoi polloi on the pavement below. And it is the hidden nature of these places, along with their sometimes flamboyant, over-the-top ostentation, that is perhaps their most defining feature.
 ''It's something new in New York,'' said David Garrard Lowe, author of the new book ''Art Deco New York.'' ''We used to build apartment buildings on Fifth Avenue or West End Avenue that made it clear to anyone going by that this was for upper-middle-class people or the upper class. This new building on top of roofs is, in a sense, a disguise of how much wealth there is. But at the same time, when you go there, they want to make it clear it's opulent.'' 
 TriBeCa's exclusive aeries, atop roofs that in the past were more likely to be decorated with water towers and lawn chairs, are also a telling sign that the city is increasingly home to large numbers of people for whom money is not only no object but practically an afterthought. ''It's a very European sense of hiding your wealth, and it becomes very secretive and almost antisocial,'' Mr. Lowe said. ''It's a society headed toward, as they used to say in Naples, public squalor and individual opulence. We don't have public squalor in TriBeCa, but I've seen a couple of those places and it's astonishing. It's a little like Xanadu.''

A Theater, a Shrine, Even a Forest
 When Mr. Reichgut and Mr. Whitney moved to 129 Duane from the Flatiron district in 1997, the spiral staircase in their penthouse loft led up to nothing more glamorous than an expanse of tar and some weathered parapets. Sitting on the roof on a carpet remnant and contemplating the hefty sums that a high-end rooftop addition would entail, Mr. Reichgut pronounced himself happy with the space just as it was.
 ''I, on the other hand, envisioned a big movie screen where we could sit in a hot tub and screen dailies instead of sitting in a boring, ugly editing suite,'' recalled Mr. Whitney, a filmmaker whose 2002 documentary ''Telling Nicholas'' included images of the World Trade Center collapse that were filmed from the roof. ''I think the older you get, the more toys you need.''
 Three years and half a million dollars later, the couple's lavish rooftop playpen was complete. On a recent sunny morning, as Ashanti throbbed through 10 outdoor speakers, the pair enumerated the roof's creature comforts. The staircase now led to a set of white leather furniture and a Triton synthesizer inside a gleaming glass-and-steel solarium. Just outside, a steaming hot tub and sleek Philippe Starck chairs and sofas provided seating from which to watch the 15-foot-wide outdoor movie screen. Nor is the couple quite finished.
 ''See the plumbing there?'' Mr. Whitney said, gesturing toward his rose garden. ''That's where the wet bar is going.''
 The couple's raffish theater harks back to the grand rooftop gardens of the Gilded Age, with the exclusivity ratcheted up a notch. In the early 1900's, the city's most luxurious hotels, like the Astor on Times Square, had opulent roof gardens, and the New Amsterdam Theater and Madison Square Garden staged revues on their elegant rooftops. But while those gardens were public spaces at which society's nabobs sought to be seen, the invited guests at the Duane Street theater strive to be not seen, perhaps in part so they can indulge freely in what Mr. Whitney calls ''naked Jacuzzi romps.''
 The sound of clinking glasses atop 129 Duane is sometimes borne on the breeze across Church Street and south to the rooftop hideaway that the architect Matthew Baird has designed atop his loft at 74 Reade Street. The seventh-story sanctuary has at its center a generous master bedroom encased in a box of glass and mill-finished copper. Surrounding the room on three sides is a 1,500-square-foot terraced garden of limestone and South American hardwood, planted with Japanese maples, lilac trees, Russian sage, hydrangeas and Himalayan birch trees.
 Reclining on their outdoor teak daybed, which is edged with wild sea foam roses, Mr. Baird and his wife, Liz, can glimpse tantalizing bits and pieces of other rooftop oases, like the black-and-white desert tent across Church Street that Doug Kaplan, an executive with Sirius Satellite Radio, commissioned from a company in Morocco. ''This is sort of the modern TriBeCa,'' Mr. Baird said. ''You can imagine the lap dog in the tent.''
 Mr. Kaplan does not, in fact, have a lap dog, but he does have dozens of vibrantly colorful tropical fish swimming around the perimeter of his oasis in a dramatic pool, which is planted in summer with lotus, Egyptian papyrus and wild grasses. When the mood strikes, Mr. Kaplan and his girlfriend, Lauren Hyman, lay out rich Turkish rugs and cushions and relax in their tent by the light of a Moroccan stained-glass lantern, sometimes puffing apple tobacco through a hookah that was purchased, Mr. Kaplan said, from a Lebanese smoke shop ''in the exotic West Village.''
 The playful extravagance of rooftop additions like Mr. Kaplan's tent is reminiscent of the whimsical follies built by European gentry on their country estates. A similarly fanciful confection stands at the edge of Laurie Weltz's rooftop garden on Reade Street, which features a recirculating stream running through a 400-square-foot lawn. Ms. Weltz's 10-year-old daughter, India, is fascinated with all things Indian, and as a result her family built a double-peaked structure that they call her shrine. Inside the shrine, which is made of gold-painted plywood and wooden latticework, India makes offerings to her little statue of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom.
 Up at 44 Walker Street, Mark Seth Lender and his wife, Valerie Pettis, have created an aerie with a very different purpose; they have planted their rooftop with 2,100 square feet of forest intended to provide habitat for birds and butterflies. ''If I plant this right,'' said Mr. Lender, a conservation columnist for the Shoreline Times in Connecticut, ''you could sit here and be very quiet and you'll see birds that'll knock your brains out.'' Scooping up a thin gray feather, he said: ''See, we had a visitor. That's a mourning dove.''

The Odd Tin Shack, Till the Cash Came In
 The recent rash of outre mid-six- to seven-figure additions to TriBeCa's roofscape are descended from a far more humble, and sometimes oddball, lineage. The early ad hoc roof structures, built by the neighborhood's artistic pioneers before any of the area was subject to landmark regulations, included Quonset huts, idiosyncratic greenhouses and even a red London phone booth that stood on a North Moore Street rooftop as part of a hippie fantasy of urban freedom. ''But as eyes became more and more focused on TriBeCa,'' said Bruce Ehrmann, chairman of Community Board 1's landmarks committee, ''more and more things became codified.'' 
 By designating four historic districts in TriBeCa in 1991 and 1992, the city in effect placed much of the area under landmark protection, a move that curtailed the neighborhood's traditionally iconoclastic rooftop behavior. And as the recession of the early 90's gave way to a more robust real estate market, TriBeCa's rooftop additions went upscale in a hurry.
 The 1996 conversion of the Dietz Lantern building at 429 Greenwich Street ushered in a wave of luxury conversions of commercial and industrial buildings. Ever since, according to Barrie Mandel, an executive with the Corcoran Group and a TriBeCa resident, developed rooftops have become de rigueur for new luxury-loft condominiums. Atop the nine-story Dietz Lantern building, for example, two stories were added to form a 50-window penthouse duplex with 5,300 square feet of interior space and a 2,200-square-foot private terrace with a lap pool. The duplex was resold in 2000 for $7 million.
 In the Bazzini Building, a 1999 residential conversion of a nut processing facility at 21 Jay Street, the existing sixth floor was combined with a large rooftop addition to create two penthouse duplexes. In the new tower of the two-building River Lofts at 92 Laight Street, a 4,000-square-foot penthouse with a wraparound terrace was sold to Meryl Streep this year for $9.95 million.
 ''Virtually anywhere and everywhere it can be done, it's either being done, or wants to be done,'' said George Boyle, a local architect working on a hat trick of new rooftop structures along Greenwich Street for three clients. ''The land's too valuable.''
 While many rooftops are being developed by longtime TriBeCans working within budgets, some of the most eye-popping additions have been built by more recent transplants from uptown. Wealth has been pouring into TriBeCa the last several years, transforming the area into what one local architect calls ''the land of the $500 stroller.'' Since 1999, the average price of a loft has soared 77 percent to $1.6 million, according to statistics provided by the Corcoran Group.
 TriBeCa derives much of its cachet from its heritage as a creative frontier homesteaded by artists, and this artistic pedigree does much to explain the over-the-top roof structures erected with the neighborhood's plentiful new cash. In sharp contrast to the Upper East Side or Westchester, TriBeCa is a traditionally iconoclastic place where status is conferred not on the basis of conformity but on individual, creative expression. As a result, an imaginative, or at least unconventional, gesture is all but expected of anyone who moves to TriBeCa and confronts the blank canvas of an empty loft or roof, especially if he or she has the blank check to go with it.
 ''It certainly sounds like new money, doesn't it?'' said Stephen Birmingham, who has chronicled the ways of the wealthy in such books as ''Life at the Dakota: New York's Most Unusual Address.'' ''What better way to make your friends drop dead than to take them off this kind of scruffy street in TriBeCa and bring them up to this Hollywood vision?''
 Wealth and daring do not, of course, always combine to produce inspired design. But zoning and landmarks restrictions have served to keep most of the rooftop aeries minimally visible and preserved the area's historic, architecturally cohesive feel. ''The Landmarks Preservation Commission has done a very, very good job keeping these rooftop extensions within appropriate boundaries,'' said Mr. Ehrmann of Community Board 1. ''Where they're not within appropriate boundaries tends to be as a result of developers trying to squeeze the last square inch out of a conversion project.''
 When it comes to winning approval for these rooftop extravaganzas, hiddenness has become a key issue. Though much of TriBeCa's city in the clouds is concealed, it occasionally offers up hints of its existence to earthbound sky gazers: a string of Chinese lanterns, a wayward juniper branch dangling over a cornice. Standing on West Broadway opposite Bouley restaurant, one can even spot, sitting atop a red brick building, the peaked roof of a gray clapboard cottage that one young Duane Street resident, Lucie Lagodich, described as the city home of the Three Bears.
 Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the landmarks commission, said the criterion of minimal visibility had become critical to his agency's decisions as to which projects would be approved. ''You can quibble perhaps over what minimally visible is,'' he said. ''But believe me, our experience has been that it really means you can barely see it, or you really have to sort of strain to see it, or you can see it from maybe a 10-yard stretch on Church Street as you're walking north -- that sort of thing -- and even then you only see a tiny slice of it and only if you're really, really looking for it.''
 With outdoor space at a premium in Manhattan, the proliferation of rooftop havens shows no sign of abating, in part because of the financial incentives. According to Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and author of the widely read Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, a typical high-end developed rooftop in TriBeCa contributes $700,000 to $1 million to a loft's value. 
 Such appealing arithmetic has kept local architects busy designing ever more sumptuous rooftop environments. On North Moore Street, Joy and Leonard Toboroff, who already have an elegant 1,000-square-foot roof terrace, purchased the penthouse condo next door and are spending lavish sums to combine the two roofs into a palatial entertaining space, complete with a formal outdoor dining room, pergola, mahogany decking and lush plantings watered by a computerized irrigation system. 
 ''It will allow for an elaborate, choreographed dinner party, fully staffed,'' said Stephen Corelli, their architect. ''The design of the terrace provides seamless integration from predinner cocktails to dinner to after-dinner drinks and cigars in a finely articulated sequence of individual spaces.'' However, since the couple's primary residence is in France, the new space will be used mostly in late summer and fall.

Spurning the Stoop for Good?
 Annie Nocenti, former editor of High Times magazine and a longtime TriBeCan, sees an insidious undercurrent to the wealthy removing themselves to such lofty heights. ''When you see urban films or the photographs of Jacob Riis,'' Ms. Nocenti pointed out, ''everyone sits on the stoops. Stoop sitting is a poor-person thing to do, and you're part of the street. If you're up on a rooftop, you're isolating yourself, and I have absolutely no interest in isolated utopias.'' Besides, she added, ''most utopias turn out to be dystopias.''
 The closest to dystopia that owners of these luxe rooftop extensions would acknowledge are bothersome leaks or, in the case of the Duane Street rooftop theater, high winds that once loosened the big movie screen and threatened to send it crashing through the skylight above its owners' bed. Such occupational hazards of high living seem unlikely to diminish the number of TriBeCan penthouse owners seeking greater proximity to the heavens. At least three major new condominium developments are slated to come onto the market in the next three years, while more owners of existing penthouse lofts are likely to see their neighbors' Shangri-Las and conclude that their ancient ladder-and-hatch access to the old tar roof just won't cut it anymore.
 Mark Winkelman, a TriBeCa architect, said that he has developed a simple standard for determining whether a client's existing roof space and access are in need of an upgrade. ''I have the martini test,'' he said. ''Can you make a martini in your kitchen and get it all the way up to the roof without spilling it?''

HEADLINE: Looking For a Place To Hang Its Hat

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
THERE is yet another plot twist in the drama of the Goodspeed Opera House: Five months after theater officials announced that they would accept a $40 million package from Middletown to move there, they reversed course and said they were reconsidering East Haddam, or at least no longer considering Middletown.
 ''More theater, that's exactly what it is, more theater!'' said Kris DiErrico, who is a co-owner of Lifespace, an architecture and design firm in East Haddam, and who is on a local committee working to preserve the village's character. ''Middletown didn't get the money it needed to bring the Goodspeed there, so the theater is back to Square 1.''
 The Goodspeed's board voted in June to accept Middletown's offer to build a theater, administrative offices and production facilities in its downtown, in what Middletown officials hoped would be the core of their efforts to create an arts and entertainment center there. 
 But the offer depended heavily on state money. Late last year, Middletown applied for a $10 million grant from the state department of economic and community development, but has failed to win it. The town has also been hoping for $30 million in state and federal money but so far, has failed to win that money, too.
 With a new, fiscally conservative state administration in place, and a pledge from Eileen Daily, East Haddam's representive in the state legislature, to fight Middletown's pursuit of the financing, the effort to secure the money seems unlikely to succeed.
 And so the Goodspeed is no longer on track to move to Middletown.
 Still, Dan McMahon, the spokesman for the theater, weighed his words carefully when commenting on the Goodspeed's plans.
 ''There's no guarantee for anything,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''None of our options are closed right now.''
 The opera house was built in 1877 on the banks of the Connecticut River. Over the years it has been used as a militia base, a general store and a storage space for the state highway department. In 1963, it reopened as a musical revival house. Of the dozens of musicals performed on its stage since then, 15 went to Broadway. 
 For about six years, Goodspeed executives had been trying to build a larger, more modern theater space in East Haddam. They have even paid half a million dollars for a seven-acre property near the waterfront area, and had hoped to built a new theater by 2008.
 But their efforts have been stymied at nearly every step. Among the problems were local opposition to building more parking on wetlands near the river and the failure to win zoning approval for a taller performance space. And so they accepted the Middletown offer.
 Despite opposition to aspects of the Goodspeed's expansion in East Haddam, many people wanted the theater to stay. The relocation was estimated to mean a loss of about $8 million in town taxes, revenues and jobs for businesses that depend on the Goodspeed for their customer base, Brad Parker, East Haddam's first selectman, has said.
 ''We have been working together right through the summer and the fall, and I've never given up,'' Mr. Parker said in a recent interview. 
 East Haddam's planning and zoning commission, with the help of a volunteer organization, the Village Planning Group, has created a new zoning plan. The commission's chairman, Harvey Thomas, said he expected the commission to vote on the plan at its meeting this month.
 The new plan would allow any live theater to build a structure that was tall enough to accommodate sets and theatrical productions. It also would allow the theater's expansion to cover a larger amount of the lot on which it is built than other structures in town.
 ''Basically everything they needed is in the new zoning regulations -- height restrictions, lot coverage -- so as long as they follow the guidelines they should be able to build the theater,'' Mr. Parker said. ''My feeling is that if the Goodspeed expands, it expands in East Haddam.''
 Parking remains an obstacle. To build on any wetlands, the theater would have to meet the regulatory requirements not only of East Haddam's inland-wetlands commission, but those of the state department of environmental protection.
 ''There are requirements they're going to have to try to figure out how to meet,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''It's not a slam dunk.''
 One possibility is to build a parking garage behind town hall. There are no wetlands problems with this idea, but the details on this plan are still unclear.
 ''I think the town was always willing to work with the Goodspeed,'' said Hans Lohse, an architect who founded the volunteer group working with the zoning commission. ''This story is about a village that is trying to survive, trying to be economically successful, trying to keep the historic character that attracts people to this village. If we ruin this, we make a big mistake.''
 ''It's not an easy task, to rezone this village,'' he added. ''This required a lot of thinking; this is a very tight, environmentally fragile village.''
 In town, some people did not know what to think about the newest development. At Delo's package store down the street from the Goodspeed, Mike Billings was straightening up after the Thanksgiving rush.
 ''I don't know what to make of it,'' Mr. Billings said. ''It's been going on for years, just like a soap opera.''

HEADLINE: A Field Guide to the Falling Dollar

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
JUST what will the plummeting value of the dollar mean for the American economy? The answer is not quite as simple as ''less imports, more exports.'' Depending on how investors behave, the dollar's downward drift could cast anything from a benign breeze to a hurricane.
 If the dollar loses value slowly, giving businesses and investors plenty of time to adjust their spending and portfolios, the main effect may be to make the American economy more competitive. That would be a happy conclusion.
 But if the dollar takes an abrupt dive, the consequences may be dire. Companies and consumers alike may find themselves stripped of purchasing power and ground down by sky-high interest rates. 
 The repercussions of a long-term decline in the dollar could be far-reaching. A permanent change in the relative prices of goods and services produced in the United States and abroad could hamper some important and long-running economic trends, like the growing productivity of the American work force.
 ''On balance, it's going to be good for people invested in the manufacturing sector of the United States if this thing is permanent,'' said Samuel S. Kortum, a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota. ''It sounds very mixed and potentially even sort of bad if you think about it for the whole economy.''
 Right now, the short-term effects of the dollar's fall are pressing enough. Imports are becoming more expensive for Americans, and exports from the United States are becoming less expensive for foreigners. For some businesses, these changes have already become very real.
 At the Cadillac division of General Motors, which sells American-built cars in Europe, margins have improved as a result of the dollar's drop. 
 At Volkswagen dealerships in the United States, which must import all their automobiles, sales fell by a total of 18 percent in the first 11 months of the year, compared with the same period in 2003. Overall sales of European brands have dropped by only 6 percent. These kinds of rewards and penalties are likely to multiply as time passes, said Maurice Obstfeld, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley. ''It takes time to reallocate resources to export industries so they can produce more,'' he said. ''It also takes time for foreign demand to adjust, and switch to new sources of supply.''
 Long-term contracts can contribute to these delays, said Harvey D. Bronstein, a senior international economist at the Small Business Administration. ''You have to build relationships and a trust level with purchasers in other countries. This takes much longer than the daily or monthly fluctuations in currency values.''
 To this point, the dollar's depreciation has not narrowed the nation's trade gap. Exports have been increasing steadily for five consecutive quarters, according to figures adjusted for changes in prices and seasonal variations by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, but imports have risen even faster. Both of these trends would be consistent with a gradual comeback in economic activity after prolonged weakness -- and have perhaps little to do with the exchange rate. So, will the sliding dollar ever eliminate the trade deficit?
 Not necessarily, Professor Obstfeld said. Americans can keep buying more imports as long as foreigners are willing to accept dollars -- and the financial assets they can buy in return.
 ''The dollar's fall is a necessary but not sufficient condition for closing the trade gap,'' he said. ''We also need an adjustment in the global saving and investment patterns. Saving by the private sector and by the government has to rise, or investment has to fall. No one wants to see investment fall in the United States, so we're looking at some sort of adjustment in saving. But it's not clear how the dollar's fall by itself will bring that about.''
 Shrinking the trade gap may require higher long-term interest rates, which could encourage Americans to save more and rely less on foreign financing. Several factors in the markets and the economy are already auguring for higher rates for bonds, home mortgages and other loans. The Federal Reserve Board has been raising short-term rates since June and is expected to continue at its next meeting, on Dec. 14.
 If bond traders believe that short-term rates will keep rising, long-term rates will almost certainly tick upward as well. The potential for bigger budget deficits in Washington -- and bigger federal borrowing -- could also help push to rates higher. 
 Finally, foreign lenders may start to demand higher interest rates from American borrowers, because payments in dollars are now worth less in the lenders' home currencies.
 Indeed, the mystery to some economists is why long-term rates haven't risen already. ''I really find it puzzling,'' Professor Kortum said.
 A partial explanation, said David A. Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's, is the enormous appetite of foreign central banks for American bonds. He said the banks bought $260 billion worth of Treasury securities in the 12 months through September, more than two thirds of the government's total borrowing during that period.
 By keeping Treasury yields low, the foreign central banks are taking pressure off interest rates. But they have also prevented, or at least postponed, further decreases in the dollar's value.
 ''I think the dollar is going lower,'' Mr. Wyss said. ''The problem is that you have the central banks fighting very hard against the market.'' The banks were less interested in protecting the value of their dollar-denominated reserves, he said, than they were in protecting their countries' exporters, who have a harder time selling to the United States when the dollar weakens.
 Those exporters may not be the only foreign businesses hurt by dips in the dollar. According to Professor Kortum, American companies will use fewer imported intermediate goods -- that is, goods that are used to produce other goods and services -- as they become more expensive in dollar terms. Instead, the companies may use more American workers.
 ''From the point of view of their production, they're finding now that U.S. labor is cheap relative to imported intermediate goods,'' he said. ''It would lead to more employment, more labor-intensive production to some degree.''
 Though this may sound like good news, it stands in opposition to a long-running and in many ways beneficial economic trend. For decades, workers have had increasing amounts of useful stuff like computers, machines and software at their disposal ---- making production more capital-intensive rather than more labor-intensive. When workers have more capital to use, they tend to be more productive -- and to earn higher wages. 
 The depreciation of the dollar may also blunt the ability of foreign competition to transform industries in the United States, Professor Kortum said. ''Firms that would have been put out of business by imports are going to stay in business,'' he said, and companies that did not export before may enter foreign markets.
 FOR the short term, much will depend on the speed of the currency shift, the economist said.
 ''The best outcome would be a rise in U.S. saving coupled with a gradual decline in the dollar to a sustainable level,'' Professor Obstfeld said. ''There's no doubt that the dollar will need to decline more, and the economy will be able to adjust much more smoothly if the adjustment is a gradual one.''
 That outcome, though, is far from certain. If investors lost confidence in the business climate in the United States, or in the federal government's ability to pay its debts, the dollar could plunge sharply and interest rates could rocket. 
 In that case, investors would demand a higher return to match what they perceived as higher risks of lending money or buying equity in the United States. But if the flow of investment also slackened, the demand for dollars to buy American securities would dry up. That could be the start of a vicious cycle, forcing a further slide in the dollar and leading investors to demand an even higher return.
 A similar situation occurred two decades ago. ''The danger is if the decline in the dollar gets too severe, that could really drive U.S. bond yields up like it did in the early 80's,'' Mr. Wyss said. ''Then you could be looking at 15, 20 percent mortgage rates again. That could cause a recession despite the fact that the trade gap is closing.''
 Investors' attitudes could change abruptly, Professor Obstfeld said, especially if they focused on how one piece of news might change the economic outlook. ''Certainly, the fiscal measures that are being tossed around in Washington are not particularly helpful,'' he said, referring to the multitrillion-dollar liability that could result from adding private accounts to the current Social Security system. ''It's clear that it's a big fiscal shift that could have an impact on the markets.''
 That could bring back unpleasant memories of the 1980's, when the ''twin deficits'' in trade and the federal budget damaged the country's economic competitiveness. A weaker dollar wasn't enough to close the gaps then, and it may not be enough now, either.

HEADLINE: Dominican President Visits, Reaching Out to Diaspora

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Severe problems face Leonel Fernandez, a former New Yorker who won the presidency of the Dominican Republic in May with the help of a landslide of votes from Dominicans in the United States. But this afternoon Mr. Fernandez will not be in Santo Domingo tackling the public deficits, corruption scandals and daily energy blackouts that mark the economic crisis he was elected to resolve. 
 Instead, he will be at a public seminar at City College, to address an audience of Dominican-Americans expected to overflow the Great Hall's capacity of 1,000. His purpose, he says, is to listen to the concerns of the Dominican diaspora and to talk about new ways of mutual help, beyond the $1 billion in remittances that 500,000 of the 700,000 Dominicans in the New York area send home every year. 
 Ideas under discussion include a Dominican Peace Corps that would bring young Dominican-Americans back to their roots, joint health care and research projects on H.I.V. and AIDS, and institutional alliances that would help increase the political profile of Dominicans in New York, where they are rapidly overtaking Puerto Ricans as the city's largest Hispanic group.
 Less upbeat topics on the table include the handling of more than 25,000 Dominicans who have been deported by the United States since 1996, many of them New Yorkers sent back as ''criminal aliens'' after serving sentences for offenses that range from shoplifting and minor drug possession to violent felonies. These reluctant returnees, who often leave struggling families behind, are widely blamed for rising crime rates in the Dominican Republic, which has a population of 8.4 million.
 Another concern for both sides is the recent increase in Dominicans so desperate to migrate that they set out in rickety boats, often with dire results. On Friday morning the United States Coast Guard reported the latest disaster: a 40-foot boat carrying more than 90 Dominican migrants capsized in choppy seas off the rocky coast of Puerto Rico. At least eight people drowned, and the accident was caught on videotape by a patrolling Coast Guard jet that threw life rafts to survivors.
 There were bound to be ripples of grief in New York, community leaders said. 
 ''There is not a person in the Dominican Republic who does not have a relative in New York,'' said Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, an advocacy and social service agency. 
 But such disasters happen too often to justify changing Mr. Fernandez's schedule, Maria Elizabeth Rodriguez, the director of his New York-Dominican Republic task force, said yesterday.
 On Friday night he was at a gala dinner in the Bronx held by a new association of bodega owners. The organization, Asociacion de Bodegueros de Los Estados Unidos, exemplifies the nascent political empowerment that Mr. Fernandez wants to foster among the Dominican New Yorkers who gave him 73 percent of their votes. Tomorrow he is to participate in an energy summit sponsored by the Clinton Foundation at New York University.
 Mr. Fernandez, 50, is himself an example of the ties between the city and the Dominican Republic. He moved to New York at 7 and went to Brandeis High School before returning to the Dominican Republic, where he became a lawyer and a university professor. First elected president in 1996, he presided over an economic boom linked to New York's boom before his party lost power to a populist businessman, Hipolito Mejia, as both economies soured. 
 In the last years of the Mejia administration, the Dominican economy unraveled. Bank failures and bailouts led to power failures when the government could no longer pay for energy owned by American companies like Enron, A.E.S. Corporation and Goldman Sachs. Mr. Mejia blamed the first Fernandez administration for selling control of the nation's electricity industry to American companies, and called for their executives to be deported to the United States. 
 Mr. Fernandez has taken a different tack. Austerity measures at home and optimism abroad have been part of a program to win back a $600 million aid package suspended last year by the International Monetary Fund. 
 ''The link between the Dominican Republic and its people residing in New York represents a golden opportunity,'' Mr. Fernandez wrote in the prologue of a book to be released at today's seminar. 
 Called ''Building Strategic Partnerships for Development: Dominican Republic -- New York State,'' it is the culmination of a two-year research project on Dominican development sponsored in part by the Dominican Studies Institute at City University of New York. 
 Ramona Hernandez, who directs the institute and helped organize the event at City College, said that before Mr. Fernandez spoke he would listen to presentations by community activists, scholars and elected officials. 
 ''The president sees the Dominican people as one people, living in different parts of the globe,'' she said, adding that she is one of many Dominican New Yorkers who welcome that approach. ''I want my son, who is attending Duke University, to continue to be Dominican, and I cannot do that alone.''

THE WORLD'S BANKER
A Story of Failed States, Financial Crises, and the Wealth and Poverty of Nations.
By Sebastian Mallaby.
462 pp. A Council on
Foreign Relations Book/
The Penguin Press. $29.95.
 THE World Bank's stated mission is a world without poverty. Like most noble goals, this one is far easier to articulate than to achieve. Even successful cases of bank-assisted development have proved frustrating; like good golf swings, they are hard to replicate. 
 The result over the years has been an organization overshadowed by its sister institution (the International Monetary Fund) and an easy mark for simplistic attacks. Most popular books that discuss the bank do so through a miasma of righteous indignation. The World Bank is now the largest external provider of funding for education and for H.I.V./AIDS programs in the developing world, but such facts are glibly ignored by antiglobalization activists.
 In ''The World's Banker,'' the Washington Post columnist Sebastian Mallaby gives us a sophisticated, evenhanded take on the bank's last decade of development efforts. To do this without making a reader's eyes glaze over, he marries policy debates to a biography of James D. Wolfensohn, who became the bank's president in 1995. Consequently, a book about economic development becomes intertwined with tales about Wolfensohn's life and times at the bank.
 Wolfensohn turns out to be the perfect muse for discussing the complexities of poverty reduction. Equal parts grandiloquence and petulance, he latched on to every new development trend like a vainglorious Renaissance man with attention-deficit disorder. Some of the proposed ideas -- debt relief, combating corruption -- were waiting for a powerful sponsor. Mallaby ably documents how Wolfensohn successfully grafted these common-sense concepts onto the World Bank's agenda. 
 Wolfensohn's mistakes are also front and center. Upon taking office, he reached out to antiglobalization critics in an effort to improve the bank's image. But whatever success he may have had came at a high price. In catering to them, he overcommitted the bank's resources, taxing his staff into exhaustion with overlapping campaigns centered on different facets of development. Wolfensohn's inability to set priorities led to results that did not live up to his good intentions and, in the end, all of his efforts at outreach came to naught in the aftermath of the Seattle antiglobalization protests in 1999. 
 Seeing Wolfensohn's ego on full display makes ''The World's Banker'' a dishy read. Almost immediately after his appointment, he demanded a private jet -- and threatened to resign if he didn't get one -- while bemoaning the ''enormous financial sacrifice'' of the large salary he had been making in the private sector as a wheeler-dealer. Early in his tenure, he asked the future finance minister of Turkey to act as his baggage handler. Later on, he tacitly encouraged questionable criticisms of the International Monetary Fund -- apparently because he didn't want to look like the fund's second banana. 
 Lest one judge him too harshly, Mallaby also spells out the political and policy constraints Wolfensohn faced and partly conquered. They ranged from intrusive executive board members (that is, the Group of 7) to histrionic nongovernmental organizations to American conservatives convinced that the bank was a bloated bureaucracy with a superfluous mission. Along the way, Mallaby provides a picaresque tour of the successes and failures of economic development, both on the ground and in the corridors of Washington. The chapter on Uganda is especially illuminating, demonstrating how competent bureaucracies combined with market-friendly economic policies can genuinely help the poor. The chapter on how AIDS has devastated African economic development -- and how the bank was slow to respond -- is especially heartbreaking.
 Mallaby has done his homework, interviewing hundreds of World Bank officials, critics and government figures -- including Wolfensohn, whom he spoke to for nearly 20 hours. He has produced a book chock-full of affecting vignettes, and that rarest of treats -- an informed disquisition about public policy wrapped up in a fascinating narrative.

HEADLINE: My Favorite Mistake? Not a Million-Dollar One

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY mother's mother, God bless her soul, used to say when a mistake was made, ''Don't worry, you'll do it again.'' By that she meant that the human animal is so constructed that we barely learn from our mistakes, so let's not let them get to us. We're all human, and we all make mistakes.
 This occurs to me about 100 times a day as I contemplate the staggering investment mistakes I have made and as I hope and pray that, Grandma's words notwithstanding, I might not make them again. 
 The cruelest examples are in real estate. I have an amazing gift for picking great real estate. The only problem is that I rarely put it to any long-term or even short-term use. 
 In 1973, at the prodding of my wonderful girlfriend, Pat, I bought a house in one of the classiest neighborhoods of Washington, Wesley Heights. I paid $55,000 for a tiny, tiny house. Then I lost my job when Mr. Nixon, my boss, resigned, and a few months later the new chief of staff, a wonder boy named Donald Rumsfeld, gently suggested I seek greener pastures (and kindly offered to find some for me). I moved to New York to work at The Wall Street Journal and rented out my Wesley Heights house. But it was a lot of trouble dealing with tenants and paying my $300-a-month mortgage, so in 1974, I sold it for $75,000. 
 It was recently for sale as a tear down, and the lot value alone was close to $1 million.
 In 1975, I went to a conference in Aspen, Colo. I loved it, and in 1978, my wife and I bought a house there. We paid about $280,000 for a house at a prime address on the West Side. But it was trouble from the start with contractors, rental agents, neighbors and leaking foundations. We sold it in 1980 for $320,000. I cannot even guess what it's worth now, but millions is a start.
 In the late 70's, we decided we wanted a place to stay in Manhattan during our visits from Los Angeles, where we lived. We could have bought a fine penthouse -- 2 bdrs., 2 bths. -- at 72nd Street and Park Avenue for $250,000. A look at the ceiling told me that there was a speck of water damage, so we passed. I cannot even guess what that's worth now.
 Then there are the country houses I could have owned but didn't. There was one near Oxford, Md., on the Eastern Shore, that I passed up because of fears of traffic on the Bay Bridge; one in the hunt country of Virginia that a friend talked me out of because of the traffic on I-66; and one in Sandpoint, Idaho, a booming garden spot, because it was in the shade too much of the day. All of these places have appreciated beyond words.
 Then there are my mistakes with stocks. I decided that Berkshire Hathaway had seen its best days when it was in the $50,000's and sold a chunk of it; it's now near $85,000. I sold a good chunk, although far from all, of my best investment of all time -- Laaco Ltd., an extremely well-run real estate venture in Southern California that owns the Los Angeles Athletic Club -- to put some of the money into technology stocks in 1999. These led to sleepless nights and frothing at the mouth. 
 But those are small compared with the real estate mistakes. I reckon that the ''missed gains'' -- if I can use such a silly phrase -- on the real estate are in the range of $5 million to $10 million, while the stock market mistakes are at most $1 million or $2 million down the drain.
 Because I am a lawyer and economist as well as an actor, I try to make some system out of what I did, and to learn the causes. No.1 was simple fear: the fear of being illiquid and not having money coming in. The fear of a genuine economic depression. The fear of a real estate collapse -- which I have seen and suffered through, so I know it can happen. And, especially the fear of a real estate collapse during which I would be illiquid and need money. (My parents, who saw truly hard times in their youth, endlessly preached to me to stay liquid and stay safe. That turned out to be terrible advice, although very well intended.) 
 I also completely failed to understand the scope of inflation in real estate and how persistent it would be. (Of course, in the early and mid-1990's, when real estate did collapse in many places, I felt pretty smug.) Another reason for my mistakes was acting on newspaper and magazine headlines. I made some of my worst stock purchases by allowing my stupid self to be goaded by tales of Internet riches that I should have known could not be true -- or, if true, could not last.
 But have I learned any lessons? Maybe. One is that once I buy a house, I should never sell it -- and if I move out, I should rent it out, grit my teeth and expect to be tortured by rental agents and tenants. In other words, barring a calamity, I do not plan to sell real estate again for some time. The other mistake has to do with failing to remember Ben Graham's sound adage about the stock market: in the short run it's a voting machine, but in the long run, it's a weighing machine. In other words, I let myself be sucked in by hype and glamour.
 NOW, I don't want to cry. I have also done one or two things right, and my wife and I can still pay our bills this month. And if Warren Buffett can make the error he made about Coca-Cola -- failing to sell it when it was trading above $80 some years ago -- and make the whopper of a mistake that the ideal holding period for any stock is ''forever,'' thus undermining his own notion that ''price'' is everything, I can make mistakes, too.
 But my foolish acts do bother me, especially late at night and early in the morning, and I can hear my mother quoting her mother to remind me of two things they used to say about their own investments: ''We do the best we can, and when we make a mistake, we don't cry about it.'' And, yes, ''Don't worry, you'll do it again.''

HEADLINE: Backed Into a Currency Corner? Don't Overreact

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
THE dollar has seemed to be on a one-way trip -- down -- against other major currencies. The tumble has helped the portfolios of some fortunate Americans by bolstering the returns of their foreign stocks and bonds. 
 But if the dollar's fall continues, as some analysts are predicting, many American investors may be hurt. That is because foreigners' appetite for United States stocks and bonds could weaken, dampening returns in American markets. 
 Investors can use a variety of techniques to hedge their portfolios against a further decline in the dollar. Most experts warn, though, that trying to predict the direction of currencies is risky, particularly after one of them, like the dollar, has already taken a sharp dive. Understanding markets in the United States is difficult enough, they say; investing in foreign markets and trading on currencies is more than some investors can reasonably manage. Because of the risks, many advisers recommend that only a small percentage of portfolio assets be used for currency hedges. 
 Of course, a modest hedge may not have a huge effect on a portfolio, though it may help you sleep at night. Neil Winter, senior vice president for Prudential Financial and a specialist in derivatives, said that if someone with a total portfolio of $100,000 invested 10 percent of it in foreign bonds that paid interest in euros or yen, even a 10 percent increase in the annual return, for example, on that $10,000 investment would amount to only $1,000. That gain, he said, may not be worth taking the necessary risk. ''Remember,'' he said, ''it is your whole basket of investments and your planning that will ensure your survival.'' 
 Still, there are some simple steps that Americans can take if they think that the dollar will keep falling. One of the most basic, if you are planning a trip to Europe or Japan, is to buy euros or yen now and put the money away until you travel. You won't earn any interest on it, but if the dollar drops further before your trip, you will have paid less for the money you need.
 Investors who do not want to venture outside the country may want to concentrate on the stocks of American companies that make goods in the United States but distribute them overseas, said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates in Akron, Ohio. The dollar's decline, Mr. Yardeni said, means that ''American multinationals can sell more exports because the price of their goods is far more competitive with foreign goods.'' He likes such stocks as General Electric, Intel and Procter & Gamble.
 Investors with a higher tolerance for risk may want to consider gold or gold stocks.
 James R. Hedges IV, who runs LJH Investments, a hedge fund of funds, says gold is likely to benefit because of the dollar's decline and because an alternative, the euro, is not ''an attractive investment'' over the long run. 
 ''By default,'' he said, ''the third global currency is gold: stocks or the bullion itself.'' 
 Gold prices have already risen more than 9 percent this year, to around $455 an ounce, though that is still far below its peak of $850, set early in 1980.
 For people who don't want the trouble and expense of buying, storing and protecting bullion, he suggests the stocks of gold mining companies.
 Mark Smith, who follows mining stocks for Dundee Securities in Toronto, noted that gold mining stocks tended to be more volatile than gold bullion. Because of the industry's fixed costs, the profits of gold mining companies can rise and fall disproportionately when prices fluctuate. Among the best known are Newmont Mining, based in Denver, and two Canadian concerns, Barrick Gold and Placer Dome. Although the buying of bullion has generally been a realm for professional investors, several currency experts pointed out that there is now an exchange-traded fund, StreetTracks Gold Trust, that invests in gold itself. The fund, which started trading on Nov. 18 at $44.38, closed on Friday at $45.60. 
 Investors can also choose precious-metals mutual funds, which may invest in a variety of mining stocks and commodities other than gold. They have returned more than 35 percent a year, on average, over the last three years, but are down almost 2 percent this year, according to Morningstar. 
 Another way to hedge one's bets on the dollar, said Douglas Cliggott, president of B&P Research, a subsidiary of Brummer & Partners, a Stockholm firm that owns a group of eight hedge funds, is to buy foreign bonds. ''The no-brainer for U.S.-based investors is high-quality government bonds outside the U.S.,'' he said, including German, French and Dutch government issues. ''That is because you get the interest payment in euros, and European interest rates are not meaningfully different from ours,'' he said. ''Ten-year government bonds in Germany and Holland are yielding over 4 percent. If the dollar moves down versus the euro by another 10 percent, then the investor would make 14 percent over the next year.''
 Lynn Russell, who follows international bond funds for Morningstar, says that almost every fund in that category is up this year. Among the leaders are Evergreen International Bond and Templeton Global Bond, both of which are up by more than 12 percent. 
 But she said that in 2001 some funds in the category posted losses, in part because of exposure to currency swings. For instance, Federated International Bond is up 9.2 percent this year, but this unhedged fund fell 4.2 percent in 2001. 
 ''Do your homework to make sure you know what risks you are taking'' before buying a fund that specializes in foreign bonds, Ms. Russell said. For example, a fund that holds bonds of a developed country may have hedged its foreign currency holdings, but investors still need to assess the risk of investing in that country, and the risk that interest rates could rise.
 This year, currency movements have had a significant impact on the performance of many international bond funds. Consider T.Rowe Price International Bond, a fund that invests in high-grade bonds but is not hedged against currency shifts. It is up 9.3 percent so far this year, while the Pimco Foreign Bond fund that is hedged against currency movements is up 5.4 percent. Most strikingly, the T.Rowe Price fund was up only 4.28 percent at the end of October, which gives an indication of its volatility. 
 Ms. Russell said investors should investigate the quality of bonds in any fund. ''To reduce credit risk, the best bet is sovereign debt of developed countries,'' she said.
 And while bond funds that do not hedge currencies have lately had stronger returns than those that do, they will also suffer if the dollar rises. 
 BEHIND all of these investment strategies is a belief that the downward trend in the dollar's value may not be over. That view is held by Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. The decline of the dollar ''is shaping up as one of the bigger stories of 2005,'' he said. 
 ''The trade deficit means that there are more and more dollars abroad, and foreign investors need to do something with them,'' he said. ''As long as they are putting them into Treasuries, they are saying they believe in the value of the dollar. If they start to get a little nervous, they may consider other alternatives.''
 And if foreign investors become skittish about their dollar holdings, investors in the United States may be grateful for any measures they have taken to protect their portfolios from a dollar decline.

 BODY:

COAST OF DREAMS
California on the Edge, 1990-2003.
By Kevin Starr.
Illustrated. 765 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
 ANY comprehensive book about California will always sound slightly like the Guinness Book of World Records. In ''Coast of Dreams,'' Kevin Starr points out that we Californians have more overseas trade missions than many a nation; by 2027 we are projected to have more prisoners than all of Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand combined; we produce a quarter of all food eaten in the United States; Los Angeles County's economy is worth more than all of Russia's; and not long ago the Los Angeles Police Department had the highest killing-per-officer ratio in the country. 
 Starr has so far produced half a dozen highly readable volumes of his history of this megastate, carrying the story up through 1950. For his latest installment, however, he has skipped ahead to cover 1990 to the present. 
 Some of the results are impressive, since no one else knows more about California. Starr writes as both historian and journalist. He observes who the political, literary and show business regulars are at a string of cafes up and down the state. He notices how a black audience in Los Angeles calls out advice to actors on a movie screen. He collects a marvelous array of odd characters: a software salesman who went to the Billy Graham School of Evangelism to hone his skills; a Franciscan priest who performs an annual Blessing of the Bikes, sprinkling holy water on a leathery cavalcade of motorcyclists; a high-heeled female prizefight manager who once had a wardrobe so large it had to be electronically indexed; and a group of computer whizzes who variously prefer to type in the nude, bring a pet python to work or spend the night sleeping in an office cubicle. 
 He is also a master of graceful analogy: California's Central Valley stands ''in a long line of irrigated cultures,'' from Mesopotamia to the rice fields of China; failed computer start-ups are like one of the state's great species: ''Not every salmon struggling upstream is destined to spawn''; Berkeley, San Francisco, Davis, Santa Cruz and West Hollywood, producing their own foreign policy through municipal ordinances, are a ''Hanseatic League of Upper Left California cities.'' 
 But, unfortunately, the book as a whole is less a pleasure to read than are some of its parts. For one thing, there's too much of it. At 765 pages, with more than 60 chapters covering everything from natural disasters to Nafta to redwoods to urban transit, this is less a history than an encyclopedia. It has thousands of facts, but no grand theme that fits them together. 
 Starr almost has one: he is fascinated by the irony of how California, with its anti-immigrant ballot measures, plus white flight and gated communities, has also seen a recent economic recovery largely fueled by immigrants -- from Indian programmers to Mexican laborers to Korean small-business entrepreneurs. Adding to the paradox is the fact that ''while American-born groups talked family values, they were actually . . . getting divorced, having children out of wedlock or not having children at all. . . . Immigrants, by contrast . . . were marrying, having children and staying married.'' But he too quickly leaves this rich subject matter behind and sweeps us forward again in a river of almanac-type detail: Los Angeles has 600 furniture-manufacturing companies; San Francisco has one restaurant for every 230 inhabitants; the state has five major container ship ports; the Gallo empire controls one-third of America's wine, brandy and wine-cooler business. 
 ''Coast of Dreams'' also suffers from an excess of boosterism. Starr seems rarely to have met a Californian -- or a California city, for that matter -- he doesn't like. The former state university chancellor Barry Munitz is ''skilled and dapper . . . trusted and admired.'' Gov. Gray Davis valiantly battled in favor of education and against an energy shortage; his successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is driven by ''a fierce hunger for something more,'' rising up ''through sheer force of brainpower and will.'' For Starr, the state has little of the dark side seen by writers as varied as Frank Norris, Nathanael West, Joan Didion and Mike Davis. His sunny California is almost bereft of shysters, greedy C.E.O.'s or demagogues. 
 Yet surely others who look over the same historical record will not be so kind. Consider just those two most recent governors. Davis was a cold fish who amassed enormous campaign war chests from groups like real estate developers and the state's powerful prison guards union. Schwarzenegger rode into office in his personal caravan of Hummers promising to terminate a scheduled increase in taxes on cars -- one of the appallingly few measures that even hinted at limiting the state's thirst for oil. 
 There may be a reason for Starr's gentleness. Until stepping down this past spring, he served for 10 years as California's state librarian and, according to the newspaper editorials that marked his retirement, served well: promoting libraries all over the state, pioneering digital connections among them, raising funds from corporations and foundations, and lobbying library bills through the legislature. A good public servant in such a position succeeds by appealing to the better instincts of those in power. But a good historian must ruthlessly chronicle their follies. 
 Curiously, few people in Starr's text are onstage for more than a page or two. ''Coast of Dreams'' lacks the sort of Californian giants of his earlier volumes, like John Muir and Jack London, whose lives provided him not just with the raw material for a leisurely portrait but with a vantage point from which to see an entire aspect of the state's past. Admittedly, contemporary California may have too few larger-than-life figures and too many celebrities. But we did just vote one of the latter into office -- the third time in recent decades we've chosen a movie actor as senator or governor. That in itself would seem to be a California trend at least as significant as anything John Muir did with national parks. Could even Nathanael West have imagined it?

HEADLINE: New Hope for the Unhandy

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
ON Wednesday afternoon Mike Bukach, a 24-year-old who works in marketing in Manhattan, walked into the Home Depot on West 23rd Street in Chelsea with an odd assignment. His boss was organizing a large publicity event that evening, and he needed 13 fire extinguishers.
 ''Where else am I going to get bulk fire extinguishers?'' Mr. Bukach asked, posing a question that must sound like music to a Home Depot executive's ears.
 Mr. Bukach, who was reared in Twinsburg, Ohio, in a family of band-saw wielding do-it-yourself men, found his fire extinguishers, but as he walked through the store, he said, something felt a little off. He had been to Home Depots back home, giant warehouses dingy with sawdust and chalky clouds of dry cement mix. This place had a doorman. No shop vacuums shrieked. The table saws sat silent. Worse, it was kind of pretty. 
 ''You think of Caterpillar tractors and work boots and do-it-yourself lumberyard-type deals, and then you get this,'' he said, gesturing to the air. ''Oriental rugs and glass lamps. You instantly think fragile.''
 Much has been written lately about cultural divides in this country. Red and blue states, two Americas, the secular versus the religious. But there is another ideological split that receives less attention but is every bit as acute and rife with misunderstanding: the chasm between do-it-yourself America and do-it-for-me America. If the heartland, with its crane rentals, pickups with built-in toolboxes and self-service lumberyards, is home to do-it-yourself, then Manhattan -- with doormen, 24-hour locksmiths, messengers and delivery men galore -- is certainly the headquarters of do-it-for-me.
 Home Depot, a symbol of the do-it-yourself ethic, designed the Chelsea store, its first in Manhattan, to bridge the gap between the self-reliant and the shamelessly reliant on others. 
 At its most basic level it is just a big hardware and home fixtures store, but viewed another way it is a lot more than that. It stands as a monument to the strange mixture of ingenuity, vanity, entitlement and helplessness that characterize the Manhattan psyche and is also a kind of looking glass that reveals how the rest of America -- those do-it-your-selfers -- sees us.
 Executives at Home Depot left little to chance in trying to figure out New Yorkers. Joe Faranda, the chain's vice president for strategic market intelligence and a Queens native who now lives in Atlanta, said it conducted hundreds of studies of Manhattanites as well as hundreds of focus groups. 
 The store was then designed accordingly, which, he said, is the reason it looks so different from Home Depots beyond the Hudson River.
 Mr. Faranda said he and his team were struck by one particular finding in their research: while much of America puts a premium on being normal, New Yorkers expressed a strong need to feel unique.
 ''Where the Manhattanites were different is that they thought they were different,'' Mr. Faranda said. ''They said we want you to demonstrate that you know that.''
 At first glance some of the differences between the Home Depot in Chelsea and other Home Depots are obvious. This store is in a renovated cast iron building. Besides those doormen, its centerpiece is a help counter that bears a resemblance to the concierge desk of an expensive hotel, reassurance for New Yorkers who get jittery beyond the reach of the service economy. 
 Unlike the average Home Depot, with its mall-style sprawling buildings and utilitarian floors and displays, the three-level Chelsea store has polished floors and orderly appointments. 
 The clientele looks different, too, with a much higher iPod-to-customer ratio than the average Home Depot, more gay couples strolling the aisles hand in hand and fewer work boots.
 ''You don't see a lot of Uggs at a typical Home Depot,'' said Adrianna Giuliani, a spokeswoman for the company.
 The store is also pet-friendly. Tiny dogs that could easily be sent flying by leaf blowers at a Home Depot in the Southeast stroll around as casually as Eloise's pug at the Plaza. 
 Elizabeth Fried, a hair and makeup artist from Chelsea who took advantage of the pet-friendly policy, was sauntering in flip-flops through the store with her Chihuahua, Romeo. Since the store opened, she said, she has bought a light fixture, faucets and a toilet seat, none of which she installed herself. 
 ''We're city people,'' she said. ''Most of the stuff, we don't do ourselves. I can do very little myself. Except spend the money.''
 Home Depot's slogan, ''You can do it -- we can help,'' speaks to the dilemma executives faced in opening a do-it-yourself store in the do-it-for-me capital of the world. The burning question was, how much help exactly did New Yorkers need?
 ''Everybody has some degree of ability in home improvement, and everybody could use a certain degree of help,'' Mr. Faranda said diplomatically. ''Some more than others.''
 At the Chelsea store, smiling, orange-clad employees mill about, offering assistance stigma-free. 
 While many Home Depots give classes on home improvement, the store in Chelsea has built a curriculum with local residents in mind. Besides basics like how to install a toilet, there are classes titled Hide Your Television, Apartment Plumbing 101 and Don't Lift a Finger: Automation. 
 Perhaps with an eye toward competing with the many other entertainment options New Yorkers have each night, the classes are taught on a snazzy set that looks suspiciously like an infomercial soundstage, complete with three glimmering flat-panel televisions.
 ''New Yorkers told us they would do projects if they knew how,'' Ms. Giuliani said. ''The more you know, the more you're going to want to do.''
 Even the merchandise speaks to an effete and slightly hypochondriacal Northeastern customer base. There are, for instance, a wine refrigerator and cleaning solutions with names suggesting aromatherapy, including a melon chutney bathroom cleaner you will not find at a Home Depot in Arkansas. 
 There are plenty of bacteria-slurping air purifiers -- New Yorkers hate their microbes -- along with humidifiers for locals with tetchy sinuses. 
 The store also offers space-saving items of the sort Middle America has little use for, including a contraption called a gym in a box, a wardrobe that opens to disclose a dumbbell set and a fold-down treadmill.
 Shopping at a megachain bent on commodifying the trappings of domestic life would seem to run counter to the compulsive need of Manhattanites to be different. And indeed some customers shopping at the store last week expressed ambivalence about being there. 
 ''It's like Starbucks,'' said Troy Hixson, a model looking at orchids in the garden section. ''You don't want to go there, but then you do.''
 As it is, with no lawns or home exteriors to mold into expressions of their uniqueness, New Yorkers instead turn to interior paint. Home Depot in Chelsea offers 3,200 hues: hundreds more than other stores do, Ms. Giuliani said, including many colors so bright that they would have no place in southern Ohio. They are the red states, after all, not the matte rose petal vermilion states.
 There are actual manly power tools tucked away on the lower level: gas-powered snow blowers, table saws, nail guns and the like. Mr. Faranda said that the store also expects to serve small contractors and do-it-yourself commuters, who might need to pick up, say, a chain saw on the way home.
 But if the store is to bridge the gap between the self-sufficient and the helpless, it may take some time. Bill McDermott, a transplant from South Dakota who stopped by to pick up supplies for a plastering job in his apartment, took a look around at the power tool section.
 ''New Yorkers don't know anything about this stuff,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Choosing a College Major: For Love or for the Money?

BYLINE: By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
Like countless other college students, Susannah Lloyd-Jones struggled with her choice of major. Finally, in her junior year at Loyola University in Chicago, she picked sociology, a decision that ''opened my mind and introduced me to other cultures, '' she said. More than two years after graduation, though, Ms. Lloyd-Jones, now a 24-year-old paralegal from Maplewood, N.J., occasionally wonders if she made the right decision. ''It might have been easier if I had been a business major,'' she said, ''because that's where the money is.'' 
 Ms. Lloyd-Jones says if she had it to do over, she would probably still study sociology but take more business classes and work some internships. She said students feel tremendous pressure over the choice of a major, which could be an important career decision, when many are just beginning to understand themselves. 
 Many students and career counselors say the pressure to choose the ''right'' major is more intense than ever because of factors like rising tuition costs and the uncertain economy. Parents and students today often consider college more an investment than a time of academic and personal exploration. Some students say they are education consumers seeking the best return on that investment, which is often financed with a student loan. 
 The annual cost of a four-year public college averages $11,354, a 7.8 increase from 2003-4, according to the College Board; a four-year private college averages $27,516, a 5.6 percent increase. 
 In their recently published ''College Majors Handbook With Real Career Paths and Payoffs'' (Jist Publishing), three economists from Northeastern University in Boston try to quantify just how much students with a variety of majors can expect to earn in their careers. The authors concluded that choosing a major was more crucial to future financial success than the college attended. 
 One of the authors, Paul E. Harrington, an economist and associate director at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern, said that, on average, humanities and education majors fared far worse financially than students in business or engineering. 
 In 2002, workers with degrees in chemical engineering and accounting were on the high end, earning an average of $75,579 and $63,486, respectively. On the low end, philosophy majors made an average of $42,865 and elementary education graduates $38,746. 
 Mr. Harrington said the research was not intended to dissuade sociology majors from following their passions. Instead, he hopes the information will help students prepare carefully when choosing a major. He recommends that students contemplating majors in the liberal arts or humanities also take some business-oriented courses. A philosophy major, Mr. Harrington said, should probably get some real-world internship experience. 
 ''The world is a more unforgiving place than it used to be, and investment costs are too high for four years of drift,'' he said. ''If a student doesn't take the right sequence of math courses in high school, they can lose out on the best jobs.'' 
 But some people worry that choosing a career based primarily on economic factors can lead students to make poor choices. Jieun Chai, a 2000 Stanford University graduate, for instance, deeply regrets not majoring in Asian languages. 
 ''I'm so angry at myself for giving in to peer pressure, parental pressure and societal pressure,'' Ms. Chai wrote on her Web journal. ''Why are you taking only language classes? Think about your career in consulting, engineering, medicine or law.'' 
 Alysha Cryer, who was Ms. Lloyd-Jones's roommate at Loyola, withstood pressure from classmates and family members who urged her to attend law school or study business. 
 Ms. Cryer said that sticking with sociology was the most satisfying, if not financially rewarding, decision she could have made. 
 After graduating in 2002, she took a public relations and marketing job at a nonprofit organization in Chicago called Little Brothers, a group that matches volunteers with elderly clients. Her starting salary was $24,000, barely enough to survive in Chicago. In 2003, she moved to Manhattan to work for Catalyst, a nonprofit research and advisory organization. ''With education so expensive, many in my generation are mired in debt,'' Ms. Cryer said. ''Some people choose to sacrifice personal happiness to make money.'' 
 Peter Vogt, a career counselor in Minneapolis and the moderator on the Career Planning for College Students message board at Monster.com, a Web site for job seekers, says many of his 20-something clients think they have squandered their college years on the wrong studies. 
 ''They think they only have one chance and that they've blown it,'' Mr. Vogt said. '''I should have picked X instead of Y. I should have taken the unpaid internship instead of working at T.G.I. Friday's to pay for tuition.''' 
 He tells graduates they should think of themselves not as psychology or sociology majors, but as workers with marketable skills like research, writing and communications. 
 A danger in the Northeastern economists' research, he said, is that it adds to the ''mythology'' that only dollar figures are important in choosing a field of study, and it does not account for differences in personality, aptitude, interest and values. Mr. Vogt considers the pressures facing current students far greater than those of generations past.
 Trudy Steinfeld, director of career services at New York University, tells students that majors should be less about preparing for one career and more about preparing for many options, and probably several careers, over a lifetime. She agrees with the Northeastern data showing that finance, accounting and technology degrees will lead to higher salaries. But she says she also sees liberal arts majors who become equally successful. 
 ''College should be about stretching yourself and discovering who you are and what you want,'' Ms. Steinfeld said. ''Schools should not become factories. There are hundreds of majors out there, and it's almost always a mistake to base the decision on money alone.'' 
 Ms. Steinfeld agrees, though, that students can run into overwhelming pressure from many sources. 
 Parents paying even a portion of college costs may wonder if a major in philosophy will pay the bills. And if their children change majors, it could extend college from 8 semesters to 9 or 10, at an additional cost. 
 Nevertheless, Priscilla Molina, 18, an N.Y.U. sophomore, is taking her time choosing a major. Many of her friends are pursuing business careers, but that, she said, will not affect her decision. She is fascinated by international relations and is leaning toward anthropology.
 ''I want to pick a path that I'm interested in, one that opens my mind,'' she said. ''You're only in college once. I don't want to regret why I didn't major in something I enjoy.''

HEADLINE: Between Union Leader and His Protege, Tension Over Direction of Labor Movement

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, John J. Sweeney, then the president of the Service Employees International Union, was so impressed by the drive and intelligence of a little-known union official from Pennsylvania that he asked him to move to Washington and become his organizing director.
 The official was Andrew L. Stern, who, quite predictably, succeeded Mr. Sweeney as the union's president. But rather unpredictably, he has called into question the whole structure of the house of labor, which Mr. Sweeney has headed for the past nine years. 
 Eager to reverse labor's decline, Mr. Stern has called for a sweeping overhaul of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., proposing to cut its budget by more than 50 percent and to use the savings to vastly increase organizing by its member unions. And he has warned that the service employees, the largest union in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., may quit the labor federation unless it embraces far-reaching changes -- changes that would have to be pushed through by the man who was his mentor, Mr. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
 Adding intrigue, some union leaders say Mr. Stern is seeking to push Mr. Sweeney into retirement, although he denies that, or having any interest in succeeding Mr. Sweeney in organized labor's top job.
 At the moment, these two union leaders have only kind words for each other, but when they were interviewed separately last week, their frustrations with each other showed: Mr. Stern's frustration that Mr. Sweeney has not done more to halt labor's slide and Mr. Sweeney's frustration that his former protege is seeking to slash the federation's budget, is threatening to break away and appears to be undercutting him. 
 ''We haven't seen a resurgence of organizing,'' Mr. Stern said, adding that Mr. Sweeney's efforts to use his bully pulpit to spur far more organizing by individual unions have fallen short. And Mr. Sweeney ever so diplomatically indicated his displeasure with Mr. Stern's threat to secede, saying, ''My goal is to keep the federation united.''
 What happens over the next few months between these men could go far to determine the shape of the American labor movement.
 Mr. Stern, who heads the nation's fastest-growing union, with nearly 1.7 million members, insisted that the two men were making common cause. ''I would say we're allies in what we want to accomplish,'' he said, noting that he and Mr. Sweeney each favor bold steps to stop labor's decline.
 But many labor leaders say it is strange behavior for an ally to threaten to quit, to upstage Mr. Sweeney and to implicitly criticize his performance.
 ''In terms of what Stern has proposed, there's a lot of overlap between what Sweeney and Stern want, but my sense is the Sweeney people aren't happy with how it's been done and that it has made Sweeney look bad,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University.
 With an elan rare for labor leaders, Mr. Stern has promoted his 10-point plan for change with a glossy brochure, a sophisticated Web site and a blog. His plan calls for having the A.F.L.-C.I.O. spend more on politics, for merging its 60 unions into fewer than 20 and for using the $25 million in yearly profits from its credit card to mount a nationwide campaign to pressure Wal-Mart to improve its wages and benefits. He wants unions to keep half the dues money they currently give to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and to use that to create a $2 billion war chest over five years for organizing.
 Mr. Sweeney praises his former protege.
 ''What Andy is proposing are some very good ideas,'' he said. ''I don't completely agree with every single proposal, but every single one of them merits discussion. Some of them, there will be great support for and for others, there will be healthy debate. I don't interpret these as Andy taking a swipe at me. I'm too big for that.''
 If Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Stern agree on anything, it is that labor unions and workers are in a bad way. Wages are stagnant, millions of workers are losing health insurance, corporations are hacking away at pensions, and just 8.2 percent of private-sector workers are in unions, the lowest level since 1901.
 Facing such a crisis, Mr. Stern and Mr. Sweeney badly need each other. If Mr. Stern is to persuade the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 60 unions to embrace his plan for aggressive change, he needs Mr. Sweeney to build a consensus. If Mr. Sweeney is to achieve his goal of making labor grow again -- a goal frustrated by the many union leaders who have done little to increase organizing -- he needs Mr. Stern as a battering ram to break through union leaders' resistance to change. 
 ''We complement each other,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''There is no question Andy has good ideas. He has done a great job at S.E.I.U. I think I have some skills and some strengths that can develop some of his great ideas and build consensus around them.''
 At times, Mr. Stern acts like his own worst enemy. After he warned that he might quit and seek to build something better unless the A.F.L.-C.I.O. embraced reform, some union leaders began calling him arrogant, divisive and a prima donna. Some said his style was undercutting his efforts to win support for his ideas.
 But Mr. Stern said he felt a duty to speak out about labor's woes. 
 ''I don't believe I have all the answers,'' he said. ''But I do have an incredibly strong opinion based not just on the experience of our union, but the experience of other unions in how we can best change workers' lives. It's my obligation to say what I believe is right for helping workers get some changes in this country because things are looking worse and worse for this generation and for my kids.''
 In his view one of labor's biggest problems is that many unions are too small to stand up to giant corporations -- two-thirds of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 60 unions have fewer than 100,000 members. Convinced that there is strength in numbers, Mr. Stern -- a University of Pennsylvania graduate who first became involved in the union movement when he took a job as a social worker -- is labor's most fervent advocate of mergers.
 ''We don't look at this movement, as it's currently structured, as giving workers the best chance they have to succeed,'' he said. ''They are trapped in organizations that were formed generations ago when the economy was different. Workers are paying the price for our failure to confront some of these structural problems. The purpose of the labor movement is not to keep as many unions as possible and as many officials with the title president after their name.''
 In the interviews, Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Stern praised each other for what they accomplished while heading the S.E.I.U. In Mr. Sweeney's 15 years at the union's helm, its membership grew by 500,000 and in Mr. Stern's eight years as president it has grown by nearly 600,000. The union represents nearly 900,000 health care workers and 220,000 janitors and other building service workers.
 The two men echoed each other in saying they had ''different styles.'' Mr. Stern is hot, Mr. Sweeney is cool. Mr. Stern, 53, states new ideas with crispness and machine-gun rapidity, while Mr. Sweeney, 70, speaks slowly, after careful deliberation. Mr. Sweeney is a consensus builder, Mr. Stern a charge-ahead consensus breaker. ''I think I have a little more patience than Andy does,'' Mr. Sweeney said.
 But the tensions are unmistakable. Viewing it as retaliation and as an attempt to discourage internal debate, Mr. Stern's supporters are angry that Mr. Sweeney fired the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of field mobilization, Marilyn Sneiderman, whose husband, director of the S.E.I.U.'s Justice for Janitors campaign, helped to write Mr. Stern's 10-point plan. 
 Mr. Sweeney made clear that he feared that Mr. Stern's call to slash the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s budget could hobble the organization. 
 ''We need a strong federation,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''The federation has to include services that don't get a lot of attention, the work we do on education, on safety and health, on communications and media. These are all important parts of our program.''
 In coming months, Mr. Sweeney plans to study proposals for change submitted by many union presidents and union members. He will make recommendations, including presumably some of Mr. Stern's, to the federation's executive council.
 ''Andy has chosen to be the lightning rod to help push for change,'' said Professor Hurd, of Cornell. ''Whether or not labor leaders agree with his proposals, if they don't do something dramatically different, the future for organized labor might be drastically bleak.''

HEADLINE: A Working Minimum Wage

 BODY:
Last summer, with an eye to this year's election, the New York Legislature decided the time had come to lift the state's minimum wage above the $5.15 an hour provided under federal law. While legislators did not exactly offer a Wall Street bonus to those working at grocery checkout counters or anywhere else on the lower rungs of America's economic ladder, they did approve a $2 increase over the next year and a half. This modest increase, following similar increases in other states with high costs of living like California, was intended to help workers without overburdening businesses. 
 The Democratic Assembly and the Republican Senate both passed the bill with plenty of votes to spare. Then Gov. George Pataki vetoed it, arguing that the state should wait for Washington to raise the minimum wage for the whole country at once. But the new Congress -- which could be more conservative than the one that is about to leave Washington -- appears unlikely to concern itself with wages for the poor or near-poor anytime soon. So it is up to New York's Legislature to override the governor and give this state's working poor a raise.
 The Democrats in the Assembly have already voted to override. That leaves the Republican Senate -- where members voted for the increase 51 to 7 on the first round -- to come back and do it again. Only 42 votes in the Senate are needed to override, but Joseph Bruno, the majority leader, refused to allow his members to address the matter again before the November election. Mr. Bruno's delaying tactics made it hard not to conclude that the Senate Republicans wanted to have it both ways. They wanted a recorded vote in favor of increasing the minimum wage to impress voters who liked the idea. But they could tell their more conservative constituents that the bill had not actually become law.
 Mr. Bruno now says he hopes to have a minimum wage increase in effect by January. If he is serious, a vote could occur as early as tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to go back to work. There are lots of items members should address, like budget reform, rules reform, electoral reform and an expanded lobbying law to cover state contracts. But the first and easiest piece of business to dispense with is the minimum wage. It would take just a few minutes to give a holiday gift to millions of people who labor so hard in this state for so little money.

HEADLINE: Exiles on Main Street

BYLINE: By Hugo Lindgren

 BODY:
IN FELL IN LOVE WITH A BAND: The Story of the White Stripes (St. Martin's Griffin, paper, $12.95), Chris Handyside explains why Detroit, in the late 1990's, suddenly teemed with noisy rock bands. ''The crushing effect of inactivity, burnout or apathy were ever present,'' Handyside writes. ''If you wanted to stick around the scene, you had to keep pretty busy to stay ahead of the boredom that led to the depression that led to the bottle that led to being just another anonymous face in the bar.'' 
 Nobody, in other words, was counting on that job at the Chrysler plant. And while playing in a garage band isn't likely to pay the mortgage, at least it fills up the day.
 Handyside puts his finger here on an essential, if often underappreciated, reason that rock music remains such a potent cultural phenomenon -- it is a time-tested antidote to boredom. Wherever there is tedium, rock finds fertile soil, and occasionally greatness springs from miserable circumstances. From Liverpool in the 50's to New York in the 70's to Manchester in the 80's to Detroit in the 90's -- where would rock history be without economic rot, cheap housing and asphyxiating boredom? 
 There is a catch, as each of these books attests, in one way or another. If you stay in the game too long, if you don't surrender your Les Paul and eventually give up the rock fantasy of eternal adolescence, boredom will come back to get you -- and you'll be in deeper trouble than ever. 
 In PERFECT SOUND FOREVER: The Story of Pavement (Justin, Charles, paper, $19.99), Rob Jovanovic picks up the story of a band that, despite its avowed indifference to fame, became one of the most influential indie-rock groups of its generation. Pavement was born in Stockton, Calif., in early 1989; two friends, Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, were trying to forestall the arrival of adulthood by writing songs together. They recorded five of them -- scratchy, idiosyncratic tunes that made a virtue of ineptitude -- called the thing ''Slay Tracks,'' pressed 1,000 copies and sent them out into the world. 
 Here is the notice of ''Slay Tracks'' that appeared in Spin magazine in December 1989: ''Pavement's brand of string-churn is a lot like a hambone half-chewed by Ohio's Sister Ray, then rump-blasted into the gaping mouth of some revo-tard-pop cousin of Live Skull's girlfriend. What a party!''
 It is a testament to the tremendous breadth of the global economy that such modest origins could lead to a 10-year career that included hundreds of thousands of records sold, tours of Japan and a decent standard of living for Pavement's members.
 Just before disbanding as casually as they had formed -- boredom had reasserted itself, and Malkmus had the good sense to bail out -- Pavement asked the White Stripes, a band unknown outside Detroit, to be the supporting act on three dates of its final tour in 1999. 
 The White Stripes were un-Pavement-like in almost every way. They wore matching red and white outfits, played loud, blues-oriented music and were fixated on upward mobility. There were only two members: Jack White, a budding virtuoso, on the guitar, and his wife, Meg White, a rank amateur, on the drums. If this sounds like a prescription for marital discord, it was. The couple quickly divorced, but the band miraculously endured -- they told the press they were brother and sister and made an alluring onstage spectacle of their tense relationship -- and became wildly popular.
 Like Jovanovic, Handyside tells his tale with a fan's undisguised bias. But whereas Jovanovic enjoyed ample cooperation from the members of Pavement, neither White Stripe would speak to Handyside, forcing him to make do with secondary reporting. Even in this rather limited book, however, a figure like Jack White helps provide a brisk, vivid narrative. The story of his ascension through the dive bars and bowling alleys of southwest Detroit yields some terrific details. It's good to learn, for example, that this deeply self-serious artiste got his start in a band called Goober and the Peas, remembered for its crowd pleaser, ''Hot Women (Cold Beer).''
 At 29, Jack White has achieved a mythic status that might one day have a writer like Stephen Davis telling his story. But let's hope it's not actually Davis. One of rock's most prolific hagiographers, he earned a place in the mass-market paperback canon with ''Hammer of the Gods,'' the gloriously debauched story of Led Zeppelin. Snatch up the next dog-eared copy you come across in a secondhand shop.
 With JIM MORRISON: Life, Death, Legend (Gotham, $27.50), however, Davis spreads the very ennui that rock is supposed to dispel. On the first page of the introduction, we are informed that Morrison, the hunky and mythopoetic singer of the Doors, ''tried to set the night on fire,'' and the toneless blare of Davis's prose doesn't let up for almost 500 pages. What seems to be every last concert, recording session and account of Morrison's legendarily boorish behavior is rehashed in dreary detail. By the end, it's hard not to feel relieved that Morrison failed to make it into his 30's.
 If it's too late to do an interesting book about Morrison, it's probably too early to write one about Elliott Smith. The singer-songwriter was a master of gloomily elegant folk-pop songs, and he flirted with serious fame when his song ''Miss Misery,'' from the ''Good Will Hunting'' soundtrack, was nominated for an Oscar in 1998. (He lost to the ''Titanic'' theme song, sung by Celine Dion.) Smith died last year after battles with drug addiction. With their wounds still fresh, few of his friends agreed to be interviewed by Benjamin Nugent, who gamely forged ahead and wrote ELLIOTT SMITH AND THE BIG NOTHING (Da Capo, $23.95). Some of Smith's heartsick fans may be grateful for this effort, as they apparently are for the ragged posthumous Elliott Smith album that also came out this fall.
 But less ardent fans might be puzzled by the book. Smith seems to have been a remote figure, and Nugent is unable to help us really comprehend the root of his trauma and his terrible addiction. 
 While rock success may have had something to do with Smith's decline, rock failure was very, very good for Seb Hunter, the author of HELL BENT FOR LEATHER: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict (Fourth Estate/HarperCollins, $26.95). His book is the gem of this batch, a wonderfully deadpan account of his childhood obsession with heavy metal and his subsequent attempt to make a career of it.
 To the young Hunter growing up in Winchester, England, heavy metal was a means of understanding the world and his place in it. His earliest love was AC/DC, then Kiss, passions that perplexed his parents and made him an outcast at grade school. Attempting to explain the appeal of the band Slayer to a friend, he described its music as ''aural bleach.''
 '' 'Why would I want to listen to aural bleach?' he replied.
 '' 'Because it's aural bleach.'
 '' 'But my ears are not a toilet,' he said.''
 So it went until Hunter ran off to London and lived out a dystopian adventure on the fringes of the metal scene there. That included living in squats, working in burger joints, taking lots of speed and leaving a trail of broken groupie hearts. The story is memorable not only for Hunter's mordant self-deprecation and hilarious recitation of heavy metal trivia (how many subgenres of glam metal can you name?), but for the unexpectedly moving conclusion. When Nirvana came along in the early 1990's, heavy metal collapsed, saving Hunter from his delusions and giving him the chance to rethink his life before it got completely out of control.
 Billy Corgan was among those rock stars who followed in Nirvana's wake, and in the course of a successful but turbulent career with the Smashing Pumpkins, he distinguished himself as a fiercely driven artist. His first collection of poetry, BLINKING WITH FISTS (Faber & Faber, $18), is further proof of his ambition, though not necessarily of his good judgment. There are many good rock lyricists, but even the best of them suffer when their words are set starkly on the page. Corgan is no exception. In earnest compositions tinged with goofy mysticism -- references to grottoes, lairs, oracles, ''ghosts of shale'' and ''spitting amethyst'' -- he reaches for something beyond his grasp. Here's my theory: after the breakup of his latest band, Zwan, Corgan is bored and he's taking it out on poetry. Let's all be glad that, at last report, he has started work on a solo album.

HEADLINE: A Trio of Villages Hugging the Hudson

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
DRIVING down Main Street on the way to a family gathering two years ago, Matt Koke and Bobby Belfry were quickly won over by the Nyacks' charms: the Hudson River views, the wood-frame homes with welcoming front porches, and the profusion of restaurants and galleries in the downtown business district.
 They were so smitten with the villages of Nyack, Upper Nyack and South Nyack, in Rockland County, 25 miles north of New York City, that they decided to leave their apartment in Astoria, Queens, and become suburbanites.
 ''But not the usual kind of suburbanites that most people associate with manicured front lawns, two-car garages and traditional families,'' explained Mr. Koke, a personal assistant for a Broadway producer.
 At first, it was the beauty of the trio of villages along the Hudson's western shore that lured Mr. Koke and Mr. Belfry, a songwriter and performer. 
 ''Then it was the friendly mix of people who live here,'' Mr. Koke said, referring to the traditional and gay families, individuals of different nationalities and racial groups, and artists, professionals and blue-collar workers who populate the area. ''In a nontraditional suburb like this is, it didn't take long for us to be woven right into the fabric of life.''
 Because the three Nyacks have attracted an eclectic mix of residents, the 2.7-square-mile area is often referred to as ''SoHo in suburbia,'' said Jaci Mandikas, a relocation specialist for Joyce Realty. 
 In all, there are about 12,000 people living there: 6,737 in Nyack itself, 1,863 in Upper Nyack and 3,473 in South Nyack.
 Robert S. Knoebel Jr., a Nyack village justice, who grew up a block from where he now lives, described the area as ''more than a small town, and not quite a city.''
 Mr. Knoebel, 42, lives in a 1920's Tudor with his wife, Donna, and their toddler son, Aidan. He has seen the area change in many ways over the decades -- and in other ways, remain the same. In the 1980's, the village of Nyack, where the downtown is located, was struggling through an economic decline, one of several the area has endured over the years.
 From the time of the Civil War until 1893, the Nyacks constituted a fast-growing center of transportation and manufacturing, with a rail terminal, a steamboat port and a cross-Hudson ferry.
 In those years, the area had three shipyards, six shoe factories, four cigar factories and a piano factory. But many of those enterprises were hit hard during the financial panic of 1893 and forced to close. In the years that followed, they survived as picturesque river towns but were not the center of industrial activity they had once been.
 Following the downturn of the 1980's, some of the stores downtown that Mr. Knoebel used to visit as a boy, like the 5&10 where he bought comic books and candy, closed. The business area, though, has since rebounded, responding in the 1990's to an influx of new antiques shops, boutiques and restaurants.
 Today, many structures built during the late 1800's and early 20th century remain, as does the mostly unobstructed view of the sun rising over the river in the early morning hours. Even Charles Jones, the man who used to deliver his parents' mail when Mr. Knoebel was a boy, still delivers it today.
 ''I'm not a nostalgic person, but when I walk outside for lunch or stop by Village Hall, I find it reassuring to see all these familiar sights and people,'' said Mr. Knoebel, who also has a law practice in the village center. 
 Over the years, the riverfront villages have been home to a number of high-profile residents, including the artist Edward Hopper. He grew up in Nyack, and his childhood residence on North Broadway is now the Hopper House Arts Center. Hopper lived there through his high school years -- he graduated from Nyack High School in 1899 -- and some of his earliest work depicts maritime activity near the docks.
 Perhaps the most famous resident was the actress Helen Hayes, who lived in Pretty Penny, a 22-room riverfront mansion, until her death 11 years ago at age 92. The 600-seat Helen Hayes Performing Arts Center has been established in her honor.
 Since Ms. Hayes, there have been others in the entertainment business who owned homes in the Nyacks. The comedian Rosie O'Donnell lived in Miss Hayes's house, but she has since sold it and moved to South Nyack. The film director Jonathan Demme lives in Upper Nyack.
 Among the area's many draws today is the relative affordability of its real estate, especially when compared with houses for sale in Westchester County just across the Hudson, said Frank Mancione, an associate broker with Prudential Rand.
 ''Sometimes people can't afford a house in Westchester, so they come here,'' said Mr. Mancione, who manages Prudential Rand's Nyack office. ''Other times they just don't want a place that's too upscale, so they chose Nyack.'' 
 Employees being relocated by their companies to the New York City area also often choose Nyack. According to Ms. Mandikas, many in that group suffer sticker shock when they encounter the prevailing prices for residential real estate in most other areas close to New York City.
 The median sales price for a single-family home in all three Nyacks is about $590,000, according to Ms. Mandikas of Joyce Realty. By comparison, the median price in Westchester at the end of September was $686,000, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.
 Mansions along North Broadway in Upper Nyack, directly on the river, get the highest prices -- from the $900,000's to several million dollars, Ms. Mandikas said. By contrast, Mr. Koke and Mr. Belfry paid $327,000 for their three-bedroom home in Nyack itself. 
 Also in Nyack, directly on the river, a town house condominium on two levels with three bedrooms and six balconies is going for $949,500. South Nyack has a range of offerings including a semiattached three-bedroom town house on the market for $310,000, and a 1930's two-bedroom Tudor listed for $499,000. 
 The main drawback of living in the Nyacks is the hour and 15-minute -- and sometimes even longer -- commute to Manhattan during the morning and evening rush. But at least one homeowner, Susan Veraja, said that especially when compared with the cost of homes elsewhere, it was a small price to pay. Ms. Veraja, an account manager for Verizon Wireless, recently closed on a four-bedroom, three-bathroom high ranch in Central Nyack, just west of South Nyack, inland from the river. She said commuters have a number of alternatives when traveling from Rockland County to Midtown Manhattan, including using the Tappan Zee or George Washington Bridges, or commuting to Metro-North or PATH train stations.
 In all, there are five areas in Rockland with Nyack in their names: the three along the Hudson River, and Central and West Nyack. The latter two, however, are hamlets of Clarkstown and do not have their own governments. By comparison, Nyack, South Nyack and Upper Nyack are self-governing villages with their own mayors.
 As is typical in much of New York State, there are many overlapping town and school boundaries in Rockland. The village of Upper Nyack is part of Clarkstown, while Nyack and South Nyack are part of Orangetown. When it comes to the public schools, all residents of the Nyacks, except those in West Nyack, are eligible to send their children to the Nyack Union Free School District, which has 2,881 students in three elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. 
 Ninety-four percent of the graduating seniors from Nyack High School last year took the SAT exams, with the average score for the verbal part of the test 526, and for math, 527. The statewide average in 2003 was 496 for verbal and 510 for math.
 The high school offers 15 advanced-placement courses, including calculus and physics, said Gail Fleur, a district spokeswoman. At the elementary grade level, Spanish is taught in Grades 2 through 5.
 Another source of pride for the high school, and for the Nyack area in general, Ms. Fleur added, is the football team. The Nyack Indians, as they are called, won the state championship in 2000 and 2003. ''This year, we only made it as far as the playoffs, but that doesn't mean we're not still cheering,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Maybe It's Not All Your Fault

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE spectacle of American spending always gets a little silly in the holiday season, but shoppers over the next few weeks will be hard-pressed to match the performance last year of Antoinette Millard. She ran up bills of nearly $1 million in Manhattan luxury stores like Cartier and Barneys, and, according to court papers, Ms. Millard is now suing American Express for improperly soliciting her to sign up for a big-spender's credit card, her purchasing weapon of choice. 
 The wayward shopper's ''victim defense'' is a stretch, like a fat person who blames McDonald's for his potbelly. Yet a faint twinge of amused empathy seems in order, at a time when Americans throng to downtown stores and suburban malls, and each day's mail brings a fresh pile of retail catalogs and credit card deals. 
 Indeed, while there was a good deal of tut-tutting about Ms. Millard's refusal to take responsibility for her spendthrift ways, it might be time to ask if American consumers are entirely responsible for all their out-of-control spending. After all, the United States economy depends on its citizens' penchant for spending with abandon. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's $11 trillion economy, and the machinery of American advertising, marketing, media and finance all encourage the consumption habit. Many consumers are unable to resist the overpowering mantra: spend, spend, spend.
 The reach of the American consumer is global. Economists have long described the United States as the ''locomotive'' of the international economy. Someday China, with its billion aspiring consumers, will almost surely take over as the world's largest economy. Until then, it is up to the United States, and its free spenders, whose purchasing includes vast quantities of imported goods like cars and flat-screen televisions.
 ''The American consumer has been pulling the United States economy and the global economy for years,'' noted David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's, a financial research firm.
 But all that heroic pulling comes at a price. The outlook for consumer-driven growth, economists say, is in doubt, given the low savings rates and high debt levels of many American families. The Commerce Department reported last week that the personal savings rate fell near to a record low in October, when American households saved a meager two-tenths of 1 percent of their disposable income. The rate implies that a family with take-home pay of $40,000 saves on average $1.50 a week. 
 The average American household now spends 13 percent of its after-tax income to pay debts, the highest percentage since 1986. Much of it goes to pay home mortgages and car loans, but the average American household is also carrying more than $8,000 in credit card debt. Every 15 seconds, someone in the United States goes bankrupt, five times the rate in 1980, noted Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who is an expert on bankruptcy.
 One school of thought blames an out-of-control consumer culture for this debt. The majority of American households have attained a level of affluence where added consumption no longer improves welfare, says Juliet Schor, an economist and professor of sociology at Boston College. Indeed, she points to studies that show materialistic attitudes -- wanting more and never being satisfied -- increase the likelihood that a person will suffer from depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.
 And in surveys of children age 10 to 13, Ms. Schor, the author of ''Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture,'' found that their overriding goal was to get rich. In response to the statement, ''I want to make a lot of money when I grow up,'' 63 percent agreed, and only 7 percent disagreed. 
 Another school of thought blames not the consumers, but the rising costs of necessities like education and housing. The debt of American consumers is worrying, but the problem is not impulse buying of luxury goods, said Professor Warren.
 Today's middle-class families with two working parents, she said, have far less financial leeway than a single-income middle-class family of 30 years ago. What Ms. Warren classifies as ''fixed costs'' -- mortgage, child care, health insurance, car and taxes -- take up 75 percent of the income of today's two-income family. By contrast, the those costs represented about half of a middle-class family's income in the early 1970's.
 ''The issue isn't holiday shopping,'' said Ms. Warren, co-author with Amelia Warren Tyagi of ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke'' (Basic Books, 2003). ''If you can't afford Christmas, then you can't afford your life.''
 What is beyond dispute is that consumer debt has become a huge business in America. In September 1958, Bank of America began the first mass-mailing of credit cards, sending some 60,000 into the mailboxes of unsuspecting families in Fresno, Calif. The plastic cards caught on. A little more than a year later, more than two million credit cards were circulating around California.
 There was scattered resistance in the early years. Preachers condemned consumer installment debt as a financial path to perdition, but the convenience of charging and the lure of easy money prevailed. Initially, banks saw credit cards as a favor to their clients, a way to build customer loyalty and make small loans, like for back-to-school expenses or to buy a refrigerator.
 But banking has steadily become a more aggressive, sophisticated business. The bankers figured out that the real money was to be made on people who constantly carried large balances on their credit cards but made their monthly minimum payments.
 These days, credit card marketers employ the most advanced computer technology to track spending patterns, reduce loan delinquencies and search for potentially lucrative customers. They employ intricate data-mining systems, neural networks and business intelligence software -- high-tech sleuthing tools similar to those used by national security agencies. 
 THE clever software can cull through credit reports, purchasing records, ZIP code directories, memberships in professional organizations and countless other data sources, often with pinpoint precision to assemble digital dossiers. The goal is to winnow out the likely deadbeats and zero in on promising prospects.
 They use all that to try to find ideal customers -- people who are going to load up on debt but not default,'' observed Joseph Nocera, author of ''A Piece of the Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class'' (Simon & Schuster, 1994), which chronicles the rise of the modern credit card industry.
 Consumer debt is, in a sense, a freedom. It has allowed consumers to buy things that would have been beyond their means. And Mr. Nocera said it could be seen as part of the evolution toward greater freedom across American society since the 1960's, from new sexual freedom to financial freedom.
 ''The big issue this raises is whether the democratization of money and finance has, on balance, been a positive thing or a negative thing,'' said Mr. Nocera, who is the editorial director of Fortune magazine. ''Are we better off? I'm not sure.''

HEADLINE: A Long March From Maoism to Microsoft

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: FOX ISLAND, Wash. 

 BODY:
IN one sense, Sidney Rittenberg can be viewed as just another international business consultant scrambling to cash in on the China boom. He certainly appears to fit the mold, driving an expensive late-model BMW and serving as an adviser to a long list of companies that have included Microsoft, Intel, Prudential Insurance and Polaroid.
 But at 83, Mr. Rittenberg is a striking contrast with the new breed of self-proclaimed China experts setting up shop on either side of the Pacific, promoting themselves as corporate matchmakers. It's a safe bet, after all, that he is the only American business consultant who can claim to have been airbrushed out of a photograph appearing in the official Beijing Review. And certainly none of his competitors can say, as he did in his autobiography, ''Mao didn't really like me.'' 
 From 1945 until 1980, Mr. Rittenberg lived in China. He was a member of the Communist Party there and served as a midlevel party functionary -- except for 16 years when he was locked away in solitary confinement, wrongly accused of being a spy. Though Mr. Rittenberg was born into a prominent family in Charleston, S.C., his compelling tale can perhaps best be understood as a story, writ small, of modern-day China itself. His metamorphosis from isolated expatriate to high-priced global go-between mirrors the country's own shift -- from a closed-door Communist state to a freewheeling money-making society, with a new class of entrepreneurs who dream the same dreams that dance in the heads of people in places like Silicon Valley. 
 These days, even as Mr. Rittenberg hopes to move toward semiretirement, demand for his services has never been greater. With hundreds of American companies considering their first moves into China, his long experience dealing with the country's leaders is a powerful draw.
 ''For a long while, Sidney was this very well-kept secret that only the top people in technology seemed to know about,'' said Mark R. Anderson, publisher of The Strategic News Service, a weekly business intelligence digest that features Mr. Rittenberg's thoughts on China. ''But word has really started to get out over the past two years.''
 Mr. Rittenberg's writings are avidly followed now by the likes of Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Michael S. Dell, who holds the same title at Dell Inc. Executives at Prudential, eager to sell insurance to the Chinese, recently sought him out for advice, as did InFocus, a maker of digital projectors. Last month, Mr. Rittenberg chaperoned Craig O. McCaw, a cellphone industry pioneer, on Mr. McCaw's first trip to China. 
 ''What you get with Sidney is not only his contacts,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''but also his understanding of the way these guys think and work, which is invaluable.''
 Mr. Rittenberg has started to do a brisk business among the venture capital set. In recent months, he said, several firms have beaten a trail to his remote home here, about 90 minutes southwest of Seattle, hoping that he will agree to take them on as clients. The reason is simple: everybody wants a piece of the red-hot Chinese economy. 
 ''I'm telling my clients that if they own stock in any company that doesn't at least have a well-articulated strategy for getting into China, then they should sell immediately,'' said Donald H. Straszheim, a former chief economist for Merrill Lynch who now runs his own consulting firm.
 John Zagula, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners in Bellevue, Wash., hired Mr. Rittenberg a few days before traveling with a partner to China this summer. ''He was like a sensei,'' Mr. Zagula said, ''whose advice kept me calm, centered and focused.'' 
 MR. RITTENBERG was dispatched to China as an Army private in 1945. Shortly after the war -- and his military stint -- came to an end, he joined Mao's revolutionaries in the mountains. He did not set foot again in the United States until 1979, not long after he had been released from prison. 
 Today, as a sage and a guide to the capitalist class, he lives with his Chinese-born wife of 48 years, Yulin, in relative splendor in Fox Island. Their home, on a three-acre site that includes an outdoor hot tub and a gazebo, affords them dreamy views of Puget Sound. ''For the longest time, it felt like we were visiting affluent friends rather than living in our own home,'' said Mr. Rittenberg, who can't help but shake his head over the direction his life has taken in recent years as corporate interest in China has exploded. 
 Mr. Rittenberg is a debonair man, short and active, with an etched face, thinning gray hair and brown eyes that in turn seem to dance playfully and, when a topic turns more serious, go dead with sadness. He affectionately calls his BMW ''Blackie,'' and his second car is a four-door copper-colored Lexus, which still has that new-car smell. Mike Wallace and the Rev. Billy Graham are among those he counts as good friends.
 ''He's an enthusiastic, lovely, sensitive friend,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''I trust this former Communist implicitly.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Rittenberg has a gift for winning over those not generally expected to embrace a former Maoist, including William A. Owens, who was the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bill Clinton. ''Sid Rittenberg,'' said Mr. Owens, now the chief executive of Nortel Networks, ''is the most fascinating individual I've ever met.'' 
 It's no wonder, given a life story studded with tales of late-night card games with Mao, Zhou Enlai and other revolutionary leaders in the days before the Communists took power. 
 ''With time, Mao came to not trust me,'' Mr. Rittenberg said. ''The simple explanation is that he generally didn't trust foreigners. But ultimately I don't think he trusted anybody but peasants -- the little people who were not threatening to him.''
 Mr. Rittenberg still has a high profile in China. Heng-Pin Kiang, who worked with him through much of the 1990's when McCaw Cellular was seeking to break into the Chinese mobile phone market, recalled how a Beijing cabdriver once refused payment for a ride upon learning that his passenger was ''the famous Li Dunbai,'' Mr. Rittenberg's Chinese name.
 It's not surprising that Mr. Rittenberg's name is so familiar in China. ''We all had to read the writings of Mao growing up, and Sidney was mentioned in Chairman Mao's writings,'' said Fengming Liu, who first met Mr. Rittenberg when both were working to help a telecommunications company, now defunct, get started in China in the mid-1990's. 
 ''Anyone in the general age group of maybe 45 to 55 would know Sidney's name, or at least his Chinese name,'' said Mr. Fengming, 48, who oversees all of Microsoft's China projects. ''And, obviously, a lot of people older than that would know his name because of the role he played in the revolution.'' 
 As an undergraduate in college, before he was drafted, Mr. Rittenberg belonged to the American Communist Party. He was 24 when World War II ended, an idealist who encountered Mao and his revolutionary band during a fact-finding mission in the Chinese hinterlands for a United Nations relief organization. Soon Mr. Rittenberg was working for the party's propaganda arm, translating news dispatches into English. 
 The pedigree of his past serves him well as he travels to China -- now six or so times a year -- to help American corporations negotiate with the relevant party and government officials.
 ''We can see just about anybody we need to see in China because people are curious to meet me,'' said Mr. Rittenberg, who described his 35-year China odyssey in ''The Man Who Stayed Behind'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993), a book he wrote with the journalist Amanda Bennett. Mr. Rittenberg served the first of two prolonged stretches in prison starting in 1949, the same year the Communists took over China.
 Both times he was accused of spying for the United States -- and both times the Chinese authorities ended up acknowledging that they had made a grave mistake. 
 He believed so strongly in the utopian vision of a classless society that he devoted that first spell in solitary, which lasted six years, to scraping away the vestiges of his bourgeois past so he could be an even better Communist. He married his wife, Yulin, shortly after his release from prison in 1955; today they have four grown children and four grandchildren, all living in the United States.
 During his second prison stint, from 1967 to 1977, he first saw the potential for a new career in helping American corporations crack the Chinese market. The catalyst was an article he read in The People's Daily about President Richard M. Nixon's trip to China in 1971. 
 ''I knew sooner or later that some tycoon would discover China,'' Mr. Rittenberg said, ''and I figured if I ever got out of this place, I'd have my chance to play the role of someone who builds bridges.'' 
 Yet he would first have to wake up to the fact that his beloved Communist Party had grown corrupt and autocratic. As he described it, his disillusionment came only gradually, a long and painful process that was punctuated by a single moment when his 12-year-old son interrupted a conversation he was having with his wife several weeks after his release, while China's notorious Gang of Four was running the country. 
 ''I was in the kitchen arguing with Yulin from my high political throne,'' Mr. Rittenberg said. ''And this little kid said, 'Dad, you talk just like the Gang of Four.' And I thought, 'Wow.'''
 In 1980, the Rittenbergs moved to Woodside, Queens, where they initially subsisted largely on the money they made as hosts of high-priced tours of China. ''He was lucky he came back in 1980,'' when Jimmy Carter was still president and the country's legal policies were less restrictive, said Leon Wildes, senior partner at Wildes, Weinberg, Grunblatt & Wildes and a professor of immigration law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. 
 Mr. Rittenberg's big break came several years after his return, when the chief executive of Computerland asked him about helping to serve as a host for a delegation from China. Initially, he was bashful about charging clients for simply sharing his knowledge, but he would quickly shed that vestige of his indoctrination. 
 Nowadays, when Mr. Rittenberg takes on new corporate clients, they generally commit to a one-year deal that pays him in the six figures. ''He may have been a card-carrying Communist, but he's also very much a capitalist,'' said David Shrigley, a former Intel executive who worked with Mr. Rittenberg at the start of the 1990's, when the company was seeking to open a semiconductor plant in China. ''And he wasn't shy about sending you his bill.'' 
 Intel knew little about China then, Mr. Shrigley said, which made Mr. Rittenberg's contributions well worth his fees. Over time, Mr. Rittenberg has developed a set of guiding principles for doing business in China: Candor is paramount. Patience is essential. And figure on at least three hours of prep work for every hour you would dedicate to a deal in the states. 
 BUT you do not hire Mr. Rittenberg because he offers rules for dealing with the Chinese, Mr. Shrigley and other clients said. You hire him mainly to have a consigliere at your side as you negotiate the thickets of the vast Chinese bureaucracy. ''He understands what's really going on in a very nuanced way that proved tremendously valuable to us,'' Mr. Shrigley said. ''He was very good at getting a read on how a proposal was being perceived -- if it stands a chance, what the real issues are. He was also good at helping us get a read of people in meetings.'' 
 Today Mr. Rittenberg -- like China itself -- may feel entirely at home operating in the capitalist world of global commerce, but not all potential clients necessarily feel at ease with his Communist past.
 In June, he and Yulin met in Beijing with a delegation of top executives from a large New York-based financial services corporation that he declined to identify, shortly before a crucial meeting with a regulatory commission there. ''These suits from the headquarters in New York started giving the people we were with hell for retaining us,'' he said.
 But even before the meeting officially started, the chairman of the Chinese commission interrupted the discussion to commend the company for hiring a couple he described as friends of China and its leadership. As Mr. Rittenberg told it, the commission chairman then added, ''If you succeed in China, I'm sure they'll be a factor in your success.''
 Recalling the incident, Mr. Rittenberg could not suppress a raucous laugh and a slap on the knee. ''Suddenly, I'm the all-wise consultant they can't possibly live without,'' he said.
 Like the Chinese officials who were once his junior comrades, Mr. Rittenberg does not seem to waste much time wrestling with his conscience over his new role helping those who in the past he might have described as imperialist forces seeking to exploit China's vast resources and downtrodden masses for personal gain. ''I don't think a lot in ideological terms of capitalism versus socialism, and neither does the leadership in China,'' he said.
 Even if he could, he said, he wouldn't want to undo his life, including those years he spent locked away in Chinese prisons. ''I am the person I am today in part because of that experience,'' he said. 
 Therein, perhaps, lies the root of Mr. Rittenberg's greatest gift as a business consultant: the perspective of someone who has lived a life that has been both arduous and rich. 
 ''If he bears scars from his time in prison, those are scars that he somehow has turned to be positive for him,'' said Mr. Zagula, the venture capitalist. ''He's vital. He's engaged. He has a BlackBerry. He's totally with it. He knows what's going on in the world.''

HEADLINE: A City Seeks a Remedy for Layoffs

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
THE last few months have been frustrating for several employees at Bayer Corporation in West Haven, and for the city.
 The company, according to city officials, is in the process of laying off about 400 of the approximately 1,600 employees at its West Haven facility, which is structured around research and development for the drug maker Bayer. 
 Mark Bennett, a spokesman for the company, confirmed that layoffs were taking place mostly in sales and marketing, but he would not provide any numbers. He said some employees who had received terminations notices would be working through the early part of next year. 
 Mr. Bennett said the layoffs were a result of an agreement reached in September that allows another company to market and distribute Bayer products.
 Mayor H. Richard Borer Jr. of West Haven, who called the company the city's biggest taxpayer and second-largest employer, said he was concerned.
 ''You can't escape the human factor,'' he said. ''Many people are taking it hard on the chin, and many of those are West Haven people,'' he said. ''We're doing all we can to work with Bayer to help them find employment, or get them retrained.''
 Mr. Borer said the company was continuing its investment in the city by increasing research and development at the West Haven site.
 ''They're going through a transition that a lot of companies in America are going through: doing less manufacturing and more research and development,'' he said.
 Robert Rosenberg, president of the West Haven Chamber of Commerce, said the layoffs could affect the city's overall economy.
 ''It depends on whether the people who are leaving there are going to find other employment locally,'' he said. ''If they relocate, it's going to have effects on the housing markets. Also, most of the people at Bayer are fairly well compensated. They have good buying power.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Slows Bid to Advance Democracy in Arab World

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other senior American officials arrive at a summit meeting in Morocco next week that is intended to promote democracy across the Arab world, they have no plans to introduce any political initiatives to encourage democratic change.
 President Bush started speaking in 2002 about the need to bring democracy to the Arab nations. Since then, however, the popular view of the United States in the region has grown so dark, even hateful, that American officials are approaching the meeting with caution and with a package of financial and social initiatives that have only a scant relationship to the original goal of political change. 
 Administration officials and their allies defend the change in strategy, saying the United States should no longer try to take the lead. 
 ''Others have gotten involved in the political side, and that is a good thing,'' said Lorne W. Craner, who was assistant secretary of state for democracy and human rights until August and now is president of the International Republican Institute, a government-financed organization dedicated to advancing democracy worldwide. But administration officials said some senior officials in the State Department were frustrated by the unwillingness of their colleagues to raise political initiatives at the meeting.
 A senior administration official involved in Middle East policy said that if the American program remained largely centered on business and financial initiatives, ''that's not good enough.'' The United States needs ''to hold people accountable,'' he added.
 Another official working in the same area added that Arab leaders were ''willing to take the aid, but they're not willing to carry out the reform.''
 Mr. Powell, in a radio interview on Thursday, said he hoped the summit meeting participants would ''come to an understanding of the need for reform and modernization in the broader Middle East and North Africa region.''
 When the State Department set up a news media briefing last month on the Morocco meeting, it assigned Alan P. Larson, undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs, to make the presentation. He said the meeting was intended ''to create greater opportunities for the next generation in the broader Middle East'' through grants and aid to small businesses, networking among regional financial institutions and exchanging ''views about how to bring more capital in the region,'' among other ideas. The United States is involved in most of those efforts through its Middle East Partnership Initiative. 
 In an interview, Mr. Larson contended that these and other financial proposals would contribute to democratic change, at least indirectly.
 ''When you help small entrepreneurs, that creates a middle-class part of the social underpinning of a democracy,'' he said. ''We see synergistic links between political and economic initiatives.''
 He and other officials said more direct discussions of political change would come from the Democratic Assistance Dialogue, a new program administered by Italy, Turkey and Yemen intended to foster discussion of political change. But after an initial organizational meeting in Rome last month, future meetings have not yet been scheduled, said Burak Akcapar, counselor in the Turkish Embassy. 
 The Middle East Partnership Initiative, which has received $264 million from Congress since 1993, has a political component. But a study by two scholars at the Brookings Institution, published this week, found that it was ''increasingly shifting its resources from democracy promotion and engagement with local volunteer organizations, to the far less provocative path of regime-led economic development.''
 That ''can have the effect of subsidizing an Arab government's attempts to build a kinder, gentler autocracy,'' it added.
 ''The whole thing rings hollow,'' said Steven A. Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research group based in New York. ''What is missing is not technical and financial know-how, it is the political will to reform,'' said Mr. Cook, whose field of study is political change in the Arab world. ''I don't think these programs mesh with the president's rhetoric.''
 At the briefing, Mr. Larson emphasized repeatedly that the Morocco conference was not ''an effort to impose anything from the outside as much as to facilitate efforts that are already being undertaken in the region'' and ''share experiences, share ideas'' among Arab foreign ministers. 
 Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a public research organization, said, ''If only the Arab leaders are involved, that will be a brief discussion.'' 
 Anger about a perceived bias toward Israel in Washington and about the war in Iraq have made the United States quite unpopular among many in the Arab world. Then, in February, when an Arabic newspaper published a draft of a Bush administration plan urging the world's wealthiest nations to press for political change in the Middle East, several Arab leaders erupted in anger. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a close ally of Washington, called the plan ''delusional.''
 The administration quickly abandoned the plan.
 The unspoken fact behind all of the discussions, said Leslie Campbell, director of the Middle East Program at the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a government-financed group that promotes democracy worldwide, ''is that we are trying to work with a bunch of people who are going to be kicked out of office'' if democratic change moves forward. For now, he added, ''it's easier to support free-trade agreements than political change.''
 Now, not only do many Arab leaders oppose the plan for broad democratic change, so do some opposition leaders.
 ''The Bush plan is opposed by the ruling elites who fear losing their privileges and powers,'' wrote Amir Taheri, a political commentator, in Gulf News, ''and by a variety of oppositionists who use anti-Americanism as the key element of their political message.''
 There is little question that Arab leaders prefer the new approach. A senior Arab diplomat said in an interview that when American officials spoke to his nation's prime minister about political change recently, ''the prime minister told them: 'I have two trains -- the political train and the economic train. And the political train cannot run ahead of the other.'
 ''So we started talking to them about economic development,'' the diplomat said.
 A senior State Department official said discussions with several Arab states brought similar results.
 In a speech to open a session of Parliament on Wednesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan emphasized that his country must continue ''reform, modernization and development,'' which would enable ''the Jordanian individual to actively take part in formulating the present and the future.'' He went on to emphasize that change should be focused on fighting ''poverty and unemployment.''
 Mr. Craner, the former State Department official, said: ''I would watch for the prominence of political versus economic and social reforms discussed at the meeting. If it is mostly economic and social, it is not a good sign.''
 The senior Arab diplomat offered a broader warning. 
 ''Something must happen as a result of this meeting,'' he said. ''If nothing happens, it will be very difficult to keep this alive because there are lots of people who want to kill it.''

HEADLINE: The Dry Goods Frenzy, Updated

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
AS the angry lady with the stroller grabbed the last $7 DVD player away from you at the Best Buy on Thanksgiving weekend, did you, perhaps, take a moment to reflect that such frantic shopping is hardly a new phenomenon?
 Of course, people have been killing each other for food since time began. But in the mid-19th century -- at the start of the great era of American retailing -- people were still shocked and amused by descriptions of crowds lining up and shoving for anything so mundane as ribbons. 
 ''In 1846, Harper's Weekly coined the term 'the dry goods epidemic,''' said Thomas Hine, author of ''I Want That! How We All Became Shoppers'' (HarperCollins, 2002). That newspaper, which often ran cartoons of women running, shouting and grabbing, wrote of ''a willingness to crowd into the stores at the beginning of the season when the newest lines arrived.''
 In December 1874, Macy's put $10,000 worth of dolls in its windows, Mr. Hine said, and in one masterstroke of marketing began several important trends, including lining up to see holiday window displays and panicking that your child's most desired gift will be sold out. 
 The hordes of bargain hunters, of course, are engineered by the retailers, said Julie Downs, director of the Center for Risk Perception and Communication at Carnegie Mellon University. Retailers, she said, ''want to create physiological arousal because shoppers in an aroused state are not as deliberative, they are more apt to buy stuff they don't want.'' 
 Holiday sales represent a very old technique, said Robert H. Frank, who is the author of ''Luxury Fever'' and an economics professor at Cornell. The trick, he said, is to lure different people into paying different prices for the same thing. ''If you just sell it at a low price, you defeat the purpose,'' he said, ''because you've missed all the people who would have paid full price.'' 
 The solution? ''To put a hurdle between the buyer and the discount,'' he said. That way, a distinct group -- the frenzied ones -- will line up at 5 A.M. for the dirt-cheap iPods, and the rest of the shoppers will say ''the hell with it'' and pay full price.

But in other cases, for instance at Macy's in Christmastime 1939, top, or a new Carrefour store in Hangzhou, China, or a Wal-Mart in West Burlington, Iowa, the fevered interest has been carefully stoked by the retailers involved.

HEADLINE: Transforming an Unappealing Street

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
WHEN Thomas Schutte took over as president of Pratt Institute in 1993, he said, one of the first things he discovered was the frustration that students felt about their adopted home. Sitting in Clinton Hill not far from where it meets Fort Greene, Pratt Institute, which was founded in 1887, was not exactly in Harvard Square. So Mr. Schutte took it upon himself to contribute to the revitalization of the neighborhood, known for its race and class diversity. 
 ''Myrtle Avenue was not an enticing street,'' Mr. Schutte said. ''It was unsafe; it had years of graffiti and terrible litter problems and drug problems. So I decided we needed to do something about it. I knew the neighborhood and the students needed that street to be transformed.''
 Mr. Schutte assembled a small group of volunteers, which eventually became the Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Project. Five years after its founding, local merchants gathered recently on a rainy fall day to celebrate a rather unexpected outcome of the kind of progress that MARP set in motion. Women have become the leading entrepreneurs in the neighborhood. Eight new businesses that have opened up on or near Myrtle Avenue in the past two years are all owned by women, many of whom live nearby. 
 Ada Williams's family came to Fort Greene from Costa Rica when she was a girl. She moved away but came back as an adult and has owned a brownstone here with her husband since the 1980's. As the senior manager of human resources for the National Basketball Association, she was getting tired of working long hours and needed to make a change. ''I wanted control of my day-to-day life,'' she said. ''For so many years, rushing down the hill toward the subway and seeing people walking their dogs, I just wanted to be around my community more. I wasn't even making it home in time to see the evening news. I don't like the phrase burned out, but I was burned out.'' 
 With the area on the upswing, Ms. Williams realized there was an opportunity to provide the kind of boutique shopping experiences that were already offered in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, but it took a while to find right location.
 ''I had a retainer on a property on Myrtle for two years,'' she said. ''It never became available. The day I took my retainer back, I saw a new for-lease sign. I called the property owner and he said he didn't want a beauty shop or nail shop. I said, 'How about a gift shop?' And he said, 'Can you come down and sign the lease right now?' And that's literally how it happened.''
 In June, she opened Frosted Moon Emporium on Vanderbilt, just off of Myrtle Avenue. Ms. Williams has selected the inventory with the neighborhood in mind. She says there's a baby boom happening in Fort Greene, so she has gifts for children. She also has home decor items and personal care products that are not readily available in the area.
 But more important, the 450-square-foot store is more than just a place to stop in and buy a present; it has a presence. The storefront's large glass picture windows, framed in decorative ribbons, reveal an inviting, brightly painted space. 
 ''I wanted to add life to the street,'' Ms. Williams said. ''When stores and restaurants and cafes are open after hours, people will stroll around and chat on their stoops. It becomes a much more pleasant place to be.''
 A few blocks away is another new woman-owned business, a 650-square-foot restaurant called Maggie Brown, which opened in October. ''I live in the neighborhood and my upstairs neighbor is a real estate broker and she was telling me about the space,'' said the owner, Chelsea Altman, 32, who is co-owner of a bar and a Mexican restaurant in Fort Greene. ''I had other spots in mind, but there's nothing on Myrtle like what I'm trying to do here. There are places to eat. But this is different.''
 The bordellolike retro decor was done by Ms. Altman to beautiful effect. The old pressed-tin ceiling had to be removed for soundproofing, so Ms. Altman used it on the building's facade and on the walls around the bar area. Chandeliers, recycled wood and flocked wallpaper all work together to create a warm atmosphere. 
 Ms. Altman, who is also an actress -- she appeared in a national tour of ''Proof'' -- says the neighborhood reminds her of the old SoHo, where she grew up.
 ''I was a kid when SoHo was coming of age, when there were artists and musicians and it was eclectic,'' she said. ''That's how it is here now. So many people are buying here, and they want restaurants and bars and retail stores. I'm thinking at a certain point there won't be much of a need to go to Manhattan.'' 
 One unusual shop in the Fort Greene-Clinton Hill area is Karen's Body Beautiful, featuring all-natural hair-care, bath and skin-care products, which Karen Tappin makes on the premises while customers watch. Ms. Tappin, a former high school teacher, began making products at home and selling them to family and friends, and the business grew enough for her to justify opening a retail store. 
 ''Almost a year ago, my brother-in-law came across the space and suggested we step up the business,'' said Ms. Tappin, whose store is on Clinton Avenue just off Myrtle. ''When I looked at the location, our demographic is right here. Economically, I felt the neighborhood could afford my products. And Myrtle is becoming a shopping destination, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to get in on the ground floor.''
 Ms. Tappin is a client of the Women's Venture Fund, a nonprofit organization that extends loans of $400 to $15,000 to women who are starting or expanding small businesses. ''There is a lot of energy around entrepreneurship in Brooklyn in particular,'' said Maria Otero, president of the Women's Venture Fund. ''And women and minorities are leading the way. The area is perfect for entrepreneurs because it's up and coming, but not yet too expensive.'' 
 All of the street improvements and the resulting influx of new businesses persuaded the City Council and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to approve the Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Project's request to form a Business Improvement District, which will encompass a mile-long stretch of Myrtle Avenue, covering 20 blocks from Flatbush to Classon. The BID, which is to take effect early next year, will take over street cleaning and graffiti removal duties that MARP has been doing for five years.
 MARP will then be able to aim more of its resources on continuing to improve the retail mix and assist the business owners. So far, MARP had provided grant money to 25 area businesses for storefront and sign improvements done by Pratt designers, as well technical and promotional assistance, tree plantings on the street and other improvements. Myrtle is also slated to receive new lighting in the coming year.
 ''It's got everything it takes to make for a revitalized community,'' said Norman Mintz, a BID consultant and the co-author of ''Cities Back From the Edge,'' who grew up near Myrtle Avenue and went to Pratt. He served as a consultant to MARP when it was just getting started. 
 ''After I worked with the group, I did not come back to Myrtle Avenue for almost a year, and I was so impressed,'' he said. ''It's been evolving ever since. It's gotten a whole new spirit. It couldn't happen to a nicer place.''

HEADLINE: The Insiders Are Selling. But Is That So Bad?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NEW research shows that pessimists are on shaky ground when they argue that recent heavy selling by company insiders is a bearish sign for the stock market.
 Insiders, of course, are a company's officers, directors and largest shareholders. Laws require them to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever they buy or sell shares of their company's stock. For decades, investors have paid close attention to what insiders at a business are doing, on the reasonable assumption that they know a lot more about its prospects than do the rest of us. 
 Many market timers, in particular, have paid close attention to the overall ratio of insider sales to purchases. Typically, they say it is a bullish sign whenever this ratio falls well below its several-decade-old average of around 2.5 to 1, and a bearish sign when it rises well above that average. 
 This indicator certainly looks bearish right now. The insider sell-to-buy ratio for trades over the last eight weeks is 5.51 to 1, according to the Argus Research Company of New York, which collects insider trading data from the S.E.C. and reports its findings in a newsletter, Vickers Weekly Insider Report. Largely because this ratio is more than twice the long-term average, Argus is decidedly bearish. For its newsletter's two model portfolios, the firm is recommending that investors hold no stocks at all.
 But how valid is it to compare today's ratio to a long-term average that is based on insider behavior extending back several decades? In recent years, some researchers have worried that the widespread use of stock options has distorted the picture, making the sell-to-buy ratio artificially high.
 Here is why: The ratio on which market timers focus is based on open-market transactions -- purchases or sales at the market price. Shares bought when cashing in options are made at the price specified by those options, and therefore are not counted in the ratio. But when an insider sells the shares acquired by exercising his options, those sales are counted.
 This calculation quirk is not a recent development. The figures have always been based on open-market transactions. But so long as relatively few options were being granted to insiders, few people worried that the ratio was significantly misrepresenting insiders' trades.
 H.Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan who has extensively studied insider trading, recently set out to determine how much the sell-to-buy ratio has been skewed by options exercises. Professor Seyhun calculated what the ratio would be if it included shares bought when cashing in options. His focus was on the four years from the beginning of 2000 through 2003, a period that included the last few months of the Internet bubble, a bear market and a little more than a year's worth of the subsequent bull market.
 He found that the inclusion of shares bought via options exercises caused the sell-to-buy ratio for those four years to drop significantly -- to just above 2 to 1, on average, compared with 6.5 to 1 when those purchases were not counted. As he points out, the lower number is right in line with ''what used to be the normal level before option exercises became more prevalent.''
 The biggest discrepancy between these two calculation methods came in late 2003, in the wake of the powerful bull market that began a year earlier. In November 2003, for example, the traditional sell-to-buy ratio, based only on open-market transactions, was more than 11 to 1 while the ratio including purchases from options exercises was less than 3 to 1. According to Professor Seyhun, this large discrepancy showed that insiders were taking advantage of the bull market to cash in their options.
 Investors should take his findings into account if they want to compare current insider selling data to the long-term average. Ideally, apples-to-apples comparisons should include options exercises when calculating the sell-to-buy ratio.
 But it's difficult to get up-to-date data that includes option exercises. Professor's Seyhun's numbers, for example, extend only through the end of last year. Without information that is more current, he recommends that we assume the norm for the ratio to be around 6.5 to 1.
 He adds, however, that this number is no more sacrosanct that the 2.5-to-1 ratio once was. The number would need to be revised again, for example, if the S.E.C. required companies to record options as an expense in the year when they are granted -- a proposed rule that the agency is seriously considering. In that event, he speculates, companies would reduce the number of options they grant, and the average sell-to-buy ratio would decline again.
 For now, however, because the current sell-to-buy ratio is still below 6.5 to 1, Professor Seyhun says that insider selling is no worse than neutral for the overall market.

BYLINE: By Pamela Paul

 BODY:
IN at least one important way, selecting a book for an armchair excursion is like planning an actual trip: Where you go may not be as important as the person you go with. Who wants to do Napa with a teetotaler or take on Delhi with a companion whose digestion is delicate? Readers rely on travel writers not only for their knowledge of foreign lands but also for their taste and perception, for what they remember and highlight and what they leave out. No matter the destination, a writer's failure to focus on the right vista can spoil the entire expedition. I recall two book-bound excursions to Vietnam, a country where I love to travel, with disagreeable narrators who seemed intent on quashing my enthusiasm. Neither showed me a good time. 
 Happily, the choice of literary guides is expanding, and some recent books have broadened the range of professional travel writing, a pursuit first perfected by the British, in a very American way. Rather than require authors to learn their trade in glossy magazines or gritty backpacker newsletters, several publishers have begun series of books that enlist famous nontravel writers as tour guides. Although the idea is reminiscent of those edifying vacations advertised in alumni magazines, in which packs of overgrown students tramp through Greece in the company of tenured archaeologists, presumably readers do yearn for ''qualified'' literary companions. And, like having a wine column or mastering sports reporting, travel writing seems to be one of those things many accomplished authors have always really wanted to try.
 At the same time, seasoned travel writers appear to be having second thoughts, questioning the genre itself. Do you actually need to go somewhere or can travel writing take place right where you live? Just how closely must travel writers stick to the facts? Like memoirists, perhaps they're allowed to bend the journalistic rules -- encourage the sun to set more pinkly or conjure up the requisite village savant. The two main questions seem to be these: Does the travel book differ fundamentally from the personal chronicle or from foreign reporting? And can anyone -- professional writer or well-informed layabout -- write a travelogue? Some of this season's most interesting new books address both issues.
 You hardly expect to see the name Anna Quindlen -- so closely associated with newspaper and magazine columns, domestic novels and short guides to the happy life -- emblazoned across the cover of IMAGINED LONDON: A Tour of the World's Greatest Fictional City (National Geographic Directions, $20). Quindlen also seems surprised by her latest endeavor, especially since she had never visited London -- or been overseas, for that matter -- until 1995. But her quest is more literary than expeditionary. Rather than lead us to the usual landmarks, Quindlen muses on her real passion: English literature and its London legacy. No literary snob, she veers from Henry to P. D. James and explores Sherlock Holmes's beat, Nancy Mitford's romps and Evelyn Waugh's targets, with room for plenty of Dickens. Best read by committed Anglophiles, Quindlen's appreciation of the literary city shows just how much a reading experience can enrich the physical journey.
 It would be silly even to pretend that MY KIND OF PLACE: Travel Stories From a Woman Who's Been Everywhere (Random House, $24.95) qualifies as a travel book at all. But that hardly matters. Susan Orlean is game for anything, and her exuberance is infectious. Her latest collection of essays, most of which will be familiar to New Yorker subscribers, lures readers into profiles and narratives on seemingly tedious topics: taxidermy, high school government, the local supermarket.
 ''I view all stories as journeys,'' Orlean explains. ''Even when I don't actually go anywhere for a particular story, the way I report is to immerse myself in something I usually know very little about, and what I experience is the journey toward a grasp of what I've seen.'' Orlean not only circumvents the usual subjects, she invites untimeliness -- plunking herself down in Sydney in the weeks before the Olympics and in Miami days before the Super Bowl (instead of focusing on the events themselves) and insisting on climbing Mount Fuji in the fog and rain. Orlean shows why place can be so pivotal to any story. In the end, her timing -- and the title of her book -- makes perfect sense.
 One of the more well-established literary travel series is Crown Journeys, which has steered authors like Christopher Buckley and Michael Cunningham on walks in cities both foreign and domestic. Myla Goldberg's TIME'S MAGPIE: A Walk in Prague (Crown Journeys, $16) is this season's best offering, though it cries out for even more than its 140 pages. It's nice to travel with a novelist: Goldberg's language is lush and evocative without sinking into dense or mannered descriptions. Better still, Goldberg was one of those post-collegiate Prague expatriates so prevalent in the early 1990's, so she retains a rusty grasp of the language and remembers the city's more obscure attractions. In Prague, she points out, ''for every designated spectacle there are at least three that have gone unmarked and unsung.'' Her forays into the Czech National Library and Vysehrad Cemetery, Prague's Pere Lachaise, make even those who have spent time in the city pine for a return ticket.
 But choose your Crown Journey carefully. I've always wanted to see Austin, but have second thoughts after reading THE GREAT PSYCHEDELIC ARMADILLO PICNIC: A ''Walk'' in Austin (Crown Journeys, $16), by Kinky Friedman. The book is more an ode to the self-described Kinkster than it is a guide to Austin proper, even with Friedman's desultory inclusion of to-do lists, quizzes and restaurant recommendations. He proffers his advice as a local yokel and a man's man, a ''Texas Jewboy'' -- which is also the name of his frequently mentioned rock band. Despite his evident fondness for the place, Friedman jokingly suggests that visitors skip Austin entirely because it's a city that doesn't take to outsiders: ''But maybe you've really set your ears back, and you're hellbent on spending your furlough in Austin. In that case, the least you can do is follow these few simple rules of the road for all modern Bubbas and Bubbettes.'' Or not.
 This sort of writing makes you yearn for a real travel professional. THE BIRD MAN AND THE LAP DANCER: Close Encounters With Strangers (Pantheon, $24) is the latest from the intrepid veteran Eric Hansen, author of ''Stranger in the Forest'' and ''Orchid Fever'' and a frequent contributor to magazines like Outside and National Geographic. Unlike many world-wearied writers, Hansen avoids studied cynicism and forced sentimentality. In this collection, he focuses not only on particular places but on the people he meets while traveling to those places, be they drunken roughnecks in New Guinea, patients of Mother Teresa in Calcutta or Russian expatriate chefs in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York.
 Hansen draws out-loud guffaws when recounting his own travails -- enduring the torments of India's bureaucracy, suffering from hepatitis in the Maldives and tripping on kava in the South Pacific. The book's only weaknesses are Hansen's failure to contextualize some of his isolated experiences (just how did he come to be working on a prawn trawler off the coast of Australia?) and the title story, which is a cliche-ridden dud.
 Another varied collection, in voice as well as place, is THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2004 (Houghton Mifflin, cloth, $27.50; paper, $14), edited this year by Pico Iyer, author of several travel books, including ''Video Night in Kathmandu'' and ''Falling Off the Map.'' Iyer, born to Indian parents in England, raised in America, schooled in Britain and now living in Japan, tries to uncover exactly what makes travel writing ''American.'' He notes that ''at a time when America is largely dominant in the fields of the English-language novel and serious nonfiction, we often look across the Atlantic when we're in search of classic travel writing.''
 It's no surprise, then, that Iyer's selections lie outside the Graham Greene tradition. In fact, most of these essays fall into travel-slash subgenres: travel/memoir, travel/humor, travel/foreign reporting. Those closest to the classic travel essay, and in a markedly American way, are the adventure stories -- Mark Jenkins's account of his reckless attempt to traverse Stilwell's World War II road in Burma, Kira Salak's investigation into efforts to protect eastern Congolese gorillas and Kevin Fedarko's tale of his ski trip to Kashmir. Iyer says he sought writing that would interest people who don't travel, but essays like Tom Haines's depiction of starvation in Ethiopia, Bill McKibben's meditation on the meaning of ''local'' in a globalized economy and Paul Salopek's look at oil exploration in pre-Darfur Sudan remind us why it's so important that we do.
 A useful companion volume is A SENSE OF PLACE: Great Travel Writers Talk About Their Craft, Lives, and Inspiration (Travelers' Tales, $18.95), in which the journalist Michael Shapiro serves as interviewer. Shapiro says he chose his subjects, ranging from Bill Bryson to Simon Winchester to Pico Iyer, in an attempt to recharge his own career. Hearing some of the great travel writers talk about their craft is certainly instructive for readers and writers alike, but what's note-worthy is the interviewees' near-universal disdain for the label. Jonathan Raban doesn't believe the genre exists and thinks of his work more as a ''total-recall memoir'' than as ''see the world'' journalism.
 Some of the people Shapiro talked to are unlikely contenders (the novelist Isabelle Allende; the television tour impresario Rick Steves), and he even includes a few next-to-unknowns. Most enjoyable are his interviews with some of the standard-bearers: Arthur Frommer, Eric Newby, Peter Matthiessen and Jan Morris. Given that sort of lineup, it's hard to blame Shapiro for his gratingly deferential manner and his habit of insinuating his own experiences into his interviews, but you can fault him for failing to ask some crucial follow-up questions. For guidance, it's best to stick with remarks like this one from Frances Mayes: ''The travel writers I like are those who create some kind of particular world where the experience could only be had by that person. . . . I like when I know the person is there, and they make the world of being there.''
 Speaking of Mayes, what would the holiday season be without another slew of books about whiling away the time in some wine-soaked nook of Tuscany or Provence? (And which comes first, the plane ticket or the book contract?) In TOO MUCH TUSCAN SUN: Confessions of a Chianti Tour Guide (Globe Pequot, paper, $14.95), by Dario Castagno with Robert Rodi, you look to Castagno, a tour guide turned author, to toss some vinegar on the lot. Self-published in Italy (with 30,000 copies sold), ''Too Much Tuscan Sun'' seems to suggest that Italians, pummeled by throngs of American tourists, long for the same approach. But Castagno, a former local party boy and vineyard laborer, is more charming than churlish. He prefers to highlight Tuscany's social structure and traditions rather than skewer the Americans who overlook them -- though he does mock their fondness for Diet Coke and pharmacies, lambasting the laziest and least considerate of his charges. Most refreshingly, his book doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a light, engaging jaunt into the Italian countryside, unfiltered by an outsider's prejudice and romanticism.
 Another potential curative is SEASONS IN BASILICATA: A Year in a Southern Italian Hill Village (HarperCollins, $25.95), by David Yeadon. At first, it's almost disappointing to learn that Yeadon, who specializes in writing about the world's more remote regions, chose Italy, of all places, not only to write about but to spend a year living in. But leave it to Yeadon to choose one of the country's poorest, most overlooked provinces, Basilicata, a barren, mountainous backwater located just west of the heel of Italy's boot.
 Inspired by ''Christ Stopped at Eboli,'' Carlo Levi's account of his imprisonment under fascism, Yeadon and his wife moved to the hill village of Aliano, site of Levi's incarceration. There they set themselves up in a small apartment, leaving Yeadon free to sketch the local sites and interview the weathered inhabitants by day, then join his wife to gorge on hearty peasant fare by night. It's not a bad life, filled as it is with the rituals of olive oil production, winemaking, brickmaking and pig slaughtering, intermittently disrupted by feasts, festivals, fairs, processions, market days and funerals. Yeadon also explores Aliano's rumored ''dark side'' of witches and werewolves, abandoning (nearly) all skepticism in the process. Maybe the book's leisurely pace reflects the torpor of rustic life, but at 463 pages Yeadon could have cut a few corners. Still, there are far worse ways to spend your time.

HEADLINE: Long on Cash, Short on Ideas

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
MONEY affects people in different ways -- it emboldens some but makes others cautious. Right now, healthy profits seem to have made corporate leaders meek. Business investment seems to be losing steam. And growth in jobs and the overall economy could soon sputter, too. 
 What's holding companies back? Can anything be done to rev up their investment spending? 
 After the 2001 recession, economists looked in vain for an expected rebound in spending by companies. The long-awaited recovery showed up in the second half of 2003, but it has slowed sharply in the third quarter of this year. 
 According to recent government figures, gross private investment grew at a mere 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter after expanding at a double-digit pace for the previous four quarters. The upshot is that corporate America's contribution to overall growth was cut by two-thirds during the last quarter, to 12 percent from an average of 40 percent in the previous four quarters.
 There's no mystery about what has changed. The main force behind the investment recovery -- spending on technology -- grew at a 13 percent pace in the second quarter, then just 7 percent in the third quarter. 
 ''I think capital spending has done its thing for this recovery,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm. ''While I don't expect it to fall out of bed, it will slow down.'' 
 Mr. Behravesh is in good company. Most economists are forecasting weaker business spending next year.
 But hang on. It's not supposed to be like this. By this point in the economic cycle, strong profits would be expected to translate into pretty spectacular investment spending, spurring dynamic growth in jobs and in the overall economy. Ideally, that should create a self-sustaining cycle of ever higher profits, investment and economic growth. 
 But instead of investing, corporate America has been accumulating cash -- big piles of it. According to the most recent figures from the Federal Reserve Board, nonfinancial corporations increased their liquid assets by 20 percent, to a record $1.3 trillion, from the start of 2003 to June 2004.
 Think about all that money for a minute. It's about 10 percent of the total economy, and much of it is virtually stuffed into a mattress.
 It's not the normal state of affairs. In a recent speech, a Fed governor, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., highlighted the unusual trend. Historically, capital spending has almost always been larger than a company's cash flow, according to Mr. Ferguson. That is because corporate leaders usually have a lot more ideas about how to generate future profits than they have cash on hand to do it. Today, it's the opposite. Companies seem to have more cash than ideas.
 So what's going on in all those thick-carpeted boardrooms? Have managers really run out of good ideas? One can only speculate. Mr. Ferguson said the cash buildup was a troubling sign of weak confidence. 
 ''Given the current low interest rates, the preference for holding financial assets over expanding operations suggests that businesses lack confidence in the future profitability of their potential ventures,'' he said. Factors like high oil prices, international tension, immense budget deficits, high consumer debt and stretched consumer budgets could be weighing on decision makers.
 But there are other considerations. Consider all the investment opportunities out there. Is it possible that corporate leaders just can't find enough acceptable opportunities to expand their operations -- at least not at home? Or perhaps it's a question of expectations. Executives who became accustomed to rich returns during the bubble years may not have adjusted their expectations to the current climate. They could be holding on, waiting for the home run that seems never to happen.
 Whatever the reason for holding back, there remains a huge untapped potential for the economy. But that potential may never be fully realized. Investors recognize the problem, which is sometimes called the bladder principle. Uncomfortably large cash reserves build pressure for managers to spend. At a certain point, they may seek relief without due consideration of the wisdom of their spending.
 Ultimately, the fear of wasting hard-earned dollars leads companies to sit on their hands or, as Microsoft chose so dramatically, to return the hoard to shareholders rather than invest it.
 With so much potential sitting idle, can anything be done to encourage wise business investment? One popular recent approach has been to allow businesses to accelerate the depreciation of their investments, a tax incentive that encouraged buying of certain items. Legislation allowing this went into effect in 2002 and will expire at the end of this year. But so far, evidence suggests that the policy's economic impact has been modest. 
 Two economists at the University of Michigan, Christopher L. House and Matthew D. Shapiro, recently studied the policy and found that while the accelerated depreciation rates did bolster spending on long-life assets, the effect on the overall economy was not large. 
 THEY calculated that the policy might have increased output by 0.1 percent over all and resulted in 100,000 more jobs. As the policy expires at the end of this year, those gains could shrink. In any case, government incentives have their limits. ''A firm isn't going to want to install capital, even if it's cheap, if it can't use it in the future,'' Professor Shapiro said. ''If people come to expect we'll have a relatively strong economy over the next few years, that will be more important than any of these tax changes.''
 That insight may be crucial to understanding the problem. 
 The best path forward may not be paved with a clever government fix but rather with a steady diet of fiscal responsibility, wise international diplomacy and price stability. And for individual businesses, the task may be refocusing on the difficult and expensive path of investing steadily and courageously in their long-term strategies. 
 Subtracting a bit from those cash piles could add nicely to the economy.

HEADLINE: A Working Minimum Wage

 BODY:
Last summer, with an eye to this year's election, the New York Legislature decided the time had come to lift the state's minimum wage above the $5.15 an hour provided under federal law. While legislators did not exactly offer a Wall Street bonus to those working at grocery checkout counters or anywhere else on the lower rungs of America's economic ladder, they did approve a modest $2 increase over the next year and a half aimed at helping workers without overburdening businesses. 
 The Democratic Assembly and the Republican Senate passed the bill with votes to spare. Then Gov. George Pataki vetoed it, arguing that the state should wait for Washington to raise the minimum wage for the whole country at once. But since Congress appears unlikely to concern itself with wages for the poor or near-poor anytime soon, it is up to New York's Legislature to override the governor and give this state's working poor a raise. 
 The Democrats in the Assembly have already voted to override. That leaves the Republican Senate -- where members voted for the increase 51 to 7 on the first round -- to come back and do it again. Only 42 votes in the Senate are needed to override. Joseph Bruno, the majority leader who refused to allow his members to address the matter before the November election, now says he hopes to have a minimum wage increase in effect by January.
 If he is serious, a vote could occur as early as tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to resume work. There are lots of items that need attention, like budget reform, rules reform, electoral reform and an expanded lobbying law to cover state contracts. But the first and easiest piece of business to dispense with is the minimum wage. 
 It would take just a few minutes to give a holiday gift to millions of people who labor so hard in this state for so little money.

HEADLINE: An Islamic Democracy for Iraq?

BYLINE: By Ian Buruma. 
Ian Buruma is the author, with Avishai Margalit, of ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of Its Enemies.''

 BODY:
Is ''Islamic democracy'' really possible? Or is it something meaningless, like ''Jewish science,'' say, or contradictory, like ''people's democracy'' under Communism? This is the question that will determine the future of Iraq, since the man with the greatest credibility in that broken country is Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Shiite cleric, who refuses to run for office himself but says that he supports the idea of Islamic democracy.
 The ayatollah insists that an Iraqi constituent assembly must be chosen through direct elections and that ''any basic law written by this assembly must be approved by a national referendum.'' He makes only cursory reference to Koranic law as the basis for that legal code. Any attempts to postpone general elections because of security concerns, especially in the Sunni areas, have also been fiercely resisted. In mid-October, he issued a fatwa requiring all men and women to vote, equating voting with such basic religious duties as fasting during Ramadan. It is the duty of the Shiites, according to the ayatollah, to protect Sunni and Christian interests as well. And although he opposed a plan to allow Kurds, who make up 15 to 20 percent of the Iraqi population, veto power over the constitution, he has not squelched Kurdish hopes of preserving some degree of autonomy under a new government. All these are fine words, of course, yet to be tested in reality. But they are remarkable words for a Shiite cleric born in Iran and should be taken seriously. 
 Despite the recent surge of conservative Christian activism in the United States, the received opinion in the Western world is that in democracies, church and state do not mix. Islam, we are often told, is particularly unsuited to democracy because in Muslim countries the state was never untangled from the clergy. But Iraq was supposed to be a special case, because it was largely secular. In fact, both these assertions were too sweeping. Muslims have rarely been ruled by clerics. Worldly and spiritual authority have usually been kept separate in the Middle East. And until not so long ago, religious minorities, like Jews, were treated with more tolerance in the Muslim world than in Christendom. When worldly authority becomes intolerably oppressive, however, religion is often the only base of resistance. Such was the case in Poland under Communist rule, when the Catholic Church provided a source of dissent. Under Saddam Hussein, the mosque had begun to play a similar role. Political Islam was a way to fight back against secular Baathism, and Ali al-Sistani was its main Shiite spokesman. The pope played a somewhat comparable role under Communism.
 Still, the neoconservatives around President Bush mostly favored a secular route toward democracy in Iraq. In the early days of the war, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz frequently cited Turkey as a ''useful model for others in the Muslim world,'' and the administration pinned its hopes on secular exiles like Ahmad Chalabi, not Shiite mullahs exiled to London and Tehran. This line of thinking fell in easily with the views of another administration favorite, Bernard Lewis, the Princeton scholar who says that Kemal Ataturk got it right in Turkey: to promote modernism, religious authority must be forcibly expunged from politics. Ataturk said in 1917 that he would change Turkish social life in one blow. And that, in 1923, is what he proceeded to do. Women were stripped of their veils, Islamic schools were closed and dervish brotherhoods were banned. Even wearing the Turkish fez was forbidden in the new society ruled by ''science, knowledge and civilization.'' 
 Similar revolutions happened or were tried elsewhere. After the Meiji Restoration in Japan in the 1860's, Buddhist temples were razed in the name of civilization and enlightenment. The May 4, 1919, students' revolt in China was an attempt to replace Confucian tradition and religious ''superstition'' with ''Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy.'' In Persia, during the 1920's, Reza Shah Pahlevi tried to modernize his nation, later to be called Iran, by leveling mosques, murdering or arresting clerics and banning the chador. And the pan-Arabism of the early Baathists, some of whom were Christians in Syria, was a secular movement inspired by pan-German nationalism.
 Unfortunately, what came out of all this secularizing zeal was not democracy but militarism, absolute monarchy, fascism and variations of Stalinism. The religious revolution that now stalks the Muslim world has come as a reaction, in part, to the failure of modern secular politics. And yet many Middle East analysts sympathetic to the Bush administration, like Daniel Pipes, see a secular strongman, along the lines of Ataturk or Chiang Kai-shek, as the best option in Iraq, since elections in the short term would bring ''Khomeini-like mullahs'' to power. Neoconservatives are not alone in their distrust of clerics. This distrust split the left-leaning anti-Communist opposition in Poland too. It was hard for some dissidents to support the priests against the commissars. As Jerzy Urban, one of the last spokesmen for the Communist regime there, once remarked, it's either us or the Black Madonna of Czestochowa. But does it always have to be one or the other? Is the choice in Iraq really between Ataturk and Khomeini?
Islamic democracy has no track record, since it barely exists as yet. In Iran, a democracy of sorts is controlled by a religious council. Perhaps Turkey comes closest to a European model we know, based loosely on religious values without being a theocracy. Yet even Turkish democracy is distrusted by many Europeans and is actually considered sinful by some Muslims.
 The idea that modern democracy has to be secular in its ethos is, of course, rooted in European history. The Enlightenment was partly an assault on the authority of the church, especially in France. Political arrangements were to be subject to reason, not to theology. To be modern was to reject religion, or ''superstition,'' and to believe in science. It was not enough, in the view of Voltaire, among others, to put organized religion in its place; it was necessary to ''wipe out that rubbish.'' The belief in science as a solution for all human problems became a kind of superstition itself. Scientific socialism, a la Stalin and Mao, for example, led to all manner of crackpot experiments that caused the deaths of millions. 
 Of course, not all rationalists were so extreme. Many typical Enlightenment thinkers, like John Locke, were convinced that a political system based on enlightened self-interest could not survive without a strong basis in religious morality. The kind of anti-clericalism that inspired Stalinists and other authoritarians was more a product of the French Revolution than of the pursuit of democracy in itself. 
 In fact, anti-clericalism, much more than a history of religious zeal, formed the basis for many of the Middle East's bloodiest political failures: Nasserism in Egypt, Baathism in Syria and Iraq, the shah in Iran. These regimes were led by secular elites who saw religion as something that held their countries back or in a state of colonial dependence. The fact that a number of iron-fisted reformers, like Nasser himself, were routinely the objects of assassination attempts by religious zealots showed the gap between the secular ''progressive'' elites and the people they ruled. When organized religion is destroyed, something worse often takes its place, usually a quasi religion or personality cult exploited by dictators. When it is marginalized, as happened in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East, it provokes a religious rebellion.
 This is not to say that Muslim clerics are naturally disposed to democracy. But, as Michael Hirsh pointed out in a recent article in The Washington Monthly, a number of Middle East scholars -- Richard Bulliet, author of ''The Case for Islamo-Christian Civilization,'' among them -- have argued that religion for many centuries actually acted as a constraint on tyranny in the Muslim world. The destruction of traditional Muslim institutions, like religious schools and mosques, in the name of modernization left a social void in which extreme, political Islam would eventually thrive. 
 Ayatollah Khomeini was not acting as a traditional Shiite cleric but as a modern revolutionary who took power as a political strongman. And in the eyes of many believers, his worldly dictatorship in Iran undermined his stature as a religious figure, since mullahs are not supposed to act like politicians. Osama bin Laden is an amateur priest with more knowledge of Swiss bank transfers and media manipulation than of the intricacies of Islam. It would be hard to find a serious Muslim cleric or scholar who respects him. 
 It may be useful to reflect for a moment on how the West itself has coped with religion. The separation of church and state was indeed a necessary condition for democratic development in Europe and the United States, but the separation has never been absolute. Britain's constitutional arrangements include organized religion: the monarch is the protector of the Anglican faith. This may now be nothing more than a formality, but in continental European politics Christian democratic parties are still the mainstream. The first such party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party, was founded in 1879 by a Calvinist ex-pastor in the Netherlands named Abraham Kuyper. His aim was to restore God (not the church) as the absolute sovereign over human affairs. Only if secular government was firmly embedded in the Christian faith could its democratic institutions survive. That is what he believed and what Christian Democrats still believe. 
 I do not believe this. It is always tricky for an agnostic in religious affairs to argue for the importance of organized religion, but I would argue not that more people should be religious or that democracy cannot survive without God, but that the voices of religious people should be heard. The most important condition for a functional democracy is that people take part. If religious affiliations provide the necessary consensus to play by common rules, then they should be recognized. A Sharia-based Shiite theocracy, even if it were supported by a majority, would not be a democracy. Only if the rights and interests of the various ethnic and religious groups are negotiated and compromises reached could you speak of a functioning democracy.
 A tall order, to be sure, but given the miserable record of secular politics in the Middle East, and beyond, it makes sense that several distinguished experts on Islam have taken issue with the Ataturkian solution in Iraq. Reuel Marc Gerecht, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research and a former C.I.A. specialist, has argued that devout followers of Sistani offer not just the best hope for democracy but also the only one. In Gerecht's view, Sistani's ''Iranian blood and family in the Islamic republic has surely made [him] more sensitive to the pitfalls of clerical dictatorship,'' and ''in the matter of democracy in Iraq, Sistani may again become one of America's most effective allies.'' Noah Feldman, an N.Y.U. law professor, has also argued forcefully that Islamic democracy is possible in Iraq, a democracy that guarantees not just that people can vote but also that they can ''vote for laws infused with Islamic beliefs, ideals and values, and the state can endorse Islam and fund religious institutions and education.''
 The views of devout Shiites on the rights of women and other social issues may not be shared by most voters in the United States, but devout Shiites do claim to want popular sovereignty based on elections. The question is whether Sistani and his followers maintain this position because they are the majority in Iraq and elections would favor them, not the Sunnis, or whether they want an electoral system on principle. We will not know the answer until it is tested -- that is, until one faction or another loses an election and has to give its consent to being ruled by an alternative party. Sistani has worked hard to create a unified Shiite coalition, but Shiites are far from being united. A coalition between Chalabi and the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr could siphon off a number of Shiite votes. 
 In January, some 200 political groups will be vying for places in a 275-seat national assembly. As in Europe, in Iraq these parties are expected to form a patchwork of alliances (many of them no doubt along religious lines) and then work to appoint a prime minister and draft a permanent constitution. Elections for a full-term government are supposed to take place at the end of 2005. And apart from local elections for provincial leaders, the Kurds in the northern Kurdish region will be voting for a separate assembly at the end of January. 
This sounds complicated, but it is not more so than the situation in Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world. Three months ago, a group of Iraqi political delegates visited Indonesia to watch that country's democratic elections in action. Akif Khalik Ibraheem, of the Iraqi Independent Democrats, a largely Sunni party, said, ''The most important lesson here is not to be deterred by the complexity and difficulty of the task -- it can be done.'' Mahdi Jaber Mahdi, a delegate from the Iraqi Communist Party, a predominantly secular organization, expressed a similar feeling, telling a reporter for Agence France-Presse that, like Indonesia, Iraq had a variety of religious and ethnic groups and that the important thing was to ''manage that variety.'' He said that ''the more democratically you manage these, the more you are assured the country will not be split.'' 
 The transition to democracy in Indonesia has not been easy, following as it has years of secular dictatorship, during which political Islam was suppressed, much as it was in Iraq. Yet the outcome has not been a fundamentalist Islamic regime but a democratic system, however flawed, in which Islamist parties have to cast around for votes like any other party. 
 To be sure, Indonesian Muslims are different from Arabs. Their religious habits are less puritanical. Fanaticism is not in their tradition. Women enjoy a higher status. But their politics can be just as brutal, even though often couched in the language of tolerance and consensus. President Suharto, who took power in 1967 after a bloody coup, suppressed political Islam by forcing the Muslim parties to merge into one representative body, which had to accept non-Muslims too. It was called the P.P.P., the United Development Party. The official ideology was not Islam but Pancasila, devised by Suharto's predecessor, Sukarno, as a kind of state religion to form a common moral basis for national unity. Pancasila is a Sanskrit term encompassing five principles: belief in the supreme being, a just and civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy and social justice for all Indonesians. Anodyne enough, you might say, if a little disingenuous, for there was no democracy under Suharto. But Muslims, forced to give the state ideology precedence over Islam, felt robbed of their religious identity. Riots broke out in Jakarta, Chinese people and Christians were attacked and the old Buddhist temple in Borobodur was bombed. Not one to take even peaceful dissent lightly, Suharto cracked down hard. Official Muslim organizations decided to accept Pancasila.
 Radical Islam, promoted and financed by Wahhabists from Saudi Arabia, began to attract a growing number of Indonesians for the same reason it appealed to Iraqis under Saddam Hussein: when all political opposition is crushed by autocrats, the mosque becomes the only place of political refuge. After an economic crisis led to the downfall of Suharto's dictatorship, the chaotic start of a new democracy created room for radicals, calling for an Islamic state, to operate more freely. Secular politicians refused to criticize the Islamists for fear of being accused of being anti-Islam, and moderate Muslims tried to ignore them. This pretense was no longer possible after a group named Jemaah Islamiyah, loosely linked to Al Qaeda, killed more than 200 people in a disco in Bali. Indonesians had to acknowledge that they had an Islamist terrorist problem.
 You might conclude from this that Suharto had it right. His rule may have been harsh and corrupt, but at least he kept the Islamists in their box. Democracy is resulting in terror. Yet this would be the wrong conclusion. Not only were Suharto's authoritarian methods largely responsible for the birth of religious extremism; democracy is proving to be the best cure -- for moderate Muslims, still the majority in Indonesia, are so appalled by the bloody mayhem caused by the terrorists that they won't vote for any party associated with them. This has forced the Islamist parties to publicly reject the extremists. 
Will Iraq be like Indonesia? Will democracy allow the differences between Arabs and Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis, religious and secular, to be solved without violence? In principle, you would have to say that it would. But the Iraqis have problems that the Indonesians did not have to face. They have to build democratic institutions under a hated foreign occupation. 
 It is very difficult to build a democracy as pupils of foreign tutors who arrived in bombers and tanks. Even though the foreign occupiers say they want an Iraqi democracy too, anyone or any party believed to be on the side of foreigners is discredited from the start. The more those foreigners insist on secularism, the more the local people may turn to radical Islamism. And the more violence the Islamists unleash, the less likely it is that Iraqis can vote in safety. This is particularly true of the so-called Sunni triangle north and west of Baghdad. It is all very well for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and for leading Shiites and Kurds, to say that it would still be better to have elections, even if many people can't take part, but that won't do. ''There is no perfect election in the world,'' Sa'ad Jawad Qandil told The Boston Globe. Qandil is a senior official in the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution, a major Shiite party better known as Sciri. ''If there are some minorities who cannot participate because of security, that is not a reason to cancel the decision of the majority.'' Well, yes, it is. For if the Sunnis can't vote, Iraqi democracy won't work, because without the consent of this minority, the majority can never govern in peace. 
 There are other problems with a democracy incorporating a patchwork of faiths and denominations. A two-party system is not really feasible. Yet in a multiparty system, small parties can have too much influence, as they do in Israel. Most Israelis are secular people, but tiny orthodox parties can sometimes make or break governments. Perhaps the early Zionists, almost all secular, socialist kibbutzniks, gave too much away to the religious, by letting them set the rules for marriage, among other things. The fear was that without such a deal, the ultra-Orthodox would not recognize the state of Israel. But the founding fathers of Israel cannot have anticipated that autonomy in spiritual affairs would lead to so much clout in secular politics. 
 It is also true that the religious, in Europe, the United States or anywhere, often do what their priests or mullahs tell them to. Until not so long ago, many people in countries with Catholic or Protestant parties did just that. But at least they voted, and by consenting to the democratic rules, they managed to live together without going at one another's throats. If Shiites and Sunnis can do so in a future Iraq, by voting for religious parties, then so be it. But first they have to be able to vote without getting killed. That is the issue, and not religion per se. The answer will be shaped by a foreign occupation, which made democracy possible, but then, by its very presence, might help to snuff it out.

HEADLINE: House Proud

BYLINE: By Matt Bai

 BODY:
Q: What's different about Washington, as you leave it, than when you arrived?
 When I came here, we'd fight hard on the floor, in the old Tip O'Neill phrase, but then we'd go have a beer together and get along as human beings. And that just does not happen as much as it did. When it's my way or the highway every day, which is the way I think the Republicans run the place, I don't think it works very well. 
 Who was the most talented politician you ever saw?
 Bill Clinton. Hands down. You can't just be up there giving numbers and facts. You've got to connect emotionally.
 I was at the flea market the other day, and they were selling the edition of The New York Post with the famous headline that said you were the vice-presidential nominee.
 I thought I could get enough of them that I could support myself in retirement. I could autograph them and sell them for a little more on eBay, and get $5 rather than $3.
 That's as good a retirement plan as I've heard from Congress in a while. What else have you been buying?
 I did get an iPod. Oh, I love it. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. 
 What are you listening to -- political speeches?
 The collected speeches of Newt Gingrich. That would be NO. I like Josh Groban. I like Tony Bennett. I like Nelly. He's from St. Louis. He's a very good rapper. I like Eminem. 
 I have his album. 
 Some of the lyrics are a little hard to take.
 Oh, I don't listen to the lyrics. I just like the music. I like the beat.
 Is the vice-presidential nomination something you really wanted? 
 What I told John Kerry was: ''If you really want me to do this, if you think I can help you, I will do it. But I'm 63 years old. I'm never going to be president, and so, you 
 know, I'd just as soon do something else.'' 
 What will you do next?
 One thing I'll probably do is set up an institute for public service at Washington University in St. Louis to interest young people in what I got messed up in -- politics, public life, public service.
 Do you buy the idea that the Democrats are on the verge of not being a national party?
 I don't believe that. I do think we have to do two things to be successful. One, we've got to speak to values and people's faith. Secondly, I think we need to do grass-roots politics better than we've ever done. 
 I have this enduring image of you standing up there in a union jacket. Where do you keep all those jackets? Do you have an enormous warehouse somewhere?
 I have the world's largest union jacket collection. I think I probably had more memberships in more unions, honorary memberships, than any living human being. 
 Is the situation for workers today better or worse than when you came to Washington?
 It's probably a little worse, because when I came here, services were not in the world economy, just the manufacturing and industrial-type jobs. Now everything's part of the global economy.
 If you could snap your fingers and amend the Constitution, what would you change?
 The Electoral College. Get rid of it. You basically had an election in seven or eight states, not the whole country. And I don't think that's healthy. You did not have the level of activity in, say, California, Georgia, New York or Alabama that you had in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania. I mean, what's that about? It's their president too.

LENGTH: 1120 words

HEADLINE: An Obsession the World Doesn't Share

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Roger Cohen writes the ''Globalist'' column in The International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
THE United States has a strategic problem: its war on terror, unlike its long fight against Communism, is not universally seen as the pivotal global struggle of the age.
 Rather, it is often portrayed abroad as a distraction from more critical issues -- as an American attempt to impose a bellicose culture, driven by the cultivation of fear, on a world still taken with the notion that the cold war's end and technology's advance have opened unprecedented possibilities for dialogue and peace.
 Here in Brazil, plagued by problems of poverty and development, the policies of the International Monetary Fund arouse more interest than Al Qaeda's. The violence that is debated is not that of Islamic holy warriors but of drug barons and their private militias occupying the favelas, or slums, of Rio and Sao Paulo. 
 In South Africa, the issues of the day are 40 percent unemployment, crime, disease and addressing the problems of a continent that is home to many of the 1.3 billion people in the world who live on less than $1 a day. Terrorism is not the theme of the hour. 
 The cold war was refracted through Latin America and Africa in the form of countless battles between surrogates of Washington and Moscow. But the war on terror has neither divided nor engaged these continents in the same way. That, on balance, is a good thing: the American-Soviet struggle took a huge toll on societies from Argentina to Angola that still bear the scars.
 What is less good, from the American perspective, is that these continents are more or less united in a critical view of an American power routinely described as hegemonic and intent on using the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to impose what Candido Mendes, a Brazilian political analyst, called ''a civilization of fear.''
 Mr. Mendes, who has written several books about Brazil's left-leaning president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said: ''The exploitation of fear is a highly developed and refined science, but Brazil is not convinced by this culture that triumphed in the American election. What concerns us in Latin America is that, in the name of defending its security, the United States will escalate the wars it has begun.''
 The cold war world adhered to a simple paradigm: free societies, led by the United States, confronting Communism, with its headquarters in the Kremlin. But for all of President Bush's attempts to frame the current conflict against Islamic terrorism as one of equally epochal and all-enveloping proportions, it is now clear that the world has resisted such a single, overarching framework.
 In wide swaths of the southern hemisphere, including Africa and Latin America, the central preoccupation is economic development and trade. In Asia, the main focus is on China rising, with India not far behind. In Europe, the bulk of political energy is still absorbed by the vast experiment in transnational governance and the banishment of war that is the European Union.
 Because America's central preoccupation -- the war on terror -- is not widely shared, it tends to isolate the United States, a country whose power is now so overwhelming as to invite dissent and countervailing currents. Mr. Bush seems aware of his problems. On a visit to Canada last week, he described his second term as ''an important opportunity to reach out to our friends,'' and expressed gratitude to those Canadians who waved at him ''with all five fingers.'' 
 Many Americans might be tempted to use four fewer fingers in response to the world's hostility. They might be tempted to retort to a restive global community: Your memories are short, and if a bunch of crazed Islamic jihadists get their hands on loose nukes, you'll understand why we are fighting this war. They might care to use a quotation often attributed to George Orwell: ''People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.''
 But for now, the image of rough Americans ready to do violence is more alienating than comforting to Latin Americans and Africans.
 ''Anti-Americanism is generalized and growing,'' said Luiz Felipe Lampreia, a former Brazilian foreign minister. ''The whole Iraq situation has brought back memories of the big stick -- American power as used in Nicaragua or Chile during the cold war. The problem is the perception that Bush uses immense power in an egotistical way.''
 The animosity engendered was evident during President Bush's recent visit to Santiago, Chile, where he confronted angry crowds who were not waving. This situation has its paradoxes: the Bush administration's policies toward Latin America have been generally pragmatic and restrained.
 Trade differences with Brazil, once acute over steel, have been quietly patched up, although Brazil's push to fight subsidies to farmers in rich countries continues. Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bush get along well, two straight-talking guys who like to brush past details, not least the fact that they come from opposing political camps. In theory, this could be a time marked more by harmony than hostility.
 A similar situation prevails in South Africa. The United States is pouring more money into tackling the AIDS epidemic than any other country. Mr. Bush has made this fight a priority of his administration.
 The personal relations between Mr. Bush and Thabo Mbeki, the South African president, are good. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, strongly supported by Mr. Bush, has provided important new trade openings by removing tariffs in several sectors, including automobiles.
 Yet the president is routinely dismissed in the South African press as the Texas Twit and gets no credit for any of the policies that are helping the country or Africa as a whole. Dr. Jendayi E. Frazer, the American ambassador to South Africa, said that government-to-government relations were excellent, but that the prevailing atmosphere meant that ''people who support the United States cannot come out and say it.''
 Here lies part of the price of the war on terror, and particularly the war in Iraq, for the United States and Mr. Bush: the good done quietly on other fronts gains scant recognition because war against a constant terrorist threat is seen to be the overriding message from the administration.
 If Condoleezza Rice, nominated by Mr. Bush to be the next secretary of state, is to change this negative impression, she may have to concede that the war on terror is not, like the cold war, a label for an era. It describes the focus of America, a new principle and project guiding national policy, but it describes no more than that, because other countries have other agendas. What these countries want, above all, is to sense that the Bush administration, in its second term, hears them.

HEADLINE: Fly Me To The Moon

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Of all the irresponsible aspects of the 2005 budget bill that the Republican-led Congress just passed, nothing could be more irresponsible than the fact that funding for the National Science Foundation was cut by nearly 2 percent, or $105 million.
 Think about this. We are facing a mounting crisis in science and engineering education. The generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who were spurred to get advanced degrees by the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik and the challenge by President John Kennedy to put a man on the moon is slowly retiring. 
 But because of the steady erosion of science, math and engineering education in U.S. high schools, our cold war generation of American scientists is not being fully replenished. We traditionally filled the gap with Indian, Chinese and other immigrant brainpower. But post-9/11, many of these foreign engineers are not coming here anymore, and, because the world is now flat and wired, many others can stay home and innovate without having to emigrate.
 If we don't do something soon and dramatic to reverse this ''erosion,'' Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, told me, we are not going to have the scientific foundation to sustain our high standard of living in 15 or 20 years. 
 Instead of doubling the N.S.F. budget -- to support more science education and research at every level -- this Congress decided to cut it! Could anything be more idiotic?
 If President Bush is looking for a legacy, I have just the one for him -- a national science project that would be our generation's moon shot: a crash science initiative for alternative energy and conservation to make America energy-independent in 10 years. Imagine if every American kid, in every school, were galvanized around such a vision. Ah, you say, nice idea, Friedman, but what does it have to do with your subject -- foreign policy?
 Everything! You give me an America that is energy-independent and I will give you sharply reduced oil revenues for the worst governments in the world. I will give you political reform from Moscow to Riyadh to Tehran. Yes, deprive these regimes of the huge oil windfalls on which they depend and you will force them to reform by having to tap their people instead of oil wells. These regimes won't change when we tell them they should. They will change only when they tell themselves they must.
 When did the Soviet Union collapse? When did reform take off in Iran? When did the Oslo peace process begin? When did economic reform become a hot topic in the Arab world? In the late 1980's and early 1990's. And what was also happening then? Oil prices were collapsing.
 In November 1985, oil was $30 a barrel, recalled the noted oil economist Philip Verleger. By July of 1986, oil had fallen to $10 a barrel, and it did not climb back to $20 until April 1989. ''Everyone thinks Ronald Reagan brought down the Soviets,'' said Mr. Verleger. ''That is wrong. It was the collapse of their oil rents.'' It's no accident that the 1990's was the decade of falling oil prices and falling walls.
 If President Bush made energy independence his moon shot, he would dry up revenue for terrorism; force Iran, Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to take the path of reform -- which they will never do with $45-a-barrel oil -- strengthen the dollar; and improve his own standing in Europe, by doing something huge to reduce global warming. He would also create a magnet to inspire young people to contribute to the war on terrorism and America's future by becoming scientists, engineers and mathematicians. ''This is not just a win-win,'' said the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum. ''This is a win-win-win-win-win.''
 Or, Mr. Bush can ignore this challenge and spend the next four years in an utterly futile effort to persuade Russia to be restrained, Saudi Arabia to be moderate, Iran to be cautious and Europe to be nice. 
 Sure, it would require some sacrifice. But remember J.F.K.'s words when he summoned us to go to the moon on Sept. 12, 1962: ''We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.'' 
 Summoning all our energies and skills to produce a 21st-century fuel is George W. Bush's opportunity to be both Nixon to China and J.F.K. to the moon -- in one move.

HEADLINE: For Its 2012 Bid, New York Enlists a Southerner

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

DATELINE: DUBROVNIK, Croatia, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The secret weapon in the New York bid for the Summer Olympics is a good old boy from Atlanta named Charles H. Battle Jr., who has been through Olympic wars before and kept the essential tools of his trade: friendships and a sense of humor.
 Battle is widely described as one of the most liked and trusted of dozens of people working hotel lobbies here to persuade European sports leaders to give the 2012 Games to the United States rather than to a European capital. 
 This is America's team: Battle softens up a table with charm. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the earnest deputy mayor, NYC2012 founder and former investment banker, moves in for the direct sell. The two-time Olympic gold medalist Donna de Varona represents the athletes. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg commands attention by his mere presence for a second day of the European Olympic Committees meeting. Bloomberg is posing for countless pictures and showing the approachability of a billionaire who rides the subway to work -- someone, he hopes, the International Olympic Committee would like to work with.
 Never have five such powerful cities competed for the same Olympics. Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow are the other finalists. Jacques Rogge, president of the I.O.C., said, ''Any of the five cities is perfectly capable of staging a very prestigious Games.''
 And never has there been such a strong ethics commission and strict prohibition of gifts, trips and favors, which veered to bribery in the recent past, tainting the all-powerful I.O.C., whose members will decide the winner in secret balloting on July 6, 2005.
 I.O.C. members and other sports officials here say the absence of financial influence-peddling and the technical strength of all five cities' bids means that other factors will be the key to winning the vote, namely, trust, confidence and friendships.
 And that is where Battle comes in. He is the best-known face in the New York group to I.O.C. members, and certainly the most congenial.
 ''Well, I've been around a long time, comfortable, like an old shoe,'' he said.
 Battle, 62, is the managing director of international relations for NYC2012. He worked 21 years as a lawyer before joining his friend Billy Payne in the seemingly far-fetched Atlanta bid for 1996 and said that they were lucky the other finalists had problems. He served I.O.C. members and ''the Olympic family'' at the Atlanta Games, then headed a downtown redevelopment program and joined the Olympic commission that evaluated the bids for the 2004 Games. Battle also consulted for the Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Beijing Olympic bids.
 ''I think it's safe to say that this experience has meant a lot to me and I've made a lot of friends and relationships that I've been able to maintain to some degree,'' Battle said. ''So when New York was selected, I thought this would be a tremendous opportunity to get involved again and see these friends again, and introduce Dan to people.''
 Doctoroff, who met Battle in 1996, hired him last year. ''When Charlie speaks, he's got 15 years of credibility in this movement behind him,'' Doctoroff said Saturday. ''He's somebody who's delivered on promises, and having that asset as part of our effort, when a lot of this is about people having confidence that you will ultimately deliver on promises, is very valuable.
 ''And for me personally not only has he been a guide and a mentor and a very close friend, he also gives me credibility with people that I, before this process, didn't know.''
 Andrew Craig, the London bid's senior vice president for international relations, said Battle has the right touch with I.O.C. members. ''He's very well-known and liked,'' Craig said. ''He's very sociable and works this crowd well. Charlie Battle is a core asset.''
 Craig said friendships are especially important to winning support in the crucial later rounds of the selection process in which I.O.C. members who voted for the city that finished last on one ballot, and any I.O.C. members from that city's nation, make their decisions for more personal reasons.
 That is where Battle won the Atlanta bid. Forty percent of Atlanta's final votes were cast for other cities in earlier rounds. At the same time, Battle's identification with the Atlanta Olympics carries some risk because some I.O.C. members and athletes didn't like the 1996 experience.
 In some ways, New York is competing not only with the great cities of Europe, but also with the legacy of the United States' two most recent Olympics. The Atlanta experience, for many I.O.C. members and athletes, was marred by poor transportation and rampant commercialism, including gaudy advertising and gantlets of street vendors.
 ''Atlanta had problems,'' Alex Gilady, an I.O.C. member from Israel, said. ''But Charlie was not part of the problem. Charlie was the only guy in Atlanta who could get things done.''
 New York has taken great care to prevent ''ambush advertising.'' Adidas paid $40 million to be an official sponsor of the Atlanta Olympics, but Nike handed spectators so many flags that a survey showed most people thought Nike was the official sponsor. Paying sponsors do not like that. New York organizers said they had locked up contracts for more than 95 percent of the billboards and all other advertising signs in the city, more than 600,000 in all.
 The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City left a legacy of bribery and disgrace among many I.O.C. members and a severe loss of credibility.
 New York is far from Utah, but I.O.C. observers here say it may remind them of corruption. So far that is a factor in no other Olympic bid city but perhaps rough-and-tumble Moscow or London, where the BBC set up a phony consulting company in a sting operation. The BBC taped Olympic brokers and the I.O.C. member Ivan Slavkov of Bulgaria saying they could deliver I.O.C. votes to London for money.
 Bloomberg rejected the notion that New York could suffer from the Salt Lake experience. ''This administration has a reputation, if I can say with all due modesty, of being scrupulously honest,'' he said from a patio overlooking the Adriatic Sea.
 Rogge emphasized integrity in his talks here, much as his predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, left an Olympic legacy of financial stability.
 The Olympic Ethics Commission is also taking a powerful new role in the run-up to the decision. Paquerette Girard Zappelli, special representative for the commission, has delivered many warnings and lectures the past two days, including a meeting with all bid cities Saturday morning. She tells bid city staffs, ''I'm watching you.''
 Doctoroff said the New York bid had turned other negatives into positives, including an improved, though still difficult, visa process for Olympians, the appointment of Peter V. Ueberroth to stabilize the United States Olympic Committee and the redesign of the proposed Olympic Village. ''People grade on improvement,'' Doctoroff said.
 Bloomberg added, ''People are demanding accountability and results.'' 
 That is one reason the New York bid committee tries to save money where it can, including economy-class airplane tickets for Battle and other NYC2012 staff members, except Doctoroff, who pays his way in business class, and Bloomberg and his staff, who fly in his private jet.
 Battle is too smooth to complain about cramped seating in coach on overseas flights, even though he is, after all, the international relations manager. When asked about it, he knew right away that some old friends here had raised the issue.
 ''Well, NYC2012 is trying to be frugal, so that's what you do,'' Battle said, then laughed and added, ''But I'm glad they said that.''

HEADLINE: Changes May Be Needed In Superfund, Chief Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The head of the nation's Superfund program says that fundamental changes in the program may be necessary to continue cleanups as more contaminated sites demand attention and federal resources remain flat.
 Thomas P. Dunne, an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who oversees the Superfund, said pressures on the program's annual cleanup budget of $450 million and the growing list of sites to be restored were strangling the program's ability to operate effectively. A new report by the agency predicted that as many as 355,000 hazardous waste sites could require cleanup over the next three decades, at a cost of up to $250 billion. 
 As a result, Mr. Dunne said the time had come for ''a frank, open and nonpartisan discussion'' to balance public expectations for action and budgetary realities that make timely responses increasingly less likely. 
 ''We will continue to operate within the constraints of what we've got,'' Mr. Dunne said Friday in an interview. ''We intend to be open and transparent. But these are some things people can chew on, and we'll see what happens.''
 The agency's budget for Superfund cleanups has not changed in the last few years. Since 1995, when Congress did not renew a special tax on polluters, the cleanup money has come entirely from taxpayers. 
 President Bush sought no increase in the fund three years ago, and Congress has rebuffed his requests to increase the budget by $150 million in each of the last two years. Recent program reviews by the environmental agency's inspector general have cited the need for hundreds of millions of dollars more to meet a growing backlog of sites.
 In that context, Mr. Dunne, in a speech on Thursday, proposed three ways to ease the pressure on the budget and, perhaps, to lower expectations of community groups eager to eliminate contaminated sites in their neighborhoods.
 One, Mr. Dunne said, is to seek private businesses that may have an economic interest in a restored site to help defray cleanup costs.
 Another would be to create a management system for the program in which large sites that ate up more than half the Superfund budget were separated from smaller sites. The change, he said, would give communities a more realistic picture of how much help they could expect and when.
 A third idea he proposed was halting the listing of more contaminated sites until current work is completed.
 ''I'm not necessarily advocating for these ideas,'' Mr. Dunne said in an interview. ''I want to get them on the table for discussion and debate.''
 It is unclear, however, whether Congress may be immediately willing to contemplate reorganizing the Superfund program.
 Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, ''looks forward to looking at these proposals in the future,'' said his spokesman, Will Hart, who added: ''They're interesting ideas, especially the first one. Senator Inhofe has definitely said he would welcome market-based approaches to solving problems.'' 
 But critics of the program say the real problem facing the Superfund program is an apparent lack of political will among Republicans in the White House and Congress to push for increasing its budget.
 ''These ideas are not a solution, but a diversion from the real problem, which is the failure of the administration and the Republican-controlled Congress to properly fund Superfund site cleanups,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the Superfund.
 Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont independent who is the ranking member of Mr. Inhofe's committee, also dismissed Mr. Dunne's ideas, saying, ''We should be working to protect our environment and public health by cleaning up more sites, faster, rather than shirking our responsibilities.''
 Mr. Dunne said that he was not wedded to any of his proposed changes. Nor, he said, is he asking for a bigger Superfund budget.He emphasized, however, that the program could accomplish only so much without a budget increase. He conceded this was unlikely, even as the number of sites needing cleanup is increasing by an average of 28 daily. 
 On any day, over 500 cleanup projects are under way and hundreds await work, but reflecting frustrations faced by communities on the waiting list, 9 of the biggest projects, known as megasites, account for 52 percent of the budget. 
 In the speech on Thursday at a Superfund seminar in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Dunne said: ''Because of these painful realities, we need to undertake a broader, more strategic discussion of our future options. We need fresh thinking about how we manage the program.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a warning by Thomas P. Dunne, the head of the nation's Superfund program, that changes in the project may be needed because more contaminated sites need attention referred incorrectly to the rate of increase of those areas to be cleaned. It is an average of 28 a year, not 28 each day.

HEADLINE: Courting Disaster

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen. 
Jeffrey Rosen, the legal affairs editor of The New Republic, writes frequently for the magazine.

 BODY:
The next Supreme Court nomination could provoke a partisan eruption unlike anything America has seen since the battle over Robert Bork in 1987. The Supreme Court today occupies a central role in the American psyche because we expect it to have the last word on the most contested questions of our national politics. In the 50 years since Brown v. Board of Education, Americans have imagined that the justices could protect vulnerable minorities from the excesses of democratic politics. From affirmative action to school prayer and presidential elections, the court has enthusiastically accepted the invitation to answer the divisive political questions that politicians are unable to resolve. 
 Americans are not alone in imagining that courts can and should have the last word in the most intractable political disputes. Since World War II, more than 80 countries have transferred a startling amount of power from elected legislatures to unelected courts. As Ran Hirschl points out in his recent book ''Towards Juristocracy,'' citizens and political leaders around the globe are turning fervently to judges to resolve political stalemates. The high courts of South Africa, New Zealand, Canada and Israel, for example, have been asked to decide matters that go to the heart of their countries' national identities -- from the question of who is a Jew in Israel to the effort by Quebec to secede from Canada. As a result of this international craze, the belief that judges can be engines of social change has achieved ''near-sacred status,'' Hirschl writes. 
 But this near-sacred belief turns out to be a myth. Far from protecting vulnerable minorities or promoting social and economic justice, the newly empowered high courts around the world tend to side with political elites in their efforts to entrench the status quo. The rights that constitutional judges are trained to protect -- like free speech, fair procedures and property rights -- prevent the government from meddling in citizens' private lives, but they can't require it to spend money on health care or eliminate poverty. In conflicts between free-market values and the regulatory or welfare state, judges usually favor Adam Smith over big government. And European countries with relatively small social and economic disparities -- like Norway and Sweden -- have not embraced American-style ideas about judicially enforceable rights. 
 In America, too, the widespread belief that our Supreme Court is a powerful engine of social change is naive at best. Throughout history, the Supreme Court has tended to follow national opinion rather than challenge it. For all the invective that it initially generated, Brown v. Board of Education was actually popular with a narrow majority of the country, as were many of the most controversial decisions by the Warren, Burger and Rehnquist courts. 
 Instead of protecting minority rights against tyrannical majorities, the Supreme Court tends to follow national opinion, as reflected in the election returns. Moreover, on the rare occasions that the courts have tried to impose an outcome that is intensely unpopular, it has tended to provoke a strong political response. After the Massachusetts Supreme Court decreed a right to gay marriage and local officials in California responded by marrying gay couples in defiance of state law, 11 states passed constitutional amendments this past Election Day that ban gay marriage. That is hardly consistent with a vision of judicial heroics. 
 If courts tend to support the mainstream of American opinion rather than challenge it, why do Americans persist in indulging the myth of judges as heroic guardians of the nation's better self? Part of the myth results from the legacy of the 1960's: some of my teachers in law school came of age during the heyday of the Warren Court, which shaped their romantic view of judges as protectors of the downtrodden. The myth is also fostered by the Supreme Court itself, which has become increasingly addicted to a rhetoric of judicial supremacy, grandiosely -- and misleadingly -- suggesting that judges have the unique power to save the nation from its most intractable political disputes. Then there is the tantalizing obscurity of the court -- a rarity in a celebrity culture. By wisely resisting the scrutiny of TV cameras, the justices have managed to sustain a mystical aura of authority long after the other branches of government have been overexposed. When William Rehnquist retires after nearly 35 years, he will have been one of the most influential chief justices in history. Yet most Americans will not recognize his name or face. 
 But although the myth of the heroic court may serve a psychic need, surely it has outlived its usefulness. Throughout American history, the people most fervently devoted to judicial supremacy have been political losers -- from the conservative Federalists of the 1790's to the Democrats of the Civil War era to conservative Republicans during the New Deal. Today, the groups most anxious about the Supreme Court battles ahead are once again those whose beliefs have been repudiated by a majority of the country -- from the social conservatives who want a chance to resurrect statewide bans on early-term abortions to the liberal egalitarians who want to resurrect the Great Society welfare state by judicial fiat. Both of these special-interest groups are bound to fail in their efforts to persuade courts to reverse their political defeats because courts rarely impose values that a majority of the country rejects. And on the few occasions when they have tried in the past, they have usually provoked a swift and democratic rebuke. In the wake of another polarizing election, as we contemplate the transformation of the Supreme Court, perhaps it is time to acknowledge that courts can't and won't and shouldn't save us from politics.

HEADLINE: Supporters Rally for National Guard Unit

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH 

 BODY:
FOR years, the 106th Air Rescue Wing, an Air National Guard unit based at Gabreski Airport, has been a source of pride on the East End. The elite unit's rescue of a fishing boat's crew in the Atlantic was one of the most harrowing scenes in ''The Perfect Storm.'' It has been deployed behind enemy lines in Iraq, and its members pulled the last survivor from the World Trade Center. 
 Now, the 106th may need rescuing itself. Last summer, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's office grew concerned that the unit might become a cutback target and began fanning the flames of community support. Residents, civic leaders and other politicians have rallied on its behalf. ''The support around here has been tremendous, especially in the last couple of months,'' said Col. Dennis Diggett, the operations group commander for the 106th. ''They've all of a sudden realized that we might be going away, and they're like, 'Wait a minute.''' 
 Mayor Bob Strebel of Westhampton Beach, just south of Gabreski, said, ''We took them for granted, but the thought of losing them has rallied everyone around here.'' 
 On Wednesday, a contingent of New Yorkers met with Defense Department officials at the Pentagon to make the case for the 106th. The group included Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr. and staff members from the offices of Governor Pataki, Senator Clinton, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Representatives Timothy Bishop and Steve Israel, and Steve Levy, Suffolk's county executive. 
 The 106th, one of the most decorated search-and-rescue units, has about 1,275 employees, most of them Long Island residents. About a quarter of them are pilots, technicians and parajumpers, the rescuers who dangle by ropes from helicopters. Only two other Air National Guard units in the country are equipped and trained to perform a similar mission. 
 Given the 106th's history and specialized training, the odds that the federal government would dismantle the whole operation are extremely remote. And because air-sea rescues are its forte, it makes sense that the unit be stationed near the coast. But periodically, all military bases come under a review known as Base Realignment and Closure -- BRAC, for short.
 The list of bases on the target list will not be announced until next May, but that has not stopped the worries that the 106th might be relocated, perhaps to Newburgh, and the current installation at Gabreski shut down. The BRAC review is supposed to be nonpolitical, but as with many things in Washington, decisions are often swayed by political and lobbying muscle. 
 There are a number of reasons for supporters of the 106th to be worried. Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, has promised to close more than 100 bases around the country. New York fared poorly in the last round of base consolidations in 1995, losing two bases and some small installations, including the Roslyn Air National Guard Station. And New York's heavily Democratic representation in Congress could leave it with less clout against Republican states in the South and the West. 
 New York also has five Air National Guard units, the most of any state, which could make it easier to justify shutting one of them. The four others are in Newburgh, Niagara Falls, Schenectady and Syracuse, whose economies might be more vulnerable to a closure, since Gabreski is just east of the moneyed Hamptons. Senator Clinton, who sits on the Senate's Armed Services Committee, talked about the strong political realities working against the 106th.
 ''We know we have an uphill battle,'' she said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''Long Island is a choice piece of real estate. People don't think there's an economic downside; people think Gabreski would make a transition easily to civilian use. These are arguments being made forcefully on the other side by people who want to close Gabreski to save their own base.''
 Those factors, she said, make it imperative for local residents to make their own arguments. ''Many of the people on Long Island are unaware of the mission and bravery of the 106th,'' she said. ''It's something that needs to be widely understood so that people can advocate for them.''
 A move could be hard on the unit. Many of its members hold full-time jobs on Long Island as firefighters, police officers or public-school teachers and would find it difficult or impossible to move. 
 Supporters argue that the loss of jobs, 1,275 of them, would be acute if the unit left Gabreski. The Air National Guard says that the Gabreski unit's economic impact exceeds $100 million a year.
 In addition to its military mission, the 106th has traditionally acted as an airborne auxiliary to local fire departments and responds to nonmilitary emergencies at sea, working with the Coast Guard. It played an instrumental role in fighting the wildfires in the pine barrens in 1995. 
 The prospect of losing the 106th is spurring community action. An informational meeting on Aug. 7 at the Remsenburg School, organized with the help of Senator Clinton's staff, drew a crowd, and the Gabreski Rescue Initiative Partnership has been organized to muster further public support. 
 ''We pulled together that meeting in August, and since then we've had a publicity and letter-writing campaign,'' said Hank Beck, who heads the partnership, known as GRIP. ''Now we're trying to raise money to hire a consultant. We're just doing anything we can to organize ourselves and to raise awareness around Suffolk about the 106th.'' 
 To further the ''don't touch the 106th'' argument, supporters have helped the unit to cut costs. After lobbying from Senator Clinton and other elected officials, the Long Island Power Authority slashed the rates it charges the base, and Suffolk County reduced its rent at Gabreski from $36,000 a year to a token $1. And Mr. Levy, Suffolk's county executive, has offered to donate 73 acres to the base, which would bring its total to 163 acres.
 ''We know it would be a great loss to the community if they go,'' said Mayor Strebel of Westhampton Beach. ''Whether we can be persuasive enough is another thing.''

HEADLINE: If I Had Hillary Clinton's Ear...

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
THERE was the old Hillary Rodham Clinton, the one who said she wasn't ''some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,'' who led a failed and ridiculed effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, who so inflamed a nation's passions that her book ''It Takes a Village'' became a punch line at political rallies and on late night television.
 And there is the new Hillary Rodham Clinton, the reserved junior senator from New York who was elected after making a ''listening tour'' of the state, a member of the Armed Services Committee who supported the invasion of Iraq, and a lawmaker who has won praise from Republican colleagues.
 But now, Mrs. Clinton's persona is again evolving, propelled as much by the intense feelings she has engendered in her career as first lady as by her own drive and ambition. 
 There are a lot of people, Democratic people to be sure, who want Mrs. Clinton to run for president in 2008. In a Gallup poll taken in November after the election, 25 percent of respondents chose her as their preferred Democratic candidate; John Kerry came in second at 15 percent.
 It is a counterintuitive notion, that a party badly beaten by what many interpreted as a rejection of liberal political values, would endorse a woman who has come to embody those very liberal ideals. 
 But some Democratic political operatives say it could work. The theory, said David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant based in Chicago, is that while a polarizing figure like Mrs. Clinton may motivate the opposition, she could also expand the Democrats' base. ''If you accept the premise that we are a polarized country then part of the challenge is to maximize your base,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''I think she, as much as anybody, is in a position to do that.''
 Could she really cast aside the baggage from years in the spotlight to become not merely the first senator since John F. Kennedy -- or the first Northeasterner of any party since Mr. Kennedy -- to be elected to the White House, but America's first woman president? 
 For many Democrats, certainly, she is the only personality, the only larger-than-life figure in the party with the drive, the ambition and the name recognition that might be able to lead the party out of the wilderness of political defeat.
 Here is a summary of the thoughts of three political professionals, including a skeptical Republican, who were asked what advice they would give to the senator.

David Axelrod
 Mr. Axelrod was an adviser in the presidential campaign of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.

PRIORITY -- Get re-elected. Create a vision for the future. She must help the party redefine itself by focusing on issues, like globalization, as they relate to the middle class.
 She should dive into health care as an offensive and defensive maneuver. This issue will be used against her. She can't run away from it. We're hurtling toward a crisis and she can say, ''I may not have approached this in precisely the right way, but I had no doubt then or now that health care is a crisis we have to face.''

ABORTION -- Exit polls show Americans are moderately pro-choice. She should promote adoption and, yes, abstinence as part of an array of options through which the government reduces the number of abortions.

GAY MARRIAGE -- Sixty percent of the voters said that they supported civil unions or gay marriage. It's not the killer issue some have painted it as.

TERRORISM -- If you're trying to be the first female president, a premium will be attached to proving yourself as thoughtful as anyone on this issue. She's got a wonderful platform on the Armed Services Committee.

CHANCES -- There is a caricature of her out there, and she needs to introduce America to the real Hillary Clinton. But she'd be the person to beat if she ran. Once you have the nomination anything can happen.

SUGGESTED THEME -- ''Keeping America and the middle class strong in a changing world.''

Joe Trippi
 Mr. Trippi advised Howard Dean, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination this year.

PRIORITY -- Define yourself as not New York and as not a senator.
 If she's the nominee, it has to mean something to be the first woman. She should be the first viable reform candidate of either party -- the first to reform the system, the way money, lobbyists and government work -- to give people more power. She is uniquely positioned to do that. She has such a large following, she could promise not to accept any donation over $500 and still raise enough money to be competitive. 
 She could counter the Republican talk of religious values by focusing on civic values and personal responsibility. When was the last time anyone running for president talked about the common good, civic virtues and the duties and responsibilities of citizens, not just their rights? That is our moral language.

CHANCES -- It would be pretty hard to stop her from getting the nomination. And if she gets the nomination and the country is still polarized, she's in the hunt, because the election will be decided by three to five points.

SUGGESTED READING -- ''Restoration of the Republic,'' by Gary Hart. The book talks a lot about why Americans feel so distant from their government. It is a very republican idea, and I mean that with a small R, to devolve power back to people and away from Washington. The Republicans do it by dismantling government. She needs to do it by taking the power back from lobbyists.

Kieran Mahoney
 Mr. Mahoney, a Republican-Conservative political consultant and pollster from New York, is a longtime adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki.

PRIORITY -- She needs to confound the expectations that she is, in fact, completely liberal. This will be difficult because she no longer operates on such a large stage. Even as a senator and well-known former first lady, she will find it much harder to make the same kind of coast-to-coast impression she did while in the White House.
 The media and the religious right both overemphasize the importance of social issues. But if you look at the ad dollars spent against Kerry, 90 percent went to economic matters and foreign affairs. Those issues matter much more.
 She would need to be supportive of President Bush on an important issue at a crucial time. Or she would have to publicly break with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party in such a way as to draw national media attention. It could be along economic lines -- like tax reform or Social Security privatization. There is much greater tolerance than the Democratic Party realizes to break with the populist economics of F.D.R.

CHANCES -- She covets the nomination and she is probably as big a frontrunner as anybody since Mondale in 1984. But any Republican with a modicum of appeal to the center of the electorate would beat her fairly handily.

SUGGESTED SLOGAN -- ''Make History.''

HEADLINE: The U.N. Oil Scandal

 BODY:
The assault on the United Nations is escalating. A Senate subcommittee has raised the estimate of how many illegal billions Saddam Hussein was able to amass under the noses of monitors hired by the United Nations. Several other Congressional committees are exploring the scandal. Norm Coleman, the subcommittee's Republican chairman, has joined a gaggle of conservatives calling for the resignation of Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
 Mr. Annan, who drew the wrath of Republican Washington for opposing President Bush's war in Iraq, will have to face the judgment of United Nations members on how much responsibility he bears. But before the call for his scalp gains more political momentum, it is important to disentangle the melange of charges swirling around. The United Nations bureaucracy does not bear the primary responsibility for letting Saddam Hussein amass a secret treasury estimated by official investigators at $10 billion to $21 billion. 
 There is no doubt that the United Nations oil-for-food program was manipulated by Saddam Hussein to generate substantial sums. The money was then used to buy forbidden goods or otherwise solidify Mr. Hussein's power. The most worrisome charge is that Benon Sevan, head of the program, received oil allotments from Iraq that amounted to a bribe. These charges need to be fully investigated, as they will be by the United Nations' own panel and other inquiries. 
 But the ever-shriller attacks on oil-for-food and on Mr. Annan play down this fact: Iraq accumulated far more illicit money through trade agreements that the United States and other Security Council members knew about for years but chose to accept.
 After the first Persian Gulf war, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq that prohibited imports of military value and banned oil exports to deny Mr. Hussein money to rebuild his army. When it became apparent that Iraq's civilian population was suffering greatly, the sanctions were eased. The so-called oil-for-food program allowed Iraq to export oil under United Nations supervision, with the revenues funneling into a United Nations account to be used for food, medicine and other necessities.
 By virtually all expert accounts, the sanctions, backed by United Nations weapons inspectors, and the oil-for-food program achieved their major goals. Iraq's programs to make chemical, biological and nuclear weapons disintegrated, its conventional military forces became a hollow shell, and the health of the civilian population improved. But right from the start, Iraq found ways to circumvent the sanctions, often with the tacit approval of the United States. 
 An analysis by Charles Duelfer, the chief American weapons inspector in Iraq, estimated that Iraq generated some $11 billion in illicit revenue and used the money to buy prohibited items, including military equipment. The main routes for these illicit transactions -- $8 billion worth -- were trade deals that Iraq negotiated with neighboring countries, notably Jordan, Syria and Turkey. By the Senate subcommittee's higher count, Iraq got almost two-thirds of some $21 billion through the trade deals or smuggling. 
 But these trade agreements had nothing to do with the oil-for-food program, and were hardly a secret. The United States actually condoned Iraq's trade deals with Jordan and Turkey, two allies whose economies suffered from the sanctions. This was a reasonable price to pay for maintaining their support on the main objective -- denying weapons of mass destruction to Saddam Hussein. 
 American diplomats tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Syria to stop buying Iraqi oil outside of the oil-for-food program, but did little to crack down on that trade. Syria became a major supplier of military goods to Iraq. This was a failure of American diplomacy, not Kofi Annan.
 The United Nations bureaucracy had no power to prevent these illicit oil or arms deals outside the oil-for-food program. It was the responsibility of member nations to adhere to sanctions imposed by the Security Council. Those members with the most diplomatic, economic and military power were obliged to help enforce them. Thus the primary blame for allowing Iraq to accumulate illicit billions lies with the United States and other Security Council members that winked at prohibited oil sales, mostly for sensible reasons.
 The investigations now under way need to determine to what extent United Nations officials could have detected and stopped Iraq's financial shenanigans in the program they did monitor, oil-for-food. Suspicions were sometimes voiced at meetings of the relevant Security Council committees, but they took a back seat to the main goal of preventing Iraq from getting weapons of mass destruction. 
 Kofi Annan's role will also have to be laid out fully. He has, unfortunately, issued inconsistent statements about the role of his son, Kojo Annan, in working abroad for a Swiss company that won a contract to monitor imports under the oil-for-food program. The whiff of nepotism has set the hounds baying, and may bring grief to Mr. Annan, but what all that has to do with Saddam Hussein's illicit billions remains murky. It seems wildly premature to call for Mr. Annan's resignation.

HEADLINE: For Biotech, the Action Is in Washington as Much as in the Lab

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
THE biotechnology industry will be different in at least one way in 2005: it will be without its longtime voice in Washington. 
 Carl B. Feldbaum, who has been president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization since it was formed in 1993, is retiring. He will be replaced on Jan. 4 by James C. Greenwood, now a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. 
 The transition comes at a crucial time for the industry. The Food and Drug Administration is under intense pressure from critics who accuse it of having been too lax about drug safety. Politicians are howling about high drug prices. And controversies continue over subjects like stem cell research. 
 Mr. Feldbaum, 60, went to Washington 31 years ago as an assistant to Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor. Later he served in the Departments of Defense and Energy and as chief of staff for Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania. That gives him some experience in reading the political tea leaves. 
 Mr. Feldbaum said the biggest challenge for the industry in 2005 was likely to be a newfound caution by the F.D.A. in approving drugs. The hesitation is in response to charges that the agency has been too cozy with industry when handling safety issues related to the Vioxx pain reliever and the use of antidepressants by children. 
 ''The natural tendency of a bureaucracy would be to slow down when it's under this kind of scrutiny,'' he said. ''Having the F.D.A. as a potential choke point is certainly a problem.'' 
 Others echo his concern. ''I think we're going to see a slowdown,'' said G. Steven Burrill, president of Burrill & Company, a biotechnology investment firm. ''I think we're going to have much more data demanded.'' 
 The F.D.A. is even more wary now, in the absence of a permanent leader, Mr. Feldbaum said. It is being run by an acting commissioner, Dr. Lester M. Crawford.
 The biotechnology industry rejoiced in November 2002 when Mark B. McClellan was appointed commissioner. Under Dr. McClellan, a physician and economist, the agency seemed to become more receptive to new drugs. But Dr. McClellan left the F.D.A. this year to run Medicare and Medicaid. 
 The silver lining, some say, would be if Dr. McClellan is named secretary of health and human services, in charge of both Medicare and the F.D.A., now that the current secretary, Tommy G. Thompson, has announced his resignation. Dr. McClellan is widely considered to be the front-runner for the job. ''He's viewed as a positive change agent,'' said Scott Morrison, head of the United States life sciences practice at Ernst & Young.
 Pricing is another big issue for biotechnology companies, which make drugs that can cost $10,000 a year or more. Some cancer specialists this year, for instance, began publicly complaining about the rising price of treating colorectal cancer after the approval of new drugs developed by ImClone Systems and Genentech. Starting in January, Medicare is changing the way it pays for cancer drugs administered by oncologists, a change that could slow sales for companies like Amgen. 
 Patients, insurers and politicians are trying to win permission to import drugs from countries where prices are controlled. And Medicare will increasingly have to choose among competing therapies because it will not be able to pay for all of them, Mr. Feldbaum said.
 Mr. Feldbaum said that the re-election of President Bush, whose views were seen as more favorable to the industry than those of John Kerry, would not do much to relieve the pressure for lower prices. But he said that he did not view the importing of drugs as inevitable, saying that many politicians do not consider it an ideal solution, though they feel obligated to try something. 
 The industry needs to demonstrate that drugs provide a benefit to the health care system despite their prices, he said, rather than argue, as it usually does, that high prices are needed to pay for research. 
 ''The industry has to do broader economic analysis,'' he said. ''Not just that the money is applied back into research, but a much broader and deeper analysis of the economic benefits of the drugs. So far it's been a narrower business argument that I don't think in the long term will prevail.''
 Still, Mr. Feldbaum said he saw a bright future for the industry, with many more products reaching the market in the next few years. He said pharmaceutical companies, faced with relatively dry product pipelines, are buying the rights to drugs developed by biotechnology companies even before the drugs have been proven to work, whereas they were once more likely to wait. 
 A big gain for the industry could come from the approval by California voters in November of a measure to spend $3 billion over 10 years on research into embryonic stem cells. That could lead other states to spend more on stem cells and biotechnology, Mr. Feldbaum said. ''Nationally there will be a sense of keeping up with the Joneses, and California is Jones,'' he said. 
 Bush administration policies have restricted research on embryonic stem cells because creating those cells entails the destruction of human embryos. Mr. Feldbaum said he did not foresee the administration's relaxing its policies immediately in response to the California vote. But the spending in California could produce scientific breakthroughs that will eventually force government policy to change. 
 ''I think the Bush administration policy will probably change when there is a discernable progress in embryonic stem cell research,'' he said. 
 Mr. Feldbaum said he would be moving to Ketchum, Idaho. He might write a book about biotechnology or give speeches. ''It's been a great turn in Washington,'' he said. ''I'm glad to get out with my skin on. Not everyone gets to leave this graciously.''

HEADLINE: A Track Transplanted, Racy Curves Intact

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
WHEN Cadillac wanted to convince drivers that its new generation of sport sedans were as agile and athletic as their German competitors, the company summed up the depth of its commitment in four carefully chosen words: ''Tested at the Nurburgring.'' 
 The phrase was compelling advertising copy, to be sure, but it was also intended as a signal to enthusiasts that General Motors' luxury division had addressed all aspects of vehicle dynamics in the new models. 
 A historic racecourse in the Eifel Mountains of western Germany, the Nurburgring challenges a car on many fronts. The track's high-speed curves, slicing through the soaring and plunging terrain, pushed Cadillac's engineers to meet European handling standards in calibrating the suspension. The course also helped in fine-tuning the transmission's shifting and in refining the brakes. 
 G.M.'s vice chairman for product development, Robert A. Lutz, decided to carry the idea further. He ordered parts of the Nurburgring's famed Nordschleife -- the track's tortuous 14-mile north loop -- reproduced at the company's vast proving grounds in Milford, Mich., 40 miles northwest of Detroit, as part of a $270 million upgrade of the testing center. The 4,000-acre Milford complex runs 24 hours a day and has been the scene of a billion miles of test-driving and 15,000 crash tests. 
 Mr. Lutz's belief is that cars developed on rigorous road courses will take on some of that rigor themselves. Suspensions, engines and transmissions don't just go straight from blueprint to production line. They evolve and are refined by extensive testing. 
 Vehicles reflect the turf where they are developed, much as a fine Barolo is shaped by the sun and fog of Italy's Piedmont; the character of a car engineered for the wide, flat roads of Michigan is almost certain to be less engaging for enthusiasts than one whose manners have been polished on the twisting mountain passes of Europe.
 While it is far better known as one of the world's storied racecourses, the Nurburgring has also been an important development track for automakers. Both BMW and Mercedes-Benz test cars there.
 ''It's the one,'' said Chris Goodman, chief test driver for the Mercedes SLR McLaren supercar, who has spent many hours driving the Nurburgring. The roller coaster qualities of the track, he explained, make it the ultimate template for German cars. 
 Tracks are more and more understood as tools of designing the dynamic character of vehicles. Though the overall feel of driving is derived as much from art as from science, the dynamics can be measured, graphed and even programmed. Nowadays, engineers often have laptops on board so they can tweak the computer code that controls engines, transmissions and chassis. 
 Automakers, more aware that tracks shape cars, are building new ones. In China, G.M. is joining forces with a local partner, Shanghai Automotive Industry, to build a track. Nissan is vastly expanding its proving grounds on Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's main islands, and Hyundai is planning a new track in Kern County, Calif., near California City.
 The most unusual test track, perhaps, was the one constructed in the 1920's on the roof of Fiat's Lingotto factory in Turin, Italy, by an architect, Giacomo Matte-Trucco. Cars on the banked track seem about to fly off over the surrounding rooftops.
 G.M.'s American competitors still maintain huge test areas in southeast Michigan, Ford near Romeo and Chrysler near Chelsea. Each of the Big Three has a proving grounds in Arizona -- General Motors near Tempe, Ford close to Yucca and DaimlerChrysler in Wittman. 
 To shield its future models from the lenses of spy photographers, one American automaker tests its S.U.V.'s at a secret camp in the western desert. Journalists are sometimes brought there blindfolded. Known to company insiders as the Rattlesnake Ranch, the place is run by veterans of the Army Green Berets and Navy Seals units. It includes a collection of metal buildings and camouflage nets worthy of a Special Operations forward base.
 Building new test facilities is not easy. Hyundai's 4,300-acre project in California was opposed by environmental groups worried about endangered desert tortoises. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service has granted Hyundai a waiver allowing an ''incidental take'' of up to 54 tortoises.
 The building of the Nurburgring was motivated as much by economics as by sports. In the 1920's, a local official, Dr. Otto Creuz, laid out plans for a raceway to bring in tourists. The mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, added his support and persuaded the Weimar Republic to pay for the track, which soon became the home of the German Grand Prix auto race.
 Over the years, the track became the site of legendary races won by Tazio Nuvolari, Juan Manuel Fangio and Jackie Stewart. But faster cars made it too dangerous. By the mid-1980's, Formula One had left the track, returning only after a modern grand prix course was carved from the South Loop in the 1990's. An 800-year-old castle presides over turns with colorful names: Gallows Head, the Carousel and the Foxhole. 
 Much of the appeal of the Nurburgring today is that not only companies but drivers can test cars there. Individuals can show up, pay a fee and drive the course, at least on those days when it is not closed for testing or racing. There is even a ''taxi'' service offering white-knuckle rides around the circuit -- in BMW M5 sedans with professional drivers at the wheel.

PROVING GROUNDS, MICHIGAN -- South road courseChart/Diagram: ''Now in Michigan, a Course with European Flavor''Automakers develop and test vehicles on their own tracks, or when these courses are not challenging enough for the sportiest models, the testing can be done at actual racetracks. General Motors recently added road course sections to its proving grounds in Milford, Mich., that are modeled after the switchback turns and undulating terrain of the famous Nurburgring track in Germany. G.M.'s track is about 3 miles long, compared with the 14-mile North Loop of the Nurburgring.Map of the ''NURBURGRING GERMANY'' track highlighting the following:North Loop (Nordschleife) -- 14.2 milesGrand Prix circuit -- 2.8 miles

HEADLINE: From a Poor Village to Job Security

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: ZHANGJIAGANG, CHINA 

 BODY:
The world's factory floors are now populated with people like Yun Liu, a 23-year-old woman from the countryside who shares a cramped house with her sister and eight other women who work in a factory. All the women are from her hometown, Siyang, about four hours north of here. 
 ''This is my room,'' Ms. Yun says shyly, as she steps into a room that is about 10 feet by 10 feet and furnished only with a bed, two small tables and a tiny dresser. ''There's not much here, but it's comfortable.'' 
 Four years ago, Ms. Yun came here to work in this bustling factory town about two hours north of Shanghai at one of China's largest textile mills, the Huafang Cotton Weaving Company. Huafang's 30,000 employees are mostly young women who were lured here from small villages in the Chinese countryside. 
 Like most of the women at Huafang, Ms. Yun came here right after high school, intending to work a few years and save money, before returning home to get married.
 She has already stayed longer than most.
 ''I'm going to get married late,'' she says matter of factly. ''I want to work a few more years. Then we'll see what happens.'' Ms. Yun, who earns about $130 a month, works the morning shift in a factory that operates around the clock.
 She works at station No.13, operating a group of machines that spin raw cotton into thinner and thinner threads that eventually end up on a spool that is destined for clothing makers. She swabs the machines with a brush, cleans cotton out of the gears, patches up strands of cotton and pushes wheelbarrows of spun cotton to their next destination in the spinning process.
 Here in Huafang's new, 30,000 square meter plant, the floors hum with the sound of hundreds of whirring machines. Fine pieces of cotton float through the air, landing on the faces, brows and hair of the young women who dominate the floor.
 After work, Ms. Yun walks just a few hundred yards to the house she shares. The women cook outside in the courtyard, in a makeshift kitchen constructed of cardboard and metal. They wash their clothes by hand, in a small pail. Each has a small room. And they share cleaning duties. But no one here seems to mind. Indeed, the women giggle and say they enjoy being here, as if they were away at college. ''I feel comfortable here,'' says Ms. Yun, who pays $18 a month in rent. ''And I know a lot of girls from my hometown, so my parents don't worry about me.'' 
 This attitude is one reason that companies have moved their manufacturing operations to China. Millions of poor men and women like Ms. Yun and her friends have been willing to migrate to factory cities like this one, where starting salaries are little more than $4 a day. 
 No one knows how long the migration will last, but many of China's 1.3 billion people seem willing to live such an existence.
 Many of the 20,000 young women at Huafang, almost all outsiders to Zhangjiagang, live in company dormitories. They can be seen filing in and out of the dorms every eight hours, heading to their jobs, spinning and weaving the world's wear.
 The women's dorms have a 9 p.m. curfew. No men are allowed in after that. There are televisions in the cafeteria. All housing, water and electricity costs are paid for by the company. The workers tend to buy only food and clothing.
 ''I like the environment here,'' Ms. Yun says, of her job. ''The salary is stable, and they always pay us on time.''

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Monday in the special Outlook section of Business Day, showing China's place among the United States' top trading partners, referred incorrectly to efforts by the United States to change the valuation of China's currency. The United States is pressuring China to revalue its currency upward, not to devalue it.

HEADLINE: Innovation and Disruption Still Going Hand in Hand 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
IN his own small way, Mark Whitman is proof that the ''new economy'' did not disappear with the collapse of the technology bubble. 
 When his father bought a small typesetting firm 34 years ago, the trade still had much of its ancient patina, with employees assembling chunks of text and art and manually pasting them together on a backlit table.
 Today, Mr. Whitman's former family firm is part of an emerging business model that is driving a turbulent new period of economic change. Typesetters are known as publishing services companies. They do their cutting and pasting on a computer. Instead of working with photographic plates and negatives, they receive documents over the Internet that can be transmitted directly to digital printers. 
 And in 1999, Mr. Whitman sold the family firm to a rival, Techbooks, which has moved most of the cutting and pasting to its facilities in India. ''We were very successful for 25 to 30 years,'' said Mr. Whitman, who now works as Techbooks' head of marketing. ''But it was difficult for us to compete with an offshore model.''
 The technology-driven dislocation that has transformed Mr. Whitman's business is spreading throughout the economy, many economists say, as more businesses discover how to harness new technological tools and fuel a surge in productivity growth. 
 Cable is taking audiences from the television networks. Telephone giants are losing business to the Internet. Wal-Mart has forced Toys ''R'' Us to consider exiting the toy business. From the goliaths of industry to the smallest of niche firms, American companies seem to be in the grip of unprecedented industrial upheaval. 
 ''We've always had a lot of turbulence in technology, but now turbulence is going beyond technology companies,'' said Adrian Slywotzky, a managing director of Mercer Management consulting. ''In the next few years we will see more of that.''
 Indeed, technology is changing what a book is. New digital techniques to layer meta-information onto texts have created Internet-based interactive books, a potentially revolutionary breakthrough for fields like high school education. 
 And the Internet permits many of these tasks to be done cheaply in faraway places. ''The business model is completely changing,'' said Rakesh Gupta, founder and chairman of Techbooks. The company makes everything from American high school textbooks to specialty journals like Kidney International, with most of the work done in New Delhi.
 With annual revenue of $50 million, Techbooks, based in Fairfax, Va., is now one of the larger companies in its market, having bought up several rivals to gain customers. According to Mr. Gupta, it is growing at about 20 percent a year.
 The actual new economy might not look quite like the utopian arrangement envisaged by the stubbled gurus of the dot-com period-- where everything brilliant was done online by 22-year-olds. But from the global outsourcing of business processes via the Internet to Wal-Mart's sophisticated logistics management systems (which have been crucial in allowing it to drive down prices and achieve its gargantuan scale), information technology is reshaping businesses and markets.
 The corporate landscape is littered with ailing former giants struggling to come to terms with the new realities. For instance, the big four television networks have lost 16 percent to half of their prime-time viewers to cable channels in the past decade. They could soon lose much of their revenue, too, as new gadgets like digital video recorders (TiVo, for one) allow people to strip commercials out of their favorite shows.
 In the last year, the camera-film giant Eastman Kodak -- once one of the five biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange -- has been struggling to retool itself to survive in the new filmless digital world. 
 The gale of innovation and industrial reorganization is a product of two major forces. The computer and its more recent application, the Internet, are seeping into every nook and cranny of the economy, and are being used by companies across the board for an expanding array of purposes. 
 And even as this technological breakthrough has ignited a rush of investment and innovation, deregulation that started some 25 years ago has opened formerly protected sectors like airlines, telephone companies and electric utilities to competition. 
 Together, the effect of these transformations has been a significant lift to productivity, which over the last eight years has grown at an annual rate of over 3 percent, nearly double the pace of the preceding 30 years. Several economists have argued that the productivity burst is a consequence of big investments in information technology since the 1980's, delayed because companies took time to understand and apply the technology they were buying.
 Some economists say the current industrial turmoil is not unique -- that it just seems more intense because it is affecting high-profile brand-name companies. ''It's been happening for 200 years now,'' said Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University. 
 By some measures, the current corporate turmoil looks rather run of the mill. Of the 50 largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964, only 6 were still on the list last year. And the churn has been more or less constant over the last 40 years, with 13 to 14 companies dropping out of the top 50 every five years.
 The last half-century is littered with corporate has-beens. The once- mighty RCA was swallowed by General Electric, and Warner-Lambert by Pfizer. Bethlehem Steel ceased to exist this year.
 Mr. Mokyr pointed to other bouts of technological and industrial transformation of similar relevance over the last century, including the replacement of the rail-based transportation system with roads and the revolution in communications brought about by the telephone, television and satellites.
 ''The technologically induced structural change is probably not worse now than it used to be,'' Mr. Mokyr said. ''It's just happening in different places.''
 Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern, argues that the innovations that will flow from information technology from now on will be entertaining --like the Palm Pilot and the iPod-- but hardly revolutionary. ''The Web could only be invented once,'' he wrote in a paper this year. Information technology's fleeting boost to productivity, he argues, is likely to be over. 
 The footprint left by information technology on the economy is large, however, and it is still growing. Information technology has changed how companies sell everything from books to airline tickets to equities. The increase in computing power is opening up whole new fields of endeavor, like genetic sequencing and biotechnology. Many businesses are just now learning to deploy technology usefully.
 Perhaps most significant for corporate America, the Internet has enabled a new wave of global outsourcing, allowing once nation-bound companies in the service sector -- the biggest part of the American economy-- to dispatch parts of their business to cheap labor markets on the other side of the world. 
 CONCERN is arising over the future pace of innovation. Corporate investment in technology collapsed after 2000, and it is doubtful that it can ever again achieve the frantic pace of the 1990's. 
 Mr. Gordon pointed out, for instance, that much of the investment surge in the 1990's was driven by factors that are unlikely to be repeated, like the deregulation of telecommunications. He said companies' investment in technology has suffered from diminishing returns.
 And paradoxically, the cutthroat environment of ever increasing competition could actually hinder future technological advances.
 Competition has been a spur to innovation, driving companies to find ways to do things better or cheaper, to gain new markets and reap higher profits. But competition can also diminish the incentives to develop new technologies if, as happened with many dot-com initiatives, innovations are easily replicated by rivals. 
 ''Today, with a much more competitive and deregulated environment there are very few companies with the kind of financial cushion to take the 10-to-15-year long-term view,'' said Mr. Slywotzky of Mercer Management. ''Those engines of innovation have shut down.''

HEADLINE: At F.D.A., Strong Drug Ties and Less Monitoring

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; John Schwartz contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
When federal drug officials suspected in 1992 that a popular allergy pill might cause heart problems, they turned to their own scientists. Their trial confirmed the danger, and the drug was pulled from the market.
 Eight years later, similar worries surrounded the arthritis pill Vioxx. But by then, the Food and Drug Administration had shifted gears, slashing its laboratories and network of independent drug safety experts in favor of hiring more people to approve drugs, changes that arose under an unusual agreement that has left the agency increasingly reliant on and bound by drug company money. Discovering Vioxx's dangers would take four more years.
 That delay has led to a firestorm of criticism. Members of Congress, an internal F.D.A. whistleblower and prominent medical journals have said the agency is incapable of uncovering the perils of drugs that have been approved and are in wide distribution. Some have accused it of being cozy with drug makers. 
 Dozens of former and current F.D.A. officials, outside scientists and advocates for patients say the agency's efforts to monitor the ill effects of drugs that are on the market are a shadow of what they should be because the White House and Congress forced a marriage between the agency and industry years ago for the rich dowry that industry offered.
 Under the 1992 agreement, the industry promised to give the agency millions -- in the 2003 fiscal year, $200 million -- but only if the agency spent a specified level of money on new drug approvals. 
 As Congressional support sank since then, the agency has cut everything else but new drug reviews. In the past 11 years, spending on the reviews has increased to more than four-fifths of the budget of the agency's drug center from about half.
 Among the priorities that took the worst hit was ensuring the safety of the drugs that patients are already taking. Drug companies test their products in people before they are approved, but sometimes potentially serious problems arise only when they are being used by millions of people. The F.D.A. has never been able to require drug makers to undertake new safety tests once a drug is approved, so tracking the safety of drugs already on the market is the agency's responsibility.
 But as a result of the agency's shifting its resources, almost everyone, including critics, outside drug safety experts, medical journal editors, some industry executives and even top agency officials, now agrees that its mechanisms for uncovering the dangers of drugs after they have been approved are woefully inadequate, particularly, as was the case of Vioxx, when the potentially damaging side effect is not an unusual ailment.
 The F.D.A.'s present safety monitoring system ''is not good for determining if a drug increases the rate of a side effect already common in the population,'' said Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting deputy commissioner for operations at the agency.
 Indeed, the agency now relies almost entirely on the willingness of drug makers to report problems that crop up after a drug has been approved to ensure the safety of the nation's drug supply. Some critics say this dependency has gradually worn away at the agency's willingness to confront drug makers, making it timid and leaving patients vulnerable.
 ''This is not just about dollars,'' said Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the author of ''Powerful Medicines.'' ''It's a cultural issue in which the agency feels it can't pressure drug makers.'' 
 Now lawmakers are considering proposals for a center for drug safety that would be independent of the agency's new drug reviewers. The departing health and human services secretary, Tommy G. Thompson, said Friday that he favored creating such a center. After initially opposing the idea, agency officials have said they will study any proposals.
 These proposals may not have been needed if not for the details of the 1992 agreement, which began with the best of intentions. AIDS, cancer, heart disease -- all were terrible diseases that drug makers' laboratories were confronting. But their remedies were languishing for years on F.D.A. shelves because the agency did not have the money to hire enough reviewers.
 The drug industry agreed to chip in. Indeed, half of the budget for the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the principal office that oversees drug reviews and safety, will come from drug industry user fees, up from nothing in 1992 and 31 percent in 1998. But these millions come with strings.

More Money for Reviews
 The 1992 agreement provided that the F.D.A. could collect fees from industry only if government financing of new drug reviews, adjusted for inflation, never fell below 1992 levels (later revised to 1997 levels). This stipulation was intended by industry to ensure that its money was used to hire new drug reviewers and not simply substitute for government support of those already on staff. 
 But Congressional financing has lagged the agency's escalating payroll costs. To meet the ''trigger'' and keep fees flowing, agency officials have been forced to shift dollars from other programs into new drug reviews. This shifting has increased the agency's focus on the reviews even beyond what the drug industry had negotiated. 
 In 1992, the agency's drug center spent 53 percent of its budget on new drug reviews. The rest went to survey programs, laboratories and other efforts that in part helped ensure that drugs already on the market were safe. In 2003, 79 percent of the agency's drug center budget went to new drug reviews. Everything else has gotten squeezed.
 ''We get increased user funds and not increased appropriated dollars,'' said Deborah Henderson, director of the office of executive programs in the F.D.A.'s drug center. ''We have stolen from the labs and other parts of the non-user fee program.''
 Since the 1992 agreement, agency officials have eliminated half of the scientists in the drug center's laboratories and starved them of new equipment. They have ended many of the agency's collaborations with academic groups that scrutinize the problems of marketed drugs. To pay for a modest in-house effort to catalog some information on drug side effects, a system called the Adverse Event Reporting System, the agency has raided furniture and travel budgets.
 Dr. Woodcock said she shut down laboratories and many outside grant programs to try and raise the money to keep the agency's side effect reporting system.
 The industry's influence even extends to perks given agency employees. Under the 1992 agreement, which was renewed in 1997 and 2002, new drug reviewers have travel and training budgets that allow them to attend far-flung conferences and courses. Those who work in the agency's office of drug safety get two-thirds less, which keeps most at home. 
 The agreement that accepted such a large proportion of industry financing ''made a bad situation worse,'' Dr. David J. Graham, a reviewer in the agency's office of drug safety who harshly criticized the agency before a Congressional panel last month, said in an interview. ''The agency was already far too focused on approvals and not on safety.'' 
 ''And if this problem isn't fixed,'' Dr. Graham said, ''future Vioxx-like catastrophes are inevitable.''
 Dr. David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the agency and now dean of the University of California San Francisco Medical School, said the financing agreements with industry ''increasingly micromanage the F.D.A.''
 ''They reinforce the focus on new drug review over the agency's field and post-marketing surveillance efforts,'' Dr. Kessler said.
 Sammie Young, a drug safety inspector for the agency from 1963 until 1992, said that by the time he left the agency had become wholly focused on drug approvals -- to the delight of industry. Those at the agency ''decided their main goal in life was to approve drugs,'' Mr. Young said.
 The decline in the agency's commitments to monitor the safety of approved medicines started in the Clinton administration and continues today. Most experts who track drug side effects say the remedy is more money, perhaps provided by a tax on prescriptions. But others complain that the agency spends far too much already, and some agency critics contend that, more than dollars, what it really needs is more courage to confront drug makers about safety problems.
 While its $1.8 billion budget and staff of 10,800 are small by federal government standards, the Food and Drug Administration is among the most important bodies of the federal government. It is the principal overseer for the pharmaceutical, food, medical device and animal feeds industries. Its rules affect nearly 100,000 businesses producing more than $1 trillion worth of goods a year, or about a quarter of the American economy.
 Founded in 1906, the agency was at first charged simply with ensuring that claims made on medicine packages were not demonstrably false. But scandal after scandal in the intervening decades led to legislation expanding its powers.
 In 1984 a law established a generic drug industry that could capture sales from drug makers once patents on medicines expired. The law led brand-name drug makers to push for quicker review times to maximize sales during the patented period. 
 And then came AIDS.
 As the disease swept through gay communities in San Francisco and New York, people desperate for remedies scoured the world. When AZT showed promise in early trials, the F.D.A. allowed the drug to be distributed to patients before its formal approval. 
 In 1988, AIDS protesters besieged the agency's offices, raising a black flag on its flag pole and contending that it was actively delaying treatments. The agency responded by allowing potentially life-saving drugs to be widely distributed while undergoing review. Still, it was not enough. Advocates for cancer patients complained about long review times as well. With Congress feeling tightfisted, almost all agreed that the agency needed more money and that the drug industry was the best source to tap. A result was the 1992 agreement. The industry agreed to underwrite the hiring of new drug reviewers if the agency would agree to tight review timelines. Peter Barton Hutt, a former general counsel for the agency, helped negotiate the agreement on behalf of drug makers. 
 ''Clearly the industry forced F.D.A. to pay attention to the industry's agenda, and that has always been to shorten the drug approval process,'' Mr. Hutt said.
 Some who supported the agreement then regret it now. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's health research group, said it had pushed the agency into the drug industry's arms and led to poorer drug reviews.
 But William B. Schultz, who worked at Public Citizen and then in Congress and was deputy commissioner for policy at the F.D.A. from 1994 to 1998, said the agreement saved the agency. In 1996, Republicans lawmakers led by Newt Gingrich, the house speaker, proposed legislation that would have allowed companies to market their products without agency review, gutting its oversight authority. 
 Proof that the agency had halved its drug review times since the 1992 agreement passed undermined the proposals, Mr. Schultz said. ''Their argument was the drug lag, but it fell apart because by then the lag had been eliminated,'' he said.

A Question of Care
 Almost every argument about the 1992 agreement revolves around review times and whether new drug reviews are as careful as in the past. Many outside the agency say the rapid review timelines adopted as part of the agreement have made the agency's drug reviews sloppy, leading the agency to approve drugs like Vioxx that should never have gotten onto the market. Merck withdrew Vioxx in September after a test showed that it doubled the risk of heart attacks.
 Top agency officials fiercely disagree with this criticism, pointing out that the ratio of drugs withdrawn compared with those approved has held steady for decades. Some dangerous side effects, they say, will never reveal themselves until millions use a medicine.
 Drug industry officials also say this criticism is wrong. New drug reviews are at least as rigorous as they were a decade ago, they say. 
 Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the drug industry's trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the fees paid by industry to the agency ''do not pay for approval. They merely guarantee review of a product application by the F.D.A. in a set period of time.''
 Beyond new drug reviews, what is rarely discussed is the 1992 agreement's effect on post-approval monitoring of drug side effects. Independent scientists had long helped the agency not only flag possible problems, but also through tests confirm them. Some gave patients drugs and measured the effects. Others combed through millions of patient records at giant managed-care companies to spot problems among those given certain medicines.
 Dr. Susan Jick, co-director of the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program, one of the nation's largest and longest-running initiatives to uncover drug side effects, said F.D.A. officials told her that the agency was ending its support after 20 years because her program was using British data. Dr. Brian Strom at the University of Pennsylvania, who worked with the agency on drug side effect issues for decades until recently, was told that there was no money. Others were told the same thing.
 None knew that the reason was that money had to be shifted out of their programs into new drug reviews to satisfy the requirements of the agreement and industry demands.
 Dr. Lou Cantilena, head of the division of clinical pharmacology and medical toxicology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Science in Bethesda, Md., not only helped the agency study drug safety issues for years but also trained its staff. Both programs were ended in the late 1990's. 
 Dr. Cantilena said the agency was now almost wholly reliant on the drug industry for tests of side effects. He said he was more aware than most about the dangers of this situation.
 In December 1989, a woman walked into Bethesda Naval Hospital complaining that she kept passing out. Doctors placed her on a heart monitor, and it showed a frightening heart arrhythmia. Dr. Cantilena and his team of drug experts were called in. The woman was taking Seldane for allergies. An overdose of Seldane was known to cause heart arrhythmias, but the woman insisted that she had taken only a pill a day.
 The doctors were stumped until the woman revealed that she had also been taking an antifungal drug to treat a vaginal yeast infection. The antifungal was known to interfere with the breakdown of other drugs. Blood tests showed high levels of Seldane. Dr. Cantilena concluded that the woman had suffered from a drug-to-drug interaction.
 At the time, Seldane was the fifth-most popular drug in the nation, and the antifungal medicine was common, too. Such a serious interaction between two popular drugs was worrisome. Dr. Cantilena reported the problem to the F.D.A. and Seldane's maker, now known as Sanofi-Aventis. The F.D.A. cannot require drug makers to test already-approved medicines. Instead, it can urge companies to do more testing, can change warning labels or, as a last resort, can take the product off the market.
 So the agency asked Dr. Cantilena to perform the study. He recruited six healthy volunteers, hooked them up to heart monitors and gave them Seldane and the antifungal. Four of the volunteers developed heart arrhythmias so severe that Dr. Cantilena ended the study early.
 Within weeks of reporting his results to the F.D.A., the agency announced that it was placing a severe warning on Seldane's label about the interaction. In 1997, the maker withdrew Seldane from the market because of the problem.
 The agency has almost no ability to perform similar tests now, Dr. Cantilena said.

Tracking Safety
 Perhaps even more pressing, the agency has no continuing ability to uncover the kind of life-threatening drug side effects that sidelined Vioxx. 
 Presently, the main drug program to catalog the dangers of drugs is a computer listing of side-effects. It is a passive system, meaning that doctors report side effects only when they think of it and have the time. The system receives almost 400,000 reports a year, but these represent a small fraction of the total, all agree. Most reports are delivered by drug makers, who hear about side effects from physicians.
 The side effects tracking system can signal problems only when a drug causes an effect like liver failure that is normally very rare. If a drug increases the number of heart attacks, a problem that is very common normally, the system is useless, Dr. Woodcock of the F.D.A. said. 
 Realizing this weakness, Dr. Graham of the agency's office of drug safety collaborated with Kaiser Permanente, a huge health maintenance organization, to check its computer records to see if those taking Vioxx had had more heart attacks. The study took nearly four years to complete. Its results became known in August and demonstrated Vioxx's dangers.
 Dr. David Campen, medical director of Kaiser's pharmacy operations, said the study would have taken half the time if the agency had had the money to pay for drug monitoring programs with Kaiser or other large managed care organizations. Dr. Graham has estimated that the delay in uncovering Vioxx's dangers cost 55,000 Americans their lives, a number top officials at the F.D.A. have labeled as ''junk science.'' 
 An adequate system for monitoring side effects may have prevented some of the deaths.
 Dr. Strom of the University of Pennsylvania said the F.D.A.'s almost complete focus on approving new drugs at the expense of ensuring the safety of medicines that patients are already taking is wrong.
 ''They're getting all these drugs on the market a whole lot sooner and not looking at what happens once they get there,'' he said.

Seeking Improvements
 Some top agency officials are keenly aware of these problems. In 1999, an agency task force wrote a 106-page report cataloging the agency's weaknesses and calling for reforms. ''F.D.A. is not funded, staffed or in some cases authorized to collect'' comprehensive reports of problems with drugs once they are already being sold, the report concluded. 
 In a March 13, 2000, letter to Senator Jim Jeffords, an independent from Vermont, Dr. Woodcock wrote that more than 1.6 million people in the United States were hospitalized every year because of drug side effects. Half of these problems are preventable, she wrote. The agency needed more money for better systems to prevent these problems, she wrote. The agency did not get them.
 Sam Kazman, general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian group in Washington, said that is how it should be. Mr. Kazman has been fighting for years against F.D.A. regulations, which he said had kept important medicines away from patients. Doctors and patients should decide what drugs are right for them, not the F.D.A., Mr. Kazman said. ''Giving them more money is no reason to think they would improve and it's possible that just the opposite would happen,'' he said.
 And Dr. Avorn of Harvard Medical School said that what the agency needed more than money was courage. When doubts emerge about a medicine's safety, the agency needs to insist that drug makers pay for independent tests, he said. And continuing drug surveillance could also be paid for by drug makers, he said.
 If companies refuse, the agency ''needs to call a press conference and issue a public notice saying, 'There are unresolved issues and we are trying to get the company to do a clinical trial and doctors should take that into account,''' Dr. Avorn said. ''The F.D.A. has moral authority and extraordinary public relations power if they chose to use them.''
 The agency has asked the Institute of Medicine, the government's principal scientific review agency, to study the agency's system for monitoring the safety of marketed drugs. Pressure for an independent drug safety center grew on Friday when Mr. Thompson of health and human services said in a news conference to announce his resignation that he supported such a move.
 The reason to make decisions governing the safety of drugs already on the market independent of the groups that approve new drugs, Dr. Graham of the F.D.A. told a Senate panel last month, is the conflicts that inevitably arise when those who approve a drug must later decide whether their own decisions were mistaken.
 ''They approved the drug so there can't possibly be anything wrong with it,'' Dr. Graham told the panel.
 But many inside the F.D.A. say that separating the monitoring of side effects from drug approvals would be a mistake because a drug's risks cannot be assessed independently from its benefits. Besides, information about the safety of drugs already approved should be used to assess applications for experimental drugs in the same class, said Dr. David Feigal, a top agency official who retired in May. An independent drug safety center ''is exactly the wrong way to go,'' Dr. Feigal said.
 Agency officials initially opposed making an independent drug safety center but have recently said they would study any proposals. Some have privately said that if Congress agrees to give such an independent center substantial resources the change could be worth the extra money.

HEADLINE: We Pledge Allegiance to the Mall

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The United States is now engaged in its greatest age of consumer spending -- longer and more intense than the splurge after World War II, when Americans rushed to acquire all the merchandise denied to them during the Depression and the war.
 That postwar surge in consumption, a pent-up response to years of unemployment, then rationing, subsided in the early 1950's. Not until the late-1980's did the nation -- encouraged by market bubbles -- once again devote three-quarters of its national income to consumer spending.
 But this time, the pent-up demand has intensified rather than dissipated, and the global economy trembles from the stress.
 The sequence is intricate. As consumption has risen in America, absorbing 80 percent of national income now, the production of goods and services has migrated overseas. That is the polar opposite of the post-World War II experience. Then, Americans consumed what they also produced; income from production paid for consumption. 
 Today, in contrast, 21 percent of what consumers purchase comes from abroad, and the figure has risen by a percentage point every two years since 1990, according to Commerce Department data. The figures do not include gasoline or fuel oil. The imports are purchased on credit -- consumer credit -- and therein lies the stress. 
 ''We outsource everything except consumption, and that is not sustainable much longer,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley, arguing that the indebtedness involved in America's obsessive spending will soon disrupt exchange rates, damaging economies.
 Foreigners are helping to make the indebtedness possible by subsidizing consumer credit through more than $600 billion a year in loans to the United States. Without that injection of borrowed money, the United States would be hard-pressed to fund both consumer credit and its huge budget deficit. Interest rates would rise, making consumption more expensive. 
 By all the rules of international economics, Mr. Roach's prognosis of impending crisis is accurate. Americans cannot endlessly purchase more than they can pay for, while the producing countries, particularly China, provide endless credit to cover the shortfall. That willingness to lend props up the dollar's value -- until the day comes that Chinese consumers purchase more of their own country's output, and the pressure to export and to finance the exports declines.
 Many experts agree with Mr. Roach that America's mounting deficit in its overseas transactions and its growing indebtedness to foreigners cannot be sustained. But much more than in the past, this way of thinking is hotly disputed. The reason is that something novel is happening to the global economy. The age-old concept of comparative advantage has taken a wry 21st-century twist. 
 Nations still trade the goods and services that each produces most efficiently. That is the traditional definition of comparative advantage and, to take just one example, no country is more adept at exporting the fruits of biotechnology than the United States.
 But as other countries acquire the skills and efficiencies that were once this country's strengths, a new comparative advantage flourishes in the United States that no other nation has come close to matching. That advantage is America's miraculous mechanism for magnifying consumption. 
 The nations feeding this mechanism are mainly China, Japan, most of the rest of Asia, Canada and the European Union. Their output of goods and services exceeds the purchasing power of their own populations, so they sell the excess in the bottomless United States marketplace. That gives these other nations a stake in maintaining the new set of comparative advantages. 
 If consumption drops in America, production falls overseas, pulling down other economies. Rising unemployment adds to the already huge number of people without work, especially in China. But consumption in America has not fallen, not even in the 2001 recession. For the first time, it rose in the United States during a recession. 
 ''With some relatively minor adjustments, we can maintain this system of us consuming and them producing for a long time,'' said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
 For him and others in his camp, a mild dollar devaluation, gradually increasing the cost of imports, is enough of an adjustment, for now, to take the edge off consumption. The dollar has indeed declined in recent weeks -- significantly against the euro, but less against the currencies of the Asian countries, although even against them the pace has accelerated. The big holdout is China, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.
 The resistance to devaluation draws no protest from the chamber. While Mr. Regalia calls for minor adjustments, the chamber itself espouses neither a stronger nor a weaker dollar. That is partly because one-quarter of the chamber's three million members are retailers who benefit from America's high level of consumption, much of it imported on credit. 
 The pressure from American manufacturers for dollar devaluation is also diluted. The rising efficiency of low-wage Asian workers draws manufacturing operations relentlessly overseas -- so much so that manufacturing's share of the gross domestic product fell to 12.7 percent last year, from 15.4 percent in 1998. 
 The cost of the new global alignment is evident in the Commerce Department's reports and in other government data. The current account deficit, the balance sheet for all of the nation's international transactions, is approaching an astronomical $630 billion this year, most of it a result of the imbalance in merchandise trade. 
 Indebtedness to foreigners, mainly to pay for this imbalance, was $4.5 trillion in the third quarter, double what it was less than six years ago. The debt is rising most quickly in Asia, where the Chinese government, for example, takes the dollars that Americans spend on imports from China and lends them back to the United States so consumer spending can continue, on credit. The dollar's reputation as a particularly safe reserve currency only adds to the willingness of other countries to lend to Americans.
 THE recycling comes mainly through the purchase of Treasury securities. These purchases in turn help fund the Bush administration's budget deficit, and the influx of cash is enough to hold down American interest rates. The lower rates keep down the cost of consumer credit and encourage the raising of cash through mortgage refinancing -- a type of consumer credit that is rare elsewhere in the world. This borrowing sustains the spending binge, even as incomes have stagnated since the 2001 recession and jobs have disappeared. 
 No other nation possesses the same huge network of retail outlets, whose productivity is rising faster than any other sector of the economy, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No other people are as drenched in advertising and product promotion. No other country maintains so sophisticated a warehouse and distribution system, linked to consumers not only through malls but through the Internet and call centers. 
 ''Once you get into a mall, you are confronted with a huge array of inexpensive goods, and you have driven to the mall, so you can bring a lot home in the car,'' said Stephen Brobeck, the Consumer Federation's executive director. ''In European cities you walk to a mall, if there is one nearby, and walking, you can't carry as much home. We have more cars per capita than Japan or Europe.'' 
 What may in the end undo the new form of comparative advantage is not current account deficits or misaligned currencies, but social forces. Tens of millions of Asians could insist on higher wages so they could consume more, too. Or, American consumers could succumb to an overload of debt and stagnant incomes. Mr. Roach, the Morgan Stanley economist, sees the former happening first. 
 ''We are assuming that Asians, in particular, are willing to put aside their aspirations as consumers,'' he said, ''and continue indefinitely as low-wage producers unable to consume what they produce.''

HEADLINE: In Housing Sales, Frenzy Is Giving Way to Balance

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
THE biggest boom ever in the price of America's houses -- four straight years of gains averaging almost 7 percent annually -- is losing steam.
 In many markets, houses that once would have attracted swarms of buyers and multiple bids are no longer snapped up in a weekend. Fewer sell for more than the original asking price. Some builders are again offering concessions to overcome newly revived price resistance, and more deals are falling through. 
 ''We've been in a frenzy'' in real estate the last two years, said S. Lawrence Yun, senior economist for the National Association of Realtors. ''In 2005, we're going back to a more healthy balance.'' He forecasts that the pace of price increases will slow to 5.3 percent next year.
 The lowest interest rates in a generation have fueled demand, the main factor causing prices to rise. But most analysts agree that the market will cool off, although some worry that the market has become so severely overvalued that prices could fall in some areas, as they did in California in the 1990's.
 One reason for the cooling could be heavy recent speculative buying, with people acquiring houses in hopes of a quick profit without making improvements to the homes. Such purchases contributed to a 12.97 percent surge in average home prices from the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2004, the biggest four-quarter increase since 1979, when inflation began to rise at double-digit rates, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. That was almost five times the gain of other goods and services measured by the Consumer Price Index.
 The median price for existing single-family homes reached $191,000 last June, up from $170,000 in 2003; it settled at $187,000 in October, according to the most recent figures available from the agency. Property held by speculators, now estimated to account for as much as 15 percent of sales, represents hidden inventory that could suddenly be put up for sale should the market sour.
 The deceleration of prices expected next year -- the rise for 2004 is estimated at 6.9 percent -- reflects an almost certain continuation of increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, analysts said. David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, predicts that rates on conventional 30-year mortgages will average 6.40 percent next year, up from the current 5.75 percent, and will reach 6.75 percent by the end of 2005. He nevertheless projects that 1.87 million new homes will be built next year, only 4 percent fewer than the 1.95 million likely to be built this year. That includes a record 1.6 million single-family homes.
 Current prices are at record levels in relation to average incomes, so higher interest rates would almost certainly make purchasing a home harder for prospective buyers. The low rates of recent years have helped buyers afford more expensive houses. 
 The sales-damping effect of higher interest rates might, however, be offset by an increase in employment, which could give more people the cash and the confidence to buy homes.
 Houses have appreciated 1.5 to 2 percentage points faster than the rise in the Consumer Price Index. With inflation at about 3 percent, the 7 percent advances in house prices in recent years are at least twice the norm.
 The latest median price for a home is $266,400 in the West; $217,900 in the Northeast; $170,400 in the South; and $152,000 in the Midwest. Areas with the biggest increases in the sale prices of houses in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 were Nevada, Hawaii, California and the District of Columbia and Rhode Island. 
 NEW Jersey ranked 8th, New York 12th, and Connecticut 13th in growth of house prices. The weakest growth was in Texas followed by Utah, Indiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
 Many industry analysts said they believed that the new year would bring continued, if more subdued, gains as the nation's homeownership rate approaches a record 70 percent.
 ''Although more locations are now at greater risk of a home-price decline than a year or two ago, a sharp correction is unlikely unless the economy unexpectedly contracts,'' the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard reported in its annual appraisal.
 Mr. Yun, the analyst for the Realtors' association, said in October, ''Homeowners can expect $10,000 equity gain from home-price appreciation in 2005.'' Increases in personal wealth from higher home values have significant effects on the economy at large. Economists have estimated that each dollar increase in real estate assets generates 8 cents of additional spending that year while the same gain from stocks and bonds adds only 2 cents to spending.
 The overall economic effect of a rise in home values next year could be muted, however, because fewer people are refinancing their mortgages as interest rates rise. Over the last four years, falling rates have led homeowners to tap the equity in their homes while lowering their monthly payments, freeing up money to spend. But the Mortgage Bankers Association of America predicts the volume of mortgage refinancings will slide almost 43 percent next year, to $680 billion from an estimated $1.19 trillion in 2004.
 Even though more people than ever already own homes, economists say that several factors will work to keep the demand for houses robust. Inventories of available housing are low, for example, because environmental and other constraints limit new supply in some of the hottest markets. And immigration provides a steady source of new buyers, since immigrants rate owning a home as their top priority -- more so than the general population. 
 That could compensate somewhat for the fact that fewer first-time buyers can afford homes. The housing affordability index for first-time buyers stood at 74.7 for the third quarter of this year, down from an average of 79.7 for 2001 to 2003, according to the office of housing oversight. 
 That suggests that a family with a median income made less than 75 percent of the money needed to qualify for a mortgage to buy a median-priced starter home, which jumped to $160,200 in the third quarter from $125,600 in 2001. The index for the third quarter shows median income for first-time buyers was $31,225. (By contrast, the index for all buyers remains relatively high -- 132.2 in October. That suggests that a family with a median income had more than enough money to buy a median-price home.)
 ''We're going to see more moderate price appreciation'' next year, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Harvard center. ''If you're buying a house now primarily for investment, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you're buying to live in it, though it's not riskless, in the long run you should be fine.''

HEADLINE: Iran Hints It Sped Up Enriching Uranium as a Ploy

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Iranian officials have hinted in recent days that they sped up their enrichment of uranium in the past year to put Iran in a better position to negotiate with the West. 
 In a rare admission, Sirous Nasseri, a member of Iran's negotiating team with three European countries over its nuclear program, was quoted Sunday in the daily newspaper Shargh as saying that Iran had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle since last year, when it came under international pressure to abandon its uranium enrichment program.
 ''We are in a better negotiating position for political work than last year,'' the daily quoted him as saying.
 Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's former ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told students at Ferdowssi University in Mashhad on Wednesday that the government of President Muhammad Khatami had, for the first time, allocated money and facilities to make ''advanced centrifuges'' for uranium enrichment, Shargh also reported. 
 Iran has taken the position that its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, though it has pursued technology that could easily be converted to weapons production. The United States has accused Iran of secretly trying to make nuclear weapons and has urged its allies on the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, to send Iran's case to the Security Council.
 The agency opted for a gentler approach and issued a mildly worded resolution after Iran agreed in talks with the three European nations -- France, Germany and Britain -- to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. In return Iran expects rewards, including economic benefits, political and security cooperation with Europe and help with nuclear technology.
 A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Sunday that Iran was not obliged to allow United Nations inspectors to visit military sites said to be involved in secret nuclear weapons work, but that it was willing to discuss the issue, Agence France-Presse reported.
 ''It is not a matter of unlimited commitments and unlimited inspections,'' said the spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi. ''We will act in accordance with'' the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
 Despite statements by Iran's leaders that their nuclear program has wide public support, reaction among Iranians to the agreement to suspend nuclear activities has been muted. 
 Except for a protest outside the British Embassy in Tehran, for which about 200 members of a militia force were bused in, no noticeable protest has occurred.
 Frustrated by more than two decades of isolation and eight years of war with Iraq, many Iranians indicate that they would rather avoid confrontation with other countries. They say their priorities are an improved economy and more political and social freedom. 
 ''The government could spend the $12 billion it has spent over a nuclear program for development of the country,'' said Karim Bozorgmehr, 32, an English teacher. An analyst in Tehran, who had done surveys on the subject but who said he feared retaliation if his name was published, said a majority of people he approached viewed the government's nuclear ambition with skepticism, saying the government was seeking nuclear capacity as a deterrent and as a way to consolidate its power.
 ''The clerics want to get hold of the bomb to rule for another 50 years,'' said, Reza, 36, a civil servant, who, fearing retaliation, would agree to be identified by only his first name. 
 News of the United Nations agency's resolution last week helped Iran's economy, in which important sectors like real estate and the stock market had slumped over fears that the nuclear dispute could result in a military confrontation with Israel or the United States. 
 ''People were in a wait-and-see situation,'' said Saeed Leylaz, a journalist and an analyst in Tehran. ''The decline in the economy and the soaring unemployment led to discontent among people. Iranian society is not ready for any kind of confrontation, and this put pressure on the government to reach a deal with Europe.'' 
 Iran began its nuclear program before the Islamic revolution in 1979 with aid from the United States, Germany and France. But the world has been suspicious of the nuclear program of Iran's Islamic government.

HEADLINE: The Two Faces of China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
FEW business executives watch the growth of the Chinese economy as closely as Michael R.P. Smith, the chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
 Yet even Mr. Smith was startled when his staff recently projected that in 2034, bank assets in China would surpass those in the United States.
 ''When I saw that, I said, 'That can't be right,' and I went back to the economics guys,'' who confirmed the projection, Mr. Smith recalled. 
 Much the same surprise is cropping up in industry after industry and in country after country. From steel to oil to cars to credit cards, China is poised to become the world's biggest producer and market for many goods and services.
 Along the way, China has come to terrify many foreign business executives and attract others -- and sometimes both at the same time, depending on whether they see the country as a competitor, a cheap source of supply, a market, or all three.
 Companies across many industries are facing enormous pressure to match prices that are available in China or lose their customers. That can mean deep price cuts of 25 to 50 percent, leading in some cases to job losses, cutbacks and even closings. At the same time, American and European companies are taking advantage of China's vast and inexpensive labor force by moving some of their operations there -- and by offering their products to a country whose role as a consumer continues to grow.
 China is already the largest user of steel and cement and is poised to overtake the United States in consumption of everything from copper to soybeans. These goods are needed in a fast-growing economy with many highways, factories and office towers to build -- and with 1.3 billion mouths to feed.
 China has become the world's largest market for cellphones, and it is catching up with Germany and Japan as a market for cars, although it considerably trails the United States in its appetite for new vehicles.
 Businesses reaping the biggest rewards include companies that supply China's need for infrastructure, like the General Electric Company, which sells large turbines and aircraft engines. G.E. currently ships roughly $3.5 billion worth of goods each year to China from other countries, mainly the United States, while exporting $2 billion of merchandise from China, mainly to the United States.
 But companies like G.E. are the exception. American imports from China exceed exports by more than five to one, as retailers like Wal-Mart Stores buy immense and growing quantities of goods from China. With as many people as the entire industrialized world combined, China has tens of millions of unskilled workers willing to work for less than $100 a month.
 During the Democratic primaries this year, Senator John Kerry repeatedly denounced ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'s'' who moved jobs overseas. Those statements drew strong objections from the business community, including Democratic business leaders, and Mr. Kerry's comments about trade were relatively tame during the general election campaign. 
 YET many corporate executives wonder how much longer a big American trade deficit and the moving of jobs overseas can persist without becoming the subject of strong protests by Americans who say that foreign workers are taking away their jobs
 ''China kind of got a pass in this campaign; that may not always be the case,'' said Benjamin W. Heineman Jr., G.E.'s senior vice president for law and public affairs.
 Even trickier could be the Chinese relationship with the European Union, another big market for exports. Powerful European labor unions could force limits on Chinese exports, much as they forced tighter restrictions on Japanese automobile exports in the 1980's and 1990's.
 ''I'm quite gloomy about Europe -- the big industrial countries like Germany, Italy and France,'' said Frank-Jurgen Richter, the president of Horasis, a consulting company in Geneva. ''How do you keep growth in these countries if everything is moving to China?''
 Like Japan from the 1950's through the 1980's, China has shown that a country can sustain high growth rates for many years by combining hard work with a closed financial system that channels very high household savings into countless industrial projects and other ventures selected partly by government bureaucrats.
 Japan's stagnation since the early 1990's suggests that such policies may have limitations. Predicting when China might hit such a wall has become something of a cottage industry. This has been particularly true in the last year, as Beijing has imposed fairly strict controls on bank lending. The government has raised bank reserve requirements three times and increased the benchmark interest rates for bank loans and deposits once, in response to evidence that the economy may be overheating.
 Climbing prices for industrial commodities like steel, bid up around the world mainly because of China's rapid growth, have alarmed manufacturers across China. Xin Yumei, an export manager at Yangquan Metals and Minerals in China's north central Shanxi Province, said the price of steel for the company's scissors and pocketknives had jumped close to 20 percent in the last year.
 ''The price is going up, and I have to raise our prices soon,'' she said. 
 Overhanging every assessment is the question of how much more competitive China can become globally if its domestic economy slows, freeing even more goods for export at ever cheaper prices while trimming China's demand for imports.
 Most executives say they see no sign of this yet, but they are still cautious. ''We don't see the danger of a huge collapse that would cause them to export huge tonnage,'' said Nicholas Tolerico, the president of ThyssenKrupp Steel Services, the trading and distribution arm of the German giant. Still, he warned, ''If there were even a slight downturn, probably the first thing that would be adjusted is the amount they import.''
 Worries that the recent boom in the Chinese economy might be followed by a sharp bust have receded considerably since last spring, when ships were waiting up to a month to unload at clogged Chinese ports, and many Western economists were predicting that Beijing would have to impose draconian measures to prevent an inflationary spiral.
 But some experts point out that the biggest imbalance in China's economy -- the fact that most of its growth depends on often-speculative construction spending -- may not be sustainable. Morris Goldstein and Nicholas R. Lardy, two experts at the International Institute for International Economics, contend in a new paper that instead of a ''hard landing'' or a ''soft landing,'' China may be due for a ''long landing'' of slower economic growth that could last for years, as few additional apartment buildings and office towers are built until recently erected ones are fully occupied.
 China experienced slower growth in the mid-1990's, as it struggled with the effects of a frenzy of construction that reached its peak in 1993. But China did fully recover from that episode. Optimists point to a flourishing of entrepreneurial energy that has long been part of the culture of overseas Chinese communities and has now emerged with full force in mainland China, with productivity improvements that are still being felt.
 One such entrepreneur is Chen Chenmei, who started making shoelaces in her home a decade ago in Wenzhou using a machine that cost $50, and delivered them on her bicycle to shoe factories. Now, she and her family own a small shoelace factory, rent a car and employ a driver to make deliveries to factories and have their own stall at a wholesale shoe market here.
 Laces in many hues and lengths, from brown bootlaces to pink laces for tennis shoes, filled the stall up to the rafters on a recent morning. Yet Ms. Chen was wearing cheap tennis shoes that had scruffy white laces with the tips broken off.
 Savings are important to keep the factory growing, and sometimes for loans to family members who want to start their own businesses, Ms. Chen said, adding that ''money flows all around among relatives.''
 The biggest question hanging over China is its political stability. Historians point out that the prosperity in China now has coincided with nearly three decades of the greatest social and political stability that China has seen in more than a century.
 How long that will endure is anyone's guess. A big problem for China is how to address the wide gap in incomes between urban and rural residents. In countries across Asia this year, voters have shown considerable concern not just over expanding economic output but over how the gains are distributed.
 ''In all these countries, the verdict the electorates have given is: strengthen the inclusiveness of growth,'' said Ifzal Ali, the chief economist of the Asian Development Bank.
 While China, a one-party state, does not allow free elections, public opinion still counts for something. Hu Jintao, the leader of the Communist Party for the last two years and China's president since early last year, has taken some steps to improve the lives of China's poor.
 Letting food prices rise steeply has helped considerably, as farmers have taken in more money for their crops. The Chinese government has also tried to improve worker safety. Many small protests have bubbled up in numerous Chinese cities, often over unpaid wages, but there has been no sign of their spreading to become a national problem.
 Corporate executives, politicians and economists generally agree that if China does suffer a sharp economic reversal, the results will be severe -- both within China and far beyond its borders. A downturn could lead to severe unemployment, social and political unrest and large-scale emigration. The effects could also include plunges in financial and commodity markets if China's demand for foreign goods dried up and it unloaded unneeded items on world markets.
 Western Europe helped maintain Russia's stability in the mid-1990's with big infusions of financial assistance, but China's larger economy and much greater population make it impossible for the outside world to offer nearly as much aid, said P. Christian Hauswedell, Germany's top diplomat for Asian and Pacific affairs.
 ''The thought of a failure of this modernization just makes us all shiver,'' he said. ''We would not be able to support China if it failed.''

HEADLINE: New Risks for Salmon

 BODY:
The Bush administration has dropped any pretense of providing serious long-term protection for endangered salmon species in the Pacific Northwest. Last Tuesday, the administration proposed to roll back restrictions on commercial development across millions of acres in California north to the Canadian border that had been designated four years ago as ''critical habitat'' essential to salmon recovery. The next day, the administration ruled out demolishing four dams on the lower Snake River -- even as a last resort to save the fish. 
 Both announcements represented departures from the Clinton administration's more robust approach to salmon recovery. Both also reflected the degree to which the administration is prepared to contort science and common sense to slide out from under its obligations under the Endangered Species Act to ensure long-term recovery of the fish instead of merely slowing their rate of decline.
 Earlier this year, for instance, the administration proposed to count millions of hatchery-raised fish as wild fish -- a bit of mathematical casuistry that would instantly make wild populations seem healthier than they are, undercut the need to keep wild salmon on the endangered species list and give the green light to federal agencies to drop protections against logging, homebuilding and other forms of commercial development.
 But this was not nearly as preposterous as the argument, in the dam ruling last week, that the dams were immutable parts of the landscape, like a mountain, and thus beyond the reach of the Endangered Species Act and ''beyond the present discretion'' of the government to remove them. 
 The administration offers endless justifications for its proposals, chiefly the insupportable claim that both dam removal and habitat protection would exact an unacceptable economic price. It also promises mitigating measures, including technological fixes to help the fish over and around the dams, and more ''focused'' habitat protection, albeit in a much smaller area than the fish's historical range. But clearly the administration's heart isn't in it. The underlying message here is that commercial interests come first, salmon second, even if history suggests that the two can comfortably coexist.

HEADLINE: Beijing Loves the Web Until the Web Talks Back

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
LAST December, China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, sat down for a remarkably candid online chat with Chinese Internet users. 
 ''People are not too keen about your looks,'' one participant chided, according to a translation published in The South China Morning Post -- and Mr. Li replied, ''My mother would not agree with this view.'' 
 The exchange was the first time that a senior Chinese official had engaged in an online chat with ordinary citizens, but its improbably personal moments belied the restrictive government's tenuous relationship with the Internet. 
 Indeed, as the number of people online in China has quintupled over the last four years, the government has shown itself to be committed to two concrete, and sometimes competing, goals: strategically deploying the Internet to economic advantage, while clamping down -- with surveillance, filters and prison sentences -- on undesirable content and use.
 Both trends, experts say, are likely to continue. 
 ''The continuance of Communist Party rule is only possible to the extent that the government delivers economic growth,'' said Duncan Clark, the managing director of BDA China, a telecommunications and technology consulting firm based in Beijing. ''Much as Henry IV in France was known for the chicken in every pot,'' he said in an e-mail message, ''China's rulers are bent on putting communications, mobile phones, Internet access and the new growth area, broadband, into as many hands as possible.''
 China is already the largest mobile communications subscriber market in the world, with more than 320 million subscribers. Internet users -- who numbered fewer than 17 million in 2000 -- are now estimated to be somewhere near 90 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center, the government's clearinghouse for Internet statistics. China is second only to the United States in the number of people online, and the 90 percent of its total population around 1.3 billion who are not online still represents a vast, untapped market. 
 The Internet has given rise to several Chinese companies worth billions of dollars, including Web portals like Netease, Sina and Sohu -- all traded on Nasdaq. And American interests responded after Beijing's pledge this year to increase purchases of United States telecommunications equipment. 
 In June, China's leading Internet search engine, Baidu.com, announced that the American search powerhouse, Google, had bought a stake in the company. Days later, Yahoo unveiled Yisou.com, its own China-based search engine. And on Nov. 11, Cisco Systems of San Jose, Calif., announced that it had been chosen to build the business portion of a new backbone network linking 200 Chinese cities. The company, which has secured over $100 million in contracts with China Telecom since last June, was also the main provider of equipment for the country's largest existing public network, ChinaNet. 
 But not everyone is celebrating the way China has nurtured the Internet. 
 ''China is the world's biggest prison for cyberdissidents,'' said Tala Dowlatshahi, a spokeswoman for the group Reporters Without Borders, based in France. ''It's extremely worrying.''
 Human rights groups, which consider the Internet in China to be something of a blessing and a curse, have long raised concerns about the Chinese government's use of the technology. The rise of China's Internet hinted at more freedoms, but it also promised the government a new and effective means of monitoring its citizens. And while some technologically adept citizens have been finding ways to circumvent the monitoring, the government is also becoming more sophisticated, and it remains just as willing to punish transgressors. 
 In a 2004 report called ''The Internet Under Surveillance,'' Reporters Without Borders noted that although Chinese officials had released four people detained for their activities on the Internet since the spring of 2003, there were still 61 people imprisoned ''for posting messages or articles on the Internet that were considered subversive.'' 
 The report also noted that the Internet, in its Chinese manifestation, is purposly built for social control and monitoring.
 ''There are just five backbones or hubs through which all traffic must pass,'' the report noted. ''No matter what I.S.P. is chosen by Internet users, their e-mails and the files they download and send must pass through these hubs.''
 The OpenNet Initiative -- an international partnership linking Internet and legal research centers at the University of Toronto, Harvard Law School and Cambridge University -- tracks state filtering and surveillance practices. According to the group's most recent bulletins from China, the government has found new ways to filter search engine results. Sensitive keywords like ''Falun Gong'' or ''Taiwan Independence'' will often return no hits. 
 And with more interactive activities like blogging, online chat and message boards, the monitoring is intense and redundant. 
 ''Those who host such activities within the country understand that they can be held responsible for what their users say there,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a law professor and a founder of the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard, ''and therefore themselves engage in monitoring.'' 
 Western companies have been chided by human rights groups for acquiescing to demands from the Chinese government that, for instance, certain words be filtered in their search engines, or that hardware be tailored to assist in surveillance -- though most companies counter that they have no control over how the government uses their products. And while it occasionally appears that incremental improvements are being made -- Reporters Without Borders noted that China finally tried and sentenced most of the cyberdissidents whom it had held without trial for years -- China's huge investment in Internet technology remains generally inseparable from the government's expressed desire to control the information carried. 
 ''The evidence points to the government not giving up on surveillance and filtering,'' Professor Zittrain said. ''Indeed, they are refining the techniques for each.''
 But so, too, will cyberdissidents refine their efforts to do and say what they want on the Internet, experts say. 
 ''On the censorship topic, best to think of it as a cat-and-mouse game,'' Mr. Clark of BDA China said. ''There will never be an absolute winner or loser.''
 The kind of cultural and economic flourishing that the Internet has already wrought in China is irreversible, Mr. Clark said. 
 Repercussions for a narrow range of sensitive topics, he acknowledged, are real -- and often severe. But apart from these, ''China's Internet is a hothouse of content on a wide range of topics and interests,'' Mr. Clark said, ''especially those embraced by the teens and 20-somethings who make up the bulk of the online population still. 
 ''China's rapidly emerging middle classes, numbering tens if not hundreds of millions, are dependent on the Internet and the Internet is dependent on them,'' he said. ''There's no putting the genie back in the bottle now, and no real attempt to do so.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Nations Seen Cutting Worldwide Deposits in Dollars

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have cut the proportion of their deposits denominated in dollars by more than 13 percentage points in the past three years, mainly to the advantage of the euro, the Bank for International Settlements said Sunday.
 In its latest quarterly report, the Bank for International Settlements -- a forum for world central banks -- attributed the trend partly to United States interest rates having fallen below euro-zone levels.
 The report said dollar-denominated deposits fell to 61.5 percent of total deposits by members OPEC in the second quarter of 2004, from 75 percent in the third quarter of 2001. 
 The share of euro-denominated deposits rose to 20 percent from 12 percent over the same period.
 The bank, based in Basel, Switzerland, noted that less oil revenues seem to have gone into the international banking system recently but said there had been a ''subtle but noticeable'' shift in the composition of deposits in the past three years.
 ''Since the third quarter of 2001, oil revenue seems to have been channeled increasingly into euro and other currency deposits,'' the bank said. ''This shift out of U.S. dollars probably reflected to some extent the relative change in interest rates in the United States and the euro area since 1998.''
 The bank said United States short-term interest rates were an average 2.1 percentage points higher than their euro counterparts for two years before March 2001, but averaged 1.3 percentage points lower from then to June 2004. In the 2004 second quarter, B.I.S. reporting banks' net liabilities to OPEC members stood at $142 billion.
 Oil prices rose 70 percent at one point this year from early January due to fast growth in demand and concerns over supply. The United States crude oil price advanced to $55.67 in October but has since fallen back to around $42.50. Speculation that Middle Eastern central banks and investors had been shifting funds out of the dollar into the euro contributed to the dollar's decline in the past three years. The dollar hit a record low on Thursday, when one euro was worth $1.34.
 OPEC nations are Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The B.I.S. excluded Indonesia from its study because it became a net oil importer this year.

HEADLINE: Stepping Up the Pressure Against Piracy in China

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND

 BODY:
AFTER years of careful, nuanced and largely unsuccessful diplomacy intended to stop the widespread piracy of American goods in China, the United States has shifted its approach and posted an officer in Beijing to address the problem directly.
 The appointment does not signal that piracy in China is nearing an end. But American companies, which lose billions of dollars every year to counterfeiting, are relieved that the coming year holds, at the very least, a new strategy. 
 The International Intellectual Property Alliance, which represents the movie, music and entertainment software industries, has estimated that 90 percent of the DVD's, CD's and digital games hawked by street vendors and sold in shops in China are pirated. In 2003, American businesses lost $2.5 billion to copyright theft originating in China, the alliance estimates. 
 ''The vast majority of copyright holders are not making money in China, or are making a fraction of what they ought to be making or are making in neighboring countries,'' said Eric Smith, president of the alliance.
 The piracy is not limited to the entertainment industry. Batteries, shoes, clothing, alcohol, prescription drugs, soap, cosmetics, toiletries -- even automobiles have been counterfeited and sold in China. 
 The black market employs thousands of workers and represents a significant portion of the economy. Illicit manufacturers operate factories all over China, where the knock-offs are produced for a fraction of the price of brand-name goods, and are so cleverly packaged that it is hard to tell them from the real products. 
 Many of the fake goods are loaded onto ships and sent throughout the world, and it can be difficult for distributors to know that they are getting bootleg products.
 Five years ago, just 16 percent of the contraband seized at American ports came from mainland China, said Jon Dudas, director of the Patent and Trademark Office. By last year, China accounted for 65 percent of confiscated counterfeit goods, he said.
 Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, stressed the issue in a meeting this year with Vice Premier Wu Yi. In the fall, the Commerce Department sent its own attache from the Patent and Trademark Office to Beijing to oversee China's enforcement of intellectual property laws for the next two years.
 It chose Mark Cohen, a lawyer in the agency's office of enforcement who speaks Chinese, holds a master's degree in Chinese studies and was part of previous trade delegations to China. Mr. Cohen will work out of the American Embassy in Beijing. 
 In an e-mail exchange from Beijing, Mr. Cohen wrote that he had been meeting with American companies and with Chinese officials, and cautioned that ''we should not be condemned to repeat the past. 
 ''It's critical that we provide guidance as well as criticism to the Chinese, and that we support our companies by trying to seek protection for their rights,'' Mr. Cohen wrote. ''Obviously if you are a rights holder watching infringing actions eat into your bottom line, every day of delay is time that is running out.''
 Although China has intellectual property laws, enforcement has been sporadic. The alliance reported last October on an increase in raids by Chinese authorities on factories and distributors of fake goods. But it also said that the raids brought no change to the black market because fines against the pirates were tiny, no violators were sent to jail, and no criminal cases were started. 
 ''Whether or not China will have the political will to do what is required to make a difference is really an open question,'' said Mr. Smith, the alliance president. ''We have immense respect for Mark Cohen, but the extent to which any one person can effect change in China is -- well, no one has been able to do it.'' 
 China has recognized American concerns. Last spring, Mr. Wu, the vice premier, pledged to substantially reduce piracy. A series of raids followed that declaration, and China started an anti-piracy campaign. 
 But acknowledging the piracy that is evident on China's streets is one thing, stopping it is another. Until recently, even the Chinese government ran its computers using pirated software. And in the small villages where illicit production generates jobs and income, it is even more difficult for the government to act.
 Mr. Cohen said in his e-mail message that he hoped to ''improve U.S. or Chinese customs seizures, or help small or medium companies without representation in China deal with enforcement challenges.''
 Mr. Smith said the main priority for the American entertainment industry was getting criminal prosecutions of the biggest producers. ''The Chinese government's rhetoric is great, but where are the actions?'' he asked. ''You can't do this by seizing a few products. A CD costs 15 cents to produce. You seize them and they are replaced in minutes.''

HEADLINE: As a Death Foretold, a Plant's Closing Causes Little Pain

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: LINDEN, N.J., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Last week's announcement that the sprawling General Motors plant in this industrial city will close should have been a sad, almost funereal event. It is, after all, the last auto manufacturing plant in the state. It has been a source of thousands of jobs going back generations.
 But news of the closing was more about symbolism than true tragedy. Though nearly 800 plant workers will lose their jobs, they have suspected the layoffs could happen since 1992, and their union contracts leave them well taken care of. The manufacturing sector of the statewide and regional economy has been hemorrhaging jobs for decades. In the end, Linden's loss is simply the period at the end of a sentence that began a long time ago.
 And that is how it was greeted last week in this city. From the union halls to City Hall, from the shops along a still-bustling downtown to the strip malls along Routes 1 and 9, the news drew a kind of world-weary shrug. People here say they have grown numb to the production ups and downs of the auto industry. Threats to the plant have been so numerous in recent years that no one was surprised to hear that the last vehicle would come off the line on Feb. 18. 
 Inside the offices of Local 595 of the United Automobile Workers union, there was no hand-wringing over the fear of missed mortgage payments. Guy Messina, the local's president, noted that all of the workers would be paid until 2007, when the current contract expires, even though no Chevrolet Blazers, the last of a distinguished line of vehicles, would be built.
 All of the union workers active here had 27 years or more of seniority, and most would probably retire, he said. They would leave, he said, with regrets only about leaving behind the camaraderie of the workplace.
 For the town, it means a loss of $4 million a year in property taxes. But even John T. Gregorio, the canny and colorful mayor of this town of 39,000 people for the last 30 years, views it as another chapter in an interminable soap opera. He said he expected a new rank of businesses to line up to purchase and develop the plant's 35 acres, which are strategically located near highways, rail freight lines and commuter lines. And the town's work force has proved nimbly adaptable to change.
 ''I haven't gotten any calls from workers there seeking work from the city, or from store owners who are afraid of losing business,'' said the 78-year-old mayor in the tone of a man who knows how to count votes. Mr. Gregorio ticked off a list of new industrial and retail developments already in the works, which he believes will more than fill the gap left by G.M. ''It's a prime piece of real estate with train tracks, highways, 20 minutes from New York City, 10 minutes from Newark Airport in a business where it is location, location, location,'' he said.
 The mayor was echoing what has become a truism in New Jersey and the region in recent decades, said Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the former head of New Jersey's Economic Development Commission. Unlike one-company towns in the nation's Rust Belt, the state and the region are blessed with a diversified economy and a sturdy infrastructure of roads and rails that make it seem infinitely adaptable to change, he said. 
 As manufacturing jobs have declined, he said, overall employment has risen, boosted by growth in the service sector, high technology, world trade related businesses and industries like pharmaceuticals.
 ''Adaptive reuse has been a big business in New Jersey,'' Mr. Coscia said, noting that whole cities have remade themselves. ''Look at the Gold Coast in Jersey City that used to be railyards. Look at the growth of health and medical businesses in New Brunswick, which used to be industrial.''
 There was a time when New Jersey could lay claim to being the leading manufacturing state in the nation. In 1943, just six years after G.M. opened the Linden plant, there were nearly one million manufacturing jobs in the state, and they accounted for 55.3 percent of employment. At the time, the national average of manufacturing jobs as a share of all jobs was 37.9 percent, said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy of Rutgers University.
 The number of such jobs as of October 2004 was 343,700, he said, which made manufacturing just 8.5 percent of the state's job base. Nationally, as manufacturing jobs have moved overseas and succumbed to technological and productivity gains, their share of the jobs was 10.9 percent, Professor Seneca said.
 Mr. Coscia said that such numbers obscured the human toll of plant closings. But he added that the region, with its skilled labor force, ports and infrastructure, was well-positioned to recoup the loss.
 ''We didn't build these factories in the middle of nowhere,'' he said.
 There is still the gritty feel of a factory town along Wood Avenue, Linden's main street, where the facades of the small shops are well-lighted and inviting. This section of town, west of Route 1 and 9 and the G.M. plant, is situated well away from the eastern part and its massive tank farms, warehouses, large chain stores, chemical plants and pharmaceutical plants that help make Linden's property taxes the lowest in Union County.
 Pat Russell, who with her husband, Bruce, operates Russell's Bridals and Tuxedos, said that Linden was not a ''G.M. town'' and she feels little nostalgia over the closing of the plant.
 ''Someone else will develop that land,'' she said, as she strolled amid shop mannequins draped in diaphanous tulle and shimmering organza. ''It might even be bought by Merck,'' she added, referring to the pharmaceutical company that has a plant right behind the G.M. plant and that has been eyeing properties for expansion.
 Workers at the G.M. plant said that fewer than 100 of them lived in Linden. But some, like Michael Donaghue, the local's chairman, think the nonchalant attitude among residents is shortsighted and a product of what they and Mayor Gregorio said has been a hostile relationship between the town and ''those guys in Detroit.'' The town has been embroiled in court in what is the state's longest running tax dispute -- more than 25 years -- over exactly how to appraise the plant for property tax purposes.
 Still, warmer feelings can emerge. Last Friday at the union hall, Mr. Messina, the local's president, and some of the plant's retirees paused over a table filled with faded snapshots of scenes at the plant, of picnics and of celebrations of the millionth Oldsmobile, Cadillac or Blazer to come off the assembly line. The young faces caught the eye of Peter Wagner, 88, and he picked out a few he had known in the years since 1937, after he became the 199th employee at the plant.
 ''I was building the road behind the plant for 50 cents an hour when I signed on with G.M. for 65 cents an hour,'' he said, eyes crinkling a bit. ''Even after I retired, I would go there and see how they modernized with the robots and the lasers. Jeez, we were like horse and wagons in comparison back in my day.''

HEADLINE: Nature and Industry In Conflict on Delaware

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA and JASON GEORGE; Anthony DePalma reported for this article from Philadelphia and Jason George from Camden and Paulsboro, N.J.

 BODY:
The Delaware River, where up to 473,500 gallons of crude oil flowed out of a six-foot gash in the bottom of a tanker bound for a New Jersey refinery recently, is more like two rivers than one. 
 The northern stretch, from its pristine headwaters in the mountains of Delaware County, N.Y., down 197 miles to the humble falls at Trenton, contains some of the most free-flowing waters in the Eastern United States, water so clean that New York City draws 800 million gallons from it every day for drinking without passing it through any filter. 
 Even after such diluvial diversions, the Upper Delaware and its tributaries are also some of the finest championship trout streams in the country, and hundreds of bald eagles winter along its unspoiled banks. 
 But the 134 miles of river from Trenton down to the mouth of Delaware Bay is so different from the upper stretch that it seems as if it has been mistakenly stuck at the tail end of the wrong river. 
 In this part, which is actually the Delaware's tidal estuary, commerce -- not nature -- is the star. Along its banks are several nuclear reactors, a chemical plant that is expected to neutralize stockpiles of nerve gas, and an oil refinery complex that provides 70 percent of the gasoline and heating oil used on the East Coast. 
 What happens in one end of the river often has a serious impact in the other, and on the millions of people who rely on it for both drinking water and their livelihoods.
 ''It's such a diverse river that it's difficult for people to get their arms around it,'' said Carol R. Collier, executive director of the Delaware River Basin Commission, a regulatory agency that brings the federal government and four states along the Delaware into a compact to resolve river issues, which is not easy when everyone involved has a different image of the Delaware. 
 ''A trout fisherman in Hancock, N.Y.,'' she said, ''can't really understand the needs of the refineries in Paulsboro, N.J.'' 
 Besides having two separate identities, the Delaware also serves as a political boundary of four states -- Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania -- that have haggled over control of the river's resources since shortly after George Washington crossed it in 1776. 
 The interstate conflict over the river's water came to a head early in the last century when a rapidly growing New York City developed ambitious plans to tap the headwaters of the Delaware River, more than 100 miles away. The other states protested, and the issue made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court. 
 In a series of decisions beginning in 1931, the court upheld New York's rights to the water, but established a system to ensure that enough water flows downriver to meet the drinking water needs of Trenton, Philadelphia and other river communities. Targets were also set to make sure that there was enough fresh water coming down the river to keep the salt water line from moving too far up Delaware Bay, threatening water intakes all along the lower part of the river. 
 With modifications, that system remains in place. So do the conflicts, especially during droughts.
 Despite the existence of the river basin commission, which was established in 1961, the Delaware is still not always thought of as a single resource. New York State and the federal government have fallen millions of dollars behind in payments owed to the commission. The other states have met all their obligations.
 Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said that even if the commission were fully funded, it would still need more authority over suburban sprawl to effectively protect the river.
 Local officials are continuously on the lookout for jobs, and housing that benefits from river views. But failure to limit construction increases both the amount of water taken from the Delaware and the amount of treated sewage and other contaminants that flow into the river. 
 ''Because the river is sort of bipolar,'' Mr. Tittel said, ''it is always being pulled in two separate directions.'' 
 At one time, even the northern stretches of the river had small-scale industry, mostly mills and small factories. Most disappeared long ago, which aided the river's restoration to the extent that much of it is now designated either a wild and scenic river or a national recreation area. 
 But on the Delaware's lower stretches, about 90,000 jobs are connected in some way to river activity, a big contribution in a region that suffers from high unemployment and urban decay.
 According to the Maritime Exchange for the Delaware River and Bay, more than 2,600 commercial ships head upriver each year, carrying all kinds of general cargo and about a million barrels a day of crude oil that the area's six refineries turn into gasoline, home heating oil, and other products. 
 By the early 1970's, the oil and chemical plants discharged so much pollution that all the oxygen was depleted from a 20-mile swath of river near Camden, and every living thing in the water died. Oil spills occurred regularly, and ship traffic constantly created hazards on the river. Dozens of workers died in the explosion of a tanker near Marcus Hook, Pa., in 1975. 
 The lower Delaware has since been cleaned up enough so that fish have returned, though there is a ban on eating them. Spills still occur regularly, though most are comparatively small. The nearly a half-million gallons of oil feared missing from the damaged tanker, the Athos I, would represent the worst spill ever on the Delaware.
 Truckers who work for the refineries say it is a shame that some birds were soaked with oil, but they are more worried that restrictions on ship traffic during the cleanup and investigation could delay crude oil deliveries and threaten jobs. 
 ''Everybody I went to school with works in the refineries in one way or another,'' Everett Peffer, 30, said recently while drinking a beer at the Starting Gate, a trucker bar near the Interstate 295 ramp in Paulsboro. Oil is so much a part of the town that the yearbook at Paulsboro High School is called The Pegasus after the symbol for Mobil, which owned the refinery until 2000. Around there, complaining too much about the oil companies is considered a sign of a lack of blue-collar civic pride. 
 ''If these refineries closed,'' said Mr. Peffer, of Thorofare, N.J., ''the town would shut down, too.'' 
 But many people believe that the lower Delaware, with all its refineries and oil spills, proves it is not necessary to have to choose between a clean environment and a healthy economy. 
 ''You have to be reasonable about it,'' said Robert F. Molzahn, president of the Water Resources Association of the Delaware River Basin, which represents businesses and individuals who work with the river. He said that over the last 30 years, the river's 20-mile-long dead zone had been cleaned up substantially.
 ''Is it as clean as it was when the Swedes sailed up the river to start their colony? No,'' he said, referring to Sweden's attempt at colonization in the 17th century. But the river breathes now, he said, fish have returned and industry continues to employ thousands of people. 
 Both business advocates and environmentalists agree that the way to have avoided the Athos I spill would have been to require all tankers to have double hulls immediately, rather than in 2015, the current deadline.
 Coast Guard investigators are looking into whether the single-hulled Athos may have struck a 14-foot bronze propeller on Nov. 26 that was lost somewhere in the Delaware last April. 
 A cleanup and rescue team from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware with up to 1,200 people has been scrambling over the river and into its tributaries to contain the oil. But they could not act quickly enough to prevent hardship for both industry and the environment. 
 The nuclear plants at Lower Alloways Creek had to be shut down temporarily as a precaution, and ship traffic up and down the river has been slowed during the recovery efforts. 
 And while dozens of Canada geese have died, and dozens more have been taken to cleaning stations, many others are still waddling around with oil-soaked feathers. A gaggle of them ambled near the Walt Whitman Bridge in Philadelphia one recent afternoon, about half of them ringed with oil. 
 Earlier that same day workmen at Fort Mifflin, an 18th century redoubt on the water's edge in Philadelphia, found a Canada goose struggling to swim inside the old fort's defensive moat, designed to keep out all intruders. It too was stained with crude. 
 Oily plastic soda bottles, looking like burnt roasts, bobbed next to branches, logs and loose planks black with oil that had washed up around the fort. The damaged ship, the Athos I, sat dead in the water, less than two miles away, as its remaining cargo was carefully unloaded and the investigation into the cause of the accident continued. 
 ''I don't have a problem and the river doesn't have a problem with sharing its resources with industry and commerce,'' said Maya K. van Rossum, an environmental lawyer and the Delaware riverkeeper, who serves as an advocate for the river at meetings of the commission and other regulatory agencies. As she walked along the old fort's ramparts, gobs of oil drifted by. ''But it's got to be done in a way that's not harmful to the river, not like this.''

HEADLINE: At a Frontier of School Reform, Getting Millions, Seeking More

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

DATELINE: JACKSON, Ky., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
As New York City schools celebrate the findings by a court-appointed panel that could bring them $5.6 billion more every year, the schools under the sawed-off mountains here in the heart of coal country tell a hopeful but cautionary tale of what may lie ahead. 
 Once the Kentucky Supreme Court said the state's school system needed revamping, in a ruling that inspired court cases and decisions around the nation, lawmakers here enacted one of the country's most thorough education overhauls within a year. 
 The response was virtually the opposite of the inaction in Albany after New York State lost its own case last year. And yet, despite all the changes and the extra money that came with them in 1990, the transformation of Kentucky's schools is far from complete -- and the state is back in court as a result.
 Here on Bobcat Lane, Breathitt County High School is precisely the kind of school that was supposed to catch up to its peers outside Appalachia. But for all its new computers, college-like schedules and, yes, academic improvement, its students still lag far behind those in the rest of the state. 
 ''We've made great strides, but there's still a long way to go,'' said Lisa Gross, a Kentucky Department of Education spokeswoman. ''The problem is revenue. There's not enough of it. This may be something we're dealing with for quite a few more years.'' 
 Since the overhaul more than a decade ago, the state has increased its yearly spending considerably -- to $7,021 per student in 2003, compared with $2,898 in 1990, state figures show. That is more than three times the percentage increase that the court appointed panel has proposed for New York City students over the next four years.
 There seems to be almost universal agreement here that Kentucky has leapt forward. Test scores on state exams have gone up steadily in almost every subject. Even the ''tidal wave'' of disappointment that made it ''crystal clear'' to the state's Supreme Court that Kentucky's schools were failing -- the high dropout rates and low national standings -- appears to have abated somewhat. 
 But while Kentucky schools have gained considerable ground, they still have much more to cover. Not much more than a third of the students are considered to be proficient or better in the basic subjects that all are supposed to master within a decade, state records show. State officials say it is probably unrealistic to think everyone will be. 
 Poor rural schools like Breathitt were at the forefront of what is now called the adequacy movement, a national fight for more education spending that has enveloped dozens of states and may soon send billions more dollars to New York City schools.
 But 15 years later, the litigation is not over. Kentucky schools are taking the state to court once more, only too aware that even a major victory does not mean an end to the battle.
 Last year, the vast majority of Kentucky districts, more than twice as many as the first time, sued the state, accusing it of failing to put in enough money over the years, basically leaving the job undone. 
 ''Years ahead of almost every other state in the nation and the federal government, we began a journey that would ensure that every child in Kentucky receives an adequate education,'' Blake Haselton, president of the Council for Better Education, a coalition of about 150 schools that brought the suit, said when it was filed last year. He added, ''But the sad fact of the matter is that the general assembly has not lived up to its constitutional mandate.''
 The lesson is a particularly important one for New York, because Kentucky's Legislature was much more responsive than lawmakers in Albany were after New York's highest court ordered them to stop shortchanging the city's students and fix what it called the ''systemic failure'' of its schools nearly 18 months ago. 
 ''The important thing to remember is that adequacy doesn't ask the question, 'Are you spending money and doing a good job with it?''' said Jacob E. Adams, director of the School Finance Redesign Project at the University of Washington. ''It asks the question, 'Did you put enough money into the system to achieve the results that states have never achieved before?'''
 To come up with at least some of the money, Kentucky raised its sales tax early on, Mr. Adams said, and the strategy may also come up in the dispute over raising more money in New York. Even so, the districts in Kentucky argue that the state's financing formulas have barely kept pace with inflation. Beyond that, they say, most -- and in some districts, all -- of the increases have been eaten up by mandatory salary increases. So if the state intends to meet the court's standard, the districts contend, it has to spend about 22 percent more than it does now, regardless of whatever increases it may have made in years past. 
 In a move that closely parallels the New York case, Kentucky districts are asking a judge to dictate how much money should be spent on education, bringing the courts into an area that has traditionally been left to the Legislature. Perhaps not surprisingly, lawmakers in both states have had similar reactions. 
 ''We vehemently oppose the idea or the concept that a court could order us to spend a specific amount of money,'' said David L. Williams, president of the Kentucky State Senate, pointing out that school spending was up to lawmakers. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki's lawyers in New York have made much the same argument, but the court-appointed panel effectively dismissed it last week. Exactly how Justice Leland DeGrasse, the State Supreme Court judge overseeing the case, will rule is still unknown, but he is widely expected to follow the suggestions of the panel, which he appointed. 
 At Breathitt High, tucked among the flat-topped mountains here, test scores have been gaining momentum in the past few years. Still, fewer than one in five students are proficient or better in math and social studies. The figures are a little better in reading and science, but only slightly: fewer than one in four.
 ''We're doing better, but obviously we live in a depressed area where there aren't a lot of jobs,'' said Joseph Beder, the Breathitt principal, who has watched the demand for coal miners dwindle. ''They don't see a job waiting for them when they graduate. They don't see that there's going to be any immediate gratification out there.''
 Breathitt's students say they are pretty content with their education, though they certainly don't think more money would hurt. As it is, Breathitt spent only about three-quarters of the state average per pupil in the 2002-03 school year, and the students say it shows in the outdated titles they have in the library and in the rough condition of the books. Some of the teachers complain about their salaries and quit, the students say, but they figure that probably happens everywhere else, too. 
 Mr. Beder said he would welcome more money, if for nothing else than to lower the size of some of his core classes. But would more money necessarily raise test scores, reduce the number of dropouts, send more students to college?
 ''I don't know if more money would make the difference or not, to be honest,'' he said. 
 For all of Kentucky's struggles, the strides it has made would be welcome in New York, said Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that brought the lawsuit that led the court to order more education aid for New York City. As long as measurable progress is being made, he said, the public's willingness to put money into the schools will continue. Without it, he said, support for the schools will be in short supply. 
 ''In a way, it's an incentive,'' Mr. Rebell said. ''The city's going to have to put up or shut up.''

HEADLINE: Anxiety for an American Family

BYLINE: By ARIEL HART

DATELINE: ADAIRSVILLE, GA. 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, Carolyn Richard of Adairsville, Ga., walked into Shaw Industries in nearby Cartersville and asked for a job application. She needed to leave high school to support her two toddlers, and she had a cousin who worked at Shaw, which is based in Dalton, Ga., and is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
 ''I was just looking for a job,'' said the soft-spoken Ms. Richard, now 39, who still laughs in disbelief at getting her first and only job. ''They called me like in the next week. I couldn't believe it.'' 
 Now, she makes $14.39 an hour, after starting at $4.98 an hour, and works 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. She is trained in various carpet making tasks: creeling, where she makes sure the yarn stays spooled; operating the carpet-making machines; and mending.
 Those toddlers are now grown women, and one of them, Katrina, 22, also works in a textile mill. A third daughter, Shondrecka, is 16 and a junior in high school. Ms. Richard reared them all in Adairsville, population 2,542, where five years ago she bought a modestly furnished trailer home. She lives there with her husband, William Ingram, 40, who is unemployed. 
 They have a 1997 Mitsubishi Galant. Their desktop computer, where children in her extended family play Internet games, has a pink mouse with a transparent tip. Pictures of her children and framed poems line the walls.
 She has been thinking of taking computer classes nearby, but it would be hard to leave town for a computer job elsewhere, even to move an hour south to Atlanta. As she steps out her door, she points across the street and the lush grass to the trailers of several relatives and to her wooden childhood home, just a stone's throw away, where her mother still lives. 
 On a recent Sunday afternoon, she sat at her kitchen table watching her daughters Melindy, 23, and Shondrecka lounge on puffy couches in her living room, playing with a cousin's 2-year-old daughter. Her son-in-law stopped by. He left work in the mills for better pay in heating and air-conditioning, but her sister, brother-in-law and several cousins still work in textiles.
 Just as Ms. Richard's parents wished that she had gone to college instead of the textile mills, Ms. Richard wishes Katrina, her middle daughter, had gone to college. ''She would have done better,'' she said. Still, the family ''has come a long way,'' she said. Ms. Richard's mother was a hotel maid, and her father had a variety of manual labor jobs; neither went to high school. Her grandparents farmed nearby.
 Ms. Richard has a G.E.D. thanks to Shaw, which arranged for free classes at the plant, and gave the graduates gowns, class rings and a ceremony. The company also provides medical, dental and vision insurance, and a 401(k) retirement plan. ''They care,'' Ms. Richard said. If she studied computer programming, the company might subsidize the training if it led to work there, she said.
 After 20 years of manual labor, she said working with computers would be a welcome change. ''I got a little too old to be in textiles,'' she said. ''It's a lot of hard work.'' What is more, a pall falls over her and her co-workers when they hear of plant closings that have cost the state 1,000 textile jobs in the last year. Jobs in Georgia's textile and apparel industries have fallen to 84,000 from 149,000 in 1994, the Georgia Department of Labor said.
 ''Sometimes we get worried and think maybe they're going to close us down,'' Ms. Richard said. ''A lot of places have been closing and moving to another country.''

HEADLINE: Talk of a Bubble as Venture Capitalists Flock to China

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
LATELY, a joke has been making the rounds among Silicon Valley venture capitalists: these days, you're far more likely to run into a colleague at a hotel bar in Beijing or Shanghai than at a local haunt in Northern California. 
 The joke has the ring of truth. These days, venture investors say, it is hardly possible to step into the business-class cabin of a flight from San Francisco to China without running into at least a couple of competitors. 
 Gerard H. Langeler, a partner in the Portland, Ore., office of the OVP venture partnership, confesses that he is frightened when he contemplates all those trips to China. ''It's a scary thing because you worry the bubble phenomenon is moving five years later to a different locale,'' he said. 
 Venture capitalists are focusing on China partly because they are sitting on more money than they could possibly invest in American-based start-ups. Collectively, venture firms in the United States have on hand $64 billion, according to the research firm VentureOne, yet they are investing only about $5 billion a quarter.
 Investors, who are focusing on semiconductor, telecommunications and Internet start-ups, also want to tap China's potential to provide outsourcing services to the companies already in their portfolios. 
 But mainly, venture capitalists are hauling themselves across 16 time zones because of successes like 51job Inc. The company, a Shanghai-based provider of integrated human resource services in China, went public on the Nasdaq on Sept. 30. 
 Doll Capital Management, based in Menlo Park, Calif., invested $14 million in 51job in early 2000. Today that investment is worth more than $260 million and represents the largest return in the firm's history, said David Chao, a Doll Capital founding partner.
 Doll Capital was among the first American-based venture firms to invest in China-based start-ups. ''Statistically speaking, it's still better to invest in the U.S., no question,'' said Mr. Chao, who figures that he travels to China an average of every six weeks. ''But if you have access to good deal flow in China, and if you have the right experience, the rewards are large.'' 
 At the same time, many unhappy endings may lie ahead. Mr. Chao wonders whether the newcomers will demonstrate patience -- a trait not normally associated with venture capitalists -- or impetuously pursue the next 51job. In the process, they may learn the hard way that China is a very different from anywhere else on earth as a place to do business.
 ''I think of China as the wild, wild West,'' said Mr. Chao, an ethnic Chinese who was reared in Japan. ''Business law has only been in practice for the last 10 years. There are all these fundamental issues that have yet to be resolved. What rights does a shareholder have in China? There's also this significant cultural gap.'' 
 Mr. Chao is convinced that in time, many venture capitalists will wish they had remained closer to home. ''There's definitely a bit of a lemming effect going on here,'' he said. ''A lot of these guys will end up getting burned.''
 Jing Huang, managing director of the Softbank Asia Infrastructure fund, is inclined to agree. Mr. Huang was born and reared in China, and earned his B.A. in Beijing. He earned an M.A. from Stanford University and an M.B.A. from Harvard. 
 He distinguishes between venture capitalists like himself who are based in China, though they are investing foreign dollars, and those he calls the ''traveling V.C.'s,'' whose offices are thousands of miles away. (A third category, the local venture capitalist investing local money, is almost nonexistent, Mr. Huang and others said.) 
 ''You can hear the difference between the two groups,'' Mr. Huang said. ''The traveling V.C. whose interest is only recent sees the positive side of things a lot more than we do. They tend to underestimate some of the difficulties of doing business here. They look at Nasdaq and see 51job and decide they should invest.'' 
 The traveling venture capitalist is also inclined to pay American prices for an ownership stake in a Chinese start-up, despite the difficulties of doing business in a country where intellectual property laws are still a work in progress, where private banks are still rare and where regulatory requirements are far more onerous than in the United States.
 ''In recent months, we've needed to walk away from some deals because the traveling V.C.'s are getting involved, and they are willing to pay too much,'' Mr. Huang said. That is especially true, he added, when a start-up is led by a Chinese national who has spent time in the United States. 
 ''They know how to do a very good presentation for the traveling V.C.'s,'' Mr. Huang said.
 Not everyone is inclined to think the worst of the new jet-setting investors. Chang Sun, a venture capitalist at Warburg Pincus Asia in Hong Kong and founder of the China Venture Capital Association, said that most of the venture capitalists who have recently discovered China are ''sort of window-shopping -- people are still mainly looking and talking.'' Unlike Mr. Huang, who is based in Beijing, Mr. Sun, who is based in Hong Kong, has not seen a spike in the price that venture capitalists apply to local start-ups.
 ''Chinese companies are holding out for higher valuations,'' Mr. Sun said, ''but so far we're not seeing actual deals done in such a way that we're seeing inflated, crazy prices. Not yet at least.'' 
 Yet venture capitalists are likely to be encouraged by their American investors, called limited partners or L.P.'s, to start making deals. ''China is the hot place to invest now, and I'm sure there's all this pressure from L.P.'s for some of the funds to start investing in China,'' said Michael J. Scown, the regional counsel for Intel Capital's Asian operations. 
 The newcomers are trying to strike a balance between excitement and caution. ''We're learning,'' said John Zagula, a venture capitalist with Ignition Partners in Bellevue, Wash., who made his first trip to China this summer. ''We think China is a giant market, and we feel it's our responsibility to learn more. But our general approach is to think hard, be deliberate.'' 
 Apparently that is the message that Chinese authorities are trying to communicate when venture capitalists visit their country. Terry Garnett, a founding partner at Garnett & Helfrich Capital, a venture firm based in Menlo Park, Calif., was part of a Silicon Valley Bank contingent that met with local officials and corporate leaders in Beijing and Shanghai in June.
 Mr. Garnett said: ''The message we all got was: 'Look, we want you to do business here, we need you, you bring capital and technical expertise and management experience and all these things. But be patient. Learn to work with us over the next few years.''' 
 Yet even patience cannot overcome some problems, starting with geography. The venture capitalist who visits a portfolio company once a week is likely to sense when something is wrong. But how can you tell if a start-up is suffering serious problems when your office is half a globe away? 
 ''The problem with the traveling V.C. is they come here for only one or two weeks and then they leave,'' Mr. Huang said. ''That style of investing doesn't work in the U.S. or in European countries, so I'm not sure why people think China is supposed to be the exception.'' 
 Still, Larry Chang, a venture capitalist at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass., said he believed that the sudden interest in China would be a boon for American venture capitalists no matter what the fate of those who have only recently discovered this great new frontier. 
 ''There's a massive overhang of capital raised but not yet deployed in the U.S.,'' said Mr. Chang, a Chinese-American who has visited China as a venture capitalist once a year since 2001, but has not yet invested there. ''If money is deployed in China, whether people make money on China or whether they don't, it takes pressure off the investment environment here and gives us another path for some of that overhang to be spent down.''

HEADLINE: From Bentonville to Beijing and Beyond

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
MORE than a decade ago, Wal-Mart set its sights on conquering the globe with a mix of cheaply produced goods, discount prices and aggressive store growth. Using that formula, the company has become the dominant retailing force in the United States, but its experience overseas, which began in earnest in 1991, has been checkered.
 Wal-Mart has stores in Argentina, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico and South Korea -- as well as a nearly 40 percent stake in Seiyu, a Japanese retailer. It also owns stores in Puerto Rico. 
 The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., likes to celebrate its international flavor at its annual shareholder meeting by having foreign workers get up and lead the Wal-Mart cheer (''Give me a W!'') in Korean, Spanish or Portuguese.
 But analysts say there is not always something to cheer about. In some places, Wal-Mart can be called a success story, at least for the time being. In others, the ''Wal-Mart way'' has barely gotten off the ground. 
 Cultural obstacles on both sides of the relationship are often the reason; products that sell out quickly in American stores may simply clog the shelves abroad, and there can be built-in resistance to the encroachment of an American company on local business. Also, big, deep-pocketed companies like the French retailer Carrefour can be powerful competitors.
 Then there are political and labor issues. Although it is known for being anti-union, Wal-Mart gave way to Chinese pressure -- and law -- last month and said it would allow its workers in China to unionize.
 ''It's a mixed bag out there for Wal-Mart,'' said Steve Spiwak, an economist with Retail Forward, a research and consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio, that counts Wal-Mart among its clients. ''Their problems have been trying to transplant their stores without molding them to local customs.''
 Not surprisingly, the company disagrees with that assessment. ''I'd say we have a good story to tell'' about international operations, said Bill Wirtz, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. Pointing to economic difficulties in countries like Argentina and Germany, he added, ''It's a measure of our success that we've survived.'' In fact, he said, the international unit has grown more in its 13-year history than the Wal-Mart chain, which began in 1962, grew in its first 13 years. ''It's a growing part of the business,'' he said of the foreign operations.
 Mr. Spiwak said that an early miss was Indonesia, where Wal-Mart began trying to build a business in 1996. Indonesians turned up their noses at the brightly lighted, highly organized stores, he said, and because no haggling was permitted, considered them overpriced. A year later, Wal-Mart packed up and left.
 In Argentina and Brazil, an apparent ignorance of local preferences regarding cuts of beef alienated many potential customers, Mr. Spiwak added. And in Germany, shoppers gave a cold shoulder to the greeters that Wal-Mart uses to lend a friendly atmosphere to its sprawling American stores. ''It was viewed as too friendly and disruptive, invading their space,'' he said. 
 International sales made up 18.5 percent of the $256.3 billion Wal-Mart took in last year, and international operating profit of $2.37 billion was 15.8 percent of the total. In general, the discounter has had better luck by purchasing foreign chains and turning them into Wal-Marts than by building a business from scratch. 
 Growth abroad is increasingly important to Wal-Mart, said Burt Flickinger III, a retail consultant who has followed the company for years. ''As efforts to block Wal-Mart stores in the continental United States continue, Wal-Mart desperately needs to be successful in South America and in southern Asia,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Social Security in the Real World

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A False Start on Social Security'' (editorial, Dec. 3):
 It seems that every program and initiative the president supports coincidentally ends up transferring large sums of money to special interests. Privatizing Social Security is no different. 
 Privatization will significantly enrich the financial industry through investment fees. Privatization will bring trillions of dollars into the stock market. 
 We can expect to see stock prices increase because of supply and demand. Current investors should see big increases in the value of their portfolios but without any increase in the real value of the companies they own. 
 For stockholders in the short term, this will increase their wealth. For the rest of America, this condition is called inflation.
 The press needs to investigate the Bush administration's true motives. It would be shameful if Social Security were trashed because a handful of people saw it as a way to increase the value of their stock portfolios.

HEADLINE: Understanding the Hidden Costs

BYLINE: As told to Jane L. Levere

 BODY:

Linda C. Drake is chairwoman and founder of TCIM Services, a call-center service provider based in Wilmington, Del.
 We have established joint ventures in Canada, India and the Philippines, one in each country. Today, 2 percent of our business is offshore; it's not generating a lot more than 2 percent of revenue or profit.
 My clients think they could save 40 percent in customer service costs by outsourcing, but the actual savings are 30 percent in India and the Philippines, and 20 percent in Canada.
 Their estimates are too high because you have travel considerations; you have to have people who are going to be there, managing and deploying the technology. Then you have to have quality control in place to maintain the standard. In the meantime, you've got training and retraining, and then you've got language certification. Trying to learn the colloquialisms, the American slang, takes time. And this is part of the hidden costs that companies are overlooking. And the savings must be balanced against the risks of potentially losing customers due to a lack of conversational skills.
 Do I feel badly when people lose jobs because of outsourcing? Of course I do. I'm a human being, first and foremost, but I feel very strongly that we have got to step up and meet this challenge, working in a global economy.
 While there will be plenty of business to go offshore, I believe that American companies will always provide American customer service because they can't find enough qualified people overseas. And then you have language barriers that truly can't be overcome. 
 For example, in India and the Philippines, they can speak English, and it's the accent, cultural and interpretive understanding that gets in the way. When you go to countries like China, where they can't speak English, then you've got other, huge barriers. As told to Jane L. Levere

HEADLINE: U.S. Automakers See China As the Land of Opportunity

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
AMERICAN automakers see China as the world's biggest growth opportunity, even though the country's auto sales boom has slowed in 2004. 
 Despite the slowdown, China propelled General Motors' Asian operations to earn more than G.M.'s three other geographic regions combined in the third quarter. While that was partly a sign of the company's struggles in the brutally competitive landscape in North America and Europe, it also explained the industry's bullishness on China. 
 Auto sales grew more slowly in China mainly because the government took steps to temper the overheated economy, including tightening credit policies and reducing its own vehicle purchases. Sales of cars and small sport utility vehicles, which rose more than 80 percent in 2003, are expected to rise less than 20 percent this year. 
 Auto executives said this cooling was expected and necessary, and would not diminish the long-term allure of China. Analysts are forecasting stronger, if less overheated, numbers next year. 
 ''The long-term fundamentals still remain very positive,'' said G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, G. Richard Wagoner Jr., during his company's quarterly earnings conference call in October. ''Coming off the boil in the near term is not necessarily a bad thing. The last thing in the world we want is this market to overheat and go through a boom-bust cycle.''
 Ken Zino, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company, said, ''We haven't changed our position that it is a significant and growing market.''
 Despite the sales boom in recent years, only a minority of the Chinese population own cars. Chinese vehicle sales, including passenger cars and larger vehicles like vans and buses, are expected to reach about 5 million this year, less than one-third the more than 17 million vehicles sold in the United States. Some analysts predict that sales in China will as much as double by the end of the decade. 
 In addition, automakers see potential for fatter profits as the country's expanding middle class trades up from small cars, like a popular version of the Volkswagen Jetta sold in China, to somewhat larger, higher-margin vehicles, like the Volkswagen Passat or the Buick Regal. 
 ''A lot of people buying Jettas will upgrade in two or three years,'' said Yale Zhang, an analyst at CSM Worldwide. ''This is a big mainland country so they like something bigger, but not so much bigger like the Ford F-150 -- some reasonable big sizes.''
 Paul Ballew, the chief industry sales analyst for G.M., said: ''As vehicles become more affordable, people are buying up. In the U.S., that's the growth of the luxury vehicles. In China, it's growth in midsized sedans'' and larger small cars, he said. 
 If China represents a huge growth opportunity, it is far from unfettered. Foreign automakers are required to pair up with domestic companies, a situation complicated by accusations of piracy against some Chinese companies. For example, the Chery Automobile Company, one of China's largest automakers, has been accused of mimicking the designs of General Motors and Volkswagen. Demand from China's rapidly growing industries is also driving up prices of commodities like steel, increasing automakers' costs. 
 And from a regulatory standpoint, China is another pressure point on the industry to produce cleaner cars. This year, the Chinese government imposed its first fuel economy regulations, a development that automakers greeted unenthusiastically. 
 Buying cars on credit is in a nascent state in China, and foreign automakers are just now setting up lending operations. The government is also faced with soaring fatalities as the number of automobiles increases, a situation that could lead to more regulation. 
 Still, the allure involves more than sales. China is the new Mexico: Labor costs are a tiny fraction of those in the United States -- low enough that they are putting pressure even on plants in Mexico.
 If Chinese cars are not yet being exported, auto parts are, and suppliers around the world are facing the choice of shifting at least some of their operations to China or no longer being competitive. And the labor pool is not limited to factory workers. 
 ''Our pool of available talent gets much deeper if we think globally,'' said J.T. Battenberg III, the chairman and chief executive of the Delphi Corporation, one of the largest auto suppliers, in a speech this year.
 Delphi has been rapidly expanding its operations in China and recently broke ground on a research and development center in Shanghai.
 ''China's Ministry of Education reported 700,000 engineering and technology graduates last year,'' said Mr. Battenberg, adding that ''the U.S. graduates only 62,000 engineers each year.''
 With the United States hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs, it is no surprise that union leaders do not share his enthusiasm. 
 ''With the rise of China as a major auto-producing country, being competitive means compensation as low as a dollar an hour, no independent union rights and broad government intimidation of the pursuit of workers' legal rights,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union, in a recent speech. ''These conditions have become the new standard of competition for companies around the world, to the detriment of workers everywhere.''

HEADLINE: Britain: Success With a Supercenter, But the Encores May Be Limited

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart's operations in Britain have been one of the company's most rousing international success stories, but the options for growth here are shrinking. 
 Wal-Mart bought the British supermarket chain Asda in 1999 and quickly began outperforming the competition by applying more efficient supply-chain economics and by stripping costs out of the stores. Profits doubled in three years, and continue to rise. Last year, sales grew 9.8 percent, to $:13.1 billion ($25.5 billion at the current exchange rates). But expansion options are limited in some cases by Britain's tough Competition Commission. 
 Last year, Wal-Mart tried to buy the British supermarket chain Safeway, but was rebuffed by regulators who argued that the company already controlled enough of the market. Building stores is more difficult in Britain -- as in most of Europe -- than in the United States, because of more stringent zoning and planning regulations. 
 Still, there is room to grow in the nonfood area. Last year, Asda opened its first Asda Wal-Mart Supercentre, which sells food, clothing and home products, much like the Wal-Mart supercenters in the United States. The company reconfigured a Wal-Mart site by adding a mezzanine. 
 Sales have been so good that the company plans to open six more of the stores in Britain. ''The first store is very, very impressive,'' said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at M&M Planet Retail in London. ''Performance is ahead of expectations.'' Wal-Mart has also opened six stand-alone George shops, which sell the company's low-price George clothing line. 
 But if Britain, where Wal-Mart has 272 stores, is the company's success story, Germany, where it has 92 stores, remains its Achilles' heel. The company promises that the German business will break even this year, but, Mr. Roberts said, ''They've said they were going to break even every year for the past five, and haven't.'' 
 The wrong acquisitions, stringent union demands and government-regulated shopping hours have held down the company sales in Germany. Disappointments there have taught Wal-Mart valuable lessons, Mr. Roberts said, including the importance of ''having local management, and keeping Wal-Mart behind the scenes.'' 
 Wal-Mart has made little secret of its desire to expand into the rest of Europe, particularly into France or Italy, but has so far been unable to cement a deal.

HEADLINE: City Locks In Space for Ads In Preparation For Olympics

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
New York's Olympic organizers have reserved almost all outdoor advertising space in the city -- some 600,000 billboards, subway signs and the like -- for the 2012 Summer Games, part of an unprecedented marketing plan that includes roving squads of ''brand enforcement agents'' to prevent others from profiting from unauthorized ads tied to the Olympics.
 NYC2012, the group coordinating the city's Olympic bid, struck deals in November with nine billboard companies, as well as several city agencies and public authorities, which together control 95 percent of outdoor advertising venues. 
 The agreements, in the form of options guaranteeing the right to buy the space if needed, came shortly after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed an executive order creating a special board to crack down on ''ambush marketing'' by advertisers who are not official Olympic sponsors.
 The steps are intended to convince the International Olympic Committee and its corporate sponsors that New York, which has played up its reputation as the world's media capital in its bid to hold the 2012 Games, can adequately police its sprawling and unruly advertising landscape. 
 Not one of the four other cities vying for the Games comes close to matching the marketing potential, and risks, of outdoor advertising in New York. 
 Money from companies that buy Olympic sponsorships makes it possible to put on the Olympics, said Gretchen Dykstra, the city's commissioner of consumer affairs.
 ''We're not just talking about protecting the interests of the sponsors, but ensuring that the people of New York can even get the Olympics,'' she said.
 Sponsorships, whose terms typically begin several years before the Games even start, can cost millions of dollars, an investment sometimes undercut by nonsponsors looking to associate themselves with the Olympics through unauthorized ad campaigns.
 But the city's efforts to tame the media beast may not be enough to satisfy the Olympic committee.
 That is because the committee requires that host cities, in addition to locking up all available outdoor advertising space for Olympic sponsors, guarantee that prices charged to those sponsors will be capped ''at 2004 rates adjusted solely for inflation.''
 Deep in the 562-page bid package it submitted last month, New York revealed that it failed to meet that requirement, and could promise only that the cost of ad space would be based on the average of rates from 2007 to 2010, plus a 20 percent premium and an inflationary adjustment.
 The organizers said those terms were the best they could negotiate with the private outdoor advertising companies. Paris, Madrid and Moscow each reported that they had met the committee's rate cap, which is intended to prevent price gouging. London has not made available for public inspection the portion of its bid package dealing with advertising.
 New York's organizers insist their proposal meets the spirit, if not the letter, of the bid requirements, and that any concerns about advertising costs are easily balanced against the extraordinary opportunity afforded to sponsors.
 ''They've never been in a city on the scale of New York, with the kind of maturity of the advertising market we have here, the level of signage, the vibrancy of it,'' said Jay L. Kriegel, executive director of NYC2012.
 Still, said Mr. Kriegel, ''there is a flip side to this being the largest media and marketing environment in the world.''
 The double-edged nature of New York's supercharged advertising market has only recently become an issue for Olympic organizers, who have viewed it primarily as a way to get a leg up in the competition. 
 The portion of New York's bid package that outlines its marketing strategy opens with glossy photographs of Times Square in all its flashy potential, as if to say, ''Imagine your Olympic insignia here!''
 Advertising on billboards and electronic signs in Midtown Manhattan is the most expensive in the world, marketing executives say. Monthly rates for outdoor displays in Times Square range from $30,000 to $250,000, and a single panel on the side of a telephone kiosk runs from $1,000 to $2,000.
 New York's bid documents say that organizers expect ''a record $822 million in local and domestic sponsorships'' for the 2012 Summer Games, and they assure the committee that the city will use ''all of its resources to protect the value of Olympic sponsors and the rights of Olympic marketing partners.''
 To do that, the mayor has authorized an Enforcement Board on Olympic Brand Protection to ''recruit and train auxiliary Olympic brand enforcement agents,'' run a special city hot line to field complaints about ambush marketing and counterfeiting of Olympic-related goods, and seek legislation to increase fines for violators.
 Ms. Dykstra said such a commitment on behalf of commercial sponsors was needed to bolster New York's chances of being selected.
 ''In New York, which is so iconic in its signage, this posed a real challenge to us,'' she said. ''It was a matter of getting the tiger by the tail.''
 ''All of this is based on the fact that the Olympic sponsors are responsible for making it possible to build these Olympic venues,'' she said. ''We're not just talking about protecting the interests of the sponsors, but ensuring that the people of New York can even get the Olympics.''
 Meeting the concerns of corporate sponsors is a priority of the International Olympic Committee, which has fielded complaints from companies in the past that the value of their Olympic investments were diluted by unapproved ad campaigns from nonsponsors trying to associate themselves with the Games.
 The complaints began in earnest following the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, said Jed Pearsall, president of Performance Research, a marketing analysis firm based in London and Newport, R.I.
 Polling by his firm found that while American television viewers that year seemed to be aware that Visa and McDonald's were official sponsors, many of those same viewers believed, wrongly, that competing credit card and fast food companies were also sponsors. 
 Conflicts over sponsorship grew during the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, where Samsung, not an official sponsor, set up shop in a parking area on the outskirts of Centennial Olympic Park.
 As a result, Mr. Pearsall said, the committee has placed more demands on bid cities to guarantee protections for sponsors, and New York has tried to comply through its unusual long-term agreements with the billboard companies, backed by promises of support from the city.
 ''Having that component in place is extremely important,'' Mr. Pearsall said. ''For the people in New York, I believe it's mostly to create the impression they have everything under control for the I.O.C.''
 Under the terms of NYC2012's agreement with the outdoor advertising companies, 5,000 billboards and 13,000 telephone kiosks will be available to Olympic sponsors beginning in 2009.
 In addition, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the city transportation department have agreed to offer 580,000 advertising spots on buses, subways, light poles and newsstands, and at the airports. 
 Should the city not get the Olympics, it would surrender those advertising rights, which were secured by NYC2012, a group financed by private donations.
 Agreeing to the rate limits, even if they are higher than what the committee requested, did not come naturally for the media companies involved. Richard Schaps, chairman of Van Wagner Communications, said his first reaction when told what the bid organizers wanted was, ''What is this, communism?''
 ''But if we want the Olympics to come, all of us have to cooperate within the realm of legitimacy, and to price-gouge is not what we're looking to do,'' Mr. Schaps said. ''The rate has got a premium in there. But it's a reasonable one. My attitude is, I'm a New Yorker, and it would be fabulous to see the Olympics here.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary Is Likely to Leave Soon

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to replace John W. Snow as treasury secretary and has been looking closely at a number of possible replacements, including the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., Republicans with ties to the White House say.
 With the White House having said on Friday that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld would stay on for Mr. Bush's second term, Mr. Snow is the only secretary at a major cabinet department whose fate has not been publicly addressed. Administration officials and advisers had been signaling for weeks that Mr. Snow was likely to depart eventually but left open the possibility that he might stay on well into next year. 
 But in recent days, administration officials have been hinting that Mr. Snow will go sooner rather than later. And an adviser to the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said on Sunday that a firm decision had been made to replace Mr. Snow as soon as Mr. Bush could settle on a successor. 
 Mr. Bush has already announced plans to thoroughly overhaul his cabinet. Eight cabinet secretaries, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft, have announced their resignations, and more, like Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary, are expected to go in the next week or two. 
 Treasury secretary is a high-profile job, and one likely to be especially prominent in the next few years if Mr. Bush makes good on his pledge to press for big changes to Social Security and a rethinking of the tax code.
 The White House has announced plans for an economic forum on Dec. 15 and 16 in Washington to focus attention on the president's second-term agenda, and administration officials have made no secret of their belief that they need a reconstituted economic team to sell Mr. Bush's plan on Capitol Hill and to voters.
 Conservative interest groups and some other Republicans in Washington have been pressing the White House to consider Phil Gramm, the former Republican senator from Texas who was an economics professor before getting into politics.
 The adviser to the White House said Mr. Gramm was under consideration, but that the prospects of him getting the job were unclear. Mr. Gramm is currently an executive with UBS, a securities firm.
 Mr. Card, who was transportation secretary under the president's father, has been at Mr. Bush's side almost every working moment for four years, having been appointed chief of staff even before the disputed 2000 election was settled.
 It was Mr. Card who whispered into Mr. Bush's ear on Sept. 11, 2001, that the nation was under a terrorist attack, and since then he has had a hand in nearly every big political and policy decision made by the White House.
 Mr. Bush announced immediately after Election Day that Mr. Card would stay on as chief of staff, but Mr. Card is said by some Republicans to be very interested in the treasury job. Mr. Bush has already nominated several loyalists in White House staff positions to top cabinet posts, including Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, as secretary of state, and Alberto R. Gonzales, who would shift to attorney general from White House counsel.
 Republicans who have spoken to administration officials said other candidates are also being considered to replace Mr. Snow, including Gerald L. Parsky, a wealthy lawyer and venture capitalist who served as an assistant treasury secretary in the Ford administration. 
 It is not clear how close Mr. Bush is to a decision on a replacement for Mr. Snow or if he has already made one. 
 Mr. Snow, an economist and formal railroad executive who was named treasury secretary two years ago after Mr. Bush ousted Paul H. O'Neill from the job, has deflected all questions in recent weeks about a possible departure, with he and his aides saying he serves at the pleasure of the president.
 ''The secretary views his service to the president as an honor and a privilege,'' said Robert Nichols, Mr. Snow's spokesman. Mr. Nichols added, ''We don't comment on personnel speculation and rumors.''
 As speculation that Mr. Snow will leave has intensified, the White House, when asked about him by reporters, has pointedly declined to give him a public vote of confidence.
 Mr. Snow has been a workhorse for the White House this year, selling Mr. Bush's economic plan nationwide during the presidential campaign and to Congress during legislative battles.
 But he upset some White House officials with a remark this fall in Ohio, the most important battleground of the campaign and a state that had suffered especially intense economic woes in recent years, that job losses were a myth. 
 Mr. Snow later said he had been misinterpreted.
 Under Mr. Bush, economic policy has been made largely within the White House, and cabinet secretaries, including Mr. Snow, have been primarily salesmen. But the president's plans for revising Social Security and the tax code give the next treasury secretary a chance to put an imprint on two of the most important economic issues facing the nation. 
 Mr. Bush plans to appoint a commission this month to suggest changes to the tax code and to deliver a report to the treasury secretary next year. Under Mr. Bush's plan, the treasury secretary would then make recommendations to the White House on how to proceed.

HEADLINE: Marines' Raids Underline Push In Crucial Area

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: MAHMUDIYA, Iraq, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
For marines staging a night raid on suspected rebel hide-outs across this insurgent heartland outside Baghdad, heading out of their heavily fortified base at midnight on Friday was a moment to make sinews stiffen.
 Clearing the base's maze of dirt-filled blast barriers, Marine Strike Force Two, in a convoy of unlit Humvees, entered some of Iraq's deadliest terrain. Through dark towns and roads, dense palm groves and heaves of broken earth offered potential attackers ample cover. Men standing through Humvee roofs with night-vision goggles scanned the landscape for impending ambushes and roadside bombs.
 In the 10 weeks since their battalion began operating in this area south of Baghdad, raids like this one by Strike Force Two have captured more than 250 people identified as suspected insurgents. Others, fleeing or resisting, have been killed. 
 The raids have taken an American toll, too. Since late September, the Second Battalion of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit has lost eight men. It has deployed in what has become, since November's battle for Falluja, one of the war's most crucial battle zones, some American officers would say its ground zero.
 If American objectives in Iraq are to be achieved, commanders say, it is on small, closely knit units like Strike Force Two, with 32 men, and on the raids they stage almost nightly, that success may ultimately depend.
 The primary mission of the 2/24 battalion, a Chicago-based Reserve force of 1,200 troops, is to destroy a network of insurgent cells that United States military intelligence has identified as the nerve center of the Sunni insurgency in central Iraq.
 Until its capture last month, Falluja, 40 miles northwest of here, served as the insurgents' main fortress. Denying Falluja to the rebels as a sanctuary, American commanders believe, was a crucial first step toward regaining the initiative in the war. But according to American officers, months of intensive intelligence work have shown that Falluja served as a forward base for an insurgency that finds its enduring heartland here -- in the powerful tribal families at its core, in uncompromising loyalties to Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party, and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of hidden munitions. The American commanders call the area, 25 miles wide and 50 miles deep between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, the ''throat of Baghdad.''
 Commanders acknowledge that forces reaching Baghdad after the invasion last year understood little of the tribal underpinnings of Mr. Hussein's power -- a social, economic, religious and political matrix that was transformed, after his overthrow, into a platform for underground resistance. While much about the insurgency remains obscure, the commanders are convinced now that much that is crucial to rebel operations is centered in this troubled region south of the capital.
 At intelligence briefings in the former chicken factory that serves as the 2/24's forward operating base outside Mahmudiya, American officers ran laser pointers across a satellite map showing towns like Rashid, Yusufiya, Mahmudiya, Latifiya, Iskandariya, Haswa and Musayyib, saying interrogations of captured Iraqis have shown that these towns, and a score of outlying villages, mostly lying to the west of Highway 1, the four-lane highway connecting Baghdad to the south, are the key to many insurgent attacks mounted much farther afield, including bombings and kidnappings in the capital.
 The focus of the marines' attention has been on two powerful tribal families, the Janabis and the Kargoulis, feudal overlords of much of the land between the rivers that the 2/24 marines now patrol. 
 Under Mr. Hussein, the Janabis and the Kargoulis were richly rewarded. Their area was the base for Republican Guard units, munitions factories, weapons research establishments and battlefield testing grounds, as well as a host of new industrial plants and depots. After the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when a Shiite uprising across southern Iraq was met with brutal repression, parts of the area around Mahmudiya, Latifiya and Iskandariya, where Sunnis and Shiites mixed were subjected to a form of ethnic cleansing, with Shiites of military age rounded up and shot and their houses bulldozed to make way for new Sunni homes.

Stalwarts of Insurgency
 After Mr. Hussein's downfall, American intelligence officers believe, powerful elements in the Janabi and Kargouli families became stalwarts of the resistance, and an insurgent axis developed that turned the region south of Baghdad into a powerful support base for the insurgent stronghold in Falluja.
 The tribes' most powerful figure, Sheik Abdullah al-Janabi, serving as the chief imam in the Mahmudiya mosque in Falluja, emerged as the effective leader of the insurgency in central Iraq. Shortly before American troops overran the mosque, he fled the city.
 One of his brothers, Mehdi, made his power base in Yusufiya, a town that has been a center of the insurgency. Mehdi, too, is a fugitive, probably in Baghdad, American officers say. A third brother, Mahmoud, identified by the American forces as a financier of the insurgency, was detained, and is in Abu Ghraib prison. 
 American forces moved into this area as Baghdad fell, but a shortage of troops, and command decisions that limited offensives, led early this year to a situation in which much of the region became a rebel stronghold. Journeys through it became a deadly lottery, with daily bombings, ambushes and kidnappings.
 Just as the assault on Falluja last month signaled a turn to a more aggressive posture by the United States command, so too has the evolution of American tactics here. Under the 2/24 marines, the policy since September has been to go after the insurgents. New forward bases have been opened in Yusufiya and Latifiya. The marines have conducted regular foot patrols through the towns. Raids on insurgent hide-outs and weapons caches have become routine.
 The marines have fought pitched battles, including one on Nov. 12 at Mullah Fayyad, west of Yusufiya, that began with an insurgent ambush and developed into a fight that lasted more than four hours. Lt. Col. Mark A. Smith, the 2/24's commander, said the rebels were trying to open lines of retreat from Falluja. 
 ''This is where the leadership of the insurgency have always lived, and now that they can't be in Falluja, they've got to come home,'' he said. ''But our rule is, 'You ain't comin' home.'''
 Colonel Smith, 40, an Indiana state trooper in civilian life, is the embodiment of the new, more aggressive approach -- muscular, salty tongued and impatient. ''We're going out where the bad guys live, and we're going to slay them in their ZIP code,'' he said. 
 ''People around here are beginning to believe that the Americans are going to stay and go after the bad guys, and they're not going to leave until the job's been done,'' he added. ''As that sinks in, opinion is swinging to our side.''
 Whether that is true is hard for reporters to gauge, considering that the only approximately safe way to venture into the towns is with a heavily armed Marine foot patrol. Beyond that, it is an axiom of life here that, just as under Mr. Hussein's rule, opinion among Iraqis is intimidation-led. People in the battle zones tend to tell reporters whatever they judge to be safest.
 On an hourlong patrol through Yusufiya, though, some signs seemed to favor the marines. People of all ages approached them, some with complaints about relatives detained or wounded in the fighting, but far more with requests for medical attention, inquiries about reopening schools and clinics, or assistance in finding work. The market in the town, closed when the marines arrived in early October, has reopened.
 When some in a crowd that clustered about the patrol appealed for the Americans to withdraw from the town so the insurgents would attack elsewhere, a debate ensued, rare for American troops anywhere in Iraq.
 ''Saddam didn't harm anybody in Yusufiya; at least he didn't kill anybody who didn't cause trouble,'' said a middle-aged Sunni woman named Fadila. ''In any case, the situation was much safer under Saddam than it is now.''
 The patrol leader, Cpl. Jared Tio, 24, from Franklin, Wis., countered with a set piece of his own.
 ''We want you to live in peace,'' he told her. ''But we need to work together to make this work.''
 Perhaps the most successful of the marines' tactics have been the nighttime raids. With more than 70 police officers in the battalion, the work-up for the raids at the Mahmudiya base has been strongly influenced by American police tactics. Colonel Smith said he attributed much of the unit's success in tracking down wanted insurgents to Warrant Officer Jim Roussell, a 53-year-old Chicago police sergeant who spent years working with the city's gang unit.
 Mr. Roussell, a tall, spare man with a graying crew cut, agreed that tracking down insurgents in Iraq was not so different from hunting down street gang members. ''In both cases, you're dealing with young people who are disenfranchised and angry and pick up weapons,'' he said.
 To identify them, he said, the marines' intelligence unit follows family ties, picks up tips from street patrols and develops ''snitches,'' many of them captured insurgents. 
 ''It's ground-level intelligence, it's patrolling, it's interacting with people,'' he said. ''At base, it's straightforward police work.''
 The raid by Strike Force Two on Friday night was based on a tip from an inmate at Abu Ghraib. The man had identified four brothers in adjacent farmhouses near Mahmudiya as participants in several recent insurgent attacks, including the seizure on Nov. 8 of 12 newly trained men of the Iraqi National Guard near Latifiya.
 The 12 were found dead shortly afterward, machine-gunned against the wall of an abandoned mosque.
 The four brothers fit the profile marines have come to expect of insurgents: Sunni Arabs, with experience in Mr. Hussein's armed forces, followed by government-assigned jobs in local industries, living comfortably off a plot of government-granted land. After their capture, they were handcuffed and loaded onto an armored truck for the ride back to the base.

Protesting Innocence
 There, they were bundled into a detainee-processing center known among the marines as ''the tent of no return,'' electronically fingerprinted, photographed and lined up for an iris-recognition test.
 Throughout the raid, the men protested their innocence, as those rounded up usually do.
 ''America good! England good! Saddam bye-bye!'' said a heavily mustached man who identified himself as Ali, a 14-year veteran of the old Iraqi Army. Around the corner from where he squatted uneasily in his handcuffs, his wife, his mother and his four children sat still amid a tumble of blankets where they were sleeping when the Americans burst through their front door.
 They seemed calm, almost puzzled, by the commotion as the marines went through closets and boxes of documents and assured them that their men would be released if they were found to have no involvement in rebel attacks.
 On Sunday, those assurances were fulfilled when Mr. Roussell, the warrant officer, and others in the intelligence unit at Mahmudiya ordered all four men released, having concluded there was no evidence to justify holding them in the killing of the guardsmen, or any other attack.
 ''It looks like the snitch in Abu Ghraib was acting on a grudge,'' Mr. Roussell said. ''But that's O.K. We're following American principles here, and that means that we've got to be pretty darned sure we've got the right men before we lock them away. We don't want to be sending innocent men to Abu Ghraib.''

HEADLINE: Talk About Scrooge

 BODY:
In November, wages grew a whopping 1 cent an hour. But that was clawed back by a six-minute decline in the average workweek, producing a $1.25 drop in weekly earnings. Coming on the heels of a sluggish start to the holiday shopping season, the Labor Department's latest employment report, released Friday, doesn't presage a particularly merry Christmas or happy New Year for millions of working Americans. 
 In what is becoming a dismally predictable occurrence, the economy produced far fewer jobs than expected last month -- 112,000 new slots versus an expectation of 200,000 -- for the worst new-job total since last July, which was widely characterized as an economic ''soft patch.'' Moreover, job growth in October and September was not as good as once believed. Those monthly numbers, disappointing on their own, reinforce what is now an unmistakable pattern in which the economy grows at a decent pace and corporate profits surge, while wages lag inflation and job creation barely keeps pace with the growth in the labor market. 
 We know how we got here. Tax cuts were misdirected at investment rather than consumption, resulting in an economic recovery weaker than it might have been. The budget deficit portends higher interest rates and a weaker dollar, both of which impair business confidence and, in turn, inhibit hiring. And then there's the lack of affirmative policy on jobs, such as a targeted credit that would make hiring more attractive, or, at the least, an increase in the minimum wage to help the working poor and put money in the economy, fueling consumption that is critical for job growth. 
 Persistent subpar job creation might cause some leaders to question their policies. Yet, more high-end tax cuts and higher deficits are the template for President Bush's second term. And flush with a victory, the president is unlikely to undertake any policy reversals. It will be up to Congress to break out of its lockstep with Mr. Bush and take steps to address the real problems of constituents, rather than the intransigent aspirations of the administration.

HEADLINE: The Successor to Greenspan Has a Very Tough Act to Follow

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Greenspan finally retires from the Federal Reserve, will he leave behind any of his DNA?
 Now in his 18th remarkable year as Fed chairman, the owlish and idiosyncratic Mr. Greenspan is required by law to step down in January 2006.
 Nominating a successor could be President Bush's biggest economic decision next year, given Mr. Greenspan's mythic reputation as the guardian of price stability and economic growth. A big uncertainty is how any successor will extend Mr. Greenspan's approach to monetary policy, which has been as much an art as a science. 
 Though he is famous for poring over reams of often obscure data, Mr. Greenspan, 78, has been outspoken in his skepticism over econometric models. ''Rules by their nature are simple,'' he said at a Fed symposium in August 2003. ''Our problem is not the complexity of our models but the far greater complexity of a world economy whose underlying linkages appear to be in a continual state of flux.''
 A devout believer in anomalies -- trends that conflict with what standard models predict -- he has defied conventional wisdom about the natural level of unemployment, the growth of productivity and the likelihood of inflation. And most of the time, he has been right. 
 ''He is very idiosyncratic,'' said Allen H. Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and longtime historian of the Federal Reserve. ''His greatest weakness is at this point. He had a very successful way of running the Fed, but he doesn't leave a method that somebody else can pick up and carry on.''
 Mr. Greenspan disagrees. Rather than rely on one economic model or another, he told a conference last January, his approach involves risk management -- allowing for a range of economic developments and trying to assess their relative probabilities.
 His authority has become so outsized that any successor may well encounter more market turbulence and more dissent from other members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. ''It's going to have to be less of a one-man show,'' said John H. Makin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
 Speculation on who will succeed Mr. Greenspan has focused on Martin S. Feldstein, a prolific author and former adviser to President Reagan who is now a professor at Harvard University and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass.
 But a growing number of Republicans say that the top candidate may be R. Glenn Hubbard, 46, who was a chief architect of President Bush's tax cutting packages of 2001 and 2003 and is the dean of Columbia University's School of Business.
 Mr. Feldstein, 65, has a formidable reputation as an economist. But he has also displayed a fierce streak of independence that may not sit well with Mr. Bush, who places top value on unflinching loyalty.
 As chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984, Mr. Feldstein angered many White House officials by criticizing the soaring budget deficits that followed the Reagan tax cuts. Mr. Feldstein has refrained from criticizing the deficits under President Bush, and has been an outspoken defender of his tax cuts.
 Mr. Hubbard was chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers in 2001 and 2002. An advocate of bold tax cuts and a longtime student of tax overhauls, Mr. Hubbard's views mesh with those of Mr. Bush, and he was a relentless advocate for Mr. Bush's proposal in 2003 to eliminate taxes on stock dividends. Congress ultimately cut dividend taxes but did not end them. Mr. Bush is expected to seek their elimination next year.
 The Fed chairman plays a major role in the public debate on tax cuts and Social Security. Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Hubbard support the president's two big domestic priorities: to overhaul the tax code and to let people divert some Social Security payroll taxes to private accounts.
 But the next Fed chairman could easily clash with Mr. Bush, as Mr. Greenspan did with Mr. Bush's father. Fed officials are worried about the nation's huge foreign debt and soaring deficits, and a possible sharp drop in the dollar's value. The central bank might feel compelled to raise interest rates faster than expected to attract foreign capital and cool inflationary pressures. 
 But because inflation expectations have declined to almost negligible levels under Mr. Greenspan, his successor will inherit the central bank's credibility, and hence its maneuvering room with investors.
 Mr. Greenspan's legacy will include some permanent changes in how the Fed operates. For one, he has made it far more open than it once was. Under Paul A. Volcker, Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, the Fed never told the public whether it had raised the overnight lending rate, leaving it for traders to figure out themselves.
 Today, officials not only announce their decisions on interest rates; they also hint strongly about their plans for the near future.
 ''There has been a tremendous increase in transparency,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and author of ''A Term at the Fed.'' ''You can argue that that has contributed to good monetary policy.''
 Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor since 1997, said: ''Compared to what the situation was before Greenspan started here, there is much more of a structure today.''
 Mr. Greenspan has also brought changes to the way the Fed crunches its numbers. He has introduced dozens of analytical techniques for teasing out ever more subtle insights from the mass of economic data available.
 The essence of Mr. Greenspan's approach has been to look for exceptions rather than rules. His intuition became the accepted wisdom, but there is no accepted wisdom on how to summon that intuition in the future.

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Expand Arms Program

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

DATELINE: VIENNA, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Nearly two years after international nuclear inspectors were ejected from North Korea, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency says he is now certain that the nuclear material his agency once monitored there has been converted into fuel for four to six nuclear bombs.
 The assessment by the energy agency's chief, Mohamed ElBaradei, in an interview here at its headquarters, aligns with the private assessments of many American intelligence officials. But it goes well beyond anything that the Central Intelligence Agency or President Bush and his aides have said in public. Some Bush administration officials have said they are not eager to update their public assessment of North Korea's abilities, out of a concern that it could create pressure for action -- either greater efforts to force the collapse of the North Korean government, or greater concessions in negotiations, as North Korea has demanded. 
 In the interview, Dr. ElBaradei said his judgment that North Korea had converted its stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium was not based on new intelligence. Instead, he said, it was based on the agency's years of accumulated knowledge of North Korea's abilities, and the amount of time that had passed since North Korea ejected inspectors and began removing the 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods that inspectors had been monitoring.
 ''I'm sure they have reprocessed it all,'' he said. ''We know they have the fissile material,'' he said, a reference to the rods, which can be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium. ''The production process is not that difficult'' to turn the rods into bomb fuel, he said, and now enough time has passed for North Korea to have solved any production problems.
 Until now, the United States has insisted that North Korea has enough nuclear material to make only one or two weapons, based on an estimate made in the early 1990's. Because the United States and the I.A.E.A. have never seen that material or any nuclear weapons, it was an educated guess, and one that has been the subject of considerable behind-the-scenes debate. 
 But it was also assumed that one or two weapons posed relatively little threat: North Korea could not afford to sell its plutonium, or even conduct a nuclear test, if those actions would eradicate its stockpile.
 If Dr. ElBaradei's new estimate is right -- and several American experts interviewed in recent days said they believed it probably was -- then that equation changes, and could give North Korea far more leverage.
 Richard L. Armitage, who is departing as the deputy secretary of state, warned Congress nearly two years ago that if North Korea reprocessed its fuel rods, there was a far more significant risk that it could sell the material. The comment alarmed some administration officials, who have striven to convey a sense that there is not a great strategic difference if North Korea holds one or two weapons or if it holds seven or eight. But internally, there has been significant debate on that subject at the White House and the Pentagon. Last month, Gen. Leon J. LaPorte, commander of United States forces in South Korea, told reporters in Seoul that he was increasingly concerned that ''North Korea, in its desire for hard currency, would sell weapons-grade plutonium to some terrorist organizations.'' 
 Robert J. Einhorn, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former senior State Department official who has often dealt with North Korea, said Dr. ElBaradei's comments ''certainly create some pressure on the Bush administration.''
 ''Would the North Koreans ever sell their plutonium? I don't think so, but who knows?'' he said. ''It becomes more plausible if they think we are turning the screws on them. And it makes the military situation more difficult,'' he said, because North Korea could hide its weapons around the country, making them more difficult to target or seize.
 A spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean McCormack, said he was unaware of any change in the official assessment of North Korea's abilities. 
 Dr. ElBaradei's assessment puts him in the opposite position he was in two years ago, when the Bush administration was pressing him to find evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Dr. ElBaradei balked then, saying there was little evidence of activity since the 1991 Persian Gulf war in 1991. His view was later supported by the American-led Iraq Survey Group.
 But in the case of North Korea, it is Dr. ElBaradei who appears more willing to raise alarms. That may reflect, in part, the breakdown in communication between the I.A.E.A. and the United States on North Korea -- the agency has been largely frozen out of the little new intelligence that the United States has gathered about North Korea's activities since inspectors left. One senior official of the agency said that was to be expected because ''without inspectors in North Korea, there's not much we could do with the intelligence.''
 Dr. ElBaradei's assessment, in the same week that he raised new questions about whether Iran might be hiding elements of its nuclear program, frames the two most urgent proliferation threats. While Mr. Bush, who said last year that he would not ''tolerate'' a nuclear-armed North Korea, has avoided public discussion of its apparently expanding nuclear capacity, the subject clearly concerns his aides.
 But there have been a few hints of those worries. In September, just before the presidential election, a senior administration official with access to the highest level intelligence told The New York Times that there was satellite evidence indicating that North Korea was preparing to conduct a nuclear test. The statement appeared to be an effort to warn North Korea and China, the North Koreans' main economic lifeline, not to interfere with the election by proceeding with the test. Soon after, activity at the suspected test site diminished, though experts here in Vienna say their own examination of other satellite imagery suggests that a test is still a strong possibility.
 In interviews, officials here said that if their assessment was correct, North Korea now had six or more ''bomb cores.'' But it is unclear whether those cores have been made into weapons. Either way, the officials said, North Korea's action could complicate the inspection process if the North agreed to disarm.
 ''This is going to be a nightmare if we don't have full cooperation and full access'' throughout the country, said Pierre Goldschmidt, who directs the department of safeguards at the nuclear agency, which is responsible for inspections.
 With so much material now produced, he said, North Korea has had time to disperse it around the country and conceal it. ''It will almost be an impossible job,'' he said.
 But he said the agency had already developed a plan in case talks between North Korea and five other nations -- China, the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia -- resulted in a deal to allow inspectors back into the country. That plan calls for far more intrusive inspections than any the agency has conducted before. Mr. Goldschmidt said that even with full cooperation by the North Koreans, completing the inspections could take several years.

HEADLINE: Two forecasters are surprisingly optimistic on ad spending next year, even after a strong 2004.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
PREDICTIONS for advertising spending next year from two leading industry forecasters are surprisingly upbeat, as they project gains will be made even after the strong growth anticipated for 2004.
 The unexpectedly optimistic predictions were offered yesterday morning by senior executives of two media agencies, Robert J. Coen of Universal McCann and Steve King of the ZenithOptimedia Group. In raising estimates they made previously for worldwide ad spending in 2005, they cited reasons that ranged from a continuing boom in online advertising to the growing list of major marketers planning to increase budgets substantially to generate demand for aging or moribund brands.
 The forecasts are good news for Madison Avenue, which is worried that the robust growth it is enjoying this year may dissipate amid wavering consumer confidence and rising energy prices. And next year will not bring a reprise of the additional billions of dollars spent in 2004 on elections or ads for the Olympics. 
 But the battles for consumer favor in crowded categories like drugs, automobiles, entertainment, telecommunications and packaged foods will generate sufficient additional growth, the forecasters said, to make 2005 the fourth consecutive year of year-over-year increases since the 6.5 percent decline in 2001, the first since 1991.
 ''Momentum will carry over into 2005,'' said Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, because big marketers will find it difficult ''to turn around and cut ad budgets when competition is heating up.''
 Mr. Coen and Mr. King, chief executive of ZenithOptimedia, based in London, made their forecasts at the opening session of the 32nd annual Media Week conference in Manhattan, which is sponsored by UBS.
 ''They were optimistic,'' Brian S. Shipman, senior analyst for UBS, said of the presenters, ''but the brand marketers need to continue to worry about market share, and without marketing they will not trigger consumer spending.''
 Not everyone, of course, agreed with the rosy predictions. In separate presentations at the conference, the chief executives of two large agency companies -- David A. Bell of the Interpublic Group of Companies and Sir Martin Sorrell of the WPP Group -- expressed caution in forecasting growth.
 Leland Westerfield, managing director for media research at Harris Nesbitt, said that doubts about corporate profits and the health of the auto, retail and telecommunications industries ''suggest a headwind in the face of advertising recovery rather than an upward cycle for 2005.'' 
 Also, Lauren Rich Fine, the advertising analyst for Merrill Lynch, has lowered her forecast for growth in ad spending next year in the United States, citing a belief that marketers may seek less-expensive media outlets for their campaigns. And Mr. Coen's prediction for growth in ad spending next year for newspapers in the United States exceeded the forecast also made yesterday morning at the conference by the medium's trade organization, the National Newspaper Association. 
 Still, given that most estimates for ad spending growth this year turned out a shade or two lower than what now seems to have been warranted, perhaps Mr. Coen and Mr. King are on the right track.
 If there is, as Mr. King predicted, ''stable and sustainable global economic growth'' in 2005, then it would not be going too far out on the proverbial limb to forecast that ad spending ''will grow marginally ahead of gross domestic product,'' particularly with quickening demand for media like the Internet and direct marketing. ZenithOptimedia is part of the Publicis Groupe.
 Mr. Coen now predicts a worldwide total for ad spending next year of $553.4 billion, up 6.1 percent from his revised final estimate for 2004 of $521.5 billion. In June, Mr. Coen, who offers predictions twice a year, forecast that 2005 global ad spending would increase 5.9 percent from 2004, to $550 billion. (The figure for this year, the first time global ad spending would top $500 billion, represents an increase of 6.4 percent from $489.9 billion in 2003.)
 Mr. Coen's forecast for next year is composed of $280.6 billion in the United States, up 6.4 percent from $263.7 billion this year, and $272.8 billion overseas, up 5.8 percent from $257.8 billion this year. Mr. Coen raised his overseas estimate by $2.8 billion from June and his domestic estimate by $600 million.
 The projected increases are warranted, Mr. Coen said, by continued growth in the advertising economies of countries like China, Indonesia and Russia, as well as in spending in the United States in categories like beverages and snacks, financial services and telecommunications.
 They are also warranted, Mr. Coen said, despite the fact that results for next year will be facing tough comparisons with 2004, when totals were lifted by spending for election and Olympics ads. 
 While Mr. Coen did not offer an estimate of how large the gain was this year, Mr. King estimated that such spending added $3.1 billion to the ZenithOptimedia worldwide estimate of $369.7 billion for 2004, accounting for 0.9 percent of the 6.9 percent increase from 2003. (ZenithOptimedia's numbers vary from those of Universal McCann, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, because the two agencies keep track of spending in different media.)
 For 2005, Mr. King said he had raised his estimate of worldwide ad spending growth to 5 percent, or $388.3 billion, from a gain of 4.8 percent he predicted in October; ZenithOptimedia updates its forecasts about four times a year. Mr. King, like Mr. Coen, cited increased interest among advertisers in media like direct marketing and the Internet, which are more measurable than traditional media like television.
 Mr. King also offered predictions for worldwide ad spending in 2006, up 5.8 percent from 2005 to $410.9 billion, and 2007, up 5.8 percent from 2006 to $434.6 billion. At the newspaper association presentation, James Conaghan, vice president for research and business analysis, forecast that ad spending in American newspapers next year would total $48.6 billion, up 4.1 percent from $46.7 billion in 2004. In July, he had forecast a 4 percent gain for 2005 from 2004.
 The total for this year was revised downward to a gain of 3.9 percent from the $45 billion spent in 2003; a 4.1 percent increase had been forecast in July and last December.
 ''I still think I'm fairly conservative,'' Mr. Conaghan said, primarily because ''I am a little cautious'' about the ability of demand for real estate ads in newspapers to continue growing briskly if interest rates rise.

HEADLINE: A Designer's Incredible Rise and Inevitable Fall

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
Can it have been just five years ago that Miguel Adrover was being hailed as the hope of American fashion? Back in September 1999, the first collection by an unknown designer, presented in a theater on the Lower East Side, upstaged all the marquee names of the moment. Critics from publications with reader profiles as unalike as those of Vogue and Paper fell over themselves praising the wit, elan and craftsmanship behind Mr. Adrover's efforts: a miniskirt pieced from a salvaged Louis Vuitton bag, a strapless dress smudged with paint and appliqued with scraps of graffiti, a dress made of ticking from Quentin Crisp's mattress, another from T-shirts and materials sold on the street. 
 They also found in his biography such good copy that tales of Mr. Adrover's past often read like fiction. How many designers, after all, were raised on almond farms on small Mediterranean islands? 
 By the time Mr. Adrover's next collection rolled around, in February 2000, the designer was awash in glowing press. ''In 2000, he was the shining star,'' said Jeffrey Kalinsky, the owner of Jeffrey New York. 
 Retailers, normally a conservative group, lined up to place orders for the output of Mr. Adrover's ad hoc studio, which then amounted to the designer; his patternmaker, Peter Hidalgo; and several talented volunteers. Some store owners, like Mr. Kalinsky and Linda Dresner, with shops in Manhattan and Birmingham, Mich., even broke with precedent and said they would be willing to write checks to back his line. 
 It would be hard to imagine a more promising blueprint for commercial success. But things quickly went sour for the designer, in ways emblematic of the difficulties now faced by any newcomer to the business. Thus the cautionary tale that is the career of Miguel Adrover completed its arc in just a handful of seasons. 
 Having arrived in New York 14 years ago from Majorca, Miguel Adrover is packing up to quit the city he calls ''the whole point of living'' and going home. ''I feel it's a pity, because we gave a voice to the multicultural city,'' the designer said last week, as he sat in the Chrystie Street loft where he both lived and worked, surrounded by packing boxes crammed with examples of his cerebral, often sculptural and superbly executed designs. His departure date is next week, the day after he turns 39.
 That the designer is gifted was never in question. ''There's no doubt in my mind that he's incredibly talented,'' said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys New York, until recently among the designer's most stalwart supporters. ''He never had bad shows, shows where you didn't want to wear the clothes.''
 In fact, the shows themselves, often held in unlikely settings -- a synagogue, an East Village park, a public school courtyard transformed into a classical arena -- gave proof of his gifts for theatricalism, organization and, not least, public relations. 
 It did not seem to matter that the presentations were scheduled off the official Seventh on Sixth roster or that they were mounted in parts of town where editors are rarely seen. People came out in droves. ''He had five separate people from Vogue sitting on a bench on the Lower East Side,'' Ms. Gilhart said. Among those people were Anna Wintour, the stylist Camilla Nickerson and Candy Pratts Price, the fashion director of Style.com, any one of whom has the ability to anoint a designer's career. 
 ''I remember that show,'' Ms. Price said yesterday, laughing. ''That was the one with the goat that wouldn't come down the runway.'' In fact the balky animal used in the show's finale was a sheep. 
 Was it put there to suggest something about the followers of fashion? Odds are it was. Among the criticisms leveled at Mr. Adrover by his detractors is that his work was too political, his politics too naive or else just postures, his agenda too provocative to make commercial sense. 
 ''Fashion lives in a bubble,'' an unrepentant Mr. Adrover said. ''We're not going to show pink flower dresses on the catwalk if people are in the world throwing bombs.'' This was a reference, perhaps, to a show in Paris last October at which the designers Viktor & Rolf presented models wearing ribboned pink dresses and gave each audience member a gift of their first fragrance, which comes in a bottle shaped like a grenade and is called Flowerbomb. 
 As it happens, it was politics that led to Mr. Adrover's downfall, but the global kind rather than fashion's parochial kind. First his career fell prey to a bubble economy when the nascent American conglomerate Pegasus Group invested in his business in 2000 and then went bankrupt a year later, leaving him without resources to meet his obligations. There were problems with sourcing, pricing and shipping, Ms. Gilhart said. Barneys had decided to drop the line even before bad luck and timing conspired in a collection Mr. Adrover called Utopia, with clothes inspired by Islam and the Middle East, and presented in a Lower East Side schoolyard on Sept. 9, 2001. 
 Mr. Adrover resurrected his business and continued showing, including what may have been his most mature collection last fall, and installing his designs in a special boutique at Henri Bendel. But it was not enough. 
 ''Yes, Pegasus was a big mistake, yet it was also a good opportunity to reach a much larger audience,'' Ms. Dresner said. ''But these have been difficult times, and although his clothes were always very handsome and beautifully made, they were not commercially easy. Business was at a point where we didn't feel like going out on a limb anymore.'' Ms. Dresner stopped buying Mr. Adrover's clothes. It is one thing to be talented and subversive, but, she said, ''you also have to understand the world that you're talking to.''
 What is that world? ''Our world today is not one where you can have a group of people just living like artists and sharing a bottle of wine,'' Ms. Price said. The commercial demands of the business are too pressing, she suggested, to leave room for practitioners more involved with conceptual issues than the bottom line. 
 ''Where's the Robert Duffy?'' she asked. She was speaking of the business partner most industry people agree has made Marc Jacobs's career possible. ''Miguel had imaginative ideas, terrific talent, a very supportive staff, but it takes a businessman next to you. You need someone to say to the fabric salesman, 'If we buy 60 yards of this, what can you do for us if we get the whole bolt?' ''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Others Gave Millions To Pinochet

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, received multimillion-dollar payments from the governments of several countries, including the United States, during his 25-year tenure as Chile's ruler and military chief, according to documents recently uncovered during a Senate committee investigation into suspected money laundering at Riggs Bank. 
 The documents, including General Pinochet's sworn financial statements, show that he received $3 million from the United States government in 1976 and, in other years, $1.5 million from Paraguay, $1 million from Spain, $2.5 million from China, a combined payment of $2.5 million from Britain and China, and a combined payment of $3 million from Britain, Malaysia and Brazil. From 1974 to 1997, the payments totaled at least $12.3 million. 
 The documents, originally given to Riggs by the Chilean defense ministry, were verified by a senior Riggs executive assessing the sources of the general's wealth. The payments from foreign governments were described as ''commissions from service and travel abroad.'' 
 General Pinochet, who is 89, assumed control in Chile after overthrowing the elected government of Salvador Allende in 1973. He instituted a police state, oversaw the kidnapping and killing of some 4,000 political dissidents, laid the foundation of a stable economy and kept a tight grip on power until 1990. Until 1998, he remained commander in chief of the military. Now he faces potential charges of human rights abuses in Chile as well as legislative and tax service investigations there of his financial dealings.
 In 1976, the year General Pinochet received his payment from the United States, there were two pivotal events for Chile. The intelligence services of Chile and other South American countries agreed on a wide-ranging campaign to kill exiled political opponents. Shortly after that, a former Chilean foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, and his American assistant were blown up in their car on a busy street in Washington, an event that led to a reassessment of the United States' relationship with the Pinochet government.
 Riggs Bank, a subsidiary of the Riggs National Corporation, based in Washington, has been embroiled in federal investigations of possible money laundering and terrorist financing since late in 2002. At that time, investigators began to examine Saudi Arabian Embassy accounts at the bank for possible links to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a connection that American authorities have since discounted.
 Even so, improprieties were uncovered in the overall handling of Saudi accounts at Riggs, as well as in the management of General Pinochet's accounts. The sources of about $700 million in cash and investment accounts at Riggs controlled by the West African nation of Equatorial Guinea or by some of its leaders have also come under scrutiny, at a time American companies are courting Equatorial Guinea, a growing producer of oil. 
 In May, federal regulators fined Riggs for failing to comply with bank secrecy laws, and a criminal investigation of the bank and its executives for possible money laundering is under way at the Justice Department. No Riggs officials have been charged with wrongdoing, although a former Riggs executive is the subject of a grand jury investigation into bank fraud.
 The Saudis have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and the government of Equatorial Guinea has declined to comment. A lawyer for General Pinochet, and for his nonprofit foundation in Chile, declined to comment Monday about the sources of the general's wealth or dealings with Riggs. 
 Senate investigators published a lengthy report in July that detailed multimillion-dollar accounts that General Pinochet and his wife, Lucia, held at Riggs. The accounts, valued at $4 million to $8 million, were disguised and moved around the world for years with the cooperation of Riggs officials. The Senate investigations subcommittee released the general's financial statements about three weeks ago.
 An independent Chilean journalist, Patricia Verdugo, first discussed the new documents in public last Friday at a news conference in Santiago, the Chilean capital.
 Riggs's own profile of General Pinochet indicates that he was a customer of the bank since 1985 and that the bank used his will, contracts, financial statements and sales receipts to verify his wealth.
 Although General Pinochet never earned more than a modest government salary, Riggs described the source of his prosperity as ''family wealth'' and a ''high-paying position in public sector for many years.'' 
 Chilean government investigators have repeatedly dismissed family wealth or government service as the real sources of General Pinochet's money in the Riggs accounts. But they have yet to reach a definitive conclusion about the source of the funds.
 Among the assets the general disclosed in his financial statements were ''100,000 volumes of books,'' ''savings in various financial institutions,'' royalties from books and real estate investments.

HEADLINE: Say the Right Name and They Light Up

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE

 BODY:
THINK about your favorite retail store. Call it XYZ. On a scale of 1 to 5 -- 1 means you're neutral, 5 means you agree strongly; rate these statements:
 XYZ always treats me with respect.
 I feel proud to be an XYZ customer. 
 If a problem arises, I can always count on XYZ to reach a fair and satisfactory resolution.
 XYZ always treats me fairly.
 XYZ always delivers on what it promises.
 XYZ is a name I can always trust.
 I can't imagine a world without XYZ.
 XYZ is the perfect store for me.
 Now think about your bank. Go through the same statements and rate how you feel. 
 Earlier this year in Japan, 16 women participated in a study that measured such responses and determined store loyalty by using a brain scan. The subjects identified their own XYZ -- an upscale department store in Tokyo -- and agreed to a scan while they were asked 32 yes-or-no-type questions about the store, their bank and their daily life. 
 The women, who were 22 to 66 years old, placed their heads into machines that track brain blood flow as the women performed the mental tasks. For example, when people see a face, make a decision, feel a reward, pay attention, sense deception or react to countless stimuli, specific regions of the brain light up. 
 Before entering the scanner, a third of the women revealed that they were passionately loyal customers of XYZ. A third said they liked to shop there but were not fanatical about it. The rest were neutral. During the session, each woman was asked to imagine her most recent experiences at XYZ and at the bank. 
 Everyone had similar brain patterns when answering questions about mundane daily life or trips to the bank, said John Fleming, a senior consultant for the Gallup Organization in Princeton, N.J., which led the study. But those who indicated an extremely strong emotional attachment to the store, as measured by questions like ''this is the store for me,'' showed a distinct pattern.
 Three areas of the brain -- the orbitofrontal cortex, the temporal pole and the amygdala -- lighted up brightly. All are associated with visual memory and emotion, Mr. Fleming said. The most ''brand addicted'' subjects, he said, showed the greatest activation in the amygdala, which is a sensory gateway to the emotions. 
 ''If the company they love screws up, they blame themselves,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''They ask themselves what they did to contribute to the problem.''
 Women who were mildly fond of or neutral about the store showed far less activation or no activation in these emotional areas of the brain. 
 The study, carried out at Nihon University in Tokyo, was reported in late October at the Society for Neuroscience's annual meeting, held in San Diego. 
 Marketing and neuroscience are becoming bedfellows. Corporations and advertisers are turning to brain-imaging technologies as a way of learning customer preferences. By peering at brain circuits as people think about products or services, neuromarketers hope to glean what buyers really want instead of what they might say in a focus group or write on a questionnaire.
 The Gallup study is a variation on this theme. It explored the brains of people who already professed different degrees of brand loyalty. A result is startling evidence that brands can invade the brain's most intimate emotional centers -- and drive behavior.
 Companies have long known that brand loyalty is important, Mr. Fleming said. Loyal customers buy more, expanding profits. They tend to try new offerings and tell their friends. It costs less to keep loyal customers than to recruit new ones. 
 If a company could turn 5 percent more of its customers into loyalists, with hooks into their amygdalas, profits would increase 25 to 100 percent a customer, said Frederick F. Reichheld, author of ''The Loyalty Effect: The Hidden Force Behind Growth, Profits and Lasting Value.''
 Marketing executives naturally want to know what creates brand loyalty. It does not stem from flashy ad campaigns, Mr. Fleming said. Nor is it a measure of customer satisfaction, a better-quality product or even a lesser-quality product. 
 What drives behavior in a complex world is often emotions, said Dr. Daniel Kahneman, a psychology professor at Princeton University who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics. He argues that emotions are important determinants of economic behavior, more so than rationality. 
 To win brand loyalty, companies need to establish strong emotional bonds with their customers. Moreover, this builds one transaction at a time, involving face-to-face contacts. ''A brand is more than a virtual symbol in the marketplace,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''It has a face of the people who interact in the marketplace.''
 Many corporations are waking up to the fact that their lowest-paid employees are the people who create, or fail to create, the emotional connections that lead to brand loyalty. They are also aware of local differences in how employees engage customers. ''For me, a good example is Continental Airlines,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''I love the airline, but maybe that's because I fly out of Newark. I know people in Houston who do not have the same experience.'' 
 It is probably too soon to tell if buying goods on the Internet will lead to similar levels of brand loyalty. A prompt, courteous, cost-competitive Web site could conceivably build loyal customers. But without face-to-face contact and those small touches that mean great service, will America's amygdalas light up in cyberspace? Perhaps a future brain imaging experiment will tell.

HEADLINE: Pataki Seeks to Expand Indian Casinos in Catskills

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and KIRK SEMPLE; Michael Cooper reported from Albany for this article and Kirk Semple from White Plains.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
With New York State facing large deficits and a court order requiring it to spend billions more on education, Gov. George E. Pataki said on Monday that he would like to allow Indian tribes to open a total of five Las Vegas-style casinos in the Catskills, two more than are authorized by state law. 
 ''I think five makes perfectly good sense,'' Mr. Pataki said on Monday, as the State Legislature returned to Albany to try to wrap up a contentious year. 
 Mr. Pataki made the announcement as the state is struggling to find ways to comply with a court order that it sharply increase education financing for New York City schools. Three court-appointed referees estimated last week that the cost of compliance could be an additional $23 billion over the next five years.
 For the governor, allowing two more casinos in the Catskills could solve several problems at once. It could help the state come up with millions of dollars in revenue, as the state typically gets one-fourth of all slot machine proceeds in the casinos it allows. And it would give the Pataki administration a bargaining point as it tries to persuade a number of Indian tribes to drop their multimillion-dollar land claim suits against New York State.
 But the first influx of Catskill gambling money could still be years away: since 2001, when the state moved to allow three Indian casinos in the Catskills, not a single one has opened. The proposed casinos have been delayed by disputes between Indian tribes, fights between developers and hurdles at the local level.
 Governor Pataki's call for allowing two more casinos in the Catskills fueled speculation that has been growing in the Capitol in recent weeks that he might try to carry New York through its fiscal straits by taking the state further into debt -- issuing bonds to be backed by anticipated casino revenues. 
 The governor's aides said there were absolutely no plans to borrow against casino revenues. ''There is nothing to that,'' said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki.
 But in the Legislature, two Democrats and a Republican said that they had heard talk that the state could try to borrow against the revenue, just as it borrowed against its share of the proceeds of a national lawsuit against tobacco companies. ''It's out there,'' one Republican said.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said, ''It is my understanding that the governor's proposal is again to borrow, but this time against these new revenue streams.'' 
 Such a proposal could be a hard sell. The state has already been criticized by fiscal watchdogs for borrowing money to cover its operating expenses, and several groups, including the Assembly Democrats and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said they were uneasy with Governor Pataki's previous proposal to use gambling revenue to pay for education. The governor had originally called for using the money from video lottery terminals that are in use at racetracks to pay for the increased cost of education. 
 And winning approval for two more casinos in the Catskills could be difficult.
 Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who represents the Catskill area, said that he hoped there would be no rush to approve the extra casinos.
 ''I don't believe at this time that the people in Sullivan County would like to rush from three to five casinos,'' he said. ''We've been waiting since 2001 to have one operating. We'd like to see the first three get built, and then see the impact on the county.''
 The state decided to allow the first three casinos to open when the Legislature passed a broad expansion of legalized gambling a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The bill called for opening three casinos in western New York and three in the Catskills, and paved the way for allowing slot-machine style video lottery terminals at several racetracks.
 But the Catskill casinos were always considered to be the most lucrative prizes, as they would be near New York City and could compete with the Atlantic City and Connecticut gambling attractions.
 ''Certainly the Catskills is an area that has been a historic resort community that has attracted millions of people from not just New York, but from across the country,'' Mr. Pataki said on Monday. 
 Charles A. Degliomini, vice president of Empire Resorts Inc., which is based in Monticello, N.Y., said on Monday that five casinos are economically better than three. ''It creates a critical mass, it creates a destination,'' he said. ''Gamblers like to go places where there are different opportunities to stay at one place, but visit other places. Some guys like to change their luck.''
 Empire Resorts predicted that five casinos in the Catskills would draw about 30 million people a year.
 As the governor spoke, his aides were negotiating with several Indian tribes and casino development groups. The governor announced deals last month with the Seneca-Cayuga Indians of Oklahoma, who trace their lineage to New York, and the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York, that essentially settled their land claims against the state in exchange for the right to build casinos in the Catskills. Those deals still need the approval of the United States Congress and the State Legislature.
 Both groups have development deals with Empire Resorts, which owns three properties: Monticello Raceway, the Concord Resort Hotel at Kiamesha Lake and Grossinger's.
 The New York Cayugas are planning to build a $500 million casino next to the raceway, located in Sullivan County, 90 miles from New York City. The Seneca-Cayugas are still discussing the location of theirs. Robert A. Berman, chief executive of Empire Resorts, the tribe's development partner, has said he is encouraging the tribe to consider developing the Concord, which closed in 1998.
 The St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, which has a development agreement with Caesars Entertainment, intends to build a casino at Kutsher's Sports Academy in Monticello, though the tribe is still trying to get state and federal approval.
 The negotiations on Monday appeared to be aimed at casino deals with the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans, a Wisconsin tribe, and with the Oneida Indians of Wisconsin, officials said.
 The current round of negotiations poses a challenge to the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, which objects to the state's decision to reach deals with tribes based outside New York. The tribe operates the highly profitable Turning Stone Resort and Casino in Central New York and could lose customers if five new casinos open in the Catskills. 
 Mark F. Emery, a spokesman for the tribe, said: ''It doesn't make any difference who's included in the five if there are out-of-state Indians included. The profits are going to be going out of state, and that doesn't benefit New York. It opens up the floodgates to other out-of-state Indian nations wanting to come here and to problems of tribal sovereignty here.''

HEADLINE: Wines That Travel Well

BYLINE: By Jim Clarke. 
Jim Clarke is the wine and spirits editor of StarChefs.com.

DATELINE: SONOMA, CALIF. 

 BODY:
New Yorkers who want to pick up a bottle of Pillar Rock Cabernet Sauvignon for Christmas dinner should keep an eye out for last-minute flights to California. They can't get the highly rated Pillar Rock at home, and state law prohibits the winery from shipping it to them. But the United States Supreme Court today is hearing a trio of cases -- two from Michigan and one from New York -- that could change that, making many high-quality wines available nationwide and opening up new markets for small wineries.
 At issue in these cases are state laws that permit in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, while barring out-of-state producers from doing so. So a Manhattanite can have Wolffer Estate on Long Island send a case of wine, but not Ken Wright Cellars in Oregon. This puts two constitutional provisions in conflict: the Commerce Clause, which allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition and gave individual states the right to regulate the sale of alcohol -- a right they took to heart. 
 Until 1986, most wineries that wanted to sell their wines in other states had to use wholesalers, which distributed their bottles to retailers. But that year, California instituted a reciprocity policy that allowed direct shipment of wine from states that would allow shipment of California's wines. Twelve states have adopted similar laws, while the rest forbid or limit, to varying degrees, the shipping of wine to consumers. Now with the Internet fueling direct sales, the issue has taken on new urgency. 
 Wholesalers and other opponents of interstate shipping argue that Internet sales will make it too easy for teenagers to get their hands on alcohol; underage connoisseurs, the argument seems to be, prefer out-of-state wines, not the local plonk. Nonetheless, there has not been any documented increase in underage wine consumption in states that already permit out-of-state shipments.
 The wholesalers, however, do have a point: many states require alcohol deliveries to be signed for by someone over 21. But enforcement seems to be spotty. In Massachusetts, the attorney general recently had college students order wine and liquor from seven retailers, and none had to prove they were of drinking age (although some were required to check a box saying that they were over 21). 
 Obviously, though, the problem is not with wineries (in this case, the senders were retailers, including one in Massachusetts), but with delivery companies that fail to follow the rules. Should this be justification for states to bar direct wine sales? 
 Interestingly, there is another area where determining an Internet user's age has been at issue: pornography. But even though it is practically impossible for providers of Internet pornography to verify the age of their customers, in 1997 the Supreme Court struck down the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which tried to limit underage access to Internet pornography. According to the court, a law that has the effect of restricting speech ''is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purposes the statute was enacted to serve.'' Similarly, laws requiring recipients of alcohol deliveries to be at least 21 are a less restrictive alternative to forbidding all shipments of alcohol. 
 In any case, waving the red flag of teenage drinking masks the wholesalers' real concern: protecting their hold on the market. Post-Prohibition, most states put the producer-wholesaler-retailer system in place to prevent vertical monopolies and racketeering. This worked at the time, and marketing directly to consumers would have been prohibitively inefficient for most wineries anyway. Under this system, the wholesaler takes on the responsibility of marketing and distributing the wines in a selected part of the country, and for many large producers this is still the most efficient means for getting their bottles into stores.
 In recent years, however, this effort to prevent monopolies has helped in some ways to promote them. The number of wholesalers has dropped to about 300 today from several thousand a few decades ago. Because of the costs of storing and promoting a wine, wholesalers are reluctant to handle small producers. Consequently, 30 companies distribute more than 90 percent of the wines on the market in the United States. Shunned by wholesalers, more and more small and midsize producers are taking to the Internet.
 Will permitting direct shipments from producers make wholesalers obsolete? It seems unlikely; the economies of scale that made the system efficient in the past will still exist, as they do in California. A winery with substantial production will continue to use a wholesaler, whether the law requires it or not. 
 It is only with unusual, small-production wines (which are generally on the expensive side) that direct shipment makes economic sense for both the winemaker and the consumer. The cost of delivery is the same for a $10 table wine and a $100 bottle of California Cult Cabernet -- a fact likely to discourage teenagers looking for cheap and easy drinking, but no impediment to aficionados who collect rare wines. 
 There is another concern for the states: lost tax revenue. Wine is subject to an excise tax that averages about 13 cents per bottle nationally. But according to the National Association of American Wineries, even under the most optimistic projections the lost tax revenue would amount to only about $1.6 million. States worried about this loss could simply do with wine what some states are doing for catalog or Internet sales: put in place permit requirements or tax-remittance laws.
 According to the association, 70 percent of the country's wineries produce fewer than 10,000 cases a year. These small wineries need every opportunity to reach their customers. Direct Internet sales have been beneficial to producers and consumers in other fields, and it's time the same thing happened in the wine industry. Contrary to what the wholesalers say, we needn't worry about finding empty bottles of Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 behind the bleachers at the high school stadium.

HEADLINE: Ex-Government Aide And Two Relatives Charged in Inquiry

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
The former chief of staff to the state commerce secretary and two of the chief of staff's relatives were indicted on Monday after an inquiry by state criminal investigators into contracts awarded by the administration of Gov. James. E. McGreevey. 
 The former chief of staff, Lesly Devereaux, was charged by a state grand jury with contracting work to her sister and mother, who were also indicted. 
The charges include theft, misappropriation of public property and tampering with records to thwart a state investigation.
 According to the indictment, Ms. Devereaux hired her sister, Candace Harper, as a consultant to review transactions with state vendors and to compile a vendor database. Under the arrangement, it is charged, Ms. Harper was paid $2,000 a month -- for a total of $9,250 -- while living in North Carolina, while she was under probation for felony embezzlement. 
 Ms. Devereaux's mother, Lillian Harper, was paid $2,275 in consulting fees to proofread two documents that had already been edited and published by commerce commission staff, the indictments charge.
 The indictment also alleges that Ms. Devereaux, after learning of the state investigation, falsified official documents.
 The investigation by the state attorney general's office led to the resignations this July of Ms. Devereaux and of William D. Watley, the commissioner of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission.
 Walter F. Timpone, an attorney for Ms. Devereux, could not be reached for comment.
 The case was assigned to Mercer County Superior Court for trial. If convicted, the defendants each face up to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000.

HEADLINE: Hotels Find New Demand For Concierge Luxury

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE. 
Readers are invited to send stories about business travel experiences to businesstravel@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Dave Fish, a software consultant from Denver, recently paid an extra 20 euros ($27) to stay on the concierge floor at the Sheraton Frankfurt Hotel and Towers at Frankfurt International Airport. ''I had been traveling around Europe for a week and was pretty tired,'' Mr. Fish said. ''I wanted to make sure I was rested before my flight the next day.''
 He got his wish. As a concierge floor guest, he stayed in a room with a thicker mattress, better-quality linen, bigger pillows and turndown service, as well as free chocolates, mineral water, an aromatherapy sleep kerchief and health club access. 
 He also had use of the concierge floor lounge, where a chef made a ham, onion and pepper omelet for him the morning of his departure. All the attention apparently soothed his nerves. ''I didn't have any trouble sleeping,'' Mr. Fish said. 
 Concierge floors are back in vogue, a result in large part of the willingness of business travelers like Mr. Fish to dig deeper into their pockets for a little bit of pampering after a long flight or a hard day's work.
 Experts give several reasons for the return to favor of an indulgence that has been around since the 1920's but that became a fixture at hotels only in the 1970's and 80's. Some corporations are beginning to loosen their purse strings in an improving economy, they say, and are allowing more employees to pay a surcharge of $10 to $50 at chains like Marriott and Sheraton and $85 to $200 at InterContinental and Ritz-Carlton.
 In addition, according to Michael J. Silverstein, a senior vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, some travelers use the savings from Internet air fares to treat themselves to more expensive accommodations. (To be sure, many frequent customers are upgraded to the concierge floor at reduced or no cost.)
 Mr. Fish's fortunate deal notwithstanding, such premium rooms are seldom cheap. Bjorn Hanson, who heads the hospitality practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, predicts that over the next five years, the average concierge floor surcharge will increase to a premium of 25 percent to 35 percent over room rates from 20 percent today, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco.
 Still, there seems to be plenty of demand. Women prefer the security of concierge floors, many of which provide access only with a special key. ''They don't like to stay in their room all the time, but they also don't like to hang out in the hotel's public areas,'' said Derek Flint, senior corporate director of rooms at Ritz-Carlton. ''The lounge gives them an opportunity to relax, read a book and chat in a comfortable, secure atmosphere.''
 Whatever the explanation, hotels are more than happy to oblige customers' embrace of such an easy money maker. ''They can dress up part of the hotel, put in some amenities, food and beverage and an attendant, and charge a premium that people will pay,'' said Chekitan Dev, a marketing professor at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University.
 After the September 2001 attacks, when already declining demand for rooms on concierge floors collapsed, companies like Ritz-Carlton, Westin and Sheraton closed some concierge floor lounges temporarily or curtailed their hours. Now, they are scrambling to meet the renewed business.
 Ritz-Carlton says the occupancy of concierge floor rooms has doubled since 2002, and now accounts for 10 percent of all bookings. Marriott International says demand for concierge floor rooms at the Marriott and Renaissance hotels in North America is up more than 5 percent this year from 2003, and Shangri-La, the Asian chain, says the occupancy rate of its concierge floor rooms has risen to about 80 percent today from 60 percent in 2002 and 2003.
 Westin, which reduced concierge lounge hours three years ago, recently ordered that the lounges stay open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., ''acknowledging that business is coming back,'' said Chuck Brown, the chain's director of standards and compliance.
 And hotels are lavishing all kinds of extravagances on their customers. These range from designer toiletries, a crystal ring holder and a DVD player at Ritz-Carlton to oversize desks, fax machines, a basket of fruit, newspapers, daily suit pressing and a purser or butler on call at Shangri-La to plants, free bottled water and coffee at Westin hotels.
 The lounges at virtually all such hotels serve food all day; this can include lunch, snacks, hors d'oeuvres and drinks late in the day and desserts and liqueur after dinner. Some add custom-ordered breakfasts; some do not. 
 Most lounges have staffs. At more expensive hotels they are there full time; at less expensive ones, they are there only at breakfast and during the cocktail hour. Many lounges also have flat-screen television sets, a wide selection of magazines and newspapers, and Internet and WiFi access. Some have separate meeting rooms. 
 Ritz-Carlton has by far the most elaborate food and beverage service in its lounges. It serves breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres and cocktails, and desserts and cordials. Breakfast can include an omelet cooked to order by a chef, bagels and smoked salmon, and fresh fruit; lunch might consist of sandwiches, salads, cheese and pastries; tea is sandwiches and pastries.
 Several of the chain's lounges serve smoked salmon and caviar during the cocktail hour; after-dinner drinks include a choice of premium liqueurs. The Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco offers free transportation to the city's financial district early in the morning for guests to keep in sync with markets elsewhere; the one in Tysons Corner, in northern Virginia, serves ''nostalgia candy,'' including bubble gum.
 Not to be outdone, the concierge floor lounge at the InterContinental Hong Kong has a boardroom with teleconference facilities, meeting rooms, listening stations, wireless headsets, a CD library and flat-screen TV's.
 Richard Dorman, a class-action lawyer in Mobile, Ala., says Ritz-Carlton's concierge floor lounges let him follow his own timetable. ''You can just walk down the hall and have breakfast and coffee when you want it,'' he said.
 Greg Mosher, chairman and chief executive of Workflow Management, a printing and promotional company with offices in New York, Denver and Los Angeles, recalls how a concierge in the lounge at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South in Manhattan summoned a chiropractor to treat his wrenched back. ''I was mobile enough to go to a dinner I had that evening,'' he said.
 Not all hotel companies are jumping on the bandwagon. Elizabeth Pizzinato, director of corporate public relations for Four Seasons, said the chain steered away from concierge floors because most of its hotels are small enough to allow it ''to offer the level of service normally associated with concierge floors to all our guests.'' Mandarin Oriental has a similar philosophy, although both companies have concierge floors at some hotels in Asia.
 But most chains have them and many are upgrading them. Sheraton says it is testing new amenities and services at hotels in New York, Boston and Chicago, and will begin rolling out improvements throughout the chain next year. And the InterContinental Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, borrowing a practice from the InterContinental Hong Kong, began selling passes to its concierge floor lounge to all hotel guests and even outsiders in July for $50 a day. Jeff Senior, vice president for brand management at InterContinental Hotels and Resorts, says the company is considering creating similar lounges elsewhere.
 Over time, Dr. Dev of Cornell predicted, ''you'll see more and more hotels morphing, and a whole hotel could be a concierge floor.'' 
 That is not far-fetched. The Shangri-La in Beijing is building a separate, 18-floor, $50 million luxury tower, with all the rooms to be concierge floor rooms. Planned for opening in 2006, the tower will be linked to the existing hotel by an enclosed walkway and will have 150 rooms, a fitness center, a spa and several restaurants.

HEADLINE: This Is for You, Dear, But It's All About Me

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. FRIEDMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
WITH the holiday season bearing down fast upon us, it's time to socialize, indulge -- and shop. And that means the annual hunt for the perfect gift, a prospect that makes some of us break out in a cold sweat.
 That this is a daunting experience for so many people is obvious from a quick Google search. When I typed in ''gift giving advice,'' more than two million sites popped up, teeming with practical tips about buying gifts for anyone -- from your boss to your best friend's pet. Is giving a gift really that hard? 
 Unfortunately, the answer seems to be yes. A 2003 American Express survey of 803 consumers found that nearly a third of respondents admitted to recycling a gift they had received. That's a lot of people who are not thrilled with their presents. An artist friend told me, with admirable but not entirely convincing calm, that he discovered one of his paintings he'd given as a gift up for auction on eBay. Of course, I didn't ask him what he was doing on eBay. 
 Gift giving is, among other things, an exercise in empathy. The successful present is a mark of how well you know a friend -- his likes and dislikes. Of course, this requires suspending your own tastes, something easier said than done. I wonder if it's possible for you to buy something you don't want yourself just the slightest bit. 
 Even if you pass the empathy test, you are not out of the woods. A truly great present has to do more than affirm your friend's interests; it should anticipate and enlarge them. When my sister was 12, I remember how thrilled she was when my grandfather gave her a subscription to National Geographic. She had no clue at first that this was an interest, but photography and travel became her twin passions.
 O.K., I admit that's a tall order. Can't a gift ever be just a gift? Not a chance. Whether you buy a present for a co-worker, a new friend or a lover, dark psychological and economic forces are apparently at play.
 ''When I buy a gift for my kids or my wife, I suppose I don't just want to surprise them but also show them how clever I am at discovering such a wonderful gift,'' my friend Nick told me recently. Whoever said gift giving is an act of altruism?
 Certainly not many economists, who view it, at least on the surface, as an irrational act. After all, if I am willing to spend $100 for a gift, the odds are high that the recipient will value it at less than $100, which is a loss for both of us. This discrepancy in value that givers and receivers place on gifts was coined ''deadweight,'' by Joel Waldfogel, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote about it in a 1993 paper called ''The Deadweight Loss of Christmas.'' 
 The logical conclusion would seem to be to give money and dispense with all this guessing. Perhaps it makes strict economic sense, but psychologically, it is just a sneaky way to make the other person buy his own gift, which would subvert the point of giving a present.
 Let's be frank, though: some people view a gift merely as an investment. As a tradition, that has a long past. Just a few hundred thousand years ago, an impressive gift was probably a necessity to secure a choice mate; whoever took down the biggest mastodon got the prize. 
 We may have come a long way since then, but some things never change. According to a 2003 study by Dr. Gad Saad, an associate professor of marketing at the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University in Montreal, men on the whole are more likely than women to give gifts for so-called tactical reasons: to flaunt wealth, to seduce, to create a good impression and to signal long-term interest. Men just can't help themselves. Not surprisingly, the women in the study understood with deadly accuracy the reasons why men offer them gifts.
 As you can see, it is probably not a good idea to think too much about your presents. When you open your gift, be gallant and say, ''You have no idea how much this means to me!'' One way or the other, you will be telling the truth.
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to Tiffany & Company. I have some seducing -- I mean shopping -- to do.

HEADLINE: Fire at Stamford Town Center Shuts 120 Stores

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 6 

 BODY:
With holiday shopping in full swing, about 120 stores in the Stamford Town Center were shut down indefinitely after an early-morning blaze on Monday.
 No one was injured in the two-alarm fire, which the authorities traced to the explosion of one of two electrical transformers that help distribute power to the mall.
 The authorities would not allow many of the mall's merchants into their stores until city engineers had assessed structural damage. Chris Riley, a spokesman for Connecticut Light & Power, said the company was working to install new transformers. ''They're on the way,'' Mr. Riley said of the equipment. 
 The authorities said that much of the damage was confined to the parking garage that borders Greyrock Place, a road that leads to the mall, and a quick tour of the Town Center's central atrium, decorated for the holidays, found little impact beyond the smell of smoke. 
 Macy's, an anchor store that has a separate entrance and is serviced by a different transformer was open for business, but customers were nowhere to be seen.
 Stamford's fire chief, Robert McGrath, said that the fire occurred about 3 a.m. on Monday, after employees of the utility had been at the mall to inspect a transformer that was not performing properly. When they later switched over to another transformer from a remote location, he said, ''it exploded, and there was the resulting fire.''
 Mr. Riley would not say whether his company's employees had been at the mall before the fire started but promised a ''full investigation'' of its cause.
 Economic damages to the merchants are expected to be ''significant,'' Chief McGrath said. Food vendors were the hardest hit; health officials instructed them to discard all inventory because of the lack of refrigeration.
 Joe Lasko Jr., the owner of TCBY, a yogurt franchise in the mall, said insurance would cover some of his losses but that it ''doesn't cover everything.''
 ''For little guys like us,'' added Eric Troy, an owner of Wetzel's Pretzels, ''this comes out of our pockets. It's not a corporate thing.'' The 850,000-square foot mall has been a fixture of downtown Stamford since 1982, when it opened.

GIFT BAGS ON CONTINENTAL -- That fixture of the celebrity gala and the high-end hotel giveaway, the luxury goody bag, is coming to the front of the plane on Continental Airlines in February on flights from Newark to Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. On those intensely competitive transcontinental routes, where domestic airlines are trying to add amenities without increasing costs significantly, first-class passengers in Continental will receive promotional items provided by Premier Bags Inc., a company that provides luxury gift bags for the travel, special-events and other industries. The products in the bags ''are not just typical samples; they are high-end, full-use items designed to cultivate a discriminating audience,'' said Chris Carbone, the president of Premier Bags. Each bag will contain well-known brand items like perfume, skin-care lotions and books.

SONG GOES INTERNATIONAL -- Delta Air Lines' low-fare carrier, Song, is flying internationally now. Song started daily nonstop service last week between Kennedy International Airport and Nassau, the Bahamas, and is upgrading its in-flight entertainment to include 10 movies on demand, a wide selection of audio recordings, 10 video games and live satellite television programming.

FEW CHOOSE QUICKER CHECK-INS -- Although checking in for a flight at the airline's main counter takes significantly longer than curbside service or self-service kiosks, fewer than one-quarter of passengers take advantage of either, according to the J.D. Power and Associates 2004 Global Airport Satisfaction Index Study. While overall satisfaction is higher among passengers who check in at curbside, online and at self check-in kiosks, 59 percent of passengers check in at the main counter, which takes an average of 19 minutes. Just 18 percent use a self-service kiosk, which takes an average of 8 minutes, while 10 percent check in at curbside, which takes 13 minutes on average. While many airlines now allow passengers to print their boarding passes through the Internet, only 5 percent of passengers do so.

PHILADELPHIA FLIERS MOST DELAYED -- Among the nation's 31 major airports, Philadelphia is where you're most likely to experience a delayed flight, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The best airports for on-time departures: Houston Intercontinental, Tampa and Denver. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Seeking Quick Loans, Soldiers Race Into High-Interest Traps

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
From Puget Sound in the Northwest to the Virginia coast, the landscape is the same: the main gate of a large military base opens onto a highway lined with shops eager to make small, fast and remarkably expensive loans, no questions asked.
 There are more than 200 of these quick-loan outlets around the Navy bases of Norfolk and Hampton in Virginia; almost two dozen around the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in California; and three dozen within three miles of the Army's Fort Lewis in Washington State.
 So the young Navy petty officer and her husband in the Puget Sound area had no trouble finding a willing lender when they wanted to borrow money between paychecks to show visiting relatives a good time.
 Getting the loan was fast and convenient, too. To borrow $500, they wrote a $575 check to the lender, to be cashed on their next payday, less than two weeks away. But in accepting that instant loan, the couple, who would talk about their experience only if their identities were not disclosed, were also agreeing to pay a staggering annual interest rate of more than 390 percent. By contrast, a loan from a credit union would have taken several days or longer but cost no more than 18 percent. 
 Repaying their fast-money loan took a big bite out of the couple's next paycheck, leaving them short when other bills fell due. So they borrowed again, and again, until they had raised about $4,000 through more instant loans, some of them with official-sounding names like Military Financial Network.
 The cost of this new money also mounted, ranging as high as 650 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate, as the law requires. And as the couple continued to fall behind, they borrowed even more, from other kinds of expensive lenders. 
 By October, just days before the petty officer had to ship out for duty in the Persian Gulf, the debts had grown so large that the couple and their young children were about to lose their home to foreclosure.
 Hardships like this are becoming more common in the military as high-cost easy-money lenders increasingly make service members a target market. As a result, many military people have become trapped in a spiral of borrowing at sky-high rates that can ruin their finances, distract them from their duties and even destroy their careers. The military, for its part, has done little to deny these lenders access to the troops, relying instead on consumer education.
 At least 26 percent of military households have done business with high-cost instant lenders, an analysis of credit industry studies by The New York Times shows. 
 ''It is getting worse, really -- much, much worse,'' said Liz Kosse, director of a Washington State office of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, a nonprofit group that helps service members like the petty officer.
 When the sailor and her husband, a government employee, took out their first triple-digit loan, Ms. Kosse said, ''none of this -- the risks to their home and their livelihood -- had ever occurred to them.'' 
 The couple asked Ms. Kosse to speak on their behalf because, she said, they were concerned about losing their security clearances and possibly their jobs if they were identified. The military considers excessive debt a security risk, saying it leaves a service member vulnerable to financial inducements to commit espionage. 
 Typically young, financially naive and often short of cash, military people present a lucrative customer base for high-cost instant lenders, known as payday lenders, as well as more traditional consumer finance outlets, whose rates can exceed 30 percent.
 In the 37 states that allow them -- up from 28 five years ago -- payday lenders have opened a disproportionate number of outlets on the edges of military bases, a new study has found. And in the 13 states that bar them, payday lenders have nevertheless cropped up around bases in disguise, posing as catalog retailers or Internet cafes, regulators say. Besides sometimes adopting military names, they frequently advertise in base newspapers or operate online with special links to attract military customers. 
 The Community Financial Services Association, which represents about 60 percent of the payday industry, says its members provide a valuable service for people who need cash for emergencies. And the short-term loans, if paid off promptly, can cost less on an annual basis than a bounced check or a credit card advance, the group contends.
 Steven Schlein, a spokesman for the group, denied that the industry specifically pursued military consumers. He said they made up only 2 to 3 percent of all payday loan customers. Most are young middle-income civilian families, he said.
 Still, in response to complaints from the armed services, the association has set up an advisory council led by a retired Army general, and it has drafted a voluntary code of ''military best practices'' for payday lenders. 
 As payday lenders have gained ground, federal efforts to protect military people from high interest rates have had little success. A longstanding federal law, updated last year as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, requires that the interest rate on any debt that service members took on before they enlisted must be reduced to 6 percent when they go on active duty. 
 But there is no limit on the rates they can be charged after they enlist; a bill that would have imposed one stalled and sank in Congress this fall. And few if any high-cost lenders -- even those repeatedly in trouble with regulators -- have been declared off limits by the Pentagon or local commanders, military lawyers say. 
 But many military authorities say service people need more protection, especially in wartime. Sudden deployments can keep them from paying off debts. And besides being denied security clearances, service members can be discharged or even court-martialed for defaulting on debts.
 Then there is the problem of distraction. ''The last thing you want,'' said a retired Navy captain, Chalker W. Brown, now a vice president of the VyStar Credit Union in Jacksonville, Fla., ''is a young sailor programming a Tomahawk missile in the Persian Gulf who is worrying about whether his car is being repossessed back home.''

Armies of Debtors
 The naval petty officer in Washington State managed to hang on to her home in the Puget Sound area; it was rescued by the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society. But she could still lose her job. If she does, hers would not be the first military career ruined by payday lending, military officials say. 
 ''I can remember dozens of cases where I or one of my legal officers had to sit down with young soldiers to try to help them dig their way out of a situation like that,'' said Lt. Col. Russell H. Putnam, a retired Army legal officer who is now chief of client services at Fort Stewart in Hinesville, Ga. 
 In a Pentagon survey in April, about 7 percent of service members said they had used payday loans in the previous year. But an analysis of industry studies casts doubt on that number.
 Stephens Inc., an investment bank that tracks the payday industry, estimated that at least nine million households had used payday loans in 2002. Gregory Elliehausen, senior research scholar at the Credit Research Center at Georgetown University, said that a survey he did found that about 2 percent of payday loan customers were in the military.
 It would be reasonable to conclude, he said, that 2 percent, or 180,000, of those nine million households are military families. That would be just under 26 percent of all military households, based on Pentagon personnel figures. 
 The interest rates they are paying are stratospheric. In Washington State, for example, the annual rates on a two-week payday loan are capped by law at just above 391 percent, but the effective annual rate on shorter-term loans is even higher, and Internet lenders are not subject to those limits. Some payday lenders near military bases in other states have charged annual rates as high as 780 percent, court exhibits show. 
 And yet business is booming, industry analysts say. From 1999 to 2003, the total payday loan volume nationwide increased fourfold, to $40 billion. 
 The presence of payday lenders on the doorsteps of most military bases across the country may be more than accidental.
 Preliminary research by Christopher L. Peterson, a law professor at the University of Florida, and Steven M. Graves, a geography professor at California State University, Northridge, suggests that payday lenders are deliberately setting up shop close to military bases. The researchers are looking at the density of payday lenders around bases in 15 states and are finding that in most places there are far more payday lenders within five miles of the base than would be statistically likely.
 ''Their locational strategy suggests very, very strongly that they target military families,'' Professor Graves said.
 He pointed to Oceanside, Calif., the home of Camp Pendleton. ''That ZIP code has more payday lenders than any other ZIP code in California,'' he said. 

Lenders in Disguise
 No military bases in New York State were included in the professors' study, they said, because payday lending is illegal in the state. But that came as news to Tonya Duncan, whose husband is completing a year in Iraq with the Army in the 10th Mountain Division, a unit based at Fort Drum in Watertown.
 Mrs. Duncan said she had borrowed money ''about four or five times in the last six months'' from N.Y. Catalog Sales, a local business on the edge of a mall parking lot near the base.
 The catalog sales outlet is typical of a motley collection of high-cost lenders who regulators say are operating in disguise, chiefly in states like New York and North Carolina, which prohibit payday loans. 
 Their role as payday lenders seems clear to customers like Mrs. Duncan. To borrow $300 in cash from N.Y. Catalog Sales, she said, she writes a check for $390, which the catalog sales shop will not cash until payday. But there is a twist: in addition to $300 in cash, she gets $90 in gift certificates to spend on merchandise shown in a dog-eared catalog chained to the counter.
 ''So it's a loan, yes, but it's a loan with no interest,'' she said.
 Stacy Kruse, another Fort Drum spouse who used to borrow regularly from N.Y. Catalog Sales, has a different view of the certificates. ''We just threw them out,'' she said. ''I looked at the catalog and it's just junk.'' 
 Besides, she said: ''Who on earth would buy gift certificates to order stuff to be delivered months from now, when you can buy better, cheaper stuff at Wal-Mart the same day? Obviously, you go there to get a loan.'' 
 Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, agrees. In September, his office filed a lawsuit accusing N.Y. Catalog Sales and the man listed as its ''principal,'' an Alabama businessman named John A. Gill Jr., of making ''unlawful and deceptive'' loans. 
 Mr. Gill, in an affidavit, denied that he had a stake in the company. The store's regional manager, the wife of a soldier at Fort Drum, insisted in court filings that the stores did not make loans. The case is pending.
 About 1,200 miles south of Fort Drum, in a string of storefront shops near the Jacksonville Naval Air Station in Florida, is another small business set up by Mr. Gill.
 It used to do business as Florida Catalog Sales and is now called Florida Internet. One customer was Petty Officer Mark L. Foster Jr., 21, a helicopter mechanic at the base.
 Last spring, just after signing a lease on an apartment, Petty Officer Foster was sent to sea earlier than he had expected. Unable to arrange for his rent to be paid in his absence, he said, he was evicted. The resulting expenses drove him to seek a $500 loan from Florida Internet.
 The paperwork he signed gave him an ''instant cash rebate'' of $500. But it also obligated him to buy a year's worth of Internet access at the extraordinary price of $100 every two weeks. To cancel, he had to pay back $600 -- the $500 ''rebate'' plus the initial $100 in ''usage fees.''
 ''I didn't want Internet access; I never used it,'' Petty Officer Foster said. All he wanted was the money, he said. He quickly realized that he could wind up paying as much as $2,100 in interest on his $500 loan, an annual interest rate of 420 percent. So he went to the local office of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, which gave him an interest-free loan to pay off his $600 obligation.
 Regulators in Florida contend that Florida Internet is an illegally disguised payday lender. In July, state prosecutors filed criminal racketeering charges against the company; similar charges were filed against Mr. Gill in September. Both he and Florida Internet have denied the charges and are awaiting trial.
 Mr. Gill's lawyer, O. Hale Almand of Macon, Ga., would not comment ''because of the pending criminal charges,'' he said.

Stars and Stripes That Sell
 William H. Kennedy, a retired Navy captain and former commanding officer of the aircraft carrier Saratoga, remembers growing more upset the more he examined a traditional loan made to a sailor at the Mayport naval station in Jacksonville, Fla.
 The sailor, troubled by the loan's terms, had come to Captain Kennedy in his new role as director of the local Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society office. 
 Captain Kennedy was bothered, for one thing, by the high annual interest rate: more than 32 percent. Then there were the extra fees: more than $420 on top of the $1,550 loan, most of them for credit insurance policies that the sailor, who had insurance through the military, probably did not need, Captain Kennedy said. And the extra charges were added to the loan, so the sailor was also paying interest on them.
 But what really made Captain Kennedy angry was that the company that had made this loan and many like it, Pioneer Services of Kansas City, Mo., had been endorsed by an influential naval figure, Robert J. Walker, a retired master chief petty officer of the Navy who is a consultant to Pioneer. 
 Even military people who avoid the triple-digit payday lenders are not necessarily home free. Other lenders frequently use people with military affiliations to promote loans with high rates, fees and insurance premiums that drive up the cost of credit.
 ''Obviously, they're better than the payday lenders,'' Captain Kennedy said of these companies, ''but these are still very high fees and rates.'' 
 The credit insurance sold to most Pioneer borrowers is ''a waste of money,'' said Jean Ann Fox, consumer protection director for the Consumer Federation of America. Most military people have ample insurance, she said, and if they want more to cover a debt, ''there are far less expensive ways to get it.''
 Mr. Kennedy did not stew about Pioneer, he said. ''I complained to Bob Walker personally,'' he said, ''because I just can't understand why he would be promoting loans like this for service people.'' 
 Pioneer Services, which also offers mortgages and insurance, has served about 650,000 military families over 20 years, according to Joe Freeman, its director of corporate communications. Its president, Patrick McCarty, is a second-generation West Point graduate. Its paid consultants also include Sgt. Maj. Jack L. Tilley, who was the top enlisted officer in the Army until his retirement last January.
 The company believes that its loans and credit insurance products are reasonably priced, Mr. Freeman said, and its retired military consultants share that belief.
 ''As men who have worked with and for enlisted personnel throughout their distinguished military careers, they believe Pioneer responsibly and ethically provides needed financial services and educational programs to help military families,'' Mr. Freeman said, speaking on their behalf. 
 Pioneer says it has lobbied against the spread of high-cost payday lending and supports a host of military charities and events. But its highly effective ''affinity marketing'' program -- using people with military affiliations to help promote its business -- backfired in Jacksonville, where Pioneer had opened an office in early 2001.
 Within 18 months, Pioneer had drawn fire from Philip A. Mauffray, who was the command master chief for the Navy's southeast regional operations until his retirement last year. In June 2002, Master Chief Mauffray attended a Navy conference at which Master Chief Petty Officer Walker and Mr. McCarty were given time on the agenda to promote the company, a sponsor of the event.
 ''They shouldn't have been there,'' Master Chief Mauffray said. In his view, their role gave the impression that the Navy endorsed their business. ''I made it clear that this was wrong,'' he said.
 Mr. Freeman said he was not aware of any objections to Pioneer's role at conferences.
 But the odd thing about Pioneer's entry into Jacksonville was that it did not actually plan to make any loans there and, indeed, was not licensed to do so.
 Instead, Mr. Freeman said, the Jacksonville office referred loan applicants to a Pioneer office in Georgia, where Pioneer was licensed; or it steered customers to a computer kiosk linked to its Internet loan service, which is licensed in Nevada. Both states permit higher loan rates than Florida allows. 
 By early 2003, Captain Brown, the credit union executive, had started to see a stream of sailors coming in to refinance Pioneer loans, he said, many of them with rates of more than 30 percent. At least half of those sailors qualified for credit union loan rates of no more than 18 percent, he said.
 ''I called the state attorney general's office,'' he said. 
 Pioneer confirmed that it was the subject of a state inquiry in Florida and is also providing information to Georgia regulators. 
 Pioneer closed its Jacksonville office last March. The decision, Mr. Freeman said, was based on low levels of business and was taken months before the company learned of the state inquiry.

Few Rules, Few Solutions
 After a legislative battle, payday lenders were banned from Georgia last May, largely because several military officers had testified before state legislators about how payday loans harmed their troops.
 Such activism by officers is rare, however; the military has traditionally tried to address high-cost debt through financial literacy classes. But teaching 19-year-old recruits to analyze complex credit costs is ''far more of a challenge'' than the military realizes, said Mr. Peterson, the law professor. ''If they really want to protect military consumers,'' he said, ''the money spent on education would be far better spent on enforcement and lobbying to end these practices.''
 But the military does not have much to enforce. The law that puts a 6 percent cap on pre-enlistment debts does not address debts incurred after enlistment. Nor did Congress take up a bill that Representative Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, submitted in October to cap post-enlistment rates at 36 percent.
 The payday industry says military leaders should simply put unscrupulous lenders off limits. That approach is supported by the National Consumer Law Center.
 But such bans have rarely if ever been used against payday lenders, Pentagon lawyers said, even when they face serious legal problems like Mr. Gill's. 
 That leaves the industry's voluntary code of best practices. It urges lenders to refrain from contacting a debtor's commanding officer and to stop all collection efforts when a service member leaves for combat or combat support duty.
 ''But enforcement is the key,'' said Maj. Gen. Steve Siegfried, a retired Army officer who helped draft the code. ''If you don't enforce it, it's just a pretty plaque on the wall.'' 
 The industry association can do little to ''get rid of jackleg outfits who prey on military people,'' he said. But he seemed startled when asked whether the military should disqualify lenders not complying with the code. 
 ''We would applaud the services if they could do that,'' General Siegfried said. ''But I don't think they will.''

HEADLINE: Winners in M.T.A.'s Bond Sale: Underwriters and Politicians

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER

 BODY:
Four years ago, the governor of New York and leading state legislators gave permission for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to pay off old bonds by borrowing $14 billion, creating a steep pile of new debt for a transit system filled with ancient structures, middle-aged equipment and little money to replace them.
 Today, with the M.T.A. facing short- and long-range financial crises, the public benefit of that decision remains a matter of vigorous dispute.
 Yet for two small groups involved in the $14 billion borrowing -- the seven private underwriting firms commissioned by the M.T.A. to raise the money, and leading state political figures who wield influence over the M.T.A. -- the bond issue has been an unambiguous success, an analysis of public records shows.
 The sales of the new bonds generated an estimated $85 million in commissions and fees to the M.T.A.'s bond underwriters, lawyers and financial advisers. 
 In pursuit of a share of profits from those and other M.T.A. deals, the underwriters reported that they paid more than $3 million to consultants, among them three men with ties to Gov. George E. Pataki, who appoints the M.T.A. chairman. 
 And even though the securities industry has tried to limit campaign contributions by companies doing bond work for public agencies, the firms hired by the M.T.A. gave at least $1.1 million to state political funds since 2000, when the decision to borrow the money was announced. 
 Their political contributions peaked in 2002, when most of the bonds were issued. That year, the firms made $408,000 in campaign contributions, twice as much as they gave in the years before and after. 
 The largest was a check for $100,000 paid to the New York State Republican Housekeeping Fund in 2002 by a political action committee at J.P. Morgan Chase, which was the lead underwriter that year on $1.8 billion in M.T.A. bonds. A spokesman for the bank, Michael Dorfsman, would not say what prompted the contribution. 
 A spokesman for the M.T.A., Tom Kelly, said the contributions had no bearing on which underwriting firms were selected. All of the M.T.A. underwriters work with other New York agencies as well. 
 Since 2000, the state's Republican Party or its candidates received about $2 from the M.T.A. underwriters for every $1 given to Democrats, the records show.
 In that period, UBS Financial Services gave $62,000 to the Conservative Party, a small but influential presence in New York that has delivered its spot on the ballot to Governor Pataki all three times he was elected. UBS also contributed $115,000 to the Democratic Party, which controls the State Assembly, and $109,000 to the Republicans, who hold a majority in the State Senate, along with the governor's office.
 A spokeswoman for UBS, Susan Austin, said, ''All contributions made by UBS Financial Services Inc. as a firm -- and contributions made by the firm's employees -- are made in compliance'' with industry rules and state laws. 
 The adequacy of those rules has been reconsidered in recent months by the governing body of the public finance industry, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which has expressed concern that government agencies, known as issuers, have pressured underwriters seeking their business to hire certain consultants or make political contributions, according to the board's executive director, Christopher A. Taylor.
 ''The board members are well aware of what practices are going on, the pressures being brought to bear on them by issuers,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''We were looking at trends that caused concern on the part of the board: increased use of consultants, increased compensation, increased political giving.'' He was speaking, he said, about the industry in general and not a specific agency.
 In the early 1990's, the board developed regulations to eliminate ''pay to play,'' the practice of underwriters making campaign contributions in exchange for public business. Even so, these rules -- issued after widely reported scandals in the industry -- have allowed underwriting firms to continue to make substantial political contributions in New York and elsewhere. 
 Political money may be given by affiliates of the underwriters not directly involved in public finance or can be channeled into general party housekeeping accounts, Mr. Taylor said. The board warned the industry last year that payments to political housekeeping accounts could not be used to make contributions that were otherwise forbidden, he said.
 As for consultants, the board recently proposed banning them but dropped the idea after protests from its members, Mr. Taylor said. It is now considering other limitations. 
 Nixon Peabody, a law firm that was paid $812,000 by the M.T.A. to work on the bond issue -- and which is not bound by the same nominal limits on political donations as the underwriters -- has given $91,000 to Friends of Pataki since 2000, making it the largest corporate contributor to the governor's campaign.
 The firm works with many agencies in New York other than the M.T.A. Including contributions from some of its partners, the firm gave at least $232,000 to public officials and political parties at every level of government in the state, the records show. 
 Arthur F. McMahon, a partner in the firm, did not respond to a request for comment.
 Goldman Sachs, which was paid $12 million by the M.T.A. to be a financial adviser on the bond refinancing deal, gave at least $136,500 to state Republicans and Democrats.
 The smallest amount given by any M.T.A. underwriter was $7,000 from a firm then called Salomon Smith Barney. 
 In 2000, when the M.T.A. solicited proposals for the underwriting positions, Merrill Lynch contributed $15,000 each to the housekeeping accounts of the state Republican and Democratic parties; in mid-2002, the company hired Powers, Crane & Company, a firm that included William Powers, the former chairman of the state's Republican Party. 
 Mr. Powers, now in a firm called Powers & Company, is being paid $16,000 a month to help Merrill Lynch gain state business, according to the latest disclosure records. He did not return a call requesting a comment on his role.
 Mr. Kelly, the M.T.A. spokesman, said that seemingly influential consultants played no role in the choice of underwriters. ''None of the people that you mention were involved in the selection process, met with anyone in the selection committee, or to the best of what they're telling me, ever discussed it with anybody,'' Mr. Kelly said.
 At least two of the M.T.A.'s underwriters, however, stated unequivocally that their consultants helped them get M.T.A. business, according to disclosure forms.
 First Albany, which did not participate in the $14 billion refinancing but went on to capture other M.T.A. work, listed Davidson & O'Mara as its consultant, for a fee that reached $20,000 a month. John O'Mara, the former chairman of the Public Services Commission under Governor Pataki, is a partner in the firm. He is the chairman of a panel that screens judicial candidates for the governor, and also represents him in negotiations over Indian tribal land claims, many related to casino development. 
 First Albany did not reply to a request to discuss the matter, but shortly after it was selected as one of the underwriters for M.T.A. work in 2000, the company reported that Mr. O'Mara had made that happen. ''First Albany was recently appointed to the senior manager rotation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,'' the report stated, under the heading ''municipal securities business obtained or retained'' by the O'Mara firm. The report was submitted to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
 Similarly, disclosure forms filed by UBS Financial Services state that Douglas Rutnik, employed at a fee of $5,000 a month, plus bonuses, helped it win M.T.A. business. Beginning in 2003, he was employed by Morgan Stanley at $10,000 a month, plus bonuses, according to disclosure forms, but these do not list any successes. 
 Mr. Rutnik, who did not respond to a request for comment, is solidly grounded in both political parties. A prominent upstate Democrat, he was a frequent hunting companion of the late Erastus Corning, the mayor of Albany for 42 years, and he has also been the companion of Zenia Mucha, the former director of communications for Governor Pataki. Mark Lane, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said the firm would not discuss Mr. Rutnik's services. 
 The M.T.A. bond sales are described in the industry as the largest refinancing in the history of municipal bonds. The amount of money borrowed is more than the cost of the most expensive public works projects ever undertaken by the state. Yet only a fraction of it will go toward the purchase of tangible new things like subway cars or new track. 
 Most of the money raised went to paying off existing bonds that were due to be retired within the next decade. The interest on the bonds that replaced them will continue until 2034. In effect, the M.T.A. has prolonged the payments for equipment bought years ago, and increased the interest costs by $8.6 billion, according to a report by Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, and Kenneth B. Bleiwas, the deputy state comptroller for New York City. 
 Gene Russianoff, who has closely monitored the transit system for 25 years as a leader of the Straphangers Campaign, warned in 2000 that the refinancing plan, while granting a short spell of fiscal peace, simply postponed some problems and would cripple the system with debt. In a rare alliance, Mr. Russianoff was joined in his critique by a former M.T.A. chairman, Robert R. Kiley, and the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, Sonny Hall, as well as independent budget monitors. 
 Nevertheless, a capital review board with delegates from the State Legislature, the governor and the city gave their approval to the refinancing. 
 M.T.A. officials said that by refinancing at lower interest rates -- along with improvements to its bond ratings -- the agency received about $4 billion in ''new money.'' That let the agency pay for its capital program for a short period without immediate pressure on the state budget or transit fares. 
 That respite has ended. The annual interest costs borne by the transit system will double between this year and 2008, according to the controller. By then, payment on the debt will command 21 cents of every dollar collected by the M.T.A.. Even with significant service cuts, M.T.A. officials say, fare increases will be needed to pay the mounting debt burden and higher labor costs. 
 Moreover, the costs of the 2002 bond refinancing will absorb so much money in the coming decades that the M.T.A. does not have funds to pay for ordinary replacement of equipment and facilities that have reached the end of their useful lives. 
 When Mr. Hevesi issued a report critical of the M.T.A. in late October, Peter Kalikow, the current chairman of the M.T.A., said responsibility for the $14 billion borrowing program rested not just with the M.T.A. but across a spectrum of New York public officials. 
 ''He ignores the fact that the entire plan and its financing structure were unanimously approved by the Capital Program Review Board, comprised of representatives of both city and state government,'' Mr. Kalikow said in a written reply to Mr. Hevesi's report, alluding to Mr. Hevesi. 
 Last week, Mr. Kalikow proposed an array of tax increases to finance the agency's capital needs.

HEADLINE: OPEC May Weigh Cutting Some Production

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices have been at record highs this year, with money flowing into the coffers of oil producers thanks to the world's growing thirst for oil. But as OPEC leaders head into a fifth and final meeting this year on Friday, the topic on their minds and on the agenda is whether the world will have too much oil next year. For some, production cuts may be in order.
 After hitting a record of more than $55 a barrel in October, oil prices in New York have since fallen by 23 percent. Under pressure to bring down oil prices, OPEC's members began pumping at full capacity this summer and continue to do so. 
 Now, because of OPEC's efforts, there is more oil on the market than is needed to meet demand. With the group's production at its highest in 25 years, some producers fear oil prices will tumble as demand slows next year in the wake of high prices and a usual seasonal brake in the second quarter. This means OPEC may be tempted to act pre-emptively and reduce output. 
 ''As an oil producer, OPEC wants to make sure that all the risk is on the upside,'' said Manouchehr Takin, an oil analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. ''They'll want to cut output in anticipation.'' 
 Oil prices bounced back from a three-month low on Monday, rising to $42.98, up 1 percent, after gunmen attacked the United States consulate in the city of Jidda in Saudi Arabia. Prices were also spurred by events in Nigeria, where militants stormed three pumping stations. The price of oil is 40 percent higher than a year ago but still below prices in the late 1970's and early 1980's when adjusted for inflation.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose members account for half the world's oil exports, can affect prices by increasing production to push prices down or reining in output to nudge them up. 
 Since December 2003, OPEC's reference price, which trades at a slight discount to New York prices, has been way above the group's self-imposed target range of $22 to $28 a barrel, prompting discussions within OPEC of raising the band to reflect higher prices.
 So far, the strongest call for a production cut has come from Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, which argues that member countries should stick to their assigned production quotas. Most are now pumping above their targets to meet demand. 
 OPEC now produces 28 million barrels a day, a million barrels above the group's quota -- OPEC's self-imposed production ceiling -- of 27 million barrels a day. Including oil from Iraq, which is a member but has not been assigned a quota since the 1990's, the group's output is about 30 million barrels a day.
 But few members are showing their hands ahead of the meeting in Cairo on Friday. Others, like Libya or Kuwait, have indicated they are ready to cut production to comply with lower quotas.
 But the country that oil markets will be watching most closely is Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter. As OPEC's top producer, it has the most influence. Because it also keeps idle capacity, it can affect the oil market like no other. 
 Yesterday's attacks indicated that despite its crackdown on Al Qaeda militants, Saudi Arabia was still vulnerable to terrorism. At least nine people were reported to have been killed, including five local employees who were not American. 
 Saudi Arabia increased its daily production to 9.5 million barrels in recent months, producing way above its quota of 8.5 million barrels. It is also drawing up plans to increase its sustainable capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day in the next few years, from 11 million barrels now.
 ''We are doing what we can, we are doing our best, but we are going to do some more,'' Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told a conference at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London on Nov. 29, according to Reuters. For now, he said, ''There is no shortage of supply in the market.''
 Cutting output now would be premature, Mr. Takin, the London oil analyst, said. Few of the issues that have pushed prices up this year have been resolved. Iraq is still at war; Venezuela's political stability under President Hugo Chavez remains unsure; the Russian government is still fighting it out with the country's largest oil producer, Yukos; and in Nigeria, the government is still facing opposition over the redistribution of the country's oil wealth.
 Still, global oil demand will slow after this year's sizzling 3.3 percent growth -- the fastest growth since 1978 and double last year's. The International Energy Agency, an advisory group to industrialized countries based in Paris, estimates demand will rise 1.7 percent, to 83.8 million barrels a day, in 2005.
 ''So long as prices were rising, it made sense to increase production,'' said Deborah White, an economist at Societe Generale in Paris. ''But given how much prices have fallen in the past month, it makes no sense to continue on that path.''
 One factor that weighs on OPEC's debate is that oil inventories, or commercial oil stocks in consuming nations, are rising. That could mean an oversupply of 400,000 barrels a day this quarter, said Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consultant.
 ''Could oil prices continue to fall through the end of the year? Yes, because supply is ample for now,'' Cambridge Energy said in a recent study. It said OPEC would not cut production unless prices dropped below $40 to $45 a barrel.
 The continuing decline of the dollar against the euro is also hurting oil producers, who sell their products in dollars but make some purchases in euros and have euro-denominated debt. 
 Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, an oil consulting firm in Washington, said, ''The Saudis will be cautious but they may trim a little bit of production.''
 Mr. Takin said that Saudi Arabia is aiming for oil at $30 to $35 a barrel. ''That's the lowest they can afford in order to pay their bills and deal with their serious domestic situation,'' he said. 
 While OPEC seems committed to bringing prices down from their current level, some analysts said it was the group's policies last year that spurred this year's price surge. ''For sure, no question about that,'' said Jan Stuart, head of energy research at Fimat USA in New York. ''OPEC played a part.''
 Within a 10-month period starting in April 2003, OPEC lowered its ceiling three times, cutting quotas by 1.9 million barrels a day to 23.5 million barrels, at a time when markets were getting anxious about issues like Iraq, Venezuela and Russia. That precipitated this summer's oil-price run. 
 By the time OPEC decided to open its taps again, it was too late to slow the markets. Partly because of OPEC's policies, over the last four years oil prices have averaged $30 a barrel, in contrast to $20 through the 1990's. Some analysts said Saudi Arabia was deliberately nudging prices up by keeping inventories in the West low.
 ''That's been Saudi policy for some time, but they may have been a little bit too clever,'' said Adam Sieminski, a global oil strategist for Deutsche Bank. ''Keeping inventories low makes sense when there's enough spare capacity. But keeping inventories low when there is no spare capacity is asking for trouble.'' 
 Mr. Stuart, the analyst from Fimat, said, ''The calculation is very different from the 1980's and 1990's, when the Saudis were interested in securing market share. Now they are among the bigger price hawks. That's a really big change.''

HEADLINE: After 30 Years, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve Will Finally Be Full

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: FREEPORT, Tex. 

 BODY:
A swamp near here is one of the most secretive places in America. There are no signs, just a 500-acre complex protected at all times by 30 armed guards in combat fatigues patrolling in sport utility vehicles.
 This is part of the world's largest and most expensive filling station, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where a large portion of the government's nearly 700 million barrels of oil are stored in underground salt shafts that are supposed to be stable into the 2020's.
 American taxpayers have invested about $20 billion to build and stock this reserve and three others in hidden places since it was created in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo that began two years earlier. And now, after 29 years, it is finally about to be filled to the brim for the first time. 
 Some oil economists say these reserves are having important effects on oil prices. They assume that the United States will no longer be putting upward pressure on oil prices by adding to the reserve, while that huge reservoir will reduce the country's vulnerability to any new shock and soothe the ''fear premium'' that elevates gas prices. Others say they will simply sleep better, knowing that America has a secure energy supply.
 But whether America is no longer vulnerable is not entirely clear, any more than the direction of oil prices themselves. What is clear, from a rare visit permitted by the Energy Department, which manages the reserve, is that this little-known operation is a colossus and nerve center in the energy world.
 ''For a while it seemed like no one had heard of us and then, boom, we're on the radar screen,'' Gregory Magallanez, site operations specialist at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said in an interview as contractors drove around the complex in small electric-powered vehicles.
 Usually the only unannounced visitors here are white egrets or the occasional seagull, Mr. Magallanez said. ''The attention is a little worrisome sometimes.''
 After Sept. 11, President Bush decided to fill the reserve to its maximum in hopes of creating an insurance policy in the event of another oil shock.
 ''Say you wake up one day and there's been an Iranian-style revolution in Riyadh,'' said David Pursell, an expert on the reserve and a principal with Pickering Energy Partners, an energy investment company in Houston. ''You simply wish you had more oil.''
 The question of ensuring a secure energy supply has taken on added significance in the last year, as terrorist groups have taken aim at petroleum installations in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and political turmoil has struck two other large oil exporters, Nigeria and Venezuela. China's growing appetite for oil has only added to the jitters about the global oil supply.
 Even though the reserve will be filled early next year, there is no sense that it has provided the country with enough of a security cushion. Altogether, the reserve would cover only about two months of the country's imported oil needs. In fact, there is growing recognition, and some aggressive exhortation, that the nation's dependence on imported oil and soaring global oil demand have made energy markets increasingly vulnerable to disruptions.
 ''We should consider increasing the reserve even further after it's full,'' said Bill Richardson, a former energy secretary in the Clinton administration and now governor of New Mexico. Indeed, part of the energy bill Congress might consider next year would increase the reserve in the United States by 300 million barrels, bringing the nation's entire reserve system to a billion barrels.
 ''I also think we should creatively find ways of releasing oil from the reserve while working together with OPEC in an effort to bring prices down,'' Mr. Richardson added, in a nod to the potential impact that filling the reserves could have on oil prices. ''OPEC's in a box right now and because of our continuing dependence on imported oil, so are we.''
 Simply the notion of a full American reserve seems to have encouraged other countries to fortify their own energy storehouses. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Germany already have theirs. China, which surpassed Japan in the last year as the second-largest importer of oil, and India, which is competing with China for oil supplies in some developing countries, are also moving ahead with plans to build their own strategic oil reserves. Even Russia, the largest oil producer, is considering building a reserve.
 Energy experts expect the new reserves to be modeled largely on the American system, which includes three other sites in Texas and Louisiana. The site here, built on a swampy hill called Bryan Mound southeast of Houston, is the reserve's largest complex, with 232 million barrels of crude oil stored almost entirely underground in immense salt domes.
 Not everyone, of course, is enthusiastic about the reserve's usefulness. The costly system has been criticized since its creation three decades ago. Energy industry executives estimate that since then the government has spent more than $20 billion to build the system and keep it stocked. The reserve emerged as a thorny political issue this year, with Democrats calling on the Bush administration to release oil from the system in an attempt to ease rising fuel prices, much as President Bill Clinton tried to do in 2000.
 Free market advocates aligned with President Bush's own party, meanwhile, have renewed calls to do away with the reserve altogether as a way of removing government involvement in the pricing of crude oil. Despite concern over high oil prices, neither proposal has gained ground while worries persist over threats to petroleum security in the Middle East, the world's main source of oil exports.
 The potential enlargement of the reserve in the United States and the creation of reserves elsewhere might put additional pressure on oil prices.
 But only about 100,000 barrels a day go into the United States reserves out of worldwide consumption of 82 million barrels. The United States consumes about 20 million barrels of oil a day, or about a quarter of global consumption, so at its current level of about 671 million barrels, the reserves would provide the equivalent of just two months of crude imports.
 It is impossible to know exactly how a complete withdrawal of the reserve's oil would play out since that has never happened before. Altogether, technicians at the reserve estimate it can release a total of 4.5 million barrels a day, falling substantially short of current domestic consumption. The two largest withdrawals were 17 million barrels during the Gulf War in 1991 and 30 million barrels in 2000, neither of significant size or duration.
 Here in Freeport, the reserve functions differently from systems in countries like Japan, where private companies are required to store oil and refined gasoline to complement the government's own inventories. In the United States, the reserve consists almost entirely of unrefined oil acquired directly from producers instead of purchases of oil on the open market.
 The government takes the oil in place of royalty payments that energy companies normally make to drill on public land, though some imported crude also goes to the reserve through exchanges to acquire a variety of sweet and sour blends of crude.
 Security measures at the Freeport complex, which was originally created by the Dow Chemical Company to store magnesium, have been enhanced in the last three years. Visitors to the reserve are required to be American citizens, a rule waived recently when technicians from Russia and India toured the site as part of studies toward creating their own reserves. Thirty armed guards in gray combat fatigues patrol the 500-acre site around the clock.
 ''The costs of creating a reserve are high, but minimal in comparison to a catastrophic oil shock disruption,'' said Gal Luft, executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, an organization in Washington that studies energy security issues and that is pushing for three one-billion-barrel reserves in North America, Europe and Asia to be built over the next decade.
 ''The problem is that new reserves aren't being created at a pace that equals the decline in spare oil production capacity around the world,'' Mr. Luft said. ''Obviously, 700 million barrels in this country is not enough.''

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
CELIA MONTGOMERY, a 30-year-old actress and playwright and paralegal, is bent over a laptop in her new apartment, trying to find out why the Oriental rug she ordered on the Internet has not been delivered.
 Ms. Montgomery, who has just moved from her Times Square environs to a space twice as big in Sunnyside, Queens, shops in Midtown stores like Kenneth Cole, Benetton and H&M during her lunch hour. After work, she surfs the Web to furnish her home. ''For things you can't try on like posters and lamps, it's great,'' she said. ''Or for clothes that are insane bargains.''
 Or not. Faced with technology that lets Americans shop every minute, even august retailers like Bergdorf Goodman are jumping into the new age. In just three months of selling on the Internet, Bergdorf has received orders from 49 states, with only Alaska left untapped. At 3 a.m. a few days ago, a shopper in Talent, Ore., bought a $1,000 Badgley Mischka handbag covered in feathers. Two hours later, another night owl bought a $475 pair of suede Robert Clergerie pumps, size 8. 
 ''Customers are becoming much more comfortable shopping at home,'' said Marshal Cohen, senior researcher at NPD Group, retail consultants.
 At home. At work. In big boxes. In places you never thought of five years ago. Shopping today can be a seamless experience that begins when you wake up -- quick, start your day with a television shopping show -- resumes with a discreet scan through the latest eBay listings at your desk and continues when you slip out for an afternoon latte and come back with Christmas mugs and a cappuccino machine.
 In the car, swing by Home Depot for the late-night special on a Makita portable table saw. Then it's time for a sybaritic wallow in holiday catalogs -- here's a bargain on linen-colored Egyptian cotton towels -- and a chance to peruse glossy new shopping magazines like Lucky and Shop.
 One way or another, retailing has a huge impact on the economy, representing roughly 24 percent of gross domestic product. Last year, sales in stores were almost $2.5 trillion, up $120 billion from the year before, but barely keeping up with inflation.
 Americans have become both avid luxury consumers and diehard bargain hunters, economists say.
 At this paradoxical juncture, the Internet has become a powerful force -- accelerating both trends. Within the last five years, shopping and the way things are sold have been caught up in perhaps the biggest retail revolution since the advent of the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Each year, more people shop on the Internet, and economists and social scientists are rushing to study the effects of what they call the shifting channels of distribution.
 Scott A. Neslin, an economist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, just finished a paper on the changing ways Americans buy. What he found underscores the complexity of the new environment: Internet shoppers have less loyalty to a particular virtual ''store'' than they do to a real store or even to a particular catalog. That is because the amount of human-to-human interaction is reduced. ''When a merchant doesn't have the sweater you want in the color you want, it's much easier to just flip to another site,'' he said. 
 Melissa Payner-Gregor, chief executive of Bluefly.com, agrees that old-fashioned stores have their advantages. Bluefly just opened a temporary store in Manhattan's SoHo. ''The consumer feels that if there's a flagship store it lends credibility to the whole thing,'' she said.
 Staying nimble and attuned to customer sentiment may be the only way to succeed because, despite all the different ways to shop, the pie has not gotten much bigger, said Mr. Neslin's colleague, Kusum L. Ailawadi, who teaches retail econometrics at Tuck. And price competition, she said, has taken consumer goods ''past the point of diminishing returns'' for the whole economy.
 F. A. O. Schwarz, the venerable toy store, went broke trying to beat Toys ''R'' Us on prices. So when Schwarz came back this Christmas season, it decided to raise prices and offer ''differentiated'' toys, many customized for their young customers. You can now pick your own Steiff purebred plush dogs, for example, complete with a certificate from the American Kennel Club. (Puppies, the catalog says, can be delivered later.) 
 How easy it seemed when there was just one big mall near your house; with Saks Fifth Avenue at one end, J. C. Penney at the other. Only a short time ago, there were not only established shopping hours but also established shopping seasons: back-to-school, Christmas, Easter. Now experts say the Easter and back-to-school shopping seasons have almost disappeared, and Christmas may not be far behind. The Christmas gifts have changed, too, from mostly clothes and fragrance -- remember the invariable striped tie for Dad, the cologne for Mom? -- to electronics or gift cards for the whole family.
 Many malls are turning into what developers call town centers or lifestyle centers, supposedly friendlier words to lure those for whom the word ''mall'' has become anathema: endless corridors with splashing fountains, plastic food courts and creepy Muzak. Today's shopping centers have restaurants you can park next to and every teenage-oriented specialty chain imaginable. Moribund department stores have been replaced by multiplex movie theaters and Cheesecake Factories, with condominiums clustered on the outskirts.
 Women, who used to shop as recreation, now shop more like men, said John D. Morris, a retail analyst with Harris Nesbitt, who writes an annual report on shopper trends. In his research gathered through ''shopalongs'' with groups of consumers in the last six months, Mr. Morris found that ''women used to be gatherers, now they are shopping like hunters.'' They know what they want and they have a list of goods found in catalogs, checked on the Web and verified in the stores for quality and fit.
 For department stores, this is merely the latest challenge.
 Department store chains still sell $62 billion a year, about 25 percent of the country's clothes and home furnishings, according to NPD. But that figure has not grown, as older customers died off and younger customers started deserting them for new specialty retailers like Sephora, an international chain that sells makeup and perfume (once the exclusive province of the department stores). Teenagers, wooed by Pacific Sunwear and Hot Topic, told pollsters they wouldn't be caught dead in a department store. Their parents had long ago succumbed to the Gap and stores like Talbots and Eddie Bauer. And increasingly, the whole family shops at Wal-Mart and Target.
 Shopping preferences do not necessarily reflect income, either.
 In a recent study by the American Affluence Research Center in Pinecrest, Fla., individuals who made at least $359,000 a year picked their favorite stores. The women's choice? Sixty-one percent chose Target. Sixty percent of the men picked Home Depot. Men and women liked Costco next. (Nordstrom was ranked No. 4; Saks Fifth Avenue, 14.)
 Burt Tansky, the chairman of Neiman Marcus, was there when the department stores started losing their touch. ''If you roll back 30 years, the department stores were everything,'' he said. ''They held the world, they sold clothes and furniture and stoves and typewriters. Then they started abdicating: to Home Depot, to Circuit City, who realized there was an enormous void. At the same time, they gave up on service.''
 To recapture this lost trade, and, they hoped, gain a new generation of shoppers, America's best-known department stores first tried slashing prices, then learned painfully that they couldn't beat the discount stores at their own low-price game.
 About 18 months ago, the stores, almost in unison, got out their hammers and drills. Influenced by Selfridges in London, they started trying to bring ''entertainment'' and ''differentiation'' into their environments because shoppers were telling pollsters all the department stores looked alike and had the same merchandise. Elaborate cornices and wrought-iron staircases buried under layers of Sheetrock were exposed at Marshall Field's. Boutiques were installed to sell pens made out of rare wood, the hottest bicycles and even pets and accessories.
 At Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, executives are debating a computerized check-in, like those at some Las Vegas casinos, offering deals and discounts to shoppers who spend over a certain amount in their establishment. All of them say they are installing more help desks and better fitting rooms, and leather-seated hang-out areas for uninterested spouses to read their newspapers.
 Is it possible to make the downtown stores a destination again?
 Happily for them, there are still women like Elissa Hutner, a lawyer who calls herself an inveterate shopper. ''I love going to the stores, putting things together, spending two weeks finding the perfect blouse to go with an outfit,'' she said. ''And it's more fun if it's a real bargain, and I have gotten some real bargains in my time.'' She calls shopping a project, especially if she has a special event, like a wedding. ''I go to Bergdorf's, Saks, Barneys, maybe Searle -- all the high-end places to see what they have, and sometimes I find the bargain right there. But usually, I go to the discounters: Filene's, Loehmann's, Century 21.''
 Yet even Ms. Hutner has responded to the late-night allure of the televised shopping shows. ''I started buying jewelry on ShopNBC,'' she said. ''Oh, and I bought a vacuum cleaner, I think it was on QVC. And I shopped for kitchen hardware and curtain rods, because they're a pain in the neck to schlep home. I've even bought books. But I still enjoy going to a bookstore.''
 However seamless the new world of shopping may appear, there are still snags. 
 Ms. Montgomery, the paralegal who moved to Queens, said the Internet provided a way for her and her mother, a retired college professor in North Adams, Mass., to shop together again. ''My mom called me up,'' she said. ''She knew I was looking for a rug and she told me to look at one on the Linens 'n Things site and I liked it, too, and I ordered it.''
 But the living-room rug, a 5-by-8-foot wool Heriz, still had not arrived. Federal Express had delivered it to the wrong address and would try again the next day. ''It's frustrating,'' she said, ''but I really couldn't have gotten it home in a taxicab.'' She sighed. ''No matter how you do it, shopping is still hard.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Consulate In a Saudi City Is Hit, Killing 9

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo for this article, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Five attackers thought to be linked to Al Qaeda staged a daytime raid on the American Consulate here on Monday, storming through a fortified gate into the sprawling compound and starting a three-hour gun battle that left five consulate employees and four of the attackers dead. 
 It was the first deadly assault against a large foreign target in this country in seven months, and the first against a Western diplomatic mission since a string of terrorist attacks erupted here in May 2003. No Americans were killed in the raid, but the attackers' rapid penetration of the compound raised questions about how vulnerable American diplomatic sites may be even after a concerted campaign in recent years to make them more secure. 
 The attack fell exactly a year after the Interior Ministry took the exceptional step of listing the 26 most wanted terrorists linked to Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia. In the ensuing year, about 17 of them have been captured or killed in many skirmishes throughout the desert kingdom. 
 But the raid on Monday was a reminder that the increasingly fragmented group was still capable of major attacks. The choice of an American target, and one designed with heavy security precautions, may have been an attempt by Al Qaeda to win back some of the support it lost here by killing civilians, including many Saudis and other Arabs, in several attacks against residential compounds.
 A brief announcement from the Interior Ministry, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said that ''members of a deviant group threw explosives at the gate of the U.S. Consulate.'' The terminology is the ministry's usual shorthand for the offshoots of the terrorist network Al Qaeda operating inside Saudi Arabia.
 The announcement said Saudi security forces wanted to assure the public that they were determined to stamp out anyone attempting to bring ''schisms and corruption'' into the country.
 The attack brought a huge swath of Jidda, Saudi Arabia's financial and trade hub, to a standstill. News of the raid was also followed by a small jump in world oil prices.
 During a news conference in Washington, President Bush thanked the Saudi government for responding to the attack quickly and vowed to resist pressure from terrorists.
 ''The attacks in Saudi Arabia remind us that the terrorists are still on the move,'' he said. ''They're interested in affecting the will of free countries. They want us to leave Saudi Arabia. They want us to leave Iraq. They want us to grow timid and weary in the face of their willingness to kill randomly and kill innocent people.'' 
 Streets were sealed around the consulate, which lies near the waterfront. Witnesses stopped to gape at a helicopter circling above the heavy black smoke billowing into the gray winter sky from a building set on fire inside the compound. 
 According to accounts by American officials here and in Washington, and by witnesses, the attack started around 11:15 a.m., with the gunmen trying to drive into a side entrance of the compound, the one usually used by employees and visa applicants. 
 The compound, which housed the embassy until 1984, and which covers nearly an entire city block, has long been surrounded by 10-foot yellow sandstone walls that until recently were capped with razor wire interlaced with bougainvillea blossoms. The flowers and barbed wire are gone now, replaced by an extra few feet of fence consisting of iron rods tipped with spikes.
 Other security upgrades include a fortified guardhouse and more external cameras, said J. Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman, speaking at a briefing in Washington. He added that the attack would be studied to find out how the compound proved vulnerable.
 The vehicle somehow managed to get by the first barrier into a closed lane used to funnel traffic in the compound. But it was stopped by a barrier farther in, said Carol R. Kalin, the spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Riyadh. 
 The attackers, using a combination of gunfire and perhaps some sound grenades or small explosive devices, created enough of a diversion to storm their way past the guardhouse into the compound. 
 ''All the Saudi security guards were shooting heavily,'' said Muhammad Mahmoud Fouad, an Egyptian who works here and was caught in traffic about 100 yards from the shootout. ''There was a guard up on the watchtower, and he was firing, too. There were so many people firing that it was impossible to tell how many were involved.''
 About 15 minutes after the gunfire erupted, Mr. Fouad said, there was an explosion, and pillars of smoke erupted from the compound. 
 One of the first buildings the gunmen attacked was the Marine barracks, which caught fire, American officials said. Then the attackers tried but failed to enter the main consulate building, a one-story concrete bungalow. 
 The consulate's Marine guards, alerted by the noise of the attack, had gone to the main building and led most of the employees to an unspecified safe haven. It is unclear whether the guards were involved in the firefight. 
 The American government would not say how many employees worked at the consulate, but there is a heavy economic contingent here because of the amount of trade that flows through Jidda. 
 Five consulate employees were killed in the attack, and four were seriously wounded, the embassy said. While no Americans died, a few suffered minor scrapes and bruises. Those killed included a local security guard, and the rest were thought to have been drivers or other staff from the motor pool who appeared to have been caught outside. 
 The Saudi government said civilians had been wounded in the attack. It also said five Saudi security officers were hurt when they rushed the compound, though all were treated and released afterward. Officials said three of the attackers were killed at the compound, and a fourth died of his injuries later.
 The statement said those killed were a Yemeni, a Sudanese, a Filipino, a Pakistani and a Sri Lankan, while those wounded included two Yemenis, two Pakistanis, a Lebanese, a Filipino, an Indian and a Sri Lankan. 
 At the Saudi Embassy in Washington, Adel al-Jubair, an aide to Crown Prince Abdullah, told reporters that the attackers had called an emergency line in the kingdom to announce that they were members of the Falluja Brigades and had seized about 15 hostages. But he and American officials said no hostages had been held at any time within the compound. 
 The American Embassy in Riyadh and the consulate in Dhahran were closed as a precaution immediately after the attack in Jidda started, and they will remain closed on Tuesday, Ms. Kalin said. 
 A series of attacks last spring, including the beheading of Paul M. Johnson Jr., a helicopter engineer, had unsettled the American and other foreign communities here, not least because the American Embassy warned all its citizens that they should depart. By some estimates, including the number of children at the American school in Riyadh, the American community of some 35,000 shrank by one fifth. 
 But the attacks, which have killed more than 75 people since May 2003, seemed to abate, with the American Embassy issuing a slightly reduced threat warning in October and noting that counterterrorism efforts in Saudi Arabia had hampered the ability of the militants to act. 
 In the past couple of months there have been several raids on suspected hide-outs for members of Al Qaeda in Jidda, with reports that one of the few known remaining leaders had died in one such attack. But in an early November issue of the newsletter Sawt Al Jihad, the group mocked the notion that the assault by the security police had undermined its ability to act.
 The attack on Monday seemed to bring an immediate payoff in support from those who applaud such violence, via numerous Internet bulletin boards popular with militants.
 One writer lauded it as the ''destruction of a bastion of atheism.'' Another said, ''We feared for our brothers on the Arabian Peninsula, but this proves that they are well and sound, thanks be to God.'' 
 There were also critics, however, who said among other things that such attacks helped to destroy the image of Islam, killed innocent souls and made the believers afraid. ''Is this what Osama bin Laden promised two weeks ago when he said that he would fight the Americans?'' wrote one Web contributor. ''Is killing an innocent Islamic soul fighting Americans?''

HEADLINE: String Theory, at 20, Explains It All (or Not)

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo. 

 BODY:
They all laughed 20 years ago. 
 It was then that a physicist named John Schwarz jumped up on the stage during a cabaret at the physics center here and began babbling about having discovered a theory that could explain everything. By prearrangement men in white suits swooped in and carried away Dr. Schwarz, then a little-known researcher at the California Institute of Technology.
 Only a few of the laughing audience members knew that Dr. Schwarz was not entirely joking. He and his collaborator, Dr. Michael Green, now at Cambridge University, had just finished a calculation that would change the way physics was done. They had shown that it was possible for the first time to write down a single equation that could explain all the laws of physics, all the forces of nature -- the proverbial ''theory of everything'' that could be written on a T-shirt. 
 And so emerged into the limelight a strange new concept of nature, called string theory, so named because it depicts the basic constituents of the universe as tiny wriggling strings, not point particles.
 ''That was our first public announcement,'' Dr. Schwarz said recently. 
 By uniting all the forces, string theory had the potential of achieving the goal that Einstein sought without success for half his life and that has embodied the dreams of every physicist since then. If true, it could be used like a searchlight to illuminate some of the deepest mysteries physicists can imagine, like the origin of space and time in the Big Bang and the putative death of space and time at the infinitely dense centers of black holes.
 In the last 20 years, string theory has become a major branch of physics. Physicists and mathematicians conversant in strings are courted and recruited like star quarterbacks by universities eager to establish their research credentials. String theory has been celebrated and explained in best-selling books like ''The Elegant Universe,'' by Dr. Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University, and even on popular television shows.
 Last summer in Aspen, Dr. Schwarz and Dr. Green (of Cambridge) cut a cake decorated with ''20th Anniversary of the First Revolution Started in Aspen,'' as they and other theorists celebrated the anniversary of their big breakthrough. But even as they ate cake and drank wine, the string theorists admitted that after 20 years, they still did not know how to test string theory, or even what it meant.
 As a result, the goal of explaining all the features of the modern world is as far away as ever, they say. And some physicists outside the string theory camp are growing restive. At another meeting, at the Aspen Institute for Humanities, only a few days before the string commemoration, Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a cosmologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, called string theory ''a colossal failure.''
 String theorists agree that it has been a long, strange trip, but they still have faith that they will complete the journey.
 ''Twenty years ago no one would have correctly predicted how string theory has since developed,'' said Dr. Andrew Strominger of Harvard. ''There is disappointment that despite all our efforts, experimental verification or disproof still seems far away. On the other hand, the depth and beauty of the subject, and the way it has reached out, influenced and connected other areas of physics and mathematics, is beyond the wildest imaginations of 20 years ago.''
 In a way, the story of string theory and of the physicists who have followed its siren song for two decades is like a novel that begins with the classic ''what if?''
 What if the basic constituents of nature and matter were not little points, as had been presumed since the time of the Greeks? What if the seeds of reality were rather teeny tiny wiggly little bits of string? And what appear to be different particles like electrons and quarks merely correspond to different ways for the strings to vibrate, different notes on God's guitar?
 It sounds simple, but that small change led physicists into a mathematical labyrinth, in which they describe themselves as wandering, ''exploring almost like experimentalists,'' in the words of Dr. David Gross of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif.
 String theory, the Italian physicist Dr. Daniele Amati once said, was a piece of 21st-century physics that had fallen by accident into the 20th century.
 And, so the joke went, would require 22nd-century mathematics to solve.
 Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., described it this way: ''String theory is not like anything else ever discovered. It is an incredible panoply of ideas about math and physics, so vast, so rich you could say almost anything about it.'' 
 The string revolution had its roots in a quixotic effort in the 1970's to understand the so-called ''strong'' force that binds quarks into particles like protons and neutrons. Why were individual quarks never seen in nature? Perhaps because they were on the ends of strings, said physicists, following up on work by Dr. Gabriele Veneziano of CERN, the European research consortium.
 That would explain why you cannot have a single quark -- you cannot have a string with only one end. Strings seduced many physicists with their mathematical elegance, but they had some problems, like requiring 26 dimensions and a plethora of mysterious particles that did not seem to have anything to do with quarks or the strong force.
 When accelerator experiments supported an alternative theory of quark behavior known as quantum chromodynamics, most physicists consigned strings to the dustbin of history.
 But some theorists thought the mathematics of strings was too beautiful to die.
 In 1974 Dr. Schwarz and Dr. Joel Scherk from the Ecole Normale Superieure in France noticed that one of the mysterious particles predicted by string theory had the properties predicted for the graviton, the particle that would be responsible for transmitting gravity in a quantum theory of gravity, if such a theory existed.
 Without even trying, they realized, string theory had crossed the biggest gulf in physics. Physicists had been stuck for decades trying to reconcile the quirky rules known as quantum mechanics, which govern atomic behavior, with Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes how gravity shapes the cosmos.
 That meant that if string theory was right, it was not just a theory of the strong force; it was a theory of all forces.
 ''I was immediately convinced this was worth devoting my life to,'' Dr. Schwarz recalled ''It's been my life work ever since.''
 It was another 10 years before Dr. Schwarz and Dr. Green (Dr. Scherk died in 1980) finally hit pay dirt. They showed that it was possible to write down a string theory of everything that was not only mathematically consistent but also free of certain absurdities, like the violation of cause and effect, that had plagued earlier quantum gravity calculations.
 In the summer and fall of 1984, as word of the achievement spread, physicists around the world left what they were doing and stormed their blackboards, visions of the Einsteinian grail of a unified theory dancing in their heads. 
 ''Although much work remains to be done there seem to be no insuperable obstacles to deriving all of known physics,'' one set of physicists, known as the Princeton string quartet, wrote about a particularly promising model known as heterotic strings. (The quartet consisted of Dr. Gross; Dr. Jeffrey Harvey and Dr. Emil Martinec, both at the University of Chicago; and Dr. Ryan M. Rohm, now at the University of North Carolina.)

The Music of Strings
 String theory is certainly one of the most musical explanations ever offered for nature, but it is not for the untrained ear. For one thing, the modern version of the theory decreed that there are 10 dimensions of space and time.
 To explain to ordinary mortals why the world appears to have only four dimensions -- one of time and three of space --string theorists adopted a notion first bruited by the German mathematicians Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein in 1926. The extra six dimensions, they said, go around in sub-submicroscopic loops, so tiny that people cannot see them or store old National Geographics in them.
 A simple example, the story goes, is a garden hose. Seen from afar, it is a simple line across the grass, but up close it has a circular cross section. An ant on the hose can go around it as well as travel along its length. To envision the world as seen by string theory, one only has to imagine a tiny, tiny six-dimensional ball at every point in space-time
 But that was only the beginning. In 1995, Dr. Witten showed that what had been five different versions of string theory seemed to be related. He argued that they were all different manifestations of a shadowy, as-yet-undefined entity he called ''M theory,'' with ''M'' standing for mother, matrix, magic, mystery, membrane or even murky.
 In M-theory, the universe has 11 dimensions -- 10 of space and one of time, and it consists not just of strings but also of more extended membranes of various dimension, known generically as ''branes.''
 This new theory has liberated the imaginations of cosmologists. Our own universe, some theorists suggest, may be a four-dimensional brane floating in some higher-dimensional space, like a bubble in a fish tank, perhaps with other branes -- parallel universes -- nearby. Collisions or other interactions between the branes might have touched off the Big Bang that started our own cosmic clock ticking or could produce the dark energy that now seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe, they say.

Toting Up the Scorecard
 One of string theory's biggest triumphs has come in the study of black holes. In Einstein's general relativity, these objects are bottomless pits in space-time, voraciously swallowing everything, even light, that gets too close, but in string theory they are a dense tangle of strings and membranes. 
 In a prodigious calculation in 1995, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Cumrun Vafa, both of Harvard, were able to calculate the information content of a black hole, matching a famous result obtained by Dr. Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University using more indirect means in 1973. Their calculation is viewed by many people as the most important result yet in string theory, Dr. Greene said.
 Another success, Dr. Greene and others said, was the discovery that the shape, or topology, of space, is not fixed but can change, according to string theory. Space can even rip and tear.
 But the scorecard is mixed when it comes to other areas of physics. So far, for example, string theory has had little to say about what might have happened at the instant of the Big Bang..
 Moreover, the theory seems to have too many solutions. One of the biggest dreams that physicists had for the so-called theory of everything was that it would specify a unique prescription of nature, one in which God had no choice, as Einstein once put it, about details like the number of dimensions or the relative masses of elementary particles.
 But recently theorists have estimated that there could be at least 10100 different solutions to the string equations, corresponding to different ways of folding up the extra dimensions and filling them with fields -- gazillions of different possible universes. 
 Some theorists, including Dr. Witten, hold fast to the Einsteinian dream, hoping that a unique answer to the string equations will emerge when they finally figure out what all this 21st-century physics is trying to tell them about the world.
 But that day is still far away. 
 ''We don't know what the deep principle in string theory is,'' Dr. Witten said.
 For most of the 20th century, progress in particle physics was driven by the search for symmetries -- patterns or relationships that remain the same when we swap left for right, travel across the galaxy or imagine running time in reverse. 
 For years physicists have looked for the origins of string theory in some sort of deep and esoteric symmetry, but string theory has turned out to be weirder than that.
 Recently it has painted a picture of nature as a kind of hologram. In the holographic images often seen on bank cards, the illusion of three dimensions is created on a two-dimensional surface. Likewise string theory suggests that in nature all the information about what is happening inside some volume of space is somehow encoded on its outer boundary, according to work by several theorists, including Dr. Juan Maldacena of the Institute for Advanced Study and Dr. Raphael Bousso of the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Just how and why a three-dimensional reality can spring from just two dimensions, or four dimensions can unfold from three, is as baffling to people like Dr. Witten as it probably is to someone reading about it in a newspaper. 
 In effect, as Dr. Witten put it, an extra dimension of space can mysteriously appear out of ''nothing.'' 
 The lesson, he said, may be that time and space are only illusions or approximations, emerging somehow from something more primitive and fundamental about nature, the way protons and neutrons are built of quarks.
 The real secret of string theory, he said, will probably not be new symmetries, but rather a novel prescription for constructing space-time.
 ''It's a new aspect of the theory,'' Dr. Witten said. ''Whether we are getting closer to the deep principle, I don't know.''
 As he put it in a talk in October, ''It's plausible that we will someday understand string theory.''

Tangled in Strings
 Critics of string theory, meanwhile, have been keeping their own scorecard. The most glaring omission is the lack of any experimental evidence for strings or even a single experimental prediction that could prove string theory wrong -- the acid test of the scientific process.
 Strings are generally presumed to be so small that ''stringy'' effects should show up only when particles are smashed together at prohibitive energies, roughly 1019 billion electron volts. That is orders of magnitude beyond the capability of any particle accelerator that will ever be built on earth. Dr. Harvey of Chicago said he sometimes woke up thinking, What am I doing spending my whole career on something that can't be tested experimentally?
 This disparity between theoretical speculation and testable reality has led some critics to suggest that string theory is as much philosophy as science, and that it has diverted the attention and energy of a generation of physicists from other perhaps more worthy pursuits. Others say the theory itself is still too vague and that some promising ideas have not been proved rigorously enough yet.
 Dr. Krauss said, ''We bemoan the fact that Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life on a fruitless quest, but we think it's fine if a thousand theorists spend 30 years of their prime on the same quest.''

The Other Quantum Gravity
 String theory's biggest triumph is still its first one, unifying Einstein's lordly gravity that curves the cosmos and the quantum pinball game of chance that lives inside it. 
 ''Whatever else it is or is not,'' Dr. Harvey said in Aspen, ''string theory is a theory of quantum gravity that gives sensible answers.'' 
 That is no small success, but it may not be unique. 
 String theory has a host of lesser known rivals for the mantle of quantum gravity, in particular a concept called, loop quantum gravity, which arose from work by Dr. Abhay Ashtekar of Penn State and has been carried forward by Dr. Carlo Rovelli of the University of Marseille and Dr. Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, among others.
 Unlike string theory, loop gravity makes no pretensions toward being a theory of everything. It is only a theory of gravity, space and time, arising from the applications of quantum principles to the equations of Einstein's general relativity. The adherents of string theory and of loop gravity have a kind of Microsoft-Apple kind of rivalry, with the former garnering a vast majority of university jobs and publicity.
 Dr. Witten said that string theory had a tendency to absorb the ideas of its critics and rivals. This could happen with loop gravity. Dr. Vafa; his Harvard colleagues, Dr. Sergei Gukov and Dr. Andrew Neitzke; and Dr. Robbert Dijkgraaf of the University of Amsterdam report in a recent paper that they have found a connection between simplified versions of string and loop gravity.
 ''If it exists,'' Dr. Vafa said of loop gravity, ''it should be part of string theory.''

Looking for a Cosmic Connection
 Some theorists have bent their energies recently toward investigating models in which strings could make an observable mark on the sky or in experiments in particle accelerators. 
 ''They all require us to be lucky,'' said Dr. Joe Polchinski of the Kavli Institute.
 For example the thrashing about of strings in the early moments of time could leave fine lumps in a haze of radio waves filling the sky and thought to be the remains of the Big Bang. These might be detectable by the Planck satellite being built by the European Space Agency for a 2007 launching date, said Dr. Greene.
 According to some models, Dr. Polchinski has suggested, some strings could be stretched from their normal submicroscopic lengths to become as big as galaxies or more during a brief cosmic spurt known as inflation, thought to have happened a fraction of a second after the universe was born.
 If everything works out, he said, there will be loops of string in the sky as big as galaxies. Other strings could stretch all the way across the observable universe. The strings, under enormous tension and moving near the speed of light, would wiggle and snap, rippling space-time like a tablecloth with gravitational waves.
 ''It would be like a whip hundreds of light-years long,'' Dr. Polchinski said.
 The signal from these snapping strings, if they exist, should be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which began science observations two years ago, operated by a multinational collaboration led by Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 Another chance for a clue will come in 2007 when the Large Hadron Collider is turned on at CERN in Geneva and starts colliding protons with seven trillion volts of energy apiece. In one version of the theory -- admittedly a long shot -- such collisions could create black holes or particles disappearing into the hidden dimensions.
 Everybody's favorite candidate for what the collider will find is a phenomenon called supersymmetry, which is crucial to string theory. It posits the existence of a whole set of ghostlike elementary particles yet to be discovered. Theorists say they have reason to believe that the lightest of these particles, which have fanciful names like photinos, squarks and selectrons, should have a mass-energy within the range of the collider.
 String theory naturally incorporates supersymmetry, but so do many other theories. Its discovery would not clinch the case for strings, but even Dr. Krauss of Case Western admits that the existence of supersymmetry would be a boon for string theory.
 And what if supersymmetric particles are not discovered at the new collider? Their absence would strain the faith, a bit, but few theorists say they would give up.
 ''It would certainly be a big blow to our chances of understanding string theory in the near future,'' Dr. Witten said.

Beginnings and Endings
 At the end of the Aspen celebration talk turned to the prospect of verification of string theory. Summing up the long march toward acceptance of the theory, Dr. Stephen Shenker, a pioneer string theorist at Stanford, quoted Winston Churchill:
 ''This is not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but perhaps it is the end of the beginning.''
 Dr. Shenker said it would be great to find out that string theory was right.
 From the audience Dr. Greene piped up, ''Wouldn't it be great either way?''
 ''Are you kidding me, Brian?'' Dr. Shenker responded. ''How many years have you sweated on this?''
 But if string theory is wrong, Dr. Greene argued, wouldn't it be good to know so physics could move on? ''Don't you want to know?'' he asked.
 Dr. Shenker amended his remarks. ''It would be great to have an answer,'' he said, adding, ''It would be even better if it's the right one.''

F4)Drawings: The Holographic Universe -- The suggestion that nature is ultimately composed of tiny strings has led to a revolution in our view of the universe. String theory has led theorists to the idea that space and time are illusions. Nature is like the three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional bank card, a hologram. Physicists hope that in the end string theory will help explain how this picture of multi-dimensional reality we call a universe is constructed.
String Too Short To See -- It is possible to explain all the forces of nature in a single unified theory if elementary particles are considered to be not points but wriggling strings. But since they would only be 10-33 centimeters long, they would be hard to see.
Strings Into Branes -- String theorists can weave more out of their mathematics than just strings. The strings might be stuck to membranes of various dimension known as ''branes.'' Our own universe might be a four-dimensional brane, floating in a higher dimensional space with other branes and even colliding with them.
Living On a Straw -- Although we think we live in a four-dimensional world, string theorists contend there are six more dimensions that we simply don't notice. At a distance a straw looks like a line, but up close it has other dimensions.
 Oops! -- Einstein showed with his theory of general relativity that space-time could stretch and warp to produce the effect we call gravity. String theorists have found that it can change shape, or topology, and even rip and tear. (Illustrations by Stuart Goldenberg)(pg. F1)

HEADLINE: U.S. Students Fare Badly in International Survey of Math Skills

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
High school students in Hong Kong, Finland and South Korea do best in mathematics among those in 40 surveyed countries while students in the United States finished in the bottom half, according to a new international comparison of mathematical skills shown by 15-year-olds.
 The United States was also cited as having the poorest outcomes per dollar spent on education. It ranked 28th of 40 countries in math and 18th in reading.
 The study, released Monday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group based in Paris representing 30 nations, used tests given to students in 2003 and was intended to assess relative performance and to try to determine reasons for it. 
 ''The gap between the best and worst performing countries has widened,'' said Andreas Schleicher, the official who directed the study and wrote the report.
 The study compared student performance in 29 of the 30 countries in the organization, which includes all major industrialized nations, and in 11 other countries that chose to participate. Because of insufficient participation in the study, figures for Britain were not reported.
 The study devoted less attention to reading than did a previous one in 2000, but it provided rankings that showed relatively little change.
 Over all in reading, the top countries were Finland, South Korea, Canada and Australia. The United States finished 18th, higher than nations like Denmark, Germany and Hungary, all of which had students who performed better in math than American students did.
 The study looked not only at the average performance of students, but also at how many from each country were top performers. It separated students into seven groups, ranging from Level 6, the best, to Level 1, which the authors viewed as a minimal level of competence. The remaining students were below the first level, a category that included more than half the students in Brazil, Indonesia and Tunisia. 
 In the United States, 10 percent of the students were in one of the top two groups, less than half as many as in Canada and a third the total of the leader, Hong Kong, which had 30.7 percent of its students in the top two categories. 
 Finland had the smallest percentage of underperforming students, with 6.8 percent. 
 The evaluation asked questions that were intended to test the ability of students to recognize what mathematical calculations were needed, and then to perform them, and to deal with questions that they would confront as citizens. Mr. Schleicher said that students in countries that emphasized theorems and rote learning tended not to do as well as those that emphasized the more practical aspects of mathematics.
 The survey also questioned students about their own views of themselves and their work, and found that while good students were more likely to think they were good, countries that did well often had a large number of students who did not feel they were doing well. In the United States, 36 percent of the students agreed with the statement, ''I am just not good at mathematics,'' while in Hong Kong, 57 percent agreed. In South Korea the figure was 62 percent. 
 Of the United States students, 72 percent said they got good grades in mathematics, more than in any other country. In Hong Kong, only 25 percent of the students said they got good marks, the lowest of any country.
 The study said that while girls typically did only a little worse than boys on the test, ''they consistently report much lower interest in and enjoyment of mathematics'' and ''much higher levels of helplessness and stress in mathematics classes.''
 Regarding spending, the study concluded that ''while spending on educational institutions is a necessary prerequisite for the provision of high-quality education, spending alone is not sufficient to achieve high levels of outcomes.'' 
 It noted that while the Czech Republic spent only one third as much per student as the United States did, it was one of the top 10 performing nations in the study, while the United States performed below the average of the nations surveyed.

HEADLINE: TOWERS' INSURERS MUST PAY DOUBLE

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; David W. Dunlap and Anthony Ramirez contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A federal jury said yesterday that the destruction of the World Trade Center constituted two separate attacks, entitling the developer Larry A. Silverstein to collect up to $2.2 billion, or double the insurance coverage provided by nine insurers at the complex.
 The jury's decision, which came at the end of 11 days of deliberation and represented a major development in the rebuilding effort, almost certainly ensures that the proposed $1.5 billion, 1,776-foot Freedom Tower will be constructed at the trade center site, although appeals are likely and it may be some time before all the insurance money is paid out. It also ensures that Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center only six weeks before it was destroyed, will remain in control of the rebuilding effort for some time. 
 Insurance experts predicted yesterday that the verdict would send ripples through the insurance industry, with premiums for property coverage almost guaranteed to rise substantially. 
 Mr. Silverstein, who plans to use the money to rebuild the trade center, issued a statement yesterday saying he was thrilled with the verdict. It will ''ensure a timely and complete rebuild of the World Trade Center,'' he said, adding that the insurers ''had an obligation to pay their fair share to help make Lower Manhattan whole again.''
 Mr. Silverstein has argued that because two jets slammed into two towers at the trade center on Sept. 11, he was entitled to a double payment of the $3.55 billion policy, or $7 billion. The jury's decision yesterday related to nine insurance companies, which provided $1.1 billion of the $3.55 billion worth of coverage. If the verdict stands, the nine companies will have to pay $2.2 billion.
 It was Mr. Silverstein's first legal victory during the 38-month legal battle he has waged against two dozen insurers at the trade center. Last spring, a jury decided that Swiss Re and eight other insurers had provided coverage based on a policy devised by Mr. Silverstein's brokers. The court had already ruled that that policy entitled Mr. Silverstein to only a single payment. The developer also settled with five other insurers. That cut Mr. Silverstein's quest for $7 billion to a maximum of $4.65 billion, if he won the second trial.
 The extra $1.1 billion is needed downtown, where officials estimate that it will cost more than $9 billion to rebuild the trade center, a complex that is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and once included 10 million square feet of office space for investment banks and insurance companies, a retail mall, a hotel and a major rail station.
 ''It's a tremendous victory for Larry and for everyone else who has an interest in Lower Manhattan,'' said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''The funds are going to ensure that Lower Manhattan recovers in the amount of time we've laid out.''
 But just as Mr. Silverstein is appealing the verdict in the first trial, the nine insurance companies are expected to appeal the decision.
 John Novaria, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers, one of the nine companies involved in the verdict, said his company still believed that the attack on the trade center was ''one occurrence.'' Asked whether Industrial Risk would file an appeal, he said the company was ''examining its options.'' 
 In a separate element of the dispute, the final amount of insurance money is under review by a court-approved panel of three appraisers, who will determine the extent of the damages at the trade center and how much each company must pay.
 Nevertheless, Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group, said that yesterday's decision ensures that the Freedom Tower, the first of four or five office towers planned for the site, will be built. But, Mr. Yaro said, the time has come for a public accounting.
 ''There needs to be a sorting out between Larry and the Port Authority about what needs to be built and who's going to pay for it,'' Mr. Yaro said.
 Gov. George E. Pataki has promoted the Freedom Tower as a symbol of downtown rejuvenation. But some critics have questioned the wisdom of building a huge and costly skyscraper when there are no potential tenants in sight and the vacancy rate in Lower Manhattan is high. Some executives at the Port Authority say privately that the money would be better spent on an estimated $1.5 billion to bring the site up to grade as it is rebuilt to ground level, so that it is ready when the real estate market improves. 
 According to Newmark & Company Real Estate, the vacancy rate downtown climbed to 15.9 percent in November, and could hit a nine-year high this month with the introduction of 7 World Trade Center, an office tower Mr. Silverstein is building nearby.
 So far, the insurance companies paid out $2.03 billion, and $1.55 billion has been spent. If yesterday's verdict survives the appeal process, that would leave about $4 billion for a reconstruction effort that might cost $9 billion. Mr. Silverstein's legal battles have cost an estimated $125 million, according to Port Authority commissioners.
 Experts were already debating the effect of the verdict on the insurance industry. Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said he doubted there would be a larger precedent growing out of the case.
 For example, the four recent hurricanes in Florida were treated by insurers as four occurrences because each was separated by a standard interval exceeding 72 hours, he said. If they had all struck within 72 hours, they would likely have been treated as one occurrence, he said.
 Mr. Silverstein's lawyers succeeded in persuading jurors that there was some doubt about the definition of occurrence, Mr. Hartwig said, because all of the policies had not been fully negotiated. 
 Andy Barile, an insurance executive and litigation consultant based in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., said the decision would ''dramatically change the industry.''
 Agents, reinsurers and consumers will have to scrutinize their policies and some property owners may face premium increases when they renew their policies in January, he said, adding, ''With companies being forced to pay out twice their policy limits, it's going to have a dramatic effect on increasing premiums.''

HEADLINE: A U.N. for the 21st Century

 BODY:
For a decade and a half, Iraq has been a disaster for the United Nations. The Security Council repeatedly failed to enforce its own sanctions and stand behind its rules for arms inspectors. The poorly run oil-for-food program was a swamp of corruption. The United States invaded Iraq without U.N. approval. A car bomb destroyed the U.N.'s Baghdad headquarters, killing one of its brightest stars. 
 The U.N.'s troubles may bring cheer to the more unilaterally minded members of the Bush administration. But they are damaging to the larger interests of the United States. That's why the thoughtful proposals for U.N. reform presented last week by a panel of notables deserve attention. 
 Without a robust U.N., there would be no effective international brake on nuclear weapons proliferation, no globally coordinated fight against AIDS, no worldwide advocate for the development needs of the world's poor and no authoritative body for restoring hope to failed, rogue and occupied states. The same United Nations that Washington too readily brushed aside in invading Iraq now represents a crucial component of any short-term American exit strategy from the deepening Iraqi quagmire. 
 The most widely discussed proposals in last week's report concern expanding the Security Council, whose permanent membership reflects the power relations of 1945, not 2004. The U.N. can only gain in authority and relevance by adding newly important countries from the developed and the developing world. But it must do so carefully, paying more heed to the internationalist credentials of new members than to the flawed formulas of population, G.D.P. and regional balance that left us with Libya and Sudan as members of the Commission on Human Rights. Japan is obviously qualified for one of the new permanent seats proposed by the panel. So is India, but only after it signs and ratifies the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as all but 4 of the U.N.'s 191 member countries have done. 
 Potentially even more significant will be the fate of the panel's proposals on defining when the use of military force is justified. Currently there are two legal paths to military action. Self-defense is obviously one of them. The U.N. charter also gives the Security Council the right to authorize military action in the broader interests of international peace. It has long been understood by most countries that self-defense includes pre-emptive military action against truly imminent threats, if the danger is demonstrably clear and no peaceful alternatives remain. The language of the charter, however, is more literal, referring only to an actual attack. It is disappointing that the panel failed to recommend updating and clarifying that language to make it more realistic for an age of missiles, unconventional weapons and catastrophic attacks by terrorists acting independently of any government. Far more controversial issues are posed by the Bush administration's idea of preventive attacks against potential or hypothetical dangers. There are times when such extraordinary actions are in fact justified, but only when a clear and convincing case has been made to the Security Council, based on solid evidence and an objective, independent analysis. 
 The panel proposes some useful guidelines for determining whether those conditions have been met. These include evaluating how serious the threat has already become, deciding whether all reasonable diplomatic means have been fully exhausted and considering the likely consequences of military action. Establishing clear guidelines well in advance of the next crisis would be helpful. But they cannot resolve the underlying conflict between the principles of collective security and the realities of a world of sovereign states. 
 It is certainly possible to imagine a situation where one or more crucial members of the Security Council may fail to apply these guidelines and refuse to authorize force when it is justified. In such cases, the panel suggests, unrealistically, that the threatened country not go ahead on its own. But such a country would be more likely to put the safety of its own citizens first and use military force. If its actions clearly meet the tests the Security Council should have applied, world opinion would probably confer at least some measure of international legitimacy for those military actions. Washington's 2003 invasion of Iraq conspicuously failed to meet these guidelines. In contrast, NATO's 1999 bombing campaign to stop Serbian atrocities in Kosovo, even without the Security Council's endorsement, won wide acceptance.
 Last week's proposals can be a good starting point. What really matters now is whether the world's nations, particularly the United States, choose to learn from recent experience and revitalize a United Nations they still very badly need.

HEADLINE: Over Pataki Veto, Minimum Wage to Rise to $7.15

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Republicans in the State Senate forced through a measure on Monday that will gradually raise the minimum wage in New York State by $2 to $7.15 an hour by January 2007, overriding Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of the proposal.
 The vote was a stinging rebuke to the governor from members of his own party. Mr. Pataki had argued that raising the minimum wage would put New York businesses at a competitive disadvantage. But in overriding the governor, Senate Republicans, who have been struggling to maintain a majority in their house, kept a pre-Election Day campaign promise.
 The measure raises the state's current $5.15-an-hour minimum to $6 on Jan. 1, 2005; $6.75 on Jan. 1, 2006; and $7.15 on Jan. 1, 2007. It raises the hourly pay for the lowest wage earners, restaurant and bar employees who earn tips, to $4.60 from $3.30, an increase that will also be fully effective by Jan. 1, 2007. New York will join at least 14 other states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, in requiring that workers be paid more than the federal government's hourly minimum of $5.15. 
 ''The increase will help the working families at the lowest income levels make ends meet, without putting an undue burden on small businesses and the economy,'' said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's majority leader. Returning to one of his favorite themes, Mr. Bruno said the higher wage would also help the working poor ''realize the value and dignity of hard work.''
 In vetoing the measure on July 29, Mr. Pataki said he supported a higher minimum wage, but preferred that it be enacted at the federal level so New York businesses would not be put at a competitive disadvantage. But because the federal government did not act, the Republicans on Monday said it was time for them to move on the state level and approved the measure, 50 to 8.
 Because the Democrat-led State Assembly voted on Aug. 11, 126 to 20, to override the governor's veto, the measure will become law in January, when the pay raises will begin, a legislative official said. It will be the first time New York has increased the minimum wage since March 2000, when it caught up with the federal minimum, which had been raised in 1997. The state has not raised the minimum wage above the federal level since the early 1970's, said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which has made a higher minimum a priority.
 Of the roughly eight million workers in New York, more than 700,000 earn $5.15 to $7.10 an hour, working mostly in retail and in the leisure and hospitality industries, say those on both sides of the issue. They cut hair, wash dishes, pump gas, bag groceries and run movie theater projectors, among an array of other jobs, according to a study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group in Albany. Economists have said that an increase would also bump up the wages of an additional 500,000 workers already earning $7 to $8 an hour, Mr. Cantor said.
 Immediately, supporters of the measure, including the labor unions, the Working Families Party and Democratic elected officials, paraded through the State Capitol, hailing the move as a way to help lift many families out of poverty and improve the state's overall economy. But opponents said the higher minimum wage would force small businesses to charge consumers more; to pay additional Social Security, unemployment and Medicare taxes; and to pay more in workers' compensation costs.
 All year, the battle lines had been drawn on the issue, which was among the most contentious that state officials faced. Senate Republicans were initially opposed to the proposal, until Mr. Bruno dropped his opposition because his party was threatened with the loss of two seats in New York City, where raising the wage is a popular position. On Election Day, the Republicans lost two Senate seats in the city anyway, and some Democrats said Mr. Bruno had no choice but to fulfill his promise, despite opposition from the governor.
 Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Manhattan, said that political pressure was ultimately at play and that Mr. Bruno was forced to follow the Assembly and override the governor. ''Senator Bruno milked every bit of political benefit out of the delay to pass this,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''But ultimately it was clear there was an organized, politically mobilized coalition.''
 The issue is a textbook case of what is wrong with Albany, Mr. Schneiderman said. He said it was ''simply wrong'' that a measure that originally passed by veto-proof margins in each house -- 51 to 7 in the Senate, and 116 to 19 in the Assembly -- took so long to be placed back on the Senate floor for a vote. He said the Senate's rules needed to be changed to allow individual senators to put bills on the floor even over the objection of the majority leader.
 The governor's office reacted with disappointment to the news of the override by the Senate.
 ''It's disappointing, because this could have been done in way that would not have hurt the state's economic competitiveness,'' said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. ''Instead, this action will hurt New York's small businesses, seasonal workers, farmers and the entire upstate region.'' 
 On July 29, when he vetoed the Legislature's bill, the governor expressed concerns that raising the statewide minimum without federal action would put New York businesses at a disadvantage compared with neighboring states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania that have not moved beyond the $5.15-an-hour rate.
 In recent weeks, opponents of increasing the minimum wage hoped the governor would be successful in negotiating an alternate bill with the Senate, which the governor hoped to do. But a legislative official said that Mr. Bruno, who is always loath to embarrass the governor politically -- and therefore did not override him before Election Day -- engaged in virtually no negotiations with Mr. Pataki in the days leading up to the override.
 Mark P. Alesse, the state director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said that with nearly 700,000 workers getting raises, the increase would hurt small businesses at about the same time the state could be forced to raise taxes to deal with a proposed $6 billion budget deficit and a court-appointed panel's ruling to pump billions of dollars more into New York City schools.
 But the pressure to act was too great, as proponents, including those in labor, said that under the existing minimum wage, full-time workers earn $10,712 a year, which is below the federal poverty line. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said the Senate's action would change that equation and ''make up for the wrong committed by the governor.'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the move as good news, just in time for the holidays.
 Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O, said, ''This is a victory for anyone who ever thought that their voice doesn't matter.''
 In the end, the debate was framed by two lawmakers from western New York: Assemblyman William L. Parment, a Democrat from Jamestown, who backed the measure, and Senator John R. Kuhl, Jr., a Republican from Bath, who opposed it.
 Mr. Kuhl said his constituents, who live on the border with Pennsylvania, complained that raising the minimum wage in New York, but not on a national level, would increase the cost of doing business in his district and cause a loss of customers. He said he would work to promote a higher federal minimum wage when he joins Congress in January.
 Mr. Parment agreed that raising the state's minimum wage would cause a ''competitive differential'' between New York and some other states, but said that the problem was much overstated by the governor. 
 ''You know, we're not in competition anymore with North and South Carolina, we're in competition with China,'' Mr. Parment said. ''And people that live and work in this state deserve a minimum wage, and five and a quarter just wasn't doing it.''

HEADLINE: It's Not Exclusive, but It's Lucrative: Why Luxe Went Online

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
IT used to be one of the great free pleasures in New York to go into Tiffany & Company in the afternoon and hear the pens tapping on the counters. Each rap of a salesman's ballpoint signaled the sale of a diamond ring or a pair of cuff links. It intoned happiness and solvency, and, since Tiffany was not the sort of place to expose a customer to the indecency of baring his wallet in public, it summoned a manager, who performed the actual transaction at a discreet distance.
 Tiffany stopped the practice of pen tapping almost 10 years ago; you probably didn't even notice. For one thing, people aren't embarrassed by the sight of money anymore and, for another, they don't have time to wait for the manager. They slap their credit cards on the counter, and there's no need to soften the blow with hushed voices. Today, in fact, the most persistent sound in luxury shopping is the mouse click. From now until the end of the holidays, Tiffany.com will receive 100,000 hits a day, roughly equal to the number of people who will visit a Tiffany store. 
 If mass retailing has been transformed by the availability of better-designed products, like Michael Graves teapots at Target, class has been transformed by technology and a consumer who is as well informed as she is impatient to have the latest gaud. Half the purchases on Neiman Marcus's Web site are by customers who do not live near one of its actual stores, said Brendan Hoffman, chief executive of Neiman Marcus Direct, which also operates the Web site of Bergdorf Goodman, a Neiman property.
 Designers who travel the trunk-show circuit, selling their new clothes like Fuller brushes, have long known about the wealth in this country. But the Web has given merchants an unlimited portal to the rich, and changed the meaning of notions like status and exclusivity. ''We're selling Chloe, Manolo Blahnik, Dolce & Gabbana,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''We see no price resistance on the Web.''
 Not long ago, the Neiman site offered Giorgio Armani's Le Collezione label, which has women's suits for around $1,200. The line sold out in less than a month, Mr. Hoffman said.
 The speed of information has also induced consumers to buy earlier, giving merchants a greater chance to sell more goods at full price. ''We saw some of our biggest purchases this year between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15,'' said Brian Bolke, an owner of Forty Five Ten, a boutique in Dallas, where some customers spent as much as $20,000.
 Speed also agitates demand for special and hard-to-find products. Stores like Bergdorf's and Barneys New York now offer more small labels in their mix to woo shoppers who are turned off by the ubiquity of big brands -- and the media buzz around them. ''Our customers want more individuality,'' said Robert Burke, the fashion director at Bergdorf's.
 But this desire for the hidden and seemingly exclusive helps even established designers. Oscar de la Renta had a $40,000 sheared mink jacket in his fall line. ''We thought we'd sell a few,'' said the company's chief executive, Alex Bolen. ''We sold 40.''
 Of course, the notion of trading up -- exchanging one identity for a better one -- has been going on in this country since the Mayflower. In their 1992 book, ''Channels of Desire: Mass Images and the Shaping of American Consciousness,'' Stuart and Elizabeth Ewen point to the influence of silent films on the lives of immigrants. Such films, the Ewens said, supported a crucial myth in American culture, ''metamorphosis through consumption.''
 But the consumption ethic, it can also be argued, remained relatively static for decades, drawn as much by rigid economic lines as by class distinctions. The rich had their own playgrounds, their own style of life, and while they sought the best clothes and the best food, they didn't try to surround their exquisite taste with a term like luxury. They certainly didn't think of luxury as an exploitable commodity, the way Ralph Lauren began to do in the 70's. As Slim Aarons said of the socialites he photographed in the 50's: ''I didn't do fashion. I did the people in the clothes that became the fashion.''
 What brought the barbarians finally to the gate was branding. Things had been moving in that direction since the mid-60's, around the time Life magazine published a list of the 100 most influential New Yorkers and included the names of a few designers and Pop artists, a notion that would have been too ridiculous to contemplate a decade earlier, when such figures were considered outside the elite establishment. But the real explosion came in the 90's with the emergence of superbrands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci.
 Although credit has been given to Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole, who left Gucci in April, for stimulating consumer demand at the high end -- largely by limiting distribution and then feeding the frenzy for ''it'' handbags with waiting lists -- Mr. Ford recognized a crucial change in modern tastes. Namely, all the energy, all the excitement (and a great deal of the money), was coming from the bottom -- from the worlds of indie rockers, rap artists, celebrities, even porn stars. A luxury brand might be aspirational, but it can't afford to be perceived as elitist.
 ''In luxury today, it's so much more about having a bottom-up identity,'' said Nancy Koehn, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''The top has to marry itself with the bottom, because the elite at the top aren't that important.''
 The Internet is also anti-elitist, as journalists who left magazines for online publications discovered. Not only was conventional media slow, it wasn't interactive or personal enough to satisfy all the different segments of readers. For luxury retailers, the challenge is how to leverage their prestige without appearing snobbishly out of touch. Neiman's, for instance, is developing custom home pages. Tiffany's Web site shows how engagement diamonds are cut and set, believing that consumers want more for their money than the luster of a name. 
 Big brands undeniably offer security. ''You know that Chanel is going to be around for a while,'' said Jane Buckingham, president of Youth Intelligence, a company that surveys trends. But safety in numbers carries its own threat. 
 Brian Bolke of Forty Five Ten, the Dallas boutique, suggests that specialty stores like his -- and Tracey Ross in Los Angeles and Linda Dresner in New York and Birmingham, Mich. -- serve as a filter.
 ''I'm sure that Prada has the biggest influence of any brand,'' Mr. Bolke said. ''But if you go to a party and there are seven other women in the same Prada dress, you might as well have gone to Gap.''
 No two designers are more alert to the cloning factor than Miuccia Prada and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel. That's why they keep upping the ante each season with looks that are novel or hard to copy. Compelled by an affluent shopper who gets her information about a collection hours after it is shown, who makes her purchases earlier and earlier, they have no choice. To be slow in fashion these days is to be out of the money.

HEADLINE: Don't Let the Dollar Take the Fall

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten. 
Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, held economic and foreign policy posts in the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton administrations.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
AS the dollar continues to sink against the euro, the yen and other currencies, the conventional wisdom is that there is little choice but to allow it to continue to fall.
 America's trade imbalance can be corrected, the current reasoning goes, with a much cheaper dollar -- perhaps 30 percent cheaper than it is today. The idea -- supported by Treasury Secretary John Snow and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman -- is that this would raise the price of imports for Americans, who would thus buy less from abroad. A cheaper dollar would also supposedly allow us to sell more to the world by making our exports less expensive. 
 Here is what's wrong with this analysis.
 A falling dollar is unlikely to curtail imports as much as hoped. It is more likely instead to act as a consumption tax. About one-quarter of the United States import bill arises from oil purchases, which are priced in dollars. A rapidly depreciating dollar thus means lower earnings for OPEC producers. In response, the cartel might well raise prices. Goods from Asia, especially China, account for at least another 25 percent of our import bill. Because these computers, machine tools, TV's and toys are essential to our work and lifestyle, chances are that we will still buy them, even at higher prices. 
 Nor will a cheaper dollar encourage domestic production that can replace imports, as some argue. Auto parts, for instance, are increasingly produced in Mexico and other developing nations. These plants, part of a highly specialized global supply line, are not likely to be replaced by suppliers in the United States just because of temporary currency movements. 
 American exports, meanwhile, will not be spurred as much as most forecasters hope. Because currencies' values are relative to one another, the lower the dollar gets, the higher the euro and yen rise. As the currencies of Europe and Japan strengthen, the exports of these nations will become more expensive. That could easily translate into slower growth in those already slow-growing regions -- and less money to buy our exports. 
 What's more, with the exception of agriculture, fewer American products are sold from our shores. Increasingly, they are sold by American subsidiaries overseas. While big American companies still export billions of dollars' worth of goods across the Atlantic, they sell three to five times as much from their European-based operations -- to countries in Europe. A lower dollar won't have much effect on those sales. 
 The problem with the administration's devaluation policy is that it doesn't treat the root causes of America's economic imbalances. Our need to borrow so much from abroad is caused by our enormous consumption and our anemic savings. Today, Americans save just 0.2 percent of their disposable income, practically the lowest level in 45 years. Since we have so little savings to finance capital investment, we borrow from savings pools abroad. Our government, too, needs foreign creditors to invest in Treasury securities, to finance its escalating budget deficits. 
 Another trade issue not addressed by dollar devaluation: the need to sharpen our global competitiveness. In an advanced economy like ours, price should be less of a selling point than the quality and sophistication of a product. This isn't going to happen unless we improve the fundamentals underlying competitiveness -- our education system and labor-force skills. A devalued dollar also does not lower health-care costs -- costs so high that they encourage American employers to move operations to countries where governments often pick up the insurance tab. 
 Traders churning $2 trillion daily in currency markets know that if the United States relies on a cheap dollar alone to correct its trade imbalance it will push the currency down fast and for a long time -- because the benefits will never quite match the predicted expectations. 
 This is a one-way bet for speculators. Already, rumors are rampant that several central banks with significant dollar holdings may diversify into other currencies. Hedge funds and other speculators may be moving in. If momentum to sell dollars gathers steam, it could lead to a dollar plunge, a global financial crisis and deep worldwide recession. 
 The dollar may well be overvalued now. But rather than just talking the currency down, Washington should try to pursue a formal agreement with Europe, Japan and China that addresses not only currency realignments but also the domestic policy changes needed to back them up. 
 A model for this is the so-called Plaza Accord negotiated by the Reagan administration with Germany and Japan in 1985. Then, as now, the United States was running large trade deficits and wanted to devalue the dollar. But rather than talking down the currency or letting it fall on its own, President Reagan's team got key trading partners to share the burden of adjusting policies to correct the imbalance. It worked. America's trade gap slowly narrowed, and foreign lenders did not demand significantly higher interest rates on Treasuries. If Washington negotiated a similar accord today, countries like China and Japan could slow the dollar's slide by revaluing their currencies. The pact could also involve policy commitments to support the currency realignments. 
 For example, rather than just assert that economic growth will reduce our budget deficits, the Bush administration might postpone or trim permanent tax cuts. It could also agree to partly privatize Social Security only after creating a plan to finance the $1 trillion to $2 trillion in transition costs without deepening the deficit. It could announce measures to improve our export performance -- starting, perhaps, with more support for certain research and development programs and a plan to lower health-care premiums for employers by offering reinsurance for catastrophic-illness costs. 
 For their part, European nations could pledge to accelerate deregulation to further open their economies and become bigger importers. And key countries could agree to intervene in currency markets to keep the dollar's decline gradual and orderly.
 A great power does not debase its currency -- a currency around which most global commerce revolves. It does not take its hand off the tiller, as if the market bears all responsibility for global financial stability. To fix the problems that underlie huge trade imbalances, it uses statesmanship -- at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: 2 C.I.A. Reports Offer Warnings On Iraq's Path

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
A classified cable sent by the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Baghdad has warned that the situation in Iraq is deteriorating and may not rebound any time soon, according to government officials.
 The cable, sent late last month as the officer ended a yearlong tour, presented a bleak assessment on matters of politics, economics and security, the officials said. They said its basic conclusions had been echoed in briefings presented by a senior C.I.A. official who recently visited Iraq.
 The officials described the two assessments as having been ''mixed,'' saying that they did describe Iraq as having made important progress, particularly in terms of its political process, and credited Iraqis with being resilient. 
 But over all, the officials described the station chief's cable in particular as an unvarnished assessment of the difficulties ahead in Iraq. They said it warned that the security situation was likely to get worse, including more violence and sectarian clashes, unless there were marked improvements soon on the part of the Iraqi government, in terms of its ability to assert authority and to build the economy.
 Together, the appraisals, which follow several other such warnings from officials in Washington and in the field, were much more pessimistic than the public picture being offered by the Bush administration before the elections scheduled for Iraq next month, the officials said. The cable was sent to C.I.A. headquarters after American forces completed what military commanders have described as a significant victory, with the retaking of Falluja, a principal base of the Iraqi insurgency, in mid-November.
 The American ambassador to Iraq, John D. Negroponte, was said by the officials to have filed a written dissent, objecting to one finding as too harsh, on the ground that the United States had made more progress than was described in combating the Iraqi insurgency. But the top American military commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., also reviewed the cable and initially offered no objections, the officials said. One official said, however, that General Casey may have voiced objections in recent days.
 The station chief's cable has been widely disseminated outside the C.I.A., and was initially described by a government official who read the document and who praised it as unusually candid. Other government officials who have read or been briefed on the document later described its contents. The officials refused to be identified by name or affiliation because of the delicacy of the issue. The station chief cannot be publicly identified because he continues to work undercover.
 Asked about the cable, a White House spokesman, Sean McCormack, said he could not discuss intelligence matters. A C.I.A. spokesman would say only that he could not comment on any classified document. 
 It was not clear how the White House was responding to the station chief's cable. In recent months, some Republicans, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, have accused the agency of seeking to undermine President Bush by disclosing intelligence reports whose conclusions contradict the administration or its policies. But senior intelligence officials including John E. McLaughlin, the departing deputy director of central intelligence, have disputed those assertions. One government official said the new assessments might suggest that Porter J. Goss, the new director of central intelligence, was willing to listen to views different from those publicly expressed by the administration.
 A separate, more formal, National Intelligence Estimate prepared in July and sent to the White House in August by American intelligence agencies also presented a dark forecast for Iraq's future through the end of 2005. Among three possible developments described in that document, the best case was tenuous stability and the worst case included a chain of events leading to civil war.
 After news reports disclosed the existence of the National Intelligence Estimate, which also remains classified, President Bush initially dismissed the conclusions as nothing more than a guess. Since then, however, violence in Iraq has increased, including the recent formation of a Shiite militia intended to carry out attacks on Sunni militants.
 The end-of-tour cable from the station chief, spelling out an assessment of the situation on the ground, is a less-formal product than a National Intelligence Estimate. But it was drafted by an officer who is highly regarded within the C.I.A. and who, as station chief in Baghdad, has been the top American intelligence official in Iraq since December 2003. The station chief overseas an intelligence operation that includes about 300 people, making Baghdad the largest C.I.A. station since Saigon during the Vietnam War era.
 The senior C.I.A. official who visited Iraq and then briefed counterparts from other government agencies was Michael Kostiw, a senior adviser to Mr. Goss. One government official who knew about Mr. Kostiw's briefings described them as ''an honest portrayal of the situation on the ground.''
 Since they took office in September, Mr. Goss and his aides have sought to discourage unauthorized disclosures of information. In a memorandum sent to C.I.A. employees last month, Mr. Goss said the job of the intelligence agency was to ''provide the intelligence as we see it'' but also to ''support the administration and its policies in our work.''
 ''As agency employees we do not identify with, support or champion opposition to the administration or its policies,'' Mr. Goss said in that memorandum, saying that he was seeking ''to clarify beyond doubt the rules of the road.'' The memorandum urged intelligence employees to ''let the facts alone speak to the policy maker.''
 Mr. Goss himself made his first foreign trip as the intelligence director last week, with stops that included several days in Britain and a day in Afghanistan, but he did not visit Iraq, the government officials said. 
 At the White House on Monday, President Bush himself offered no hint of pessimism as he met with Iraq's president, Sheik Ghazi al-Yawar. Despite the security challenges, Mr. Bush said, the United States continues to favor the voting scheduled for Iraq on Jan. 30 to ''send the clear message to the few people in Iraq that are trying to stop the march toward democracy that they cannot stop elections.''
 ''The American people must understand that democracy just doesn't happen overnight,'' he said. ''It is a process. It is an evolution. After all, look at our own history. We had great principles enunciated in our Declarations of Independence and our Constitution, yet, we had slavery for a hundred years. It takes a while for democracy to take hold. And this is a major first step in a society which enables people to express their beliefs and their opinions.''

HEADLINE: ACCORD REACHED ON OVERHAULING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Congressional leaders reached final agreement Monday allowing passage of a bill to overhaul the nation's intelligence community and enact the major recommendations of the independent Sept. 11 commission, including creation of the job of national intelligence director to force the C.I.A. and other government spy agencies to share intelligence about national security threats.
 The agreement ended a nearly monthlong stalemate over the bill, which had been endorsed by President Bush and the Sept. 11 commission but had been opposed by a group of Republican lawmakers close to the Pentagon who insisted it would dangerously dilute the authority of the Defense Department over intelligence needed on the battlefield.
 The Republicans, led by Representative Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said they were satisfied by a last-minute revision of the bill to include a sentence requiring that the new intelligence director operate under guidelines that do not ''abrogate the statutory responsibilities'' of the Defense Department. 
 Congressional officials said final House and Senate votes would probably occur on Tuesday or Wednesday, allowing Mr. Bush to sign the bill into law this week. His signature would set in motion the most important restructuring of the nation's system for gathering and sharing intelligence since the creation of the C.I.A. in 1947. 
 The bill would also create a National Counterterrorism Center to coordinate terrorism intelligence from throughout the government, as well as establish an independent civil liberties board to review the government's privacy policies. 
 Prominent civil liberties advocates have opposed the overall bill, saying that it grants law enforcement agencies broad new surveillance and anti-immigration powers that endanger constitutional protections.
 The bill's supporters described the last-minute revisions, which were worked out with the White House in weekend negotiations directly overseen by Vice President Cheney and his staff, as minor. They said the changes would not undermine the powers of the intelligence director, who is described in the bill as the president's chief intelligence adviser and who would take authority away from both the C.I.A. and the Pentagon.
 ''I think we need intelligence reform,'' Mr. Hunter said at a news conference on Monday with Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mr. Warner also announced his endorsement of the revised bill after having expressed similar reservations last week. 
 ''My obligation is to the defense sector in this bill, the military aspect of this bill, and the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States,'' said Mr. Hunter, who was able to block a final House vote on the otherwise popular intelligence bill last month. ''We have received a satisfactory provision that protects them, and so I will vote for the bill.''
 In a joint statement, the bill's chief Senate authors, Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said they welcomed the agreement. They said the bill ''creates a more coordinated intelligence community with one person in charge, to help make Americans safer and better serve the president, the military, Congress and other agencies that rely on national intelligence.''
 One of the bill's key Republican supporters in the House, Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said the revisions made to the bill on Monday were simply a face-saving measure for Mr. Hunter. ''It gets his vote, but it doesn't change what was basically the agreement two weeks ago,'' Mr. Shays said.
 The agreement also appeared to end a politically awkward showdown between Mr. Bush and members of his own party in Congress. The White House had faced a near-rebellion from Mr. Hunter and other Republicans over a bill that the president had repeatedly endorsed in public appearances. 
 The bill's Republican proponents had warned that Mr. Bush's larger second-term legislative agenda on issues like changes to Social Security and the tax code could have been threatened had he failed to enforce discipline among Congressional Republicans on the intelligence bill.
 In a letter Monday to Congressional leaders, Mr. Bush called for the bill's final passage this week.
 ''We are very close to a significant achievement that will better protect our country for generations to come,'' he said. ''Now is the time to finish the job for the good of our national security.''
 In response to the concerns of Mr. Hunter and others, Mr. Bush wrote that he believed the bill ''respects the chain of command within departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, so as to ensure that all of the warfighters' needs will be met.''
 The bill would enact the major recommendations of the 10 members of the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission, whose 19-month investigation largely rewrote the history of Sept. 11 and whose unanimous final report last July offered a detailed timeline of intelligence blunders in the months and years before the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. 
 The panel, citing turf battles and incompetence among intelligence and counterterrorism agencies, notably the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called for them to come under the control of a powerful intelligence director who would report directly to the White House and assume oversight of the government's estimated $40 billion annual intelligence budget. 
 Under the bill, the intelligence director would assume substantial authority over spy agencies within the Pentagon, including the National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic eavesdropping in foreign countries and, in terms of its budget, is much larger than the C.I.A.
 While publicly satisfying Mr. Hunter's concerns, the final bill failed to meet the demands of another prominent House Republican, F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who said Monday that the bill ''is woefully incomplete and one I cannot support.''
 Mr. Sensenbrenner, who had joined with Mr. Hunter in blocking the House vote last month, had wanted it to include a variety of law enforcement and immigration provisions that had been opposed by civil liberties groups, as well as by many Congressional Republicans. He had been most adamant that the bill include a provision to deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, overriding laws in some states that permit them to obtain licenses.
 Congressional officials said the White House had decided that while Mr. Hunter's concerns needed to be addressed in the final bill, given the degree of support he had from House colleagues, Mr. Sensenbrenner's issues would be pushed to the side for now, a decision that clearly angered him on Monday.
 ''This Sept. 10 mentality in a post-Sept. 11 world is unwise and among those I intend to rectify next year,'' he vowed.
 Although pleased that most of Mr. Sensenbrenner's toughest provisions were stripped out of the bill, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement Monday that it opposed the overall measure because it ''would centralize the intelligence community's surveillance powers, increasing the likelihood for government abuses.''
 The civil liberties union said it was alarmed by several provisions in the bill, including those that would expand the government's wiretap authority, and by the limited powers given to the independent privacy and civil liberties board created under the legislation. The board, it said, ''risks becoming the proverbial fox guarding the hen house -- the board would be appointed by the president, serve at his pleasure and have no subpoena power.''

HEADLINE: Stronger Science, A Stronger Nation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Dec. 5): 
 The goal of an energy-independent United States has been an elusive one. As a secondary science teacher for 35 years, and now as a university science educator, I well remember the effect that post-Sputnik programs had on science education. They enabled me to get both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and promoted science education for a very large number of students.
 A serious commitment to long-term energy independence would do more to help both the United States economy and world peace than almost anything else. 
 This may involve some sacrifice. Are we ready to ''pay any price, bear any burden''? We won't know unless someone asks us to do so.

To the Editor:
 If Thomas L. Friedman really wants to advance American energy independence, he should stop likening it to a moon shot.
 Getting the United States off oil and other fossil fuels is nothing like the Apollo program. No rocket science or new technology is needed. What's missing is the political will to internalize the huge social costs of energy use in the prices of fuels and electricity through fuel taxes.
 We know how to make windmills and bicycles, compact cities and compact fluorescents. Choosing them instead of gas-guzzlers and sprawl development requires market incentives that only higher energy prices can create.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Like Thomas L. Friedman, I was shocked to read that Congress cut financing for the National Science Foundation. 
 The United States is at a crucial turning point now in regard to scientific leadership in the world. We can either invest as much money as possible in supporting groundbreaking research benefiting nearly every aspect of our lives -- training new scientists and engineers, improving science education and ensuring that the United States remains the best place in the world to pursue a career in science -- or we can dedicate that money to frivolous pork, losing our place as the world leader in science and engineering. 
 As a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, I was instilled with the belief that science is vitally important to our society.
 It's unfortunate that Congress hasn't learned the same lesson; the security of our nation, as well as our economic health, depends on it.

HEADLINE: 2 More Tribes Drop Claims In Exchange For Casinos

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y., Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced two agreements on Tuesday that seek to settle centuries-old land claims by two Indian tribes in exchange for permission to develop casinos in the Catskill Mountains.
 The deals were brokered with the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin and the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, Band of Mohican Indians, also of Wisconsin. Both tribes trace their ancestry to New York. 
 The agreements came less than a month after Mr. Pataki announced similar arrangements with two other tribes, the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York and the Seneca-Cayuga Indians of Oklahoma, which are also seeking to operate casinos in the Catskills. A fifth land claim settlement, which could pave the way for another casino operated by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, is still subject to a tribal referendum. 
 But the vision of five shimmering Vegas-style casinos rising out of the Catskills could still be years away -- or may never happen. For the settlements to move forward, the State Legislature would have to pass a bill increasing the allowed number of casinos above three, the number currently permitted by law. The deals also require the approval of the Legislature and Congress and must clear local regulatory hurdles.
 The Pataki administration has been negotiating for years to settle land claims with numerous New York tribes, hoping to use the promise of casinos, rather than taxpayer dollars, to persuade tribes to drop their claims.
 Mr. Pataki has argued that casinos in the Catskills would boost the region's downtrodden economy by creating thousands of jobs and a stream of local revenue.
 The announcement Tuesday also comes as the state is seeking ways to comply with a court order requiring it to a drastic increase in education financing for New York City schools. The four signed deals all assure the state revenue and guarantee the state about 25 percent of proceeds from slot machines at the casinos.
 Mr. Pataki, in a prepared statement, said on Tuesday, ''I call upon the Legislature and Congress to act quickly to pass the legislation necessary to implement these agreements and end once and for all the decades of unrest and uncertainty that has resulted from the land claim litigation.''
 Mr. Pataki expressed interest on Monday in increasing the number of casinos allowed in the Catskills to as many as five.
 In addition to the four Indian tribes who have already brokered provisional deals with the state in the past few weeks, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe has a preliminary agreement with the state that is still subject to a tribal referendum. The tribe has a casino development agreement with Caesars Entertainment and intends to build a casino at Kutsher's Sports Academy here, in Sullivan County.
 But passing a bill that would allow so many casinos in the Catskills could be difficult, particularly since all five casinos under discussion could be located in Sullivan County.
 Numerous elected officials who represent Sullivan at the local, state and national levels have in recent days criticized the speed with which Mr. Pataki has been sealing the deals. Even some local casino boosters are wary.
 ''It's scary,'' said Sam Wohl, a Sullivan County legislator and a casino supporter, in an interview on Tuesday. ''Is five too much? Is three enough? We're worried about overkill.''
 Local officials say they are concerned whether the infrastructure can handle five casinos, the tens of thousands of workers and their families and the projected annual traffic, by some estimates, of about 30 million gamblers a year.
 They have also criticized the governor for the sudden flurry of Indian deals, saying there has not been sufficient consultation with the local governments.
 ''The governor's office is leaving us in the dark,'' said Christopher Cunningham, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature.
 The agreements announced Tuesday clear the two tribes' long-standing claims to nearly 300,000 acres in Oneida and Madison Counties in central New York, which they say were improperly acquired from them.
 The tribes have also agreed to assume any liability sought by the Oneida Indian Nation of New York in its claim to ancestral land in the state.
 Under the agreements, the Stockbridge-Munsees would operate their casino on a 333-acre site they own in the Town of Thompson, near here. The Wisconsin Oneidas were still trying to determine where they would build their casino, the governor's office said.
 Both tribes have also agreed that all state and local taxes would apply to retail goods and services sold on their properties.

HEADLINE: Cisco Expects To Hit Estimate For Revenue

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Cisco Systems, the maker of Internet networking equipment, said on Tuesday that it was on track to meet Wall Street's estimates for 13 percent growth in revenue for fiscal 2005. 
 Dennis Powell, Cisco's chief financial officer, speaking to a gathering of several hundred analysts, said that Cisco expected revenue to grow annually on the higher end of the 10 percent to 15 percent range through 2008. Mr. Powell also said that he expected the company to experience some downward pressure on its gross margins over the next several years. 
 Industry analysts, gathered for an annual conference with Cisco executives, expressed mild surprise at the company's willingness to announce its revenue projections. For the last several years, since the downturn in the technology sector, the company has declined to give year-end guidance, citing murky economic conditions.
 Mr. Powell said that the company was seeing greater optimism among its customers and was responding to numerous calls from investors seeking more forward-looking projections.
 Cisco had revenue of $22 billion in fiscal 2004, a 17 percent increase over fiscal 2003. Mr. Powell described analysts' estimates for 2005 performance as ''reasonable.'' The company's fiscal year ends on July 31.
 By affirming Wall Street's estimates, industry analysts said, Cisco may be trying to reassure investors, particularly as the company faces increasing competition and the possibility of declining prices for routers and other pieces of Internet equipment. 
 Analysts said that pressure could come from competition from companies in Asia, and a move from Cisco to get more of its revenue from selling new kinds of technology, like equipment for Internet-based phone services. 
 One financial analyst, who insisted that his name not be used, citing the policy of his Wall Street firm, said that he thought Cisco was giving guidance now to try to reassure investors that Cisco should still be considered a growth company.
 Mr. Powell prefaced his remarks by noting that his comments should be seen ''not as a forecast, not a prediction and not a guarantee.''
 After talking at the analysts' meeting, he also said, ''this is the first time in several years we've focused on something beyond the next quarter.'' He added, ''The message we wanted to give is Cisco is a company of growth.''

HEADLINE: Colgate to Cut Jobs and Use Savings to Spur Sales

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Colgate-Palmolive, the consumer products company, said yesterday that it would close about a third of its factories and cut more than 4,400 jobs over the next four years as part of a major restructuring effort to increase profit margins.
 The company plans to use the savings for advertising and product development as it seeks more robust growth in an industry that has been battered by rising raw material costs and increasingly tough competition. 
 Colgate, best known for its brand-name toothpaste and detergent, has had trouble keeping up with Procter & Gamble, which has stepped up its marketing and product development efforts with innovations like Crest Whitestrips. 
 Colgate said yesterday that it expected to take a total of $550 million to $650 million in restructuring charges after taxes as it begins more than 100 initiatives over the next four years, including the centralization of its back-office and purchasing operations and a 12 percent reduction of its 37,000 jobs. The changes are intended to save as much as $300 million a year by 2008. 
 The company, based in New York, said it still expected to meet its fourth-quarter earnings estimates, excluding restructuring costs of about $45 million. It also projected an immediate cost savings of about $45 million next year, but the company said its plans would soon require the immediate closing of eight factories worldwide and that it informed workers at those plants of the decision yesterday. 
 ''The savings come from hard stuff, and stuff that is culturally and socially not terrific,'' Reuben Mark, Colgate's chief executive, said on a conference call with investors. But Mr. Mark said that the changes were necessary to maintain the company's market share and reach profit margin goals as it faces aggressive competition.
 Earlier this fall, Colgate and another rival, Unilever, issued profit warnings in the face of growing pressure from retailers for lower prices and product innovations from P.&G. that have stripped away existing customers. As P.&G.'s profit has soared this year, Colgate said that its second-half earnings would fall well short of expectations and Unilever said its full-year forecast of 10 percent earnings growth would be cut in half. All of the consumer giants, meanwhile, have pledged to step up advertising and development efforts just to hold onto existing market share. 
 While Colgate posted double-digit earnings growth for much of the last decade, analysts said it mainly did so by improving its balance sheet and internal operations rather than by investing heavily in its brands. But with yesterday's announcement, some analysts saw an inflection point. 
 ''It's fair to say they were stretching to make their numbers the past few years, and as a result have not invested as much as they should have,'' said Amy Chasen, a Goldman Sachs analyst who upgraded Colgate stock yesterday on the news. ''With this restructuring, they will have the flexibility to post better earnings growth while redeploying funds into marketing and new product development to help drive top-line growth.''
 Investors reacted positively to the announcement, with shares of Colgate rising $3.78, to $50.07.
 The restructuring comes as Colgate experienced its first decline in quarterly profit in eight years, and investors have complained that the company has been slower to innovate than its peers.
 With the cost savings from the effort, Mr. Mark said, Colgate plans to increase its investment in the development of pet nutrition, dental and personal care products as well as some potentially new categories. But he promised no immediate big hits. 
 ''We will continue to build on quiet innovation that gives us consistent growth in volume and market share,'' Mr. Mark said. ''The one time we talked about torrid innovation was Simply White, and look where that got us.'' That Colgate product, a tooth-whitening liquid that came in a nail polish container with a small brush, hit store shelves and stayed there. But P.&G.'s Crest Whitestrips was a blockbuster.
 The company said the restructuring effort entailed closing a total of about two dozen factories worldwide over the next four years, concentrating its manufacturing in ''fewer, more sophisticated'' centers around the world. Although Colgate shut 24 of its 112 factories and eliminated more than 3,000 jobs when it went through a restructuring less than a decade ago, analysts said that many of its existing plants in the United States were old, unionized, and did not have the manufacturing- line efficiency of rivals.
 There are no senior management departures expected as part of the reorganization, and Mr. Mark did not say which factories would be shut or how many jobs would be lost in the United States. He said the effort was not a major attempt at outsourcing. ''The great bulk of it is in our key products where we don't outsource,'' he said. 
 Still, Mr. Mark hinted of at least a subtle shift in the company's plans in emerging economies -- it is stepping up marketing efforts in China, Russia and Eastern Europe, where rivals have been spending even more. ''I am not sure it is a shift in strategy,'' he said, ''but it is a de-emphasis of production to marketing.''

HEADLINE: Sale of I.B.M. PC Unit Is a Bridge Between Companies and Cultures

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Andrew Ross Sorkin, in New York, and Gary Rivlin, in San Francisco, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced late yesterday the sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo, China's largest personal computer maker, a deal that reflects the industrial and economic ambitions of not only the two companies but also their two nations. 
 Under Lenovo's ownership, the I.B.M. personal computer business will continue to be based in the United States and run by its current management team. I.B.M. will take a stake of 18.9 percent in Lenovo, which is based in Beijing but plans to have headquarters in New York. 
 The significance of the deal may exceed the relatively modest amount that Lenovo is paying: a total of $1.75 billion in cash, stock and debt. 
 The transaction -- The Times reported late last week that I.B.M. had put its PC business up for sale -- points to the rising global aspirations of corporate China as it strives to become a trusted supplier to Western companies and consumers. The sale also signals a recognition by I.B.M., the prototypical American multinational, that its own future lies even farther up the economic ladder, in technology services and consulting, in software and in the larger computers that power corporate networks and the Internet. All are businesses far more profitable for I.B.M. than its personal computer unit. 
 But the move signals an acknowledgment by I.B.M. that its future in China may be best served by a close partnership with a local market leader -- particularly one, as in Lenovo's case, that is partly owned by the Chinese government. The chief executive of Lenovo will be Stephen M. Ward Jr., currently an I.B.M. senior vice president in charge of the PC business. Lenovo's current chief and president, Yang Yuanqing, will become Lenovo's chairman.
 American companies, in one industry after another, are scrambling to take advantage of the vast potential of the Chinese market. Chinese companies like Lenovo, meanwhile, are increasingly seeking to tap into overseas markets, management expertise and technological skills. 
 ''This is an encouraging sign of the increasingly sophisticated trans-Pacific ties between the United States and China,'' said Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University. ''Seeing the Chinese seeking these kinds of economic links can only be a good thing.''
 The complex transaction is meant to serve as a bridge between very different companies from different cultures, by seeking to ensure that I.B.M. has a stake in the Chinese company's success. Whether in the United States, in China or anywhere else in the world, such a stake would be in I.B.M.'s self-interest; a messy exit from the personal computer industry could rankle corporate customers, hurting I.B.M.'s other businesses, and tarnish its stellar brand name. 
 I.B.M. has agreed to hold onto its stake in Lenovo for three years, the companies said, with an option of extending it. I.B.M.'s financial commitment to Lenovo could help open doors for its efforts to win other business in China.
 The senior management of the current I.B.M. personal computer business will join the Chinese company, led by Mr. Ward and Fran O'Sullivan, the general manager of I.B.M.'s personal computer division. 
 Besides management expertise, Lenovo would be acquiring five-year brand-licensing rights to a computer business best known for its I.B.M. Thinkpad notebooks, its sleek black desktops and the product line's distinctive tricolor I.B.M. logo. 
 While Lenovo will have its headquarters in New York, the hub of the I.B.M. PC business is in Raleigh, N.C., where its design and development operations are based. I.B.M. employs about 10,000 people worldwide in its PC business, although fewer than a quarter of those workers are in the United States. In fact, 40 percent already work in China. 
 Under the agreement, I.B.M. will continue to handle technical support, financing and warranty coverage globally for its former personal computer division. Those tend to be steady and profitable cash-generating businesses, even as the PC business itself has been only intermittently profitable for I.B.M. lately. 
 It was I.B.M. that moved the personal computer industry from a hobbyist market into the corporate and consumer mainstream with its first PC in 1981. But as the company lost its PC market leadership to nimbler players, the company has pulled back its commitment to the business, first by getting out of retail sales and, in 2002, passing off its desktop PC manufacturing to a Silicon Valley contractor, Sanmina-SCI.
 Today, I.B.M. is a distant third in worldwide PC market share, behind Dell and Hewlett-Packard. I.B.M.'s personal computer sales are about $10 billion a year, or about 11 percent of its $89 billion in revenue, but it has hovered between slight profits and losses in recent years. 
 In its hasty entry into the PC business in the early 1980's, I.B.M. made what turned out to be a strategic mistake: it chose outside suppliers for the crucial technologies of the microprocessor and the software operating system, helping Intel and Microsoft become two of the most profitable companies in the world. 
 For nearly a decade, executives have debated dropping out of the personal computer business. Samuel J. Palmisano, who became I.B.M.'s chief executive in 2002, finally made the move. He decided that the company's management and investment resources would be better used in its other businesses like software and services to help customers use information technology to help automate business tasks from product design to procurement.
 ''The PC business is just not that important anymore to I.B.M. strategically,'' said A.M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Palmisano has decided to focus instead on businesses that are more profitable for I.B.M. and promise higher growth.''
 In a statement, Mr. Palmisano said the PC industry ''continues to take on the characteristics of the home and consumer electronics industry which favors enormous economies of scale and a focus on individual users and buyers,'' while I.B.M. will focus more on the corporate market.
 Still, industry analysts say, it is not clear that a business that was struggling under I.B.M. will thrive under Lenovo. Worldwide growth in PC sales, according to Gartner, a research firm, will slow to about 2 percent a year from 2006 to 2008, less than half the projected revenue gains of 4.7 percent a year from 2003 to 2005. The number of PC makers, analysts say, will probably be winnowed in the next few years.
 ''Lenovo aspires to become a major international player and a recognized brand, a company with the ability to sell into multinational corporations and be profitable,'' said Leslie Fiering, an analyst for Gartner. ''This deal improves its chances, but the business is only going to get tougher over the next few years.''
 The personal computer industry, like most technology businesses, is not one in which low labor costs -- one of China's advantages in competing with Western rivals -- are much of an edge. The big winner in the business, Dell Computer, is mainly a master of ultra-efficient management of its suppliers, assembly and distribution.
 I.B.M.'s rivals said the Lenovo purchase would create uncertainty among customers and provide opportunity for them. ''It's hard to think back on a successful large merger in the computer industry, and I don't see this one being different,'' Michael S. Dell, chairman of Dell Computer, said yesterday. ''We like to acquire our competitors one customer at a time.''

HEADLINE: Growth in Productivity Slows; Consumer Borrowing Rises 4.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers grew at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the third quarter, the slowest in nearly two years, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. 
 The deceleration raised some hope that employers, who have squeezed so much efficiency out of their work forces, may now have to increase hiring to meet customer demand. 
 This latest snapshot of productivity -- the amount an employee produces for each hour of work -- showed that the gains were slightly weaker than the 1.9 percent growth first estimated for the quarter. The new figures, based on more complete data, represented a further slowing from the 3.9 percent pace of productivity in the second quarter. 
 Anthony Chan, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, commented, ''I think we are setting ourselves up for much better, firmer hiring.''
 Though the economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the third quarter, the labor market is still trying to gain real traction. A total of 112,000 jobs were added in November, down from 303,000 in October. 
 Some analysts expected the growth in productivity to rise to a 2 percent pace last quarter rather than the adjustment downward. 
 In other economic news on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve reported that consumers increased their borrowing at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 4.4 percent in October, or $7.7 billion, compared with September. There was greater demand for car loans, and other nonrevolving credit was stronger than the $6 billion increase analysts had expected. 
 The 4.4 percent rise followed a steeper one in September of 7.9 percent, or $13.6 billion. 
 The Fed's report on consumer borrowing includes credit card debt and loans for cars and boats. But it excludes home mortgages and home equity loans.

HEADLINE: Albany Votes To Expand Javits Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After months of political wrangling, the State Legislature yesterday approved a $1.4 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which public officials and tourism executives say will help attract new and larger trade shows to the city and stimulate development of the far West Side of Manhattan.
 The vote was the culmination of a decade-long effort to expand the Javits Center, which is smaller than convention centers in Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas and Cleveland and is unable to handle many large trade shows and conventions. As a result, tourism advocates say, the city has lost tens of millions of dollars in hotel and restaurant bookings and retail sales.
 But the Legislature approved the bill only after severing any connection with the far more controversial proposal to build a football stadium, also costing $1.4 billion, for the New York Jets over the rail yards south of the Javits Center. In that sense, the vote was a blow to the Bloomberg administration's hopes to keep the projects linked. 
 The legislation, which Gov. George E. Pataki has said he supports, paves the way for construction to begin next year on a project that would add hundreds of thousands of square feet of exhibition and meeting space to the Javits Center as well as a ballroom and a 1,500-room hotel. The center, which stretches from 34th to 38th Streets along 11th Avenue, would expand northward to 40th Street, with the hotel on 42nd Street. 
 ''The expansion of the Javits will allow us to attract groups that cannot use the current configuration,'' said Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of the city's convention and visitors bureau and chief executive of Loews Hotels. ''Once these groups come to town they'll increase demand at hotels, restaurants, cultural attractions and retail. Other than the rebuilding of downtown, this is the most important capital project not just for the travel and tourism industry but for the overall economy of our town.''
 Although the Bloomberg administration would have preferred a connection to the stadium, it nonetheless hailed the legislation as a sign of momentum in its $6.5 billion effort to rezone the West Side for large-scale development, extend the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street and build a football stadium that could also be used for the Olympics if the city wins its bid for the 2012 games.
 The West Side rezoning plan is now being debated by the City Council, which is expected to vote on it next month. And later this month, the Empire State Development Corporation is expected to give formal approval to the stadium project, which is called the New York Sports and Convention Center because it would also serve as an exhibition hall.
 ''Now that the legally required legislative approval has been achieved,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement yesterday, ''we will turn our efforts to the two remaining pieces of the plan: the rezoning that will create a vibrant, mixed-use community and the construction of the New York Sports and Convention Center.''
 The stadium is opposed by Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden and views it as competition. Also opposed are most of the residents of the West Side neighborhood, some Broadway theater owners and some Albany politicians. Both sides say that lawsuits are inevitable.
 ''We succeeded in getting the Javits done,'' said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. ''The stadium is something that's going to live or die on its own. Clearly, the jury is out.''
 Councilwoman Christine Quinn, whose district includes the West Side, said she opposes the stadium but favors expansion of the Javits Center.
 Under the expansion plan, the Javits Center will add 340,000 square feet of exhibition space, bringing the total to 1.1 million square feet. It will also create 265,000 square feet of meeting space, up from 30,000, which is considered necessary for many conventions. The American Association of Orthodontists, for example, could not book the center because of the small amount of meeting space. But the 20,000-member association has a tentative agreement to bring its convention to the Javits Center in 2013 if the expansion goes through.
 To pay for construction, the state will refinance the $350 million debt on the center, and the city will contribute $350 million. The legislation also authorizes a $1.50 a night surcharge on hotel rooms dedicated to the expansion.
 The expansion program had been hobbled by disputes for years, and even the current legislation took six months of political jostling to achieve. 
 Years ago, Mr. Pataki said he favored enlarging the convention center and set about cleaning up what was widely regarded in the convention industry as a corrupt and difficult operation. But then Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani balked at expanding the Javits Center after Mr. Pataki declined to support his dream of moving Yankee Stadium to the West Side rail yards. The center subsequently became part of Mayor Bloomberg's plans for the Olympics and the West Side. 
 In exchange for his support, the Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, won $350 million for projects in Long Island and elsewhere in the state, balancing the state's investment of $350 million in the Javits Center.
 Even at the end, state officials and Assembly Democrats said, Mayor Bloomberg feared that progress on the Javits Center alone could undermine momentum for the stadium.
 ''The key was the mayor finally understanding that he was not going to get a Javits bill that provided back-door approval for a stadium,'' Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried said.

HEADLINE: Celebrating Mexican Life in New York

BYLINE: By JULIE SALAMON

 BODY:
MexicoNow can be seen as a coming-out party for the huge influx of Mexicans into New York City over the last decade. In the six weeks since it opened on Oct. 23 dozens of events in 36 venues in the five boroughs have given New Yorkers a chance to discover the cutting edge of Mexican art, architecture and performance, as well as revisiting more familiar territory, like the films Luis Bunuel made during his exile in Mexico from the late 1940's to 1960. 
 Though not intended to be exclusive, this monthlong festival, which wraps up today, arrived with the blessing -- and financing -- of the establishment. Sponsors include the Mexican Tourism Board, American Express, the company Bloomberg and Mexicana Airlines. Performances, lectures and exhibitions have been held in Latino institutions like El Museo del Barrio and the Instituto Cervantes, but also in mainstream places like Lincoln Center, the Guggenheim Museum, the Joyce Theater and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (The festival closes tonight with the popular musician Alejandro Fernandez performing in the theater at Madison Square Garden.) 
 But it is a party that many Mexican newcomers to New York have not been able to attend. ''For some people, particularly new immigrants, the experience of going to the theater or a performance is not possible,'' said Julian Zugazagoitia, the director of El Museo del Barrio, who was born and raised in Mexico. ''They are working seven days a week, very heavy hours.'' (The Guggenheim's adult admission is $15.)
 According to the 2000 United States census, 186,872 Mexicans live in the city, more than triple the number a decade earlier; in addition at least 100,000 or more are undocumented immigrants. Many are doing jobs no one else wants, for pay few would accept. Many Mexicans in New York bear, in addition to the freight of economic pressure, the fear of deportation. 
 ''I went to the exhibition at the Guggenheim and it was fantastic, but how can most Mexicans who live here afford to go to these things?'' asked Teresa Garcia, development director for the Asociacion Tepeyac de New York, founded in the mid-1990's by Roman Catholic priests and community leaders to help Mexican immigrants. Yet the festival's opening night offering on Oct. 23 -- and the one most likely to appeal to a wide variety of Mexicans -- was among the highest priced, and it sold out: the mariachi star Vincente Fernandez and his band at Madison Square Garden.
 If MexicoNow has demonstrated that Mexican culture includes but goes well beyond the cliches -- ruins, tortillas, mariachi -- the festival has also highlighted the challenges of defining cultural identity. Mexicans are the fastest-growing immigrant population in New York. But they say they often feel invisiblein a city where the word Chicano is far more likely to evoke the streets of Los Angeles, or border towns in Texas, than Queens, Brooklyn or the Bronx.
 ''When you arrive here, you experience this incredibly odd and intriguing feeling of being in a city that knows us not at all, neither as Mexicans nor Chicanos,'' said Gerald P. Lopez, a law professor and director of the Center for Community Problem Solving at New York University, who grew up in East Los Angeles.. 
 For much of New York's Mexican population, culture boils down to making an alien world feel like home. Music, dance and street festivals are often intertwined with religion, politics and the struggle for legal rights.
 The single largest cultural event among Mexicans is the feast day celebrating the Virgin of Guadalupe, this Sunday. The ritual is based on a legendary appearance , in 1531, by the Virgin Mary before an Aztec peasant, Juan Diego, a decade after the Spanish had conquered the Aztec empire. It was a significant cross-cultural moment, as the legend goes, because the Virgin told Diego that she embraced not only the Spanish but native peoples as well.
 Three years ago Tepeyac added a new variation on this themeby instituting the International Torch run, a relay race that began in Mexico City on Oct. 10 and that will culminate in New York at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday. As the torch is passed, spectators greet the 7,000 runners with food, music and slogans about things like the rights of undocumented workers.
 Both street culture and the more rarefied offerings of MexicoNow have similar goals, said Claudia Norman, project director of the festival. ''Both want to make the invisible visible,'' said Ms. Norman, who moved to New York from Mexico City 15 years ago. ''Both want to open a window onto this new group of citizens who might be your busboy or your lawyer. We are both.''
 The audiences for MexicoNow events have been mixed: Anglo, Mexican, a variety of tourists. When El Museo del Barrio presented ''El Automovil Gris,'' a theater piece, the audience ''looked like they might have walked from their apartments on Fifth Avenue, but also people from el barrio,'' Mr. Zugazagoitia said. 
 The Mexican community in New York barely existed 20 years ago. Researchers have just recently begun to develop information beyond the fact that a large percentage of Mexicans in New York come from the state of Puebla, southeast of Mexico City, and that they are poor. The unknowns include health care, housing, education, family dynamics and dealing with the criminal justice system and immigration issues. They are also learning how these immigrants create, celebrate and mourn.
 Arnulfo Chino, 36, cultural development coordinator for Tepeyac, moved to New York 16 years ago from Puebla. ''It was very difficult to find our music and, more important, our food,'' he said. ''We had to drive all the way to New Rochelle to find tortillas and chilis for cooking.''
 In the last decade, however, fresh tortillas, chilis, even live chickens have become readily available in neighborhoods like Sunset Park and Bushwick in Brooklyn, in East Harlem and in neighborhoods like Elmhurst and Jackson Heights in Queens. Children can take mariachi lessons in East Harlem; nightclubs in Queens, Harlem and Brooklyn specialize in sonidero shows, a particular Mexican entertainment featuring celebrity disc jockeys. 
 Mr. Chino worked as a dishwasher at the Hudson River Club in the World Financial Center, across from the World Trade Center. He stayed there, in increasingly better positions, until Sept. 11, 2001. The restaurant closed.
 ''You have to look at how people have to adapt their culture to survive in the new environment, but also how they adapt the new environment to support their culture,'' said Ilana Harlow, a folklorist at the Library of Congress. ''In New York, where all these cultures come into contact with each other, this mixing of cultures is more intense.''
 Consuelo Rios Munoz works at a music store in Sunset Park that features Spanish-language music, cumbia, bachatas, reggaeton and sonidero music. Ms. Rios Munoz, 19, has lived in New York for four years and speaks little English. She goes dancing at a club in Queens that plays reggaeton, a fusion of hip-hop and reggae from Puerto Rico, to a largely Mexican audience.
 Ms. Rios Munoz said she planned to celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe in church on Dec. 12, but she has not sought traditional dances and songs she learned in Mexico. ''I don't miss them,'' she said. ''I'm into the reggaeton.''

HEADLINE: My 3 Sons: Cloning's Unexpected Results

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Even the title makes you dizzy when you think about it, in the way that staring at printed words causes them to wriggle and blur. ''A Number,'' to be exact (or inexact), is the name of Caryl Churchill's stunning new play, which opened last night at the New York Theater Workshop. And a number is something definite and specific, right? As in pick a number from 1 to 10?
 Sorry, but that's not what Ms. Churchill has in mind, or at least not the only thing she has in mind. ''A number'' is also the first line of this latest drama from the ferociously inventive Ms. Churchill that stars Sam Shepard (who is terrific in his first New York stage appearance in more than 30 years) as a guilt-hobbled father and Dallas Roberts as his son. 
 Uh, make that sons. Because ''a number,'' in this instance, refers to an indeterminable quantity -- more than one, maybe 20, maybe more -- of the versions of Mr. Roberts's character who are roaming the earth. 
 ''A Number,'' you see, is a gripping dramatic consideration of what happens to autonomous identity in a world where people can be cloned. The invaluable Ms. Churchill has not begun to stop surprising and unbalancing theatergoers. Since the 1970's this British dramatist has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. She has pondered mutations in gender (''Cloud Nine'') and language (''Blue Heart''), as well as the seismic disruptions of revolution (''Mad Forest''), civil war (''Far Away'') and environmental poisoning (''The Skriker'').
 She has now moved on to ponder a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere hour of spartan sentences and silences. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination.
 Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors, meticulously directed by James Macdonald, sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. There's a reason that the men in ''A Number'' seem to speak in shards. Inarticulateness has become the only fitting form of eloquence.
 The arrival in New York of ''A Number,'' which was produced at the Royal Court Theater in London two years ago, is a great event. And the Workshop has honored the occasion not only by luring the magnetic Mr. Shepard, who is of course famous as a playwright and movie actor, back to the stage, but also by entirely reconfiguring its theater. The designer Eugene Lee has created an interior fashioned after medical operating theaters of the 19th century, with seats arranged on a steep, high-rising slope, looking down on a clean, harshly lighted space, suitable for the performance of autopsies.
 It's an appropriate environment for a play that anatomizes the impact of a scientific pursuit. But don't be fooled into thinking that you'll be able to keep a clinical distance. Just as Ms. Churchill used seductive forms of the fable and fairy tale to lure audiences into the toxic world of ''Far Away'' and ''The Skriker,'' she here works within one of the oldest conventions of drama: the standoff between an aging father and his grown son.
 Matters common to such confrontations come up during the elliptical conversations conducted by Salter (Mr. Shepard) and the characters played by Mr. Roberts, a rising star of stage (''Burn This'') and film (''A Home at the End of the World''). Paternal guilt, filial resentment, the degree to which each man is responsible for his actions -- these aspects are all duly brought up in ''A Number.''
 But the implications of each element multiply several fold because of the unholy variable Ms. Churchill has thrown into the mix. About 30 years before the play's beginning, it seems, Salter lost his wife and beloved son, a toddler, and consulted a genetic scientist to have a new child created in the image of the other. Now Salter, rather like Scrooge on Christmas Eve, receives visits from not one but three results of this experiment.
 To explain more would be to dilute the sinister and profound pleasures of Ms. Churchill's puzzle of a play. But as the talk ranges over childhood memories, descriptions of pets and possible lawsuits, ''A Number'' strikes sharp and reverberant chords of implications about the ways people rationalize bad behavior and unthinkingly objectify others, including their own flesh and blood.
 Mr. Shepard -- who as a dramatist considers societal disintegration from his own, very different point of view -- turns out to be an ideal interpreter of Ms. Churchill's disjunctive prose. Her fragmented dialogue flows from him like blood from an opened vein. That his manner is as low key as always does not mean that he does not register every iota of Salter's stricken defensiveness. And his haggard leading-man good looks here convey the impression of a bewildered burnt-out case.
 Mr. Roberts, whose face melts between slyness and raw openness, is excellent in two of his incarnations. In the third and creepiest of them he is still finding his way. But Mr. Macdonald, who brilliantly directed the Royal Court production of Sarah Kane's ''4:48 Psychosis,'' makes consistently resonant use of the relative postures of his two actors.
 Power, passivity, horror and satisfaction are all conveyed simply by the ways Mr. Shepard and Mr. Roberts sit, stand and lie. Any moment, frozen out of context, is a classic image of the gulf -- and the possibility of a bridge -- between two generations. When these moments are connected, though, the same images bleed into an anything-but-classic portrait that portends a scary, brave new family for which the rules have yet to be written.

HEADLINE: A Boston Federal Building Is Going Green at Age 72

BYLINE: By TED SMALLEY BOWEN

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse, a monumental granite-clad 22-story Art Deco structure in Boston's financial district, is about to undergo a $78 million renovation that has a number of distinctive goals. Among the most ambitious renovations of a federal building, the project is committed to applying environmentally friendly ''green'' standards; at the same time, modern systems must be installed without compromising the historical integrity of the landmark Depression-era building.
 The 1932 building was designed by Ralph Adams Cram, an architect known mainly for his university buildings and churches, notably the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. The project is to refurbish courtrooms and a library, the entrance and elevator lobbies and coffered ceilings while saving energy, minimizing the building's negative impact on the environment and improving workplace conditions. 
 Achieving all this requires finesse and compromise, according to the Boston architectural firm Goody Clancy, the prime contracting architectural firm, and the building's manager, the General Services Administration. Other participants include government agency occupants like the Environmental Protection Agency, the building's largest tenant. 
 While the challenges of renovating a structure in its eighth decade of existence may seem evident, buildings of this vintage actually have some inherently green features. ''The designs of earlier periods incorporated natural ventilation and light and used very sustainable materials,'' said John Buckley, the assistant project manager for the General Services Administration.
 At the same time, preservation requirements can complicate major updates of a building's heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, electrical and communications systems.
 Goody Clancy and the G.S.A. are hashing out construction papers; work is expected to begin next year and wrap up late in 2006 or in 2007.
 The G.S.A. is upgrading the original aluminum windows; adding vegetation to create a green roof, which reduces storm water runoff and the ''urban heat island effect'' created when dark roofs and paving absorb heat in the summer; knocking out office partitions to improve natural light and ventilation; installing compact fluorescent lights and energy-efficient controls; and using recycled and nontoxic materials, according to agency officials. 
 With support from the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative's Renewable Energy Trust, a program financed by utility ratepayers, the G.S.A. is exploring the use of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic cells, which power solar electric systems. It is also examining fuel cells, wind turbines and other clean fuels to reduce demand on the electrical grid. The agency is also working with a local steam provider, TriGen-Boston, on the possibility of reusing steam condensate in a heating system cooling tower and toilet tanks and is considering a back-pressure steam turbine to generate electricity. 
 Besides the E.P.A., the building's other tenants include the Department of Education and the Federal Bankruptcy Court. The post office moved across the street this summer, partly for security reasons. 
 Although it might seem an unlikely advocate of sustainability and historic preservation, the General Services Administration owns and leases hundreds of millions of square feet of work space for federal employees and it counts hundreds of historic buildings among its holdings. In addition, the agency helped to draft energy use and environmental guidelines as part of the ''greening the government'' initiative begun in the 1990's.
 The G.S.A. is a member of the United States Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization that includes designers, developers, institutions, builders, environmentalists and manufacturers. The group developed Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, specifications, which lay out measures that are intended to benefit the environment and reduce energy use. They include locating near public transportation and building on formerly contaminated property to recycling construction waste and adding onsite power generation. 
 Qualifying projects are certified on a graduated scale. G.S.A. projects aim for LEED silver status, the third-highest level, behind platinum and gold. The agency also uses LEED criteria in pressing for better conditions in the spaces it leases.
 There are no federal or state green building tax incentives equivalent to the 20 percent federal tax break and various state tax breaks for historic preservation of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But private developers can qualify for a variety of grants, offsets and preferences at the state and local level. And federal agencies, state and local governments and institutions are increasingly adopting the LEED system as a requirement for their own building and renovation projects. 
 Renovations make up a considerable portion of commercial building projects -- more than 15 percent of United States construction spending in recent years, according to McGraw-Hill Construction, a research and publishing unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies. That figure is conservative, since it excludes smaller projects and those that did not involve architects, according to a McGraw-Hill economist, Jennifer Coskren. 
 How many of those are historic preservation projects or exercises in sustainable design is difficult to determine, though interest in both categories is increasing.
 The National Park Service, which maintains the National Register of Historic Places, annually approves 1,200 to 1,300 preservation projects, with an investment value of $3 billion, for the 20 percent federal tax break, according to the chief of technical preservation services, Sharon Park. In the last three years, about 22 percent of that has been office space and 25 percent other commercial space, Ms. Park said. Most projects are in the Northeast and South, where the National Register properties are concentrated. 
 Especially in cases where historic tax credits are not available, developers are likely to need incentives to pursue green preservation projects, according to Jean Carroon, Goody Clancy's principal for preservation.
 ''The tax credits for historic preservation were key to urban redevelopment, and we need the same kind of thing for sustainable design,'' she said. ''We need more documentation that shows that people really want to work in healthy environments and are willing to pay more to work in a healthy environment because there is a payback to the business owner in fewer sick days and a better work environment. That documentation is starting to happen but it is vague, so that makes it very challenging.''
 The G.S.A. and other institutional owner-managers, through their projects and follow-up studies, are generating data that advocates say may help to make the case that green preservation projects are worth the effort. 
 Historic preservation and sustainability are not incompatible, of course -- reuse is a central tenet of environmentally sensitive design. But the goals can conflict, as in the treatment of windows, changes in floor plans or the use of insulation. The relatively small group of designers and advocates who specialize in green preservation are gearing up to bring both priorities into alignment.
 Some preservationists caution that LEED's emphasis on direct energy savings may predispose developers to replace historic windows and other original building elements, even though LEED does not proscribe operable windows and natural ventilation. 
 ''Often we're ripping out windows that are 100 and some years old in order to have a lower energy bill from the thermostat, but when we start looking at more of the holistic picture about how windows are made, about the trucking to move windows, we see the environmental cost,'' said Ms. Carroon of Goody Clancy. ''And the embodied energy of glass is very high.'' Embodied energy is a measure of the energy required to manufacture, transport, use and recycle or dispose of a given product or material.
 In the case of the McCormack Building, the original windows seem to be beyond repair, according to the G.S.A. project manager, Ivan Lopez. ''You can see through the metal in some places, and they're single-pane, sealed with caulking containing asbestos.'' 
 The decision on the windows is still pending and the design team is looking at the feasibility of bolstering the existing windows and of commissioning replicas. State and city historic preservation authorities will have to sign off on the plan.

HEADLINE: Pledges of Reform in Albany Stumble in a Familiar Whirl of Politics

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Lawmakers in both parties pledged in their November re-election campaigns to overhaul the notoriously dysfunctional state budget process, but by the time the dust had cleared in Albany yesterday, they had failed to fulfill this campaign promise.
 The lawmakers saw budget reform as an important first step in breaking the chronic gridlock in Albany. Under their proposal, if lawmakers failed to pass an on-time spending plan by a new deadline of May 1, a contingency budget would be imposed.
 Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed the proposal in November. Then Joseph L. Bruno, the powerful Republican majority leader of the State Senate, vowed that as a last resort, he would move this week to force an override of that veto, mindful of the campaign promises fellow senators had made. 
 But as lawmakers returned to the capital this week to try to finish up their business for the year, Monday came and went and so did Tuesday, with no action on the veto override. And as logjams began to break on several other longstanding and knotty issues in Albany, Senator Bruno agreed to postpone action until later this month or early next year.
 So, as with many things in Albany, the fate of the Legislature's promises to reform itself seemed caught in a net of complicated politics, entangled in the mostly contentious negotiations over a host of other proposals that seemed to swirl like the snow outside the State Capitol.
 ''The pre-election rhetoric has fallen far short of the post-election reality,'' said Blair Horner, a lobbyist with the New York Public Interest Research Group, who observed the events firsthand by stalking the hallways, as is his custom. ''Today was Albany at its most typical: secretive insider deal-making.''
 Though lawmakers, lobbyists and legislative aides seemed happy that some issues, like overhauling the Rockefeller drug laws, were finally being resolved, they lamented that, in many ways, it was business as usual: issues were being rushed with little chance to read bills or for debates in the daylight hours.
 After one closed-door meeting among Republican senators that lasted from 10 a.m. to past 1 p.m., Senator Michael A.L. Balboni, a Republican from Long Island, had two words: ''Stay tuned.''
 Senator Balboni worked the phones. He moved from the Senate's ornate chamber to a public hallway filled with lobbyists to labyrinthine back offices in the State Capitol, a portrait of activity on a day of dizzying, late-in-the-day developments.
 ''That's the best I can tell you,'' Mr. Balboni said. ''Stay tuned.''
 It turned out that for much of three hours, the Republicans debated one another over their budget overhaul bill. Hanging in the balance was the nettlesome political question of whether Republican lawmakers would override the governor for a second straight day. 
 This was a move that lawmakers, lobbyists and legislative aides said the governor wanted to avoid, since his veto of an increase in the state's minimum wage was overridden in the Senate on Monday.
 One Republican official said the senators wanted to override the governor but that their leader, Mr. Bruno, urged them to hold off.
 Ultimately, all sides said they would live to debate the issue another day. Whether that would be later this month or early next year was unclear, but lawmakers seemed to be using pencils only to write down their holiday vacation plans.
 The Democrats spoke of a Republican Senate searching to find its political soul in a year when it saw its majority dwindle by three, and perhaps four, seats. While the Republicans proved bolder in confronting the governor once this week, they were apparently unwilling to cross a line by crossing their fellow Republican twice in one week.
 But that failure became old news as word came that the lawmakers and the governor had reached an agreement to overhaul the state's Rockefeller-era drug laws and to pass a bill to expand the Javits Convention Center in New York City.
 Speculation intensified. What would the upstate Republican senators and those from Long Island want in exchange for their approving such a costly project for the city? The answer came in whispers first, then it was confirmed: There would be $350 million earmarked for economic development projects in regions around the state.
 It was not lost on Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who was holding court outside Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's office, that the Senate was moving on two items named for former liberal-leaning Republicans: Nelson A. Rockefeller and Jacob K. Javits. He said it showed how the recent talk of changing Albany's ways was actually having its practical effect on big public policy issues affecting state residents.
 Elsewhere, a lobbyist, Steven B. Weingarten, said he hoped lawmakers would override the governor's veto of their bill to allow the state to charge taxes on the sale of cigarettes and gasoline on New York State Indian reservations. They did not.
 Mr. Weingarten said $1 billion in state and local revenue would be lost.
 Others talked on cellphones of a deal to spend a quarter-million dollars on information technology systems and upgrades in hospitals, a measure lost to gubernatorial veto earlier in the year. But no bill materialized; the issue faded.
 By evening, Mr. Pataki called a news conference. He said he would have preferred not to send messages of necessity, to allow lawmakers to vote on bills without a three-day waiting period required by the State Constitution. 
 But Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2002, said the speed with which Albany moved, particularly to change the drug laws, was alarming, considering that he was watching a group of self-professed reformers.
 ''They once again rushed a piece for legislation through without debate, without hearings and without even time for legislators to read the bill,'' he said. ''I am having a hard time finding a legislator who read the whole bill.''

HEADLINE: Justices Pick Apart Ban on Wine Sales From State to State

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
If the Supreme Court argument Tuesday on interstate wine sales proves to be a reliable roadmap to the eventual decision, consumers who want to order wine directly from out-of-state wineries will soon be able to do so with the court's blessing.
 The justices appeared notably unmoved by the arguments offered by New York and Michigan in defense of laws that prohibit the direct shipment of wine from other states while permitting in-state wineries to ship their products to their customers' homes.
 The 50 states are divided almost in half on a question that has grown increasingly contentious in the age of Internet advertising and sales. Twenty-six states permit direct shipment from out-of-state wineries; 24 ban it. The federal appeals courts are divided, too; one court upheld New York while another, almost simultaneously, declared Michigan's law unconstitutional. 
 The states' central argument, presented by Solicitor General Thomas L. Casey of Michigan and Solicitor General Caitlin J. Halligan of New York, was that the 21st Amendment gave states such blanket authority over the ''importation'' of alcohol as to trump the constitutional principle that applies everywhere else in the national marketplace: that states cannot discriminate in favor of their own products.
 ''Mere protectionism is permitted'' by the amendment that repealed Prohibition, Mr. Casey said. 
 ''This case goes to the very core of the 21st Amendment,'' Ms. Halligan added in her turn.
 ''It also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy responded. That clause, which empowers Congress to regulate interstate commerce, has been interpreted since early in the country's history to include the implication that states may not, on their own minus Congressional authorization, discriminate against one another.
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that in the 21st Amendment he found ''not a word in any brief that I saw of any intent to get rid of the antidiscrimination principle.''
 Nor did the justices demonstrate more patience with the fallback, that if the 21st Amendment did not simply obliterate the Commerce Clause, the laws could nonetheless be justified by the twin goals of preventing minors' access to alcohol and ensuring that the states could collect taxes from out-of-state shippers.
 Kathleen Sullivan, arguing for the 13 consumers who successfully challenged the Michigan law in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pointed out that Michigan permits its 40 in-state wineries and 7,500 liquor retailers to make home deliveries. That showed ''a pattern of exceptions that belies any implication'' that the state's real goal was to protect minors, she said.
 Ms. Sullivan, a professor and former dean at the Stanford Law School, said several states that permit direct shipments from out-of-state wineries tracked the taxes owed by requiring the wineries to obtain permits and report monthly.
 Her points made an impact, and Justice David H. Souter observed to Mr. Casey, Michigan's lawyer: ''Your opponents argue that there are no clear countervailing interests here, so by process of elimination you get down to nothing but protectionism. What's your answer?''
 The law really does enable the state to protect minors, Mr. Casey replied.
 ''You say that, but how?'' Justice Souter persisted. 
 Mr. Casey's response that state regulators could punish a state-licensed business left Justice Souter clearly unsatisfied.
 The two state laws under review in Granholm v. Heald, No. 03-1116, the Michigan case, and Swedenburg v. Kelly, No. 03-1274, the New York case, are not identical. While Michigan flatly prohibits direct shipment by out-of-state wineries, New York theoretically permits it, as long as the winery maintains a physical presence in the state, including a warehouse to store its wines before sale. No out-of-state winery has qualified for this exception, and although the law has been on the books since 1970, the state has not issued the regulations necessary to make the exception operative.
 Clint Bolick, arguing for the plaintiffs in the New York case -- small wineries in Virginia and California, along with three New York wine drinkers -- said small wineries could not afford to set up offices around the country as the price of reaching customers in other states. 
 ''Our clients cannot compete with liquor distributors,'' Mr. Bolick said. ''They can compete in the market. The Commerce Clause protects a level playing field.'' 
 He noted that of 3,000 wineries in the country, 600 sell their products in New York's retail liquor stores.
 Mr. Bolick is strategic litigation counsel of the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm with libertarian leanings that began a campaign against the state laws several years ago. His lawsuit in New York succeeded in Federal District Court, but that ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which took an expansive view of the 21st Amendment.
 Mr. Bolick said the amendment should be understood to permit states to regulate alcohol ''by one set of rules, not two.'' He added that New York was engaged ''not in legitimate regulation, but in economic protectionism.''
 The Supreme Court's own view of the 21st Amendment has shifted over the years from one that was much like the states' position to one that has increasingly taken account of the Commerce Clause. In a 1984 case from Hawaii, Bacchus Imports Ltd. v. Dias, the court invalidated an exemption from a 20 percent excise tax the state gave to its local liquor industry. 
 ''It is by now clear that the amendment did not entirely remove state regulation of alcoholic beverages from the ambit of the Commerce Clause,'' Justice Byron R. White said in his majority opinion, which concluded: ''We are convinced that Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand.''
 The Bacchus case was much discussed during the argument. The three dissenters in that case, Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor, along with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, are still on the court, while no member of the majority is. Nonetheless, there was no indication from Justices Stevens or O'Connor -- Chief Justice Rehnquist was not in court because of his treatment for cancer -- that they did not accept the Bacchus precedent as binding.
 ''If you can't grant a tax exemption,'' Justice Stevens said to Ms. Halligan, the New York lawyer, ''it seems to me a fortiori that you can't prohibit importation.''
 When Mr. Casey, Michigan's lawyer, said the Bacchus decision was wrongly decided and should be overruled, Justice O'Connor responded: ''It's a little hard to plan on overruling it, so why don't you address how to distinguish it, because it has a lot of language that cuts against you.'' 
 In addition to the states, the wineries and the wine drinkers, the wholesale liquor industry is acutely interested in the outcome. States regulate alcohol distribution by what is known as a three-tier system: producer to licensed wholesaler to licensed retailer. For the wholesalers, the stakes in this dispute are enormous. If consumers are enabled to buy directly from out-of-state producers, so, theoretically, might retailers be. 
 ''Under the same rationale, the in-state licensing system has to fall,'' Justice Kennedy observed at one point.

HEADLINE: Industry Distortion of the F.D.A.

 BODY:
Twelve years ago, the White House and Congress made an agreement with the pharmaceutical industry that seemed eminently reasonable at the time. The industry would supply substantial sums -- reaching $200 million a year at latest count -- to help the Food and Drug Administration hire more reviewers to speed the approval process for new drugs that might otherwise be held up solely by administrative logjams. The quid pro quo was that the government had to meet tight deadlines for reviewing drugs and had to keep steady its own financing for new-drug reviews, adjusted for inflation. 
 That seemed a reasonable way to ensure that the government did not cut back on its own funds and use the industry money to pay for reviewers already on the staff. But as an article by Gardiner Harris in The Times on Monday made clear, this 1992 deal -- negotiated under the first President George Bush and updated under President Bill Clinton and again under the current president -- has grievously distorted the agency's drug safety programs in unforeseen ways.
 The blame lies with successive administrations and Congresses that failed to keep sufficient funds flowing to the F.D.A. for pharmaceutical programs. As a result, the agency has had to cannibalize programs to monitor the safety of drugs after they are on the market to keep up its reviews of new drugs before they are allowed on the market. The shift in emphasis is striking. In 1993, the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research spent 53 percent of its budget on new-drug reviews, with most of the rest used for programs to ensure that drugs already on the market were safe. By last year, 79 percent of the agency's budget went for new-drug reviews. 
 Almost everything else has been starved. Half of the scientists in the drug center's labs are gone, reducing the agency's ability to conduct independent testing of suspect drugs. Collaborations with respected academic groups that assess drug side effects have ended. Both were savaged so money could be diverted to maintain a computerized listing of side-effect reports. This is the agency's main tool to detect postmarketing problems, and virtually all experts say it has serious shortcomings.
 We are not optimistic that a Republican-dominated Congress and administration, beholden to drug industry campaign contributions, will leap to change a system that works to the industry's advantage. But the last three presidents and their Congresses got the F.D.A. into this bipartisan mess, so Washington ought to fix it. One solution would be to revisit the agreement so corporate money could be used to support a wide range of postmarketing checks, not just initial drug reviews. An even better approach would be to increase federal support for the F.D.A. so safety monitoring would be adequately financed and the industry's influence would be proportionately reduced. That should not prove frightfully expensive and would be a price worth paying.

HEADLINE: Preserve Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As the father of the Chilean pension system, Jose Pinera (''Retiring in Chile,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 1) paints a seemingly attractive picture of personal retirement accounts. It might be worth examining many of the problems experienced by Chile's pension system before accepting this argument.
 Even the World Bank, a staunch proponent of private accounts, now concludes that they fail to prevent poverty in old age and that more needs to be done to strengthen the public safety net. 
 Social Security provides rock-solid, inflation-proof and lifetime-guaranteed benefits, whereas private accounts are subject to risky market fluctuations and high administrative costs. 
 Social Security can pay every penny of promised benefits until 2042. It's true that the program needs some changes so that it will always be able to pay full benefits for Americans today and tomorrow. But rather than spend trillions of dollars we don't have on risky private accounts that weaken Social Security, we should strengthen the guaranteed benefit for all generations. 
 For these reasons, AARP adamantly opposes overhauling Social Security through private accounts.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Interest Rate Steady

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Canada's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5 percent and backed off a plan to raise borrowing costs in the future, saying the country's surging currency might slow exports and inflation. The Bank of Canada increased borrowing costs at its last two policy meetings, matching the Federal Reserve in the United States. Since the last increase on Oct. 19, the Canadian dollar has gained as much as 6.8 percent. The currency's advance has made Canadian goods more expensive for international buyers and cut exports last quarter. The central bank reiterated that it was concerned that the currency's gain might slow growth further and dropped a phrase signaling its intention to raise interest rates at some point in the future.

HEADLINE: 3 Miles an Hour on the Oregon Trail

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

'The Oregon Trail'
'An American Saga'
By David Dary
Illustrated. 414 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
 For restless Americans in the 1840's and 50's, the Oregon Trail was the great highway west. From 1843 until the early 1850's, the years of peak traffic, about a quarter of a million people followed its rutted path in the longest voluntary migration in history, heading out from Missouri toward Oregon, California, Utah and other destinations.
 In smaller numbers they continued to travel it until the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. This is the primal American drama. Like their emigrant European forebears, the Americans who followed the trail pulled up stakes, gathered their belongings and moved their families thousands of miles into an unknowable future. Some went after rich farmland in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Others lusted after California gold. Still others, the Mormons, searched for a celestial city in the shimmering desert. Even today, the ruts left by their wagon wheels can be seen along a route that ran for more than 2,000 miles from Missouri to the Pacific Coast.
 This great westward trip, undertaken at an average speed of three miles an hour for as long as four and a half months, should be a storyteller's dream, but David Dary, the author of many books on the American West, delivers a dry, reportorial history. It's an accountant's view, a dull, dutiful trudge that drags the reader along the trail, year by year, at the speed of a Conestoga wagon hauled by a team of six oxen. 
 The facts are all there. Mr. Dary has carefully sifted through many of the 2,000 firsthand descriptions of the trail left by those who traveled it. He throws in a couple of helpful appendices, one a descriptive list of historic landmarks along the trail, the other a trail vocabulary, explaining terms like ''follow the tongue.'' (At night, the tongue of the lead wagon was pointed toward the North Star, so that the wagon train could orient itself the next morning.)
 But the romantic aspects of the story suggested by his subtitle, ''An American Saga,'' so evident in the work of writers like Francis Parkman and artists like Albert Bierstadt, never light a fire under Mr. Dary, who sets himself the sober task of laying out the facts and arranging them in a coherent pattern.
 Mr. Dary begins at the beginning, which is to say, the end, in Oregon. Beaver fur was the initial attraction, with John Jacob Astor competing against the Hudson's Bay Company in an American-Canadian rivalry that was not settled until 1846, when the border between the United States and Canada was fixed by treaty. In the meantime missionaries began making their way to what was known as Oregon Country, and a motley assortment of fur-trading mountain men and explorers marked out the most efficient overland route from the Missouri River.
 Efficient is a relative term. No matter how one proceeded, the trip west was brutal, as the Donner party, to cite an extreme example, found to its horror. Wagon wheels stuck fast in the mud below the shallow Platte River. Water was scarce on the plains.
 Timing was everything. If winter arrived early, emigrants paid with their lives. Information, especially for the early pioneers, was unreliable. In 1845 a large party followed a trapper's shortcut to the Dalles, a series of rapids on the Columbia River in Oregon. Unfortunately, the trapper had taken the route in 1834, an unusually wet year. In 1845 the terrain was dry and barren, and nearly 50 emigrants died.
 The Donner party came to grief in part, Mr. Dary suggests, because it may have relied on a guide published by Lansford Warren Hastings, which touted a shorter route that he probably never traveled. Some shortcuts were created simply to draw trade. The Lassen Cutoff, just inside the eastern California border, drew wagon trains through a rough, perilous three-mile canyon and required them to cross and recross one river several times. The logic of the route was simple: it led straight to the ranch of Peter Lassen, who like many other entrepreneurs along the trail realized that fleecing the emigrants made a lot more sense than trying your luck in the goldfields.
 The Oregon Trail, like the Interstate highway of today, created its own economy. The forts and trading posts strung out along the route operated a little like service plazas. Emigrants could stock up on supplies, get their horses shod and trade with Indians. Some Indians took matters into their own hands, swooping down on wagon trains to steal horses or cattle or adopting an aggressive form of panhandling. Many emigrants found it hard to say no when a party of Indians approached and asked, in no uncertain terms, for a cow. 
 Nearly as bad, it seems, was the buffalo gnat, which one traveler called ''the most detestable thing in creation.'' Small but vicious, it struck without warning, and ''before you are conscious of its presence, has bitten your face, ears and neck in 10,000 places. My face at one time had the appearance of one with small pox, my eyes were swollen up so much that I could hardly see, and my ears as thick as my hand.'' Those who escaped disease, hunger and frostbite sometimes did the job themselves. It was not uncommon for travelers to shoot themselves when unloading a wagon or for careless children to be crushed under wagon wheels. One boy suffered only a few cracked ribs when the wagon that rolled over him pushed him deep into the mud.
 The transcontinental railroad doomed the trail. A marked rise in Indian attacks in the 1860's cut down on traffic. With the driving of the golden spike, the trail, which had shaved six weeks off the journey by sea, became an anachronism and eventually part of American myth.
 ''Neither horses, mules nor oxen could compete with the iron horse in moving freight overland,'' an employee of the Overland Stage wrote some 40 years later. ''The continuous passing of freight wagons and stage and emigrant outfits ceased, and not one team could be seen where there were hundreds in the balmy days of overland transportation.'' Like Route 66 in our own time, the Oregon Train became the stuff of legend, a legend that deserves a more inspired retelling than its gets here.

HEADLINE: Retirees Return to the Grind, but This Time It's on Their Own Terms

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
When Marion Stickle retired in January, after 25 years at Procter & Gamble, she had had enough of the grind. ''I'd worked hard 50 hours a week, tried to raise a family, and was worn out,'' said Ms. Stickle, who had coordinated the artwork on the company's products. ''Something had to give.'' 
 But her skills, it turned out, were not easy to replace. Within a few months, Procter & Gamble wanted her to come back. Through a new program designed specifically for retired professionals, Ms. Stickle returned to the company on a part-time assignment that lasted five months -- exactly the situation that many older workers or retirees say they want, but that companies face formidable hurdles to offer. 
 ''It feels different,'' Ms. Stickle, 55, said of her return. ''I have enjoyed the work. I'm enjoying the more relaxed pace of my life right now.'' 
 To do so, she had to get around decades of government and corporate policies that have made it difficult for older workers or retirees to remain on the job part time. ''When the baby boom was coming in, the goal was to drive older workers out of the work force because you had younger ones coming in at a lower price,'' said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ''We're entering a period where there won't be as many young workers. So now companies have to reverse those policies to keep older workers in.''
 Ms. Stickle works for YourEncore, a company that executives at Procter & Gamble and Eli Lilly started last October to address a demographic change facing all industries: as the nation's 76 million baby boomers head toward retirement age, the generations behind them lack the numbers and sometimes the skills to replace them.
 ''It really is a serious problem,'' said Rudolph Penner, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. ''It's not my impression that the top executives at many companies are worried about this. But the human resource departments can see it coming.'' 
 While some other companies are rewriting their retirement policies to keep older workers from retiring, Eli Lilly and Procter & Gamble identified a different talent pool: retired professionals who wanted to return to work on a limited basis. 
 In surveys, older workers say they would like to scale back their hours, in ''phased retirement,'' rather than leave altogether. Some need the money; others want the challenges or camaraderie. 
 But current tax laws, protections against age discrimination and corporate pension policies all make phased retirement difficult for workers and companies, Mr. Penner said.
 Many older workers with traditional pension plans would be hurt financially if they reduced their hours because their pensions are based on their earnings in their last working years. If they want to work part time, Mr. Penner said, they have to leave the company. Also, each year they put off retiring means one fewer year of collecting their pension. And new retirees cannot return immediately to their old companies without risking tax penalties for both the employer and the retiree. 
 In November, officials at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service addressed one obstacle to phased retirement, proposing changes to allow workers older than 591/2 to work part time and collect part of their pensions. ''That solves part of the problem, but there's still a lot more to be done,'' Mr. Penner said. ''This is still a back-burner issue'' for both lawmakers and corporate executives.
 Mr. Penner added that many companies also fear that if they tailor part-time programs for older workers, they might be sued for age discrimination. On all of these fronts, he said, the laws ''have not been fleshed out,'' so many employers and workers shy away from phased retirement even where it is feasible. 
 At Procter & Gamble and Eli Lilly, executives identified a looming shortage of scientific talent, said Alph Bingham, a vice president at Eli Lilly who develops alternative business models for the company. 
 As their older scientists retired, there were not enough American or foreign students entering university science programs to replace them. In response, the two companies created YourEncore, an independently owned company that supplies retired scientists or technology workers to Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly and any other companies that join the network. Employees work for YourEncore, at rates based on their final salaries before retirement. Companies pay an initial fee of $50,000, plus a fee for each placement.
 So far, Boeing and National Starch and Chemical have joined YourEncore. Since the program started, about 400 retirees (called ''members'') from 150 companies have worked on projects lasting from one day to several months. 
 Timothy Balm, who designed research trials for new products at Procter & Gamble, retired at 52 after his wife was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. He had enjoyed his work, he said, but he did not want to spend his wife's final years or months at the office. After her death in June, he signed up with YourEncore and returned to work part time at home. He likes being productive again, he said, but without the pressures that had taken the fun out of work in his last years.
 ''After 31 years of orienting my life toward productivity and problem-solving, it was very difficult to walk away from that cold turkey,'' Mr. Balm said. ''This is like Nicorette.'' Because retirees work for YourEncore rather than the member companies, the program resolves some of the obstacles to phased retirement. ''I really think this is the wave of the future,'' said Diane Piktialis, a senior product manager at Ceridian, which advises companies on personnel. 
 ''Companies are realizing that they have to change their entire mindset about retirement.'' 
 When asked why more companies did not offer similar programs, she said many employers still held low opinions of older workers. 
 ''I'll tell you why every company doesn't do this,'' she said. ''The reality is that it's an ageist society, and up until a couple years ago, older workers were subject to negative stereotypes. Companies bent over backwards to get rid of them. Yet we've found from research that the stereotyping is unfounded. Older workers can learn new technologies, and are less absent than younger workers.'' 
 Anna Rappaport, who led a recent AARP study of how companies treat older workers, said that many employers, especially hospitals, were now working informally toward comparable programs. 
 Barbara Sailer, 62, retired from Procter & Gamble in 2001 to start a marketing business. At the time, she had no interest in slowing down. But the economy faltered, and the business never took off. So she took an assignment with YourEncore, returning to Procter & Gamble part time. She works from home and takes time off for mission trips to build houses in the developing world. 
 In her new role, she said, she does not have the stress of office politics or of constantly jockeying for promotions. ''They didn't have to train me, and they don't have to worry about me giving away trade secrets,'' Ms. Sailer said. ''They gained tremendously, and I do as well.'' 
 When her assignment ends next June, she said, she hopes to find one elsewhere. ''When you retire, you don't necessarily keep up the old relationships,'' Ms. Sailer said. ''It's great to be back in an environment that has expectations and personal contact.''

HEADLINE: Bush Gives Praise and Caution at Marine Base

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Elizabeth Becker contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: CAMP PENDLETON, Calif., Dec. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush made an emotional visit on Tuesday to the Marine base that has been home to nearly a sixth of all the American troops killed in Iraq. Yet even as he praised the role of American forces that retook Falluja last month, Mr. Bush spoke cautiously about the ability of Iraqi forces to defend themselves.
 Mr. Bush flew across the country Tuesday morning for the sole purpose of making the visit here, spending more than two hours in a closed session with about 50 families of marines who had been killed or wounded, and then returning to Washington. 
 ''The enemies of freedom in Iraq have been wounded, but they're not yet defeated,'' he said at an athletic field here, describing how troops from the First Marine Expeditionary Force had gone ''block by block, building by building'' in taking Falluja back from insurgents. ''We found blood-stained torture chambers where hostages had been executed. We found videos of beheadings and brutal terrorist attacks.''
 It was Mr. Bush's first visit with troops here since he flew onto the deck of the aircraft carrier Lincoln as it returned to San Diego 18 months ago, when he declared the end of active combat in Iraq under a sign reading ''Mission Accomplished.'' White House officials now concede that they learned a hard lesson about the price of raising expectations about quick military victories.
 That was evident in the changed tone on Tuesday, on a base that has had funerals and memorial services for many of the 269 marines based here who have been killed, and where families are struggling to deal with long deployments and the huge toll of debilitating wounds. So on the athletic field -- which was devoid of any signs proclaiming success or hinting at an end to the American military presence in Iraq -- Mr. Bush made clear that the marines here should expect plenty of combat ahead. 
 He predicted a rise in attacks between now and the Iraqi elections set for Jan. 30, while arguing that those elections will change the nature of how Iraqis perceive the American presence. ''When Iraqis choose their leaders in free elections,'' he said, ''it will destroy the myth that the terrorists are fighting a foreign occupation and make clear that what the terrorists are really fighting is the will of the Iraqi people.''
 Mr. Bush's comments, however, were somewhat guarded about Iraqi forces. ''Some Iraqi units have performed better than others, as you know,'' he said. ''Some Iraqis have been intimidated enough by the insurgents to leave the service to their country. But a great many are standing firm.'' He went on to quote a soldier who described an Iraqi who had ''really excelled, kicking in the doors, clearing the houses, running out into fire to pick up wounded marines.''
 Mr. Bush did not mention how many Iraqis are trained and ready. On Sept. 23, appearing in the Rose Garden with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi of Iraq, he spoke of ''nearly 100,000 fully trained and equipped Iraqi soldiers, police officers, and other security personnel'' who are now at work, and said ''that total will rise to 125,000 by the end of the year.''
 According to the latest weekly update from the State Department, as of Nov. 22 there were 114,338 Iraqis trained to some extent and available in the nation's security forces, up from 98,708 at the end of September. The goal is to train 272,000.
 The White House cast the visit to Camp Pendleton as part of the president's effort to thank soldiers and families separated during the holidays. But administration officials also say they have been increasingly aware of the complaints surrounding long deployments, and of the emotional and economic toll of action in Iraq that has now gone on for two years, including the buildup of forces in the Middle East in the months before the invasion in March 2003. 
 Mr. Bush talked about his recent periodic visits to the wounded -- he plans another Saturday, at a military hospital in Bethesda, Md. -- and told families here: ''Words can only go so far in capturing the grief and sense of loss for the families of those who have died. But you can know this: They gave their lives for a cause that is just.'' He cited the inauguration on Tuesday of Hamid Karzai as president of Afghanistan as a symbol of American accomplishments. 
 Mr. Bush spoke of groups that have begun to aid families here, including the work of a Camp Pendleton nurse, Karen Gunther, who with other Marine families started the Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund to raise cash for families that were struggling as marines tried to recover from their wounds. He said it had made grants of more than $400,000 in six months. He urged Americans to go to the Web site www.AmericaSupportsYou.mil to offer support and donations.
 During his visit, Mr. Bush wore a specially tailored Marine tanker jacket, the all-purpose, all-weather jacket for officers and enlisted men, said Maj. Jason Johnston, a Marine spokesman. Mr. Bush's jacket had custom touches like his name and designation as commander in chief embroidered across the front.
