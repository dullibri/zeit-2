HEADLINE: Refuge Inside Arctic Circle Is Also in the Middle of U.S. Energy Debate

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: KAKTOVIK, Alaska, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Roughly 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle, hard by the icy Beaufort Sea, this tiny Eskimo village is unlikely to be a stop on the presidential campaign trail.
Getting here entails a bumpy flight across the Brooks Range, and arrival is marked by a cheerful greeting from Kaktovik's mayor, Lon Sonsalla, who gestures across the gravel airstrip to the magnificent but fearsome animals lumbering nearby on the tundra: "Watch out for the polar bears." 
 Yet as the candidates spar over what to do about rising fuel prices, the people who live here in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge find the future of their homeland to be a major campaign issue, one that popped up in the first presidential debate. For while they are living in one of the great untouched wilderness areas of the world, they are also atop what may be the largest untapped oil reserve in the United States.
The dispute over this refuge could not be more clear. Drill it, says Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Leave it alone, says Vice President Al Gore.
The same line divides the oil industry and environmental advocates. And it divides two native groups who have lived here for centuries, generating perhaps the most bitter tensions of all, since the stakes involve their very way of life.
The Inupiat Eskimos of Kaktovik generally favor plans to drill along the 1.5 million acres of coastal plain for oil, which they think will bring them enormous economic benefits, including improvements in schools and health care. So they endorse the arguments of drilling proponents, including Alaska's top politicians, who say it is lunacy not to explore the tundra for the billions of barrels of oil that may lie beneath.
"Moola," Fenton Rexford, president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, the business arm of the Eskimos, said with a hearty smile.
But the Gwich'in Indians, citing fears that rigs, roads and pipes will mar the land and devastate the caribou herd on which they rely for food, are viscerally opposed. They are allied with environmental groups, who say drilling is a short-term energy fix that will permanently scar this austere but beautiful landscape. It lies frozen for much of the year but bursts to life in the Arctic spring with such a display of birds and wild animals, including tens of thousands of migrating caribou, that some call it an American Serengeti.
"There's no technology in the world that will make it safe for mothers and their calves," said Sarah James, an elder in Arctic Village, a Gwich'in community of about 120 people.
The two groups live on opposite sides of the 9,000-foot-high Brooks Range and have become so alienated on the issue that they barely speak to each other.
And members of both groups say they have been paying much more attention than they otherwise might to this presidential campaign. They have satellite dishes and a string of cable television lines set up in Kaktovik, a complex of small wooden and corrugated-steel homes and other buildings that hugs the shore of an ice floe-laden sea.
"Oh, boy, another month of this," said 78-year-old Isaac Akootchook, a whaling captain and village elder, rolling his eyes when yet another news clip showing Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush popped up on the screen. Yet they are keenly aware of what the candidates are saying, at least about the Arctic refuge.
Governor Bush, echoing a plan that his father, then President George Bush, unsuccessfully sought in Congress, strongly favors opening the refuge to exploration and drilling.
While no one knows for sure how much oil is below the permafrost, Mr. Bush, citing oil experts, says that the fields could produce a million barrels a day -- roughly the same amount, as he put it in the debate, as the country imports daily from Saddam Hussein, with whom his father went to war over protecting Middle East oil supplies.
Mr. Bush was speaking in rough terms, since the average this year for oil imported from Iraq is 585,000 barrels a day, says the Energy Department.
Mr. Gore is just as staunchly opposed to opening what he calls "this environmental treasure" to drilling, arguing the country needs to focus on conservation and other ways of decreasing demand.
"It would only give us a few months worth of oil, and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future," he said in the debate. "That's the wrong choice. I know the oil companies have been itching to do that. But it is not the right thing for the future."
The government's geological estimate of likely reserves ranges from about 3 billion to 16 billion barrels, and each side dramatizes what the figures mean in very different ways.
Opponents like Mr. Gore, using the lower figure, often say it contains "only 6 months" of the nation's demand for oil; supporters, citing the higher figure, say it could be enough to represent 30 years' worth of what the country imports from Middle Eastern countries like Iraq.
Here in Alaska, the issue is huge, for obvious reasons: oil, mostly from the Prudhoe Bay fields 100 miles or so to the west, is Alaska's economic engine. It not only pays for roughly three-quarters of the state budget and keeps residents here from paying state income taxes, it is also responsible for the annual "dividend" that every man, woman and child in the state receives simply for living here.
The money -- $1,963.86, in checks that are being mailed this month -- comes from the state's so-called Permanent Fund. But despite that optimistic name, oil is coursing down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline at half the peak rate in the late 1980's of two million barrels a day, says the State Division of Oil and Gas. For many Alaskans, extending drilling to the Arctic refuge may be a way to extend their oil-fueled financial bonanza another decade or two.
There is general support in the state for opening the refuge -- the Legislature once voted 59 to 1 in favor of a resolution urging that course.
For the Inupiat Eskimos who live in Kaktovik, population 260, and who own more of the land where the drilling would take place, the benefits are clear.
"Energy, warmer houses, better transportation, better schools, more opportunities for the young people," said Mr. Rexford of the Inupiat business group. Many Eskimos say the Gwich'in are jealous, because they would get less in the way of oil revenues. And they resent outsiders debating what to do with their land.
"Who is Al Gore to say what to do here?" said Carla Sims Kayotuk, an Eskimo who runs the local store here. "He wants to keep this a rich man's playground."
But the Gwich'in, members of an Athabascan tribe who are the northernmost Indians in the United States, say money is not an issue. They want to preserve a sacred place, and the 129,000-strong Porcupine caribou herd.
And Gwich'in say the Eskimos, who depend on whaling for much of their protein, are inconsistent because they remain deeply opposed to proposals for offshore drilling for oil. Inupiat whaling crews here recently took three 30-ton bowhead whales from the Arctic Ocean, providing enough meat for everyone in the village for the coming year.
Drilling proponents pointed out that despite dire predictions, a smaller caribou herd nearer the Prudhoe Bay complex has actually grown since oil production started there.
"You fly into Deadhorse, and there are caribou all over the place," said Ken Boyd, director of the State Division of Oil and Gas, speaking of the oil town at Prudhoe Bay. "They're on the runway. These animals can adapt. This idea that they'll drop dead because they see oil production going on, it's just nuts."
And Roger Herrera, a geologist and consultant to Arctic Power, a lobbying group that favored opening the refuge, said the oil industry had "bent over backwards" to prevent harm to the caribou at Prudhoe Bay, and would do so here.
David R. Klein, professor emeritus at the University of Alaska's Institute of Arctic Biology, who has been studying Alaskan caribou for nearly 40 years, said any comparisons between what happened at Prudhoe Bay and what might happen here are treacherous, as this herd is larger and may share a smaller calving and foraging space with oil facilities.
"There will be impacts, that's obvious," he said. "The magnitudes of that impact are simply very difficult to project."
Mr. Sonsalla said he thought drilling would happen eventually.
"Change is inevitable," he said. "Hopefully we can control our own destiny."

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN YUGOSLAVIA: THE SANCTIONS;
Easing of Some Restrictions By West Could Happen Soon

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Disastrous civil wars, onerous sanctions and corrupt misrule turned Yugoslavia from the most open and developed nation in the old Communist orbit into the sick man of Central Europe, with a collapsed economy, plummeting living standards and a wretched inventory of bombed bridges, severed electrical lines and outdated factories.
But President Clinton and European leaders, who promised an immediate easing of sanctions once they feel certain that Slobodan Milosevic is gone from power, seem likely to remove most sanctions on trade and investment with Yugoslavia in the coming week. This will include lifting remaining restrictions of the sale of oil, which have in any case eroded badly. And it seems likely they will eliminate the ban on air travel, currently suspended, to and from Serbia. 
 The United States and 15 nations of the European Union are also preparing to restore the nation's rights at the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Some of the toughest sanctions will remain in force, at least for now, including a ban on transferring assets out of Yugoslavia and some penalties aimed at Mr. Milosevic and his close associates. State Department officials said that it was important to guard against the Milosevic-linked elite fleeing the country with looted wealth.
Western nations are also preparing to expand a multibillion dollar reconstruction plan for several Balkan countries to include Serbia, creating what some European officials have referred to as a mini-Marshall Plan for the war-torn region.
Oil, telecommunications, consumer products and infrastructure companies, some of which operated in Yugoslavia before sanctions began making investments difficult in the early 1990's, also seem likely to explore business opportunities there if the new democratic government proves stable.
But while General Electric, Foster Wheeler and Procter & Gamble among other companies had significant operations in the old Yugoslavia, several analysts and company officials said that it would take time to attract significant private investment to the largely state-controlled economy. It has fallen more than a decade behind many of its former Communist neighbors, which began economic overhauls after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
"The problem was Milosevic, Milosevic, Milosevic, now it's economy, economy, economy," said Milan Panic, a Serbian-American who runs California-based ICN Pharmaceuticals, which once owned one of the largest private companies in Serbia. "This will be a major test for the United States and Europe."
Mr. Panic's pharmaceutical plant in Belgrade was confiscated by the Milosevic government in a bitter political battle after Mr. Panic contested -- and lost -- a race for president against Mr. Milosevic in 1992. He now plans to return to Serbia. But he says reconstruction will be slow.
"It is still a socialist country and you will have to change the culture," he said in an interview. "It will need aid money -- seed money -- before you will see much private investment."
Clinton administration officials said that NATO-led intervention in Kosovo and the campaign to oust Mr. Milosevic will ultimately remain incomplete unless they help reverse the free fall of Yugoslavia's economy, which contracted by 20 percent last year, with 50 percent inflation and 30 percent unemployment.
"Now is not the time for the United States or our allies to retreat from the Balkans in complacency," Mr. Clinton said Friday. "Now is the time to stay the course and stick with people who have won their freedom; the time to build the economic and civil institutions that will allow democracy to endure."
A senior State Department official said Western powers are aiming to channel money and expertise into repairing roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, and to deliver aid quickly.
"We want to fund projects that will have an immediate impact on people's lives," the official said.
After NATO forced Mr. Milosevic to retreat from Kosovo last year, the United States and the European Union began a joint effort known as the Stability Pact to support democracy and spark economic growth in the Balkans. The European Commission and the World Bank administer the pact. But the United States plays a significant role and sees it as the main vehicle for extending a helping hand to Serbia, the senior State Department official said.
Participants in the pact, especially the World Bank and European nations, have already made pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars to finance projects like a wastewater treatment plant in Croatia, a new airport terminal in Albania and road improvements in Kosovo.
The Clinton administration recently introduced a bill in Congress that would grant zero-tariff trade status to democratic Balkan nations. And the United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation has set aside $150 million to back companies willing to invest in the Balkans.
Serbia could use the help. A group of private Yugoslav economists recently estimated that NATO allies inflicted about $4 billion dollars of damage on Serbia during the Kosovo war, while they put the cumulative financial impact of sanctions at $30 billion.
But several Clinton administration officials said that Europe and the private sector would have to take the lead, citing the reluctance of Congress to fund major international aid programs.
Theoretically, Serbia should be an attractive market. It has 11 million consumers, slightly more than neighboring Hungary. The Danube, one of Europe's major rivers, runs through it. It is the overland bridge between Western Europe and Greece and Turkey.
Early investors could include Ericsson, the Swedish telecom company, which has ambitions to resume work on a $210 million mobile phone network. The engineering company, Foster Wheeler, of Clinton, N.J., built oil facilities in Yugoslavia before the Kosovo war and has expressed interest in helping rebuild the nation's largest oil refinery, damaged by NATO bombs.
But Gary Litman, managing director for Europe and Eurasia at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said that while many multinationals had expressed interest in Balkan investments, the market could prove unattractive in the short term.
"There's been almost 10 years with no development there," he said. "There's a big question mark about whether this curiosity will translate into real investments."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Lazio Portrayed as an Ostrich

 BODY:

Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign will begin broadcasting this 30-second commercial in upstate New York tomorrow.
 
TITLE -- "Ostrich" 

PRODUCER -- Team Hillary
 
ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of an ostrich, meant to represent Representative Rick A. Lazio, standing alone in a desert. With what sounds like a children's song playing, the camera remains on the bird as the narrator speaks about the struggling upstate New York economy. Finally, the ostrich sticks its head into a hole in the sand. Before the close, Mrs. Clinton is shown in two quick scenes, walking with people and then moving down a line, shaking hands.

THE SCRIPT -- "Over the last five years, upstate New York has ranked near the bottom of the nation in job growth. And since 1992, 170,000 young people have left. But Rick Lazio doesn't think the area needs targeted economic help. Guess it's hard to find a solution when you can't see the problem. Hillary Clinton. A strong voice for New York families with a detailed plan to create new jobs in upstate New York."
 
ACCURACY -- The economy in upstate New York grew much more slowly than in the rest of the nation from 1995 to 1998, but it has improved in the last two years, although growth remains slower than in the New York City area. Mrs. Clinton has advocated tax credits for small businesses that locate in communities with low job growth or high poverty, among other initiatives. Mr. Lazio has said he will help the upstate economy by pushing for its "fair share" of federal aid and a broad-based tax cut.

SCORECARD -- Mrs. Clinton pokes fun at her opponent in an area where he is clearly vulnerable. During their first debate, Mr. Lazio said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was trying to portray upstate New York as a "vast economic wasteland" when in fact the economy there "has turned the corner." The Buffalo News, in an editorial, has mocked Mr. Lazio's remarks and criticized him for not advocating targeted economic help for the region. The advertisement, which injects a touch of humor in what otherwise has been a largely humorless campaign, could help Mrs. Clinton win votes upstate, a region where Republicans traditionally do well but where polls suggest that Mr. Lazio is lagging.

Europe to America: Ante Up

BYLINE: By Barbara Crossette

 BODY:
The Europeans brought their pie-charts (the French call them camemberts) to the United Nations to demonstrate how much the European Union gave to the organization's various budgets compared with the richer United States, and why Washington did not deserve the cut in dues demanded by Congress. European and American shares of the world's total gross national product, on which basic national dues are assessed, are about the same: 29 percent.
But the Europeans pay 36.7 percent of the United Nations' regular budget of $1 billion a year, compared with the Americans' 25 percent (when Washington pays at all). Congress wants that lowered to 22 percent, or it will withhold even more payments. In peacekeeping, the gap is wider: 39 percent for Europe, 25 percent for the United States. 
 Europe pays half the costs of special programs and agencies, more than twice what the United States contributes.

HEADLINE: 2000 PLAYOFFS: NOTEBOOK;
Do Athletics Know The Way to San Jose?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
A Bay Area World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics would be a tame preliminary to a turf battle between the owners of the two teams. That battle may never develop, but it simmers close to the surface.
The object of the potential scrap: San Jose. The Giants have it; the Athletics want it. 
 "Obviously there has been a three-decade debate on the relationship of the Giants and the A's in the Bay Area, and baseball frankly has attempted to solve it in many different ways over the years," Commissioner Bud Selig said. "It's something I'm monitoring extremely closely and I continue to talk to both clubs."
The Giants' wildly successful new home, Pacific Bell Park, has only exacerbated the tension between the teams, making the team 12 miles away on the other side of the water feel even more like the Bay Area's stepchild.
The Oakland owners, Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann, are said by some people in baseball to want either to move the team to San Jose or neighboring Santa Clara, or, perhaps preferably, receive permission to sell to someone who would move the team to San Jose or Santa Clara.
Calls to the owners seeking clarification of their position were not returned; Jim Young, a club spokesman, said the owners "don't make themselves available to the press."
Michael Crowley, the club president, said he wasn't sure "what the owners have done at this point."
But he added, "There's no question that the economic engine of the Bay Area, if not the world, is the Silicon Valley."
Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing partner, left no doubt about his position. San Jose and Santa Clara are in Santa Clara County, he noted and explained that Santa Clara County is an integral part of the established Giants territory.
"When Schott and Hofmann bought the A's franchise, they knew what territorial rights the A's had and what territorial rights the Giants had," Magowan said. "Santa Clara County is in the Giants' territorial rights so they can't really go there if we object. If they want to violate our territory, there will be a battle."
The Major League Constitution delineates each team's operating territory. In the case of other two-team areas -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles/Anaheim -- the territories listed for each team are the same, with the provision that they "shall be shared" with the other team.
However, the same formula does not apply with the Giants and the Athletics. The Athletics have Alameda and Contra Costa counties, both on their side of the bay. The Giants have San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey and Marin, a string of counties that occupy the coast line north and south of San Francisco. "We have been assured by Bud Selig that he will be supportive of every franchise's territorial rights," Magowan said.
Any change in the existing understanding would require a three-quarters vote among the 30 major league clubs.
"If the Athletics want to go right across the street from Yankee Stadium, they could do it if they could persuade three-quarters of the clubs to go along with that," Magowan said. "But I think all the clubs know if they vote to violate this guy's territorial rights, then the precedent has been set for the violation of their territorial rights so I don't expect that to be a very successful initiative."
The Athletics' owners bought the team five years ago and tried to sell it last year, but the league owners tabled the proposed $122 million deal, effectively killing the sale. The general feeling among the owners of other teams was that the prospective purchasing group did not have pockets deep enough to operate the team and would most likely be looking to sell it themselves in a few years.
Schott and Hofmann have not attempted to sell the team since, but they have been reported to have spoken with officials and others in the potentially lucrative San Jose/Santa Clara area. In fact, one official said Selig told club officials to cease and desist after newspaper articles began appearing about their talks.
Santa Clara County, 40 miles south of San Francisco, is in the heart of Silicon Valley, where a team would most likely prosper far more than some existing teams.
"This is a privately built ballpark," Magowan said of the Giants' pride and joy. "We paid for this ourselves. The people who helped build this are our fans and the heart of our fan base is in San Mateo County and Santa Clara County, so all of the people who bought charter seats and bought sponsorships and bought suites, their loyalty to the Giants would be adrift if there were a competing stadium in San Jose."
Just last week city officials in Oakland came up with a site for a new ballpark in their town that they speculate could be as beneficial financially to the Athletics as Pacific Bell Park is to the Giants. But given the experience across the bay, the team's owners would certainly be expected to finance a significant portion of the construction, and they have shown no inclination to take that economic step.
The Giants drew 3,315,330 fans this season, the Athletics 1,728,888.
"From the team's perspective, what's happening with our attendance right now is certainly a concern," Crowley said. "We've said from the start we're going to make an attempt to make it work in Oakland."
How long will they make the attempt? "That remains to be seen," the executive said.
While the Athletics struggle, the Giants have increased their revenue to about $145 million from $68 million last year. They will show a profit of about $7 million. They made their $20 million mortgage payment for this year in one line item on the business ledger: Last season they sold $3 million in stadium sponsorships, this year $23 million.
While Giants officials express confidence that baseball will maintain the status quo in the Bay Area, they will exhale only when Selig issues a final decision on the matter. He is not expected to do that for some time.
"I don't think Bud Selig wants to do anything that would help a relocated franchise be successful if their success comes at the expense of making an already successful franchise into a nonsuccessful one," Magowan said. "That's what he has to really think about.
"I'm not saying San Jose isn't a lot better market than Oakland. I know it is. Anybody would know it is. It's a bigger market. It's faster growing. There's more money down there. There's more corporate support down there. Nobody argues with that. The question is would it hurt the Giants. The answer to that is yes, it would. The conclusion is, therefore, I think, by Bud Selig, it should not be done."
Asked what the Athletics thought the commissioner's position should be, Crowley said: "I think Bud has to act in what he feels is the best interests of baseball. That's his charter."
 
Apathy in Montreal
The franchise most urgently in need of relocation is the Montreal Expos. With an attendance of 926,263, they were the only team that didn't attract one million fans. People in Montreal once cared about the team, but at this point if the Expos left, would anyone miss them?
The question is if Jeffrey Loria, the managing partner, wanted to move the team to northern Virginia, could he do it? Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, has said he will do whatever was necessary to block a team from moving into the Washington-northern Virginia area, but that area is not part of the Orioles' territory.
Their territory is listed as the city of Baltimore and five counties in Maryland, nothing outside the state.
 
Going Against the Norm
One of the major pieces of statistical evidence presented by the Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics in dealing with payroll disparity was that from 1995 through 1999, no team with a payroll in the third and fourth quartiles won a playoff game.
Oakland has ruined that perfect record, winning two games of their playoff series against the Yankees. However, the Athletics' victories have been the only ones registered by a team in payroll quartiles III and IV. They have also lost two games to the Yankees , and the Chicago White Sox lost all three of their games with Seattle. Four of the playoff teams are in the first quartile and two are in the second.
 
So Much for Milestones
So Todd Helton did not hit .400, Darin Erstad did not break the record for hits in a season, Jose Lima did not give up the most home runs ever by a pitcher, no batter hit 60 home runs for the first time in three years, the season went without a no-hitter for the first time since 1989 and no team changed managers during the season for the first time since 1942. Of course, a week after the season, five teams have fired their managers.
And for the first time in history, no team finished with a won-lost percentage as high as .600 or as low as .400. One more victory by the Giants or another loss for Philadelphia or the Chicago Cubs would have prevented history from being made.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: GENDER POLITICS;
Among Men, It's Bush the Maserati by a Mile

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7

 BODY:
When Gov. Gray Davis's political advisers want to take Californians' temperatures on the presidential race in voter focus groups, they ask a question that might sound goofy: if Al Gore and George W. Bush were cars, what would they be?
"Among men, Gore is viewed as a Ford Taurus, a Chevy station wagon, a Volvo, safe and kind of boxy," said Garry South, the chief political aide for Mr. Davis, a Democrat. "With Bush, you get things like Maserati and Mustang convertible, and by no means all of the men who say that are doing it pejoratively. They're saying: 'Wait a minute; that guy's like who I'd like to be.' " 
 Mr. Gore is running comfortably ahead in the polls in California, in part because it is one of the few places where he is holding his own or slightly ahead among men, who tend here to be more liberal than their counterparts in the South and Midwest. But even here, Mr. Gore runs behind Mr. Bush among white men and married men, and the car quiz sums up what may be one of his biggest challenges as the presidential race moves into its final month: how to get guys who may not be like him to like him all the same.
Since at least 1980, when polls first showed men and women sharply diverging in their presidential preferences, with women leaning Democratic and men Republican, politicians have sought to exploit the gender gap, typically by making special efforts to court the votes of women, who are the greatest share of the electorate and tend to look to government as a supportive partner in challenges from child care to health care and the environment.
So this year, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have gone out of their way to demonstrate their sensitive New Age guyness by gushing with Oprah Winfrey and praising their wives' uplifting influences. In their debate on Tuesday, Mr. Bush, who like most Republicans does worse with women than his Democratic opponent, went so far as to brag about crying with Texas flood victims. "That's what governors do," he said.
Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant here, said, "Neither one of these guys is trying to project himself as John Wayne."
But men, especially white men, remain a potent political force, perhaps even more complicated to court. And among this group, Mr. Gore is struggling, trailing Mr. Bush among men over all by 22 points in one recent Los Angeles Times national poll and by smaller but still significant margins in most other surveys. At the same time, Mr. Gore has not been doing well enough among women, especially married women, to be certain he will be able to offset his deficit among men.
Part of the problem is axiomatic and beyond Mr. Gore's control: men are more likely to be what the Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick calls "congenital Republicans."
"If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, the way to a man's vote is still through his wallet, and men do still see the Republican Party as being more protective of their assets," Ms. Fitzpatrick said. "Even in 1996, with what was sometimes a very inarticulate and uninspired defense of his own tax plan, Bob Dole was still able to secure an advantage among men. It's their default position."
Mr. Gore has made his share of efforts to appeal to men. He promotes himself as the repository of fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction. His biographical advertisements are careful to note his Army service in Vietnam. Even his celebrated kiss of his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic convention, pollsters say, could be seen as much as a gesture of solidarity with his fellow family men as an appeal to women.
But political professionals in both parties say Mr. Gore also faces particular problems growing out of his earnest, wonkish personality, and his tendency to lecture. "One of the things that I think is happening is that Bush has been able to convey and project a personality type that I think appeals to men," Mr. South said, "a kind of free-wheeling, macho guy, more compatible with where the typical white, middle-aged male voter would be than Gore has."
Mr. Bush may be helped in this regard by his running mate, Dick Cheney, a former high school football captain who made appearances at two athletic events this weekend. On Friday night Mr. Cheney went to a high school football game in Waterloo, Iowa. This afternoon he went to a tailgate party at the Iowa State-Nebraska football game in Ames, Iowa, shaking hands with chilly football fans huddled around beer kegs.
Oddly, Ms. Fitzpatrick suggested, Mr. Gore may suffer by comparison not with Republicans but with Mr. Clinton, who as a candidate and president appeared often in pop culture forums that helped transform many voters' relationship with the president and presidency from a paternal one to more of a peer-to-peer regard.
"Before it was always, 'Can he stare down the Soviet Union?' " Ms. Fitzpatrick said. "Now it's, 'Is he like me and do I like him?' And with Al Gore the answer to both is no. Clinton is always looked at as having an outstretched hand, and Gore as having a pointing finger."
Joel Cook, 32, a milk truck driver in Los Banos, Calif., a swing area in the Central Valley, said it did not matter to him that Mr. Gore was a veteran like himself. He said he thought Mr. Bush would do a better job of building up the military.
"I don't like the way Gore talks," said Mr. Cook, who usually votes Republican. "I feel like he's trying to put one over on me, and tell me something just for a vote."
Robert DeSouza, 60, a disabled former appliance repairman in Sacramento, still calls himself a Democrat but says he has voted Republican since Richard M. Nixon's election in 1968. He is not a big fan of Mr. Bush but says Mr. Gore could not persuade him to vote Democratic.
"All the big promises he's making, he knows he can't do it," Mr. DeSouza said. "The Democrats had their chance to do all this stuff the first two years of Bill Clinton's administration when they controlled Congress, and they still couldn't do it."
In fact, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken late last month, Mr. Gore is doing about the same among men as Mr. Clinton did in 1992 and 1996, drawing the support of about 4 in 10 male voters, though other polls have shown him faring worse.
But Mr. Gore is so far not doing as well among women as Mr. Clinton did, drawing the support of just 47 percent of likely female voters in the most recent Times/CBS News poll. When Mr. Clinton was elected in 1996, he won the support of 54 percent of women, surveys of voters leaving the polls found.
Moreover, before Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern and his subsequent impeachment took its toll, the president had managed to make strong inroads of support among the kinds of blue-collar families that the Democrats had been ceding for years. These are among the voters Mr. Gore is trying to reclaim with his oratorical emphasis on "working families."
But here, too, Mr. Gore faces problems caused in part by Mr. Clinton's alienation of these voters, and in part by Mr. Gore's having spent much of the winter running to the left to stave off a primary challenge from Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. At the same time, he may suffer in stylistic comparisons with Mr. Clinton, who is a past master at creating connections with his audience, whatever it happens to be.
"If he was asked about gay marriage, for example, the typical Clinton response lays out right away, 'I do not favor gay marriage,' " said one Democratic strategist here who has complained to Mr. Gore about this point. "And then he segues into a sympathetic-sounding response about how we have to uphold everybody's differences and dreams. Gore's tendency is to give the long, sympathetic answer, and then, as an afterthought, add, 'Having said that, I do not favor gay marriage.' "
This strategist added that there are few people "as masterful as Bill Clinton at defining himself in a way that keeps those white male voters in the pen without alienating those female voters that really give you your edge as a Democrat."
Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide nonpartisan Field Poll in San Francisco, said that younger men, in particular, should be a natural demographic target for Mr. Gore, but that Mr. Bush had shown strong appeal among this group.
"The issues that Bush is raising have a certain appeal for young men, like Social Security, where he says I'll give you the right to invest some of your own funds," Mr. DiCamillo said. "When you poll the attitudes of the young, they basically have much less trust in government to be there when they need it, and the farther you are away from retirement age, the more likely you are to be skeptical about whether the government will deliver. I also think the entrepreneurial spirit, the kind that drives the booming California economy right now, that spirit is more reflected by Bush in his economic proposals. The key question to me nationally is, will these young people go out and vote?"

HEADLINE: Fairness of New York Condemnation Procedures at Issue in Property Owners' Lawsuit

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 6

 BODY:
Bill Brody says he would have challenged this village's condemnation of the four downtown buildings that he owned and had just renovated into office and retail space, and that Port Chester officials plan to turn over to a developer for a Stop & Shop supermarket.
But he never got to fight that fight. 
 For all the steps Mr. Brody took in his effort to follow every turn in Port Chester's 27-acre downtown renewal plan, he missed a classified legal notice in a local newspaper last year saying the property was eligible for condemnation. He did not learn about the notice until 10 months later, too late to contest the decision.
Mr. Brody is one of three property owners in the New York area who are challenging the constitutionality of the state's eminent-domain procedures in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The other two plaintiffs are the owner of a cabinetmaking business in Harlem and a church in North Hempstead, on Long Island.
A ruling in the plaintiffs' favor could change the way the state and local governments acquire millions of dollars' worth of property every year for a range of projects, including new sidewalks and sports stadiums. The process has come under increasing scrutiny as more government agencies are acting as conduits for the transfer of property from one private owner to another.
Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Judge Harold Baer Jr. issued a temporary order barring the condemnations until he could hear the owners' motion for a preliminary injunction.
The New York law does require a public hearing, but only in the early stages of the lengthy process that can lead to the condemnation of a property. At that hearing, government officials must explain the potential cost and the public benefit of a proposed project, and members of the public may speak briefly. But the officials do not have to answer questions, or permit the property owner to call witnesses or present more than brief objections.
Nor does the law require a government agency or official to directly notify an owner when, sometime after the hearing, a property is identified as subject to condemnation in a legal notice. Such identification may come months or years before the government begins court proceedings to actually seize the property.
Once the notice appears, an owner has 30 days to appeal. The notice is not required to mention this time limit, or the right to appeal.
As a result, land-use lawyers say, owners often learn months or years after the 30-day period has expired that they are being displaced.
"New York's is the weirdest statute I've ever seen," said Dana Berliner, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm in Washington, which filed the complaint by Mr. Brody and the others.
Ms. Berliner said that in many states, the government's court petition for condemnation might be the first notice to a property owner. But almost all other states notify the owner of his right to appeal.
The cabinetmaking shop, on East 117th Street, is on the site of a retail center planned by the State Urban Development Corporation. The center would include a Home Depot and a Costco discount warehouse store.
Like Mr. Brody, the owners of the cabinetmaking shop, William J. Minnich and his nephew Bill Minnich, went to a public hearing, but were given only three minutes to speak.
According to the suit, no one explained that the hearing would result in a final decision. When the decision was announced in September 1999, the Minniches were notified by mail and told that they could appeal. But the suit says the notice made no reference to a time limit.
When the Minniches went to State Supreme Court in Manhattan to challenge the condemnation, their suit was dismissed because the time limit had expired.
A spokeswoman for the development agency, Maura Gallucci, said the agency could not comment on this week's lawsuit, but was "taking the proper steps in this process."
Ms. Gallucci said the agency's plans for the center had been widely known. "This project started out with a very public announcement by the governor and the mayor," she said.
Three years ago, the third plaintiff, St. Luke's Pentecostal Church of Westbury, a village in the town of North Hempstead, bought a building that had been scheduled for condemnation as part of an urban renewal plan. The church maintains that this fact was not publicly recorded and did not turn up in the title search.
"How were they supposed to know?" Ms. Berliner asked. "They went to the building department before they purchased their property and got a full go-ahead."
After spending $130,000 for the building and hundreds of thousands more on renovation and repairs, the suit says, the church was notified last November that it would receive $80,000 for its property from the North Hempstead Community Development Agency. The congregation, which now rents space in the basement of another building, is allowed by law to contest the amount, but not the condemnation.
A lawyer for the town, Martin N. Kroll, said the church had been advised that the building was in an urban renewal area.
In any event, he said, the church could not have successfully challenged the condemnation because the property was designated for subsidized housing, clearly recognized as a "public use." Under the law, a condemnation must serve a public purpose, and the owner must receive fair compensation.
Most courts have found that promoting development and creating jobs are public purposes, even if they require seizing property from one owner and turning it over to another.
But as local governments have grown bolder, some have lost. Last year, three property owners in Atlantic City won a ruling barring the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority's plan to buy them out so the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino could expand.
The New York suit argues that property owners have no opportunity to raise such claims.
"These procedural questions are not petty," said Norman Marcus, a Manhattan land-use lawyer and former general counsel to the New York City Planning Commission. In the case of the three New York owners, he said, "the procedures killed them."
Lawyers for Port Chester could not be reached by telephone for comment this afternoon.
Mr. Brody said he wanted to contest Port Chester's finding, made years ago, that the downtown area was "blighted," and to argue that a supermarket and parking lot would serve the public no better than the 10 businesses that are his tenants.
He also said he had many discussions with the planning and zoning department as he proceeded with renovations.
"If you're doing work in an urban development zone and somebody else wants to come in and they like that use better, that's it," he said. "Nobody told me that."

 BODY:

1. The sight of a large piece of furniture being hoisted through the window of a New York City apartment is no big deal. The sight of an oil tank being airlifted by crane into a loft, however, might raise a few eyebrows. This was definitely the case when the 7,200-gallon tank from an oil truck arrived at Josh Morton's building just over a year ago (a, b). Can't live without a tank of your own? Morton acquired the rehabilitated tank for a mere $3,500 from Garafano Tank Service in Paterson, N.J. That's about $50,000 less than the cost of a new truck. And there's no need to worry about fumes or trace petroleum: each three-ton tank is meticulously steam-cleaned by Peter Garafano and his crew.
 
2. If you think a tank is hard to move, imagine what it would be like to transport LOT/EK's next project: the fuselage of a 747 jumbo jet, which the firm intends to turn into a new student lounge for the University of Washington. It's understandable why the architects made the connection between the university and airplane parts: the Boeing Company was the cornerstone of Seattle's pre-Microsoft economy. Boeing worked with university engineers in the mid-1930's to create the Kirsten Wind Tunnel, shown here. The tunnel, part of the University of Washington Aeronautical Laboratory, simulates high-speed winds and played a crucial role in the development of commercial aircraft. 

3. Besides tractor-trailers, shipping containers, oil tanks, detergent bottles, refrigerators and municipal water tanks, LOT/EK's building materials include large quantities of industrial metal sinks. The firm recently installed two pivoting walls in the Chelsea offices of Edizioni Press, an Italian publisher, each consisting of some 20 sinks coated with a thick shell of car paint. Not only are the sinks visually arresting, but they function as storage cubbies, too.
 
4. Champions of enclosed personal spaces, the architects mounted an installation at Manhattan's Deitch Projects two years ago that consisted of tanks morphed into cozy, individual TV-viewing chambers. The group has developed its TV-tank concept for this year's Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. For $70,000, technophiles can treat themselves to the "Mixer," shown here, which is an actual cement mixer retrofitted with 12 monitors, a PlayStation 2-and-DVD player, Orgazmotron-caliber surround sound, surveillance cameras and a cushy electric-blue, rubberized-foam interior. Two people can comfortably close the hatches against the physical world in the seven-foot isolation capsule. For a copy of the Christmas Book, which costs $15, call (800) 634-6267.
 
5. The architects at LOT/EK were afraid that the resin they wanted to pour into the catwalk grating that surrounds Morton's sleeping area -- rendering it more "stiletto friendly" for female guests -- would break the project's $180,000 budget. No problem: Morton's father had connections, and he garnered cost-effective materials and labor to realize both the walkway and a LOT/EK-designed dining table. Poured and cast resin has also been well utilized by other artists and designers. They include the painters L.C. Armstrong and Fred Tomaselli and the sculptor Rachel Whiteread, whose luminous resin works (a) influenced the English furniture designer Simon Dance to make the table shown here (b). Inquiries can be sent to mail@simondance.com.
 
6. The loft's industrial-looking color palette was achieved using baked-on car paint (for the yellow interior tank sections) and poured epoxy (for the blue floor). LOT/EK suggests Benjamin Moore's Industrial Maintenance Coatings, which come in such colors as "Safety Yellow" and "Safety Blue," to approximate the look. A gallon costs $35.79 at Janovic/Plaza, 161 Sixth Avenue.
 
7. Morton's dog, Ski, may not venture onto the apartment's catwalk, but he is content to lounge downstairs and play with his superswanky toys. He prefers to get his rubber bones from the Blue Ribbon Dog Company, the ultrachic canine outfitter. They cost around $20 at Ad Hoc Softwares, 136 Wooster Street, Paul Smith, 108 Fifth Avenue, and the Terence Conran Shop, 407 East 59th Street.
 
8. Dog bones excepted, the loft is fairly devoid of ornamentation. The few artworks Morton does display are three sculptures by his mother, Judith Morton. She works in metal and in stone, and also in marble, as in "Contentment," pictured here. Her most recent show was at the Prudential Center in Boston. -- Sandra Ballentine

Jeffrey Bernett Studio B, New York
Jeffrey Bernett, opposite, 36, likes to get his hands dirty. "I used to race motorcycles as a kid," he says, "so I knew my way around a machine shop. That started my appreciation for design." And it has resulted in products as diverse as the luxurious Tulip chair for B&B Italia and the mass-market Daisy doormat for Authentics. Before becoming a designer, Bernett, who started Studio B in 1995, toyed with the idea of a career in finance. But after the Wall Street crash of 1987, he drifted west to Colorado to ski. Another crash -- Bernett broke his back on the slopes -- provoked another career crisis. He enrolled in a design workshop in Aspen, where one of his teachers was the director of Parnham College, a crafts-based furniture school in England. Bernett signed up at Parnham shortly after, but found his Modernist sympathies at odds with the school's traditional ethos. He left after a year, but not before designing an umbrella stand -- part of a collection that won the editors' award for decorative accessories at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 1996 -- that is now made by the Italian manufacturer Cappellini. Other European clients followed, including Ligne Roset, who makes the magazine rack shown in the foreground opposite. In a nod to his sporting roots, Bernett now wants to design athletic equipment. "I have a lot of knowledge of skiing in particular," he quips. 
 
Suzanne Tick Knoll Textiles, New York
"Most people in textiles don't know how to make a yarn," Suzanne Tick, right, says incredulously. A weaver by training, she's fascinated by fiber, thread and "the technical side of things."
Tick, 41, got her start while studying for her fine-arts degree at the University of Iowa. "Weaving was in the home-economics department," she says. "Eventually the art department let me have a loom."
Before joining Knoll Textiles, for which she is the creative director, Tick worked for the fabric manufacturer Boris Kroll, developed a collection of fabrics for the Groundworks division of Lee Jofa and formed her own carpet company, Tuva Looms. A 1998 show at the Museum of Modern Art showcased her experiments with Japanese steel yarn, which Tick had fashioned into shimmering curtains.
In June, Knoll Textiles introduced Imago, a line of translucent panels made from woven fibers encapsulated in clear resin. Developed by Tick and Ray Goodson, an entrepreneur and aerospace engineer, this material can be used for everything from screens and panels to wall coverings, table tops, shelving and even marker boards. As a divider, it admits light while also affording privacy.
Tick is currently playing with light in other ways. "I'm interested right now in objects like surfboards and scooters and how the light reflects off them," she says. Coming soon: a silk carpet for Tufenkian that she describes as "totally luminous, unlike anything you've ever seen."
"My philosophy," she says, "is that the world doesn't need another fabric or carpet unless there's something unique about it."
 
Jonathan Ive Apple, Cupertino, Calif.
Jonathan Ive, left, 33, loves simplicity. "I'm not talking about simplicity as style," he says. "I'm talking about a simpler product to assemble and use. That's what informed the Cube."
He's talking about the Power Mac G4 Cube, of course, the latest in a series of technological marvels from Apple, for which he is the vice president of industrial design. "There's too much visual clutter in our lives," he says. "We went in the opposite direction, utterly serene and utterly quiet."
That sums up Ive, who speaks in measured tones and is modest to the point of self-deprecation. The son of a British silversmith ("I never grew my craft skills to the level of my father's," he laments), he studied design at Newcastle Polytechnic. After graduating, he designed ceramic washtubs and basins for Ideal Standard and soon began consulting for Apple.
The challenge of designing a computer, he says, is that you can't fall back on centuries of examples for inspiration. "When you look at a wash basin, you know what it is," he observes. "But when you look at a circuit board, you don't understand it, and maybe even are frightened of it."
Intrigued by that challenge, Ive joined Apple in 1992, only to see the company lose its way in the wake of Steve Jobs's departure. "We kept doing provocative studies that gathered dust," he recalls. Then Jobs returned, and Ive found himself in charge of the iMac, the symbol of the company's resurgence.
"There is not a detail of the iMac that doesn't have a reason to be there," he says fondly. "It's all about removing the unnecessary."
 
Matali Crasset Paris
Matali Crasset, right, 35, is a master of reinvention, transforming the detritus of modern life into iconic objects. Born in a tiny village in Champagne, France, she attended Les Ateliers E.N.S.C.I. in Paris. While a student there, she cut her hair into her signature bob.
After graduation she landed a job with Philippe Starck, designing for Thomson Multimedia, a European manufacturer of consumer electronics. Her whimsical, curvaceous radios and televisions did away with what Crasset derisively terms the "black box" paradigm.
Two years ago, she struck out on her own. "Many designers make things for the world," she observes. "Instead, I started making things for my friends." Her guest bed, for example, is named "When Jim Goes to Paris."
It is Crasset's humblest design, however, that has garnered the most attention. Digestions, her new product line for the Italian furniture maker Edra, transforms the plaid plastic shopping bags found in immigrant neighborhoods in Paris into foam-filled sofas, chairs and tables.
A sense of playfulness pervades her work. "I don't like to make oppressive decorations," she says. "I designed the foam-filled bags to allow people to create their own space."
As Crasset sees it, she's less a designer than a collaborator. This fall she'll use that philosophy in helping wooden clog makers in rural France find new designs for their age-old skills. "I don't want to impose anything on them," Crasset says. "Designers need to work more on evolution and less on revolution."
 
Ayse Birsel Olive 1:1, New York
When Ayse (pronounced EYE-sha) Birsel, opposite, was a teenager, a great-uncle in her native Turkey told her, "Even though your husband and family will be there for you, you have to know how to take care of yourself."
Birsel, 36, took him at his word. She set up her own company in 1997, and, with her Resolve collection for Herman Miller, she is one of the rare women to have designed a line of office furniture for a major manufacturer. And it's a far cry from the sterile cubicles that fill most offices: everything about it echoes the natural world, from the petal-like canopies to the honeycomb-shaped work spaces. "That's the structure nature uses," Birsel explains.
It was her feminine perspective that catapulted Birsel to prominence five years ago with her design for the Zo Washlet, a combination toilet-bidet for the Japanese bathroom-fixture giant Toto. The Zo features a deodorizing fan and a heated, snap-on seat. "I wanted it to be easy to clean," she says. At first, Toto's all-male design and engineering staff dismissed the detachable-seat idea. Realizing that none of them had ever cleaned a toilet, Birsel made it their homework assignment. They returned chastened, and Birsel got her way.
Birsel has a host of new products in the works, including a version of Resolve for the dot-com set and a plastic sink inspired by the geometries of the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.
She is fond of saying that "design is kind of like bringing a child to life." At this rate, she'll have a bigger family than most.
 
Bodo Sperlein London
Bodo Sperlein, left, isn't pleased -- about the status of ceramics in the design world. "People don't give it the respect it deserves," he says. "It has a brown-rice, hippie reputation." Sperlein, 34, who prefers Burberry to Birkenstock, hopes to change all that.
Sperlein came late to design. Born in Germany, he spent most of his 20's working as a translator in London. When it came time to furnish his own flat, he couldn't afford high-quality dishes and so decided to make them himself, enrolling in a local pottery class. "I was the youngest one there," he recalls. "It was full of grannies."
Hooked, Sperlein went back for more, eventually getting his degree at London's Camberwell College of Arts. He soon landed a contract with Nymphenburg, one of Germany's oldest and most established porcelain houses. Sperlein's minimalist pieces are a radical departure from Nymphenburg's famously ornate china and figurines. Indeed, some of his designs are subtle to the point of ambiguity. A tapas plate doubles as an ashtray; a sake beaker works as a bud vase; an espresso cup becomes a toothbrush holder.
"Multifunctionality is very important to me," Sperlein notes.
Much of his recent work incorporates a composite of bone china and synthetic resin that enables Sperlein to create thin, translucent ceramic sheets like the ones found in his ethereal lighting fixtures. "I love it when materials are pushed to their limits," he says.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Highland Park, N.J.;
Small in Size but Large in Diversity

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
THE tiny 1.8-square-mile borough of Highland Park in Middlesex County, N.J., has been taking on a cosmopolitan flavor in recent years. Eating establishments such as Jerusalem Pizza and Kosher Chinese, which reflect the Jewish character of Raritan Avenue, the main business street, have been joined by Pad Thai, the Seven Hills of Istanbul and a Chinese bakery. Although less than a mile long, Raritan Avenue has about two dozen places to eat.
Like its diverse restaurant offerings, Highland Park is made up of distinct communities and interest groups. It is about 30 percent Jewish and supports four Orthodox synagogues and the Highland Park Conservative Temple. The borough is surrounded by a symbolic fence, using utility and other wires, that is called an eruv and that permits Orthodox Jews to carry objects or wheel baby carriages within its confines on the Sabbath. There are seven churches representing various Christian denominations. 
 Forty-nine percent of the borough's adults have at least four years of college, and there is a thriving community of students and lecturers associated with Rutgers University, just across the Raritan River in neighboring New Brunswick. In the early morning and evening they can be seen walking across the Raritan River Bridge, along with many commuters to New York City headed to or from the New Jersey Transit train station in New Brunswick. There are also significant black, Hispanic, Asian-American, artistic, literary and gay communities.
"Our diversity is ethnic, social, religious and economic," said Mayor Meryl Frank, a political scientist and Democrat who last year unseated an entrenched Democratic Party machine by pledging to bring the politics of inclusion to the borough. "My son has one friend who is a millionaire and another who is homeless and they all sit together at school. Students know that some families can have two same-sex parents and that's O.K. People here are accepting of differences."
Mayor Frank said her administration would be judged by the success of her efforts to revitalize downtown, which has a few empty stores and a dowdy appearance because of cracked and yellowed sidewalks and an abundance of aging storefronts. She said she was assembling a team made up primarily of local volunteers to determine how Highland Park can best be promoted.
"We need more parking, but I'm not sure that our downtown revitalization should include the normal brick pavers and old-style street lamps," she said. "We must capitalize on Highland Park's strengths. For instance, we could have local artists paint murals on large buildings and put sculptures in public places so people driving through will know we are an artsy town."
Despite its diminutive size, Highland Park has a large range of housing. The unifying factors are an abundance of maple trees and the age of the houses -- most of them more than a half century old. Last year, 125 single-family houses were sold through real estate agents. Prices ranged from $77,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath ranch on Raritan Avenue to $1,210,000 for the largest house in the borough, the three-story, six-bedroom Greek Revival Livingston Manor House, on two acres that include a pair of barns and a greenhouse.
Situated at 81 Harrison Street in the northern section, the house was first built in the early 1800's and has had several additions since. It is named for an early owner, the Rev. John H. Livingston, 1830's head of Queen's College, now Rutgers University.
The house is the focal point of the proposed 12-block Livingston Manor historic district with its 1920's colonials, many with slate roofs and sweeping verandas, that sell for $250,000 to $500,000. The Highland Park Historical Society is preparing applications to have the district included on both the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places.
THE few newer homes in Highland Park are mainly on the northern side of town. Four-bedroom colonials that are about 10 years old on Parkview Terrace sell for from $400,000 to $450,000, said Pamela Zdanowicz, a sales associate with Century 21 J. J. Laufer Realty. The average Highland Park house is a three-bedroom prewar colonial on a 36-by-100-foot lot selling for from $200,000 to $250,000.
Some of the most affordable homes are in the Triangle section, named for a fork that splits Raritan Avenue into Woodbridge Avenue and New Jersey Route 27, two busy roads in Middlesex County. Several small homes needing work on Columbia Street, Ninth Avenue and Alcazar Avenue in the Triangle went for under $100,000 last year.
Among newer residents are Micky and Linda Landis, who bought a 90-year-old five-bedroom center-hall colonial on Harrison Street in the Livingston Manor section for $400,000. Seeking a walking town with a sense of community for their three children, ages 4, 2 and 3 months, they moved from nearby East Brunswick, a sprawling township with no main street.
"I grew up in Highland Park and loved the diversity of the schools and wanted that for my children," said Mr. Landis, who works for a real estate investment trust in Princeton, a 45-minute drive away. "I like the fact that when I am outside, people stop and say hello. And we walk everywhere in town. We also walk to the theater and the restaurants in New Brunswick."
At the end of September, 26 single-family houses were on the market. Prices ranged from $109,000 for a small three-bedroom, one-bath colonial on Parker Road in the Triangle to $495,000 for a larger three-bedroom, two-bath colonial on Lawrence Avenue in Livingston Manor. There were also 11 two- to four-family homes on the market, ranging from $159,000 to $295,000.
Highland Park has about 200 condominium units, most of which are in two high-rise buildings -- the Highlander and River Ridge Terrace -- on South Adelaide Avenue near the New Brunswick line. Recently, two one-bedroom units in the Highlander sold for $55,000 each. No two-bedroom units -- the largest in the building -- were sold in the last year. However, Ms. Zdanowicz estimates that such units would sell for about $120,000. In River Ridge Terrace, sales over the last year ranged from $143,000 for a one-bedroom to $349,000 for three bedrooms.
According to Ms. Zdanowicz, last spring Highland Park's real estate market was the hottest it has ever been. "Homes were selling the day they were listed, many with multiple bids," she said. "Now we get few multiple offers, but houses that are priced right still go in a week or less."
Mayor Frank said that renters make up 60 percent of the population. There are approximately 3,000 rental units in a dozen large garden apartment complexes around the perimeter of the borough. Ms. Zdanowicz said that rentals range from $750 to $950 a month for two bedrooms.
Nowhere is diversity felt more than in the 1,650-student Highland Park Public Schools district. It consists of the K-2 Irving School, the Bartle School, for third through sixth grade (and where prekindergarten classes are also held), and the 650-student Highland Park High School for grades 7-12. Class sizes average 20 students in Irving and the high school and 22 in Bartle; the state average is 21.6. Computers are introduced in prekindergarten with mathematics and science play programs. All district classrooms are wired for the Internet.
The superintendent of schools, Dr. Marylu Simon, said that 70 languages and dialects are spoken in pupils' homes. Although the town population is more than three-quarters white, the school system is 49 percent minority, in part because 300 Jewish students -- 23 percent of the borough's school-age population -- attend religious schools in Edison and East Brunswick.
As part of its diversity education, the district satisfies its state-mandated foreign language requirement by teaching Mandarin Chinese to all students in grades 1 to 4. "It is the most widely spoken language in the world," Dr. Simon said. The program is not offered in the higher grades.
THE district offers 14 advanced placement courses in English, foreign languages, history, the sciences, music and calculus. It also allows seniors who have completed their course requirements to take classes for college credit at Rutgers University. Last year, the district hired a Rutgers professor to teach 14 students a second-year college course in calculus.
Of the 75-student graduating class of 1999, the last class for which official state figures are available, 82 percent went to college. On the College Boards, the graduates had a combined verbal and mathematics average of 1,092, 83 points above the state average.
Besides its many restaurants, Raritan Avenue has three book shops, a dozen beauty salons, three camera stores, a dozen specialty food shops and one supermarket with extensive kosher and other ethnic food departments. On Friday afternoons, an open-air farmers market draws crowds to Raritan Avenue. For major shopping, residents can go to the Brunswick Square Mall in East Brunswick or the Menlo Park Mall in Edison, both less than 10 miles away.
Raritan Avenue was originally part of the Leni Lenape Indian Assunpink Trail, a path that connected the Hudson and Delaware River Valleys. By 1681, the area was home to a dissident Baptist community led by the Rev. Francis Drake, a descendant of the explorer of the same name.
During the Revolutionary War, Hessian soldiers stationed on the Highland Park side of the river exchanged fire with Col. Alexander Hamilton's artillery in New Brunswick. The first railroad bridge across the Raritan was built by the Camden and Amboy Railroad in 1838, facilitating travel from New York City to New Brunswick. In 1905, Highland Park split from Raritan Township -- now Edison Township -- in a dispute over schools and taxes.
Today, much of Highland Park remains county parkland. It is sandwiched between the 90-acre Donaldson Park off South Second Avenue on the borough's southern tip, And the 473-acre Johnson Park, on River Road. Both parks have ball fields, picnic grounds, tennis courts and ponds. Johnson Park also has a petting zoo.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
In Some Foreign Funds, a Way To Overcome the Strong Dollar

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
AMONG the world's major currencies, the dollar has reigned supreme this year, climbing 14 percent against the euro and 5 percent against the yen. While that has meant bargain travel for American tourists, it has generally meant miserable returns for Americans holding foreign mutual funds.
According to Morningstar Inc., foreign funds lost 10.69 percent of their value through the third quarter, compared with a small loss of 1.54 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 Those few foreign funds that have done well this year generally concentrated on picking stocks, not on hedging their currency risks. Still, debates over to what extent investors should venture back into foreign funds often turn into debates over currencies, especially the euro.
For the first three quarters, Morningstar found 29 individual funds in positive territory, with 15 having returns above 5 percent.
The Ivy International Small Companies fund, one of the top performers, returned better than 21 percent for the nine months. Miranda Richards of Henderson Investors in London, the fund's manager, attributed the results entirely to stock-picking, with no currency hedges to bolster the results.
"There are very good small-cap companies that are global leaders in niche businesses," and her job is to find them, Ms. Richards said. Because the companies are small, she is often able to meet with the company's top management, not just the investor relations staff. As a result, she said, she has a better opportunity to know a company well than do managers of funds that invest in large-cap companies.
One of her core holdings is Rational, a German company that has 41 percent of the world market for some specialized ovens used by professional cooks. She bought shares in the initial public offering earlier this year and expects 40 percent annual growth in the stock price. Another favorite is CSL, an Australian company that is a leader in blood plasma products.
If investors have the appropriate horizon of five years or more, she said, they will have less reason to worry about exchange rates. "On this fund, we have no hedges at all at the moment," she said. "We do not do very much hedging, because over the long term, currency fluctuations are less important."
Sheridan Reilly said that the Ivy Funds, where he is international equities chief, are now unhedged but would consider currency hedges when they would be likely to enhance returns or preserve capital. If a portfolio were "overhedged," he said, "it could limit the upside."
THE costs of hedging can vary widely, he said, from "negligible" in Japan, where interest rates are extremely low, to punishingly expensive in politically or economically less stable countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where short-term interest rates have been more than 25 percent in recent years. "That means you're agreeing to give up 25 percent if you hedge," he said, because hedges are a function of interest rates. In such conditions, he added, "we exit the market."
Mr. Reilly said Ivy's approach was twofold -- stock-picking based on a thorough five-year review of individual companies and on disciplined portfolio construction. He cited Siemens of Germany as a favorite. "Over the past five years, it has slowly transformed itself from quasi-state-owned to a vibrant entrepreneurial company," he said. He also likes Nokia of Finland, despite its recent tumble on an earnings warning.
In constructing a portfolio, Mr. Reilly said, Ivy looks for companies with price-to-earnings ratios below the market's, earnings growth rates and return on equity above the market's, and price-to-book ratios near the market's.
"American investors should have up to 30 percent of their holdings in foreign equities," he said. "There are tremendous opportunities." But they should go in only for the long term -- three to five years -- he added.
An independent investment adviser, Michael Stolper, had similar views. His San Diego firm, Stolper & Company, works with institutions and wealthy individuals, often by investing directly in domestic stocks and using mutual funds for international holdings. Among the funds he likes are Acorn International, Oakmark International, Tweedy Brown Global Value, Harbor International Growth and the various Templeton funds.
"We still have about a 20 to 25 percent weighting overseas," Mr. Stolper said, a proportion with which he was happy. Asked if he looked for funds that hedged for currency fluctuations, Mr. Stolper said: "I'd probably be more nervous if they told me they were fully hedged than if they weren't. The cost of hedging can be awesome.
"The longer I'm alive, the less conviction I have that anyone can predict currencies with accuracy," Mr. Stolper said. "I'm surprised at the strength of the dollar and the weakness of the euro. It's a rotational pattern."
Does that mean that today's depressed euro offers a buying opportunity for American investors? "There could be a tactical advantage," Mr. Stolper said, if new money or tax-sheltered retirement-account money is to be deployed. But he said he would not advise selling holdings with a big taxable capital gain to go into a European fund now. Attempts to time the market are usually "exercises in vanity over economics," Mr. Stolper said.
Peter Harrison, head of the global portfolios group at Chase Fleming Asset Management in London, which markets funds in 44 countries including the United States, said the long-term results of an investing strategy were clearer when portfolios were left unhedged. "We don't, as a rule, hedge any of our portfolios," he said. "First and foremost, we are great believers that stocks matter. History and academic evidence show that performance is driven much more by companies than by where they are listed."
Many American investors, enjoying strong domestic markets and the strong dollar, have not felt a need to diversify overseas, Mr. Harrison said. But he thinks Europe will follow the United States in the growth cycle, and he said he was optimistic about the euro for the long term. "We feel it is being dragged down by sentiment," he said, "and by European companies buying U.S. assets -- $150 billion this year."
But Richard Gluck, senior vice president and head of the fixed-income team at the Ivy Funds, said the euro "is not likely to be strong any time soon." He gave several reasons: "Europeans are investing heavily in the United States. Japanese are liquidating European positions, putting pressure on the euro. The United States has an extraordinarily strong economy with high productivity levels. The oil-price rise hits Europe twice because oil is priced in dollars, and the E.C.'s central bank has been pursuing an anti-inflation policy."
Germans have been buying United States Treasury bonds, he noted, and given the dollar's strength against the euro, "they are up 26 percent this year."
Still, "things do change over time," Mr. Gluck said. "The euro will find its base level," he added. "So be diversified; don't catch the wave after it has moved 20 percent."

 The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future
 Of Egalitarianism
 By Robert William Fogel.
 383 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $25. 
If poor people today grow nearly as tall, live almost as long and surf roughly as many cable channels as rich people, shouldn't liberals stop whining? If the spiritual benefits of education are so indispensable that funds for lifelong learning (especially for needy kids and depressed older people) need to rise by a stunning $400 billion each year, shouldn't conservatives pay up? It gives you some feel for how ideologically refreshing the latest book by Robert Fogel, the 1993 Nobel laureate in economic science, is that his answer to both these questions is a matter-of-fact yes. "The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism" is an ambitious effort to account for the cycles of reform in American history. While its religious-historical framework is a bit overwrought, Fogel's book is remarkable for weaving insights from history, religion, biology, nutrition, demography, economics and even a field called "technophysio evolution" into an integrated perspective that suggests how the priorities of today's left and right might meld into a powerful new egalitarian agenda to complete the nation's unfinished business.
Shunning the prejudices of current political debate, in which the label "egalitarian" is even more fatal than "liberal," Fogel argues that "the egalitarian creed . . . is at the core of American political culture." Much of political history, he argues, involves the swing between rival interpretations of this creed, one emphasizing "equality of opportunity," the other "equality of condition." The ebb and flow of these reform paradigms, Fogel says, has turned on whether the prevailing religious ethic viewed poverty and disadvantage as the wages of sin, or as the by-product of broader flaws in society.
Fogel traces this battle through America's previous religious awakenings. The first, in the mid-1700's, saw revivalist leaders assail the corrupt church hierarchy, helping fuel the related war on British rule in the American Revolution. The second great awakening, starting in the early 1800's and peaking at midcentury, preached the struggle against sin as the path to grace, and gave rise to the temperance and abolitionist movements. The third great awakening, stretching from 1890 to 1930 and beyond, was born in the flood of displaced farm workers and new immigrants to the cities and led to the reforms associated with the Progressives, the New Deal and, eventually, the Great Society. Fogel's fourth great awakening began in the 1960's and shapes politics today. Nearly a third of the electorate now claims membership in "enthusiastic religion," powering the anti-abortion, antitax and welfare reform movements. Partly in response to the exhaustion of the third awakening's redistributive agenda, Fogel argues, the religious pendulum has swung back toward an emphasis on individual responsibility.
Fogel concedes that his analysis ends up "tying political history far more closely to religion than some historians consider warranted." Most readers will, I think, agree. It may be true, as Fogel contends, that "the evangelical churches represent the leading edge" of reform in our society. But it's hard not to view the Depression as the truer inspiration of the New Deal agenda, to cite just one example. And when Fogel recasts familiar battles (like the clash between labor and business at the turn of the century) as showdowns between the end of one awakening and the rise of another, the results feel forced.
Luckily, these aspects of Fogel's framework are easy to skip over, allowing one to feast on the surprising and illuminating data he has culled from various disciplines. Consider: Life expectancy in New York and Philadelphia in the 1830's averaged 24 years, six years less than that of Southern slaves. Nutrition was so poor in the early 1900's that one-third of American men were deemed too weak to serve in World War I. Our species has so mastered our environment that we've increased our body size by 50 percent and life spans by more than 100 percent in just 300 years. The saturation of consumer goods is so complete that American homes now boast more than one radio per ear.
These facts and hundreds like them help Fogel to make his case that life is vastly better today, even for the worst-off Americans. Which raises a provocative question: what is the proper angle of vision for reformers -- the long historical view, or a look down today's mean streets? If your standards for outrage are set by the ages, little on the current American scene seems a cause for alarm. But the long view can be so olympian as to counsel a weirdly informed indifference to the fate of millions with scant hope.
It is a measure of Fogel's subtlety that he is able to encompass both perspectives. Even as he catalogs the country's enormous progress, he's filled with ideas about what should come next. Fogel is aware that government played a big role in increasing incomes and life spans for the poor over the last century, largely through subsidies for education, pensions and public health. Indeed, he sees the "egalitarian revolution" of the 20th century as a huge success save for one thing: the "glaring failure to promote moral behavior" in a society more prone today than a century ago to teenage pregnancy, single motherhood, drug addiction and crime. In Fogel's view, "immaterial" goods -- a sense of purpose, a commitment to family and a work ethic -- are now more important than mere cash in lifting up the poor. These spiritual gaps aren't easy to fill, since they're transferred through intimate relationships, not government handouts. Fogel thus calls for a revolutionary expansion in mentoring and similar forms of extended education, aimed at disadvantaged kids, single mothers and the elderly. With material comfort freeing ordinary Americans to seek self-realization, and productivity increases likely to make retirement at age 55 routine before long, Fogel predicts a surge in volunteerism that could go far to address the virtue gap.
While this emphasis sounds conservative, Fogel insists that the next generation of reform needn't be either/or -- that Great Society liberals and tough-love conservatives should find common ground promoting education, pensions and health care, as well as curbing drugs and media violence. If his history is any guide, Fogel's dream may not come true, but it's worth hoping our politics can grope its way toward approaches as catholic and inclusive as his own vision plainly is.

HEADLINE: Trust in Government

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 5 letter posed a question -- "are government bureaucrats more capable of running my life than I am?" -- similar to what George W. Bush has asked in the debate and his stump speeches. To many of us, however, that is not the key question. 
 Voters should be asking themselves if an increasingly unregulated and oligopolistic market economy should continue to prevent many Americans from access to basic necessities, like affordable health care. I would also like to know why government is such an anathema to so many in a representative democracy.

HEADLINE: It's Not Oil vs. Beauty in the Arctic

BYLINE: By Frank H. Murkowski; Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska, is chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Clinging to a position that would prevent America from developing some of the most promising of its domestic energy resources, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman have repeatedly stated their opposition to oil exploration in a tiny sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain. They say it would yield only a six-month supply of oil, and only at the cost of the destruction of a pristine wilderness. In suggesting that we must choose between Arctic oil and environmental protection, they are presenting a false choice.
What is at stake here, according to the latest estimates of the United States Geological Survey, is 16 billion barrels of oil -- an amount sufficient to replace all of our imports from Saudi Arabia for the next 30 years. And it can be extracted and moved to consumers in the "lower 48" states without harming the wildlife that inhabits the coastal plain at various times of the year. More than 25 years of experience at nearby Prudhoe Bay, a region that has supplied America with roughly 25 percent of its domestic oil production since the late 1970's, have shown that energy production and environmental protection can coexist. 
 At the time Prudhoe Bay was discovered, some claimed that oil development would devastate the central Arctic caribou herd. Today that herd is more than triple the size it was then. Nesting populations of migratory birds in the area are also on the rise. It is clear that we now have the technology that can both develop the oil and protect the environment.
The 19 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is roughly the size of South Carolina. In 1980, Congress declared 8 million acres of the refuge as strictly protected wilderness and an additional 9.5 million as refuge lands off limits to energy exploration. Mindful of the fact that the remaining 1.5 million acres of coastal plain was North America's best and last hope of a giant oil discovery, Congress designated the coastal plain as a special study area that could be opened to oil and gas leasing.
In the intervening years, a federal environmental impact study has shown that exploration of the coastal plain could occur during the winter, when animals are not present and no habitat would be disturbed, to determine if any recoverable oil is even present. If a large oil field were found, the oil could be developed using directional drilling technology, which requires very little use of land at the surface. It would disturb only 2,000 acres or less of the flat, treeless tundra that makes up the coastal plain.
In other words, we can determine if the oil is there with no environmental impact at all, and if a very large field were found, we could develop it with minimal environmental impact. The sad fact is, at present, we aren't even allowed to look.
America will remain dependent on oil for the foreseeable future, and increasingly, our dependency is on foreign oil. During the Clinton-Gore years, our oil imports have soared 17 percent while domestic production has decreased 14 percent. We now rely on foreign suppliers for 58 percent of our crude oil, and that reliance carries several risks.
As we import more oil on foreign tankers, which lack the safety features required of American ships, the risk of oil spills increases. Pushing production out of America to nations without our environmental standards increases global environmental risks. Moreover, our growing dependence on foreign oil, including oil from Iraq, is inconsistent with our foreign policy objectives. And we endanger our economy as we rely increasingly on a cartel for an essential resource.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman heralded the recent release of oil from our existing Strategic Petroleum Reserve as instrumental in easing prices and building inventories of heating oil. But they oppose looking for the oil field that many geologists think may be under Alaska's coastal plain -- a huge field that could have a meaningful and sustained effect on consumer prices. We are flirting with danger by refusing even to see what may lie under the coastal plain.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
Back to Death Row With a Convict and a Crusading Nun

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
America is a young country with stories to tell. So rapid is our history that we like our stories simple, our characters unequivocal and our conflicts vivid, and this is why we turn so many of them into operas. This kind of narrative balladry has taken on an American style of its own: a lyrical storytelling in which music is an amiable, often meek appendage, happy to echo pastoral themes and bend to the dynamism of words and action.
An old working model and a new prototype for American opera occupied the San Francisco Opera this weekend. Friday night it was "The Ballad of Baby Doe," Douglas Moore's minor epic of boom, bust and romance in the Colorado silver industry 125 years ago. Last night brought a far more bitter and less romantic kind of art, a new opera taken from Sister Helen Prejean's book about a Louisiana execution, with music by Jake Heggie and a libretto from Terrence McNally. The book also inspired a devasting film by Tim Robbins starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon. 
 "Dead Man Walking" is drama so loaded with moral questions, politics and the sheer horrors of suffering and death that the romance of American ballad opera quickly curdles. We are asked to weigh the violent deaths of murder victims against the institutional murder of the man responsible, also to reconcile Christian obligations to love with the near-justifiable instinct for revenge. More important, "Dead Man Walking" does not debate these issues; it shows them. We follow Joe de Rocher through the corridors and anterooms of Angola Prison as failed legal appeals and the machinery of execution take him gradually to his death.
The San Francisco production by Joe Mantello and Michael Yeargan does this very well. Scene changes are liquid; the images are simple. Institutional gray and seediness set this stage as it should be set. Patrick Summers has prepared his orchestra and singers handsomely. Mr. McNally does his part. The economical libretto avoids verbiage and condenses scenes; indeed, "Dead Man Walking" does not keep us waiting.
So with such strong forces at work in this new opera, it is sad to report that its music fails to show up. Mr. Heggie's career, or what I know of it, has taken a distinctive path to success. Whereas most composers appeal to the public for approval, he has gone to performers. Principally a writer of songs, Mr. Heggie is a proficient flatterer of the human voice, with a real knack for hitting its G spots. As a result, a series of important singers, charmed by the easy, unthreatening flow of his music, not to mention his considerable personal appeal, have carried the Heggie name to the public in their concerts. The San Francisco Opera, where Mr. Heggie worked in the public relations department, seems to have been the most charmed of all, having commissioned him to write "Dead Man Walking" and provided a first-rate production.
Yet nice as Mr. Heggie's musical gifts may be, they are no match for the explosive issues and episodes entrusted to him. Singers are accommodated, schmoozed and made comfortable; and when high drama is required, Mr. Heggie gives us a drumroll, a few timpani whacks and a brass crescendo. The massed crowd choruses thrive on loudness and congestion. When these big ensembles do take on a certain power in the last scenes, credit more the raw, visceral drama surrounding the music, less the music itself. There is nothing musically offensive about "Dead Man Walking," but to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there's not much there there. The aesthetics of ingratiation take an artist only so far, and this is subject matter with far greater needs.
Mr. Heggie works hard to enliven his orchestra with conflicting inner motion and rhythm, but so ineffective is the instrumental sound that potentially interesting detail is lost in the general pallor. Mr. Heggie would have done well to turn his orchestration over to a professional.
The singing principals are first-rate. Susan Graham sings touchingly as Sister Helen. John Packard is deeply and vividly affecting as the condemned man. Frederica von Stade works hard as his stricken mother. Also good are the quartet of bereaved parents: Nicolle Foland, Catherine Cook, Gary Rideout and especially Robert Orth in an extended part. Theresa Hamm-Smith, John Ames and Jay Hunter Morris do well. Sam Fleming's costumes capture the wash-and-wear culture of the Southern poor. So much of "Dead Man Walking" is worth our while, and so much of it is missing.

HEADLINE: Semiconductor Growth Predicted

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 8

 BODY:
Worldwide sales of semiconductors will show double-digit growth in the next three years as manufacturers find places for them in a variety of devices other than the personal computer, a new report says.
Sales of semiconductors are growing at a rate of at least 25 percent as electronics manufacturers put them into cellular phones, game consoles, cameras, set-top boxes, handheld electronic organizers and other devices, Dataquest, a research unit of the Gartner Group, says in a report. 
 Total worldwide revenue in 2000 alone is expected to increase 37 percent compared with figures in 1999, to $231.6 billion, before moderating somewhat in 2001-02 and turning downward slightly in 2003, according to the Dataquest forecast.
A separate report from the research firm International Data Group predicts European semiconductor sales will grow 13 percent this year.
A spokesman for Intel, the leading maker of semiconductors, said the company could not comment on the reports because it had entered a mandatory quiet period ahead of reporting its earnings.
Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and other chip makers have been scrambling to increase manufacturing in the face of continuing shortages of high-end processors and memory chips. Cellular phone makers such as Nokia and Ericsson and makers of electronic handheld devices such as Palm and Sony are moving to make "smart" devices capable of accessing the Internet, but the equipment requires greater processing power with low heat consumption.
Flash memory, which retains information even when a device is turned off, has been in particularly short supply as nearly all manufacturers of mobile electronic devices compete for it. Analysts predict prices will remain high through 2001 until new factories begin production.

HEADLINE: Patents;
An early move in Congress to limit the protection of business methods to what is truly original.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
PATENTS for methods of doing business have existed in small numbers at least since the early 1980's, but only in the mid-90's did they suddenly begin to loom large in the economy. It was then that electronic commerce created a new arena for traditional business practices and several patents were granted that appeared to give exclusivity for such practices to some Web-only companies. As people sat up and took notice of the trend, some did not like what they saw.
One of the most recent to express displeasure was Representative Howard L. Berman, a Democrat representing a Los Angeles district. Last week, Mr. Berman, along with Representative Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, announced legislation to "provide that where an invention is new only in that it uses a computer to implement the business practice," the Patent and Trademark Office "will presume the invention to be obvious, and thus, not patentable." 
 The bill would also require the Patent and Trademark Office to publish all business-method patents 18 months after they are filed, even if they have not yet been granted. It calls, as well, for giving opponents of an awarded patent a means for challenging it without having to resort to a lawsuit.
The two Congressmen said they were concerned that business-method patents were being issued without enough evidence whether an idea was already in the public domain.
"This is particularly difficult with Internet and high-tech practices," a press release by Mr. Berman said, "since very little published information exists." He cited a patent that covers the choosing of a car color when buying a vehicle over the Internet, and asked: "Given that auto salesmen have never patented their approach on the salesroom floor, is there a published record of activity of auto salesmen? And was this record considered in the drafting or examining of the patent?"
The bill could raise questions on what the use of a computer means, since business-method patents might involve software, hardware and Web sites including Internet portals. And in the past, any hint of publishing patents before they are issued has set off vigorous opposition in this country, where there is a long tradition of protecting an inventor's secrecy until the patent is awarded.
For now, the bill amounts to little more than a gesture, as it was introduced two days before the end of the regular Congressional session, and it is impossible to know whether it will get attention next year. Both men sit on the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts and intellectual property. As the ranking minority member, Mr. Berman could become the chairman if the Democrats regain control of the House in next month's elections. Of course, he could also be defeated for re-election, though political analysts say that is unlikely.
In any case, Mr. Berman said he did not offer the legislation for immediate action. "I am not taking a position one way or another as to whether business methods should be patentable," he said in the statement. "I tend to think they should be, but I could be persuaded otherwise. My intent with this legislation is to stimulate the dialogue."
Neither Mr. Berman nor Mr. Boucher represents a district with a large number of high-technology companies. But according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political contributions, Mr. Berman's re-election campaign received nearly $150,000 last year and this from political action committees and individuals connected with the entertainment industry, and Mr. Boucher accepted just over $80,000 from PAC's in the entertainment, publishing, telecommunications and computer industries.
These industries are weighted toward traditional companies that own the information and entertainment "content" increasingly being sold over the Internet, and that are developing the hardware and software for the future of e-commerce. Such companies are not enamored of the idea that young high-technology companies like Amazon.com might patent and own a method of conducting digital business like the "one-click" online purchase.
Across the Capitol, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not vote last month on the long-pending international trademark agreement known as the Madrid protocol, despite intense lobbying by the International Trademark Association. Both the White House and Congress have supported the accord, which would allow one-stop international trademark processing -- meaning that people could apply for or renew a trademark in nearly 50 countries simply by filing the paperwork and paying the fee at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Leaders of the trademark holders group had not expected last-minute opposition over a section of the agreement from one industry -- liquor distillers. Their outrage originated with the French company Pernod Ricard, which has been locked in a trademark battle with Bacardi Ltd. over a Cuban rum brand name, Havana Club.
The contested section of the protocol is based on a 1999 law that has roots in the economic embargo against Cuba and the industries that were seized there after Fidel Castro came to power four decades earlier. The law prevents anyone other than the original owner of a Cuban trademark from paying to register or renew it with the Patent and Trademark Office. It says that "designated nationals" -- like the Cuban government or any Cuban national -- do not qualify. Thus, the law effectively strips the Cuban company that controls the rum name Havana Club from enforcing or defending a trademark in this country.
Bacardi, which leads the $3.5 billion-a-year rum market, began selling a rum of its own called Havana Club in the United States in 1995. A Cuban holding company sold a rum with that name elsewhere in the world. The Cuban company went to United States courts to stop Bacardi from using the name in this country, and also licensed the Havana Club trademark to Pernod Ricard.
Bacardi had been a supporter of the 1999 law. But now the European Union has challenged the law, saying it violates World Trade Organization agreements.
Last month a W.T.O. panel began looking into the distillers dispute. And last week, the Supreme Court turned aside an appeal from the Cuban company to stop Bacardi from using the trademark.
But by then, what the International Trademark Association had expected to be a smooth adoption of the Madrid protocol had already become tangled in the distillers fight.
In the days before the Senate's scheduled vote, Pernod Ricard began a public campaign against the 1999 law, and Congress, which has been considering the Madrid protocol since 1989, put off its vote once again.

HEADLINE: Signs of Market Saturation in PC World

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The personal computer industry, whose double-digit growth helped propel technology stocks for years, finally faces stiff competition -- from personal computers.
Lately, it has become increasingly hard to sell consumers and corporations new computers because so many consumers and businesses already own them. Some analysts see signs of market saturation that could portend the end of the glory days for PC makers and their suppliers. 
 In recent weeks Intel, Apple and Dell have seen their stocks tumble after warning that demand for computers is lighter than anticipated. The tepid forecasts have dampened investor expectations for the coming quarterly financial reports from those companies and others in the PC food chain.
When Apple issued its warning, its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, described it as "a speed bump." But some industry analysts say the warnings, taken together and coupled with other evidence, suggest something more fundamental is behind the slower demand. They say the personal computer market, especially the corporate market, is so saturated the industry can no longer assume sales will grow at annual rates of 15 or 20 percent or more to which it has grown accustomed.
"We've run out of room for growth," said Martin Reynolds, research fellow at Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. "Look at the saturation in the market. We're there. We're filled up."
Mr. Reynolds even predicts the PC market, rather than simply seeing slower growth, could actually contract by the year 2002.
The financial and product analysts who see market saturation say the shift does not yet mark the dreaded dawn of the so-called post-PC era, in which the use of personal computers would be usurped by other handheld computers and other gadgets. Rather, they see the beginning of the replacement-PC era.
"The corporate market has become a replacement market," said Anne Bui, a senior analyst with the International Data Corporation, or IDC, a research house. "There's no reason to buy anything now. They've bought everything they need."
The figures for saturation levels of the home market vary. Estimates from various market research firms indicate that from 53 to 60 percent of the nation's households now have computers, and some analysts expect greater penetration levels to be reached only gradually.
Since 1994, annual sales of computers in the United States have increased at a torrid pace. As recently as 1999, sales soared 23.8 percent, to 45 million computers, up from 36 million in 1998, according to IDC.
But for the current year, IDC is projecting a growth rate of only 12.2 percent in the United States market. That would be the lowest annual percentage rise since 1994, the earliest year for which IDC provides statistics.
Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Bui said that the computer market might begin taking on the cyclical and seasonal traits typical of other industries. Computer sales, for example, could ebb and flow with standard replacement cycles, or be pegged more directly to new software releases.
To be sure, not all analysts see systemic changes at work. Some say it is simply too soon to read anything into the recent warnings or even IDC's slow-growth projections for 2000.
And they point out that PC sales have had their ebbs and flows over the last five years. For instance, worldwide sales slipped to 12.8 percent in 1998, according to IDC, but rebounded dramatically, by 23.6 percent, the very next year.
"There's no question that in our industry's history we've seen times when supply has caught up to demand," said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services Inc., a consulting firm in Santa Fe, N.M.
Mr. Merrin said he believed that oil prices, among other factors, are slowing the economy and that the drag on computer sales is "a 9- to 18-month situation."
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said PC makers and their investors should take heart that IDC, even while projecting 12.2 percent growth in the United States market this year, projects worldwide sales at 18.9 percent.
Mr. Murphy said that roughly 435 million PC's had been installed worldwide to date, which he estimated as only one-fifth the total that will be installed in the coming years. "Before this whole revolution is over, there will be 2.5 billion computers shipped worldwide," he predicted.
Where Mr. Murphy does agree with Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Bui is in saying that the weakness in the euro is hurting PC sales. Another factor that some analysts say has clouded the figures this year is the slow uptake of Microsoft's Windows 2000 software.
Steve P. Kleynhans, a vice president at the Meta Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn., said many corporations were testing Windows 2000 on "hundreds" of new computers before rolling them out on "thousands" of upgraded computers. "I don't see this as a long-term problem," Mr. Kleynhans said. "It's a short-term problem hitting for a couple of quarters."
Mr. Kleynhans said it was misleading to draw an industry conclusion from the combined warnings of Dell, Intel and Apple, which he said were each dealing with different factors.
Intel, he said, which warned analysts on Sept. 21 that its third-quarter revenues would not meet the company's earlier expectations, was facing newfound competition from its chip-making rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and was not executing as well as it could be.
And he said that Dell's sales were a victim of the sluggish acceptance of Windows 2000. Last week, Dell warned that revenue for its fiscal third quarter would be 3 percent below previous forecasts.
Only in the case of Apple does Mr. Kleynhans see "a fairly saturated market," noting that the Macintosh faithful "all have machines." On Sept. 28, Apple said it would earn 30 to 33 cents a share in its fourth quarter, far below analysts' forecast of 45 cents.
Charles R. Wolf, executive director at the investment bank UBS Warburg, who closely follows the PC industry, said all PC makers need to realize that their industry has matured -- that they have successfully saturated the European and American business markets and now must concentrate on becoming a replacement industry.
He said PC makers could still find growth selling to households -- not only because that market is not yet saturated, but because households often purchase more than one computer.
Short term, as investors and analysts await further details from the PC industry as companies report financial results in coming weeks, stocks could be in for further punishment. Mr. Wolf said investors seem to be saying, "PC sales are slowing and there seems to be no bottom."

HEADLINE: Loans Tightening to Young and Deeply Indebted Businesses

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
As the stock market gyrates and rumors are heard about Wall Street firms' incurring losses on high-yield bonds, investment worries are spreading to new markets.
A quiet credit squeeze is under way for the most heavily indebted corporate borrowers. Banks and other companies are increasingly wary of lending to start-up businesses, companies undertaking leveraged buyouts and other leveraged enterprises. The volume of new loans to such companies, which typically carry bond ratings below investment grade, was 25 percent lower in the first nine months of this year than it was in the corresponding period a year earlier, according to S & P/Portfolio Management Data, an affiliate of Standard & Poor's. 
 "Only the best issuers are able to tap the market right now," said Sam DeRosa-Farag, director of global strategy for leveraged finance at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
A tighter loan market means that many of the small start-up companies that have fed the stock market's rise are finding it hard to obtain the credit they need to grow.
The loan market, although it receives little publicity, is a critical source of financing for corporate borrowers of all stripes. Typically, one or two banks or Wall Street firms take the lead on making a large loan to a company. They then sell pieces of the loan to other firms, a process known as syndication. The riskier the company, the higher the interest rate.
For many years, corporate loans simply stayed on lenders' books until they were repaid. But more recently, lenders have begun trading their holdings, and a relatively active secondary market for corporate loans has developed.
In theory, corporate loans are among the most secure types of investments. The investors in loans have first claim on a company's assets should the company end up in bankruptcy. Next in line among creditors are bondholders, with stockholders having lower priority and assuming more risk.
Start-up companies and deal makers undertaking leveraged buyouts rely on the high-yield-bond and loan markets to satisfy their hunger for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in financing. And with high-yield bonds in a slump, these would-be borrowers have increasingly depended on so-called leveraged loans.
But buyers of such loans are increasingly wary of lending to marginal borrowers.
What has many institutional lenders worried right now is the same fear that concerns the high-yield bond market: a rise in corporate defaults. For the 12-month period ending on Aug. 31, 3.87 percent of all high-yield debt was in default, up from 1 percent two years ago, according to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. With the increase in such defaults, the number of leveraged loans trading at distressed levels now accounts for 16 percent of the market.
Last week, bankers were busy renegotiating loans for two companies, according to investors. A group seeking to acquire Johns Manville, the building materials manufacturer, in a $2.9 billion leveraged buyout was debating whether to invest more cash in the company after weak demand from banks.
Another company, MainStream PCS, postponed efforts to raise more than $1 billion in loans last week, according to bank loan investors, due in part to their wariness about putting money into telecommunications start-ups. MainStream was raising money to finance the purchase of assets from Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic's corporate successor. A spokesman for Manville declined to comment; a spokesman for MainStream could not be reached for comment.
The week before, a third company, the car battery maker Exide, agreed to give its lenders warrants entitling them to purchase as much as 3 percent of its stock, in order to raise $250 million in bank loans it needed for an acquisition. That marked the first time a large corporate borrower was forced to issue stock to its lenders, according to Christopher Donnelly, a director with Portfolio Management Data.
"This hasn't been the best period for the auto industry," said Bruce Ling, head of syndicated finance at Credit Suisse First Boston, which, together with Citigroup, took the lead on the Exide loan. In addition, Exide is in the midst of a corporate turnaround. "We thought this was a creative way to market the deal to a broader investor base," Mr. Ling said.
But to some investors, Exide's willingness to part with stock smacked of desperation. "A deal that's selling well doesn't need an equity kicker," said David Millison, managing director of Caravelle Advisers, which manages a $2.1 billion investment portfolio that includes senior loans. Indeed, Citigroup and Credit Suisse have yet to sell a majority of the loan, according to investors in the loan market, suggesting some wariness on the part of other lenders. "We are still in the process of selling the deal," Mr. Ling said.
Banks that make leveraged loans are also facing pressure from the government to reduce their exposure to such lending. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency completed a survey of bank underwriting practices. The report found that the problem loans on banks' books had doubled in the last two years, to $100 billion, or 5.1 percent of the value of all outstanding syndicated loans greater than $20 million.
The good news for borrowers is that banks' role in the leveraged loan market has been shrinking for some time. Commercial banks long dominated the market. But securities firms have expanded their presence, and the wave of banking mergers over the last decade has caused the number of financial institutions participating in this market to dwindle. In the last few weeks alone, J. P. Morgan, Summit Bancorp and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette -- all participants in the leveraged loan market -- have announced plans to be acquired.
As banks reduce their role in the leveraged loan market, private investors have stepped in. Investment funds now account for nearly half the buyers of leveraged loans, according to Portfolio Management Data. That compares with a share of 17 percent in 1994. These investors include mutual funds set up specifically to purchase loans, as well as pools of loans known as collateralized loan obligations that are then sold to insurance companies and the like. (There are also collateralized debt obligations, which invest in a combination of loans, high-yield debt and equities.)
The growth of the mutual funds and collateralized funds helped the market for leveraged loans quadruple in size between 1993 and 1999, rising to $626 billion from $150 billion, according to Donaldson. That worked to the benefit of growing companies eager to borrow money.
But there are signs that this new crop of lenders is even quicker than banks to cut back on lending when markets become wobbly. These nonbank lenders look at new loans with a much more critical eye than was customary in the old, clubby world of banking.
"Banks will often provide credit for relationship reasons," Mr. Donnelly of Portfolio Management Data said. A company seeking a loan might also look to the bank for cash management services, or trading. "What has developed is a large segment of the market that's immune to those kind of issues," Mr. Donnelly said. "They have no bridges to burn."
Mr. Millison of Caravelle is a case in point. As the manager of a collateralized debt obligation fund, he is continuing to buy some new issues, but lately he has been spending more of his cash buying existing loans in the secondary market.
"There is a flight to quality," he said. "The loan market is still fairly robust. But with default rates on the rise, we're being very selective."

HEADLINE: Disarming Leader at Battle on the Hill

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Representative J. Dennis Hastert was elected speaker by his Republican colleagues last year for one reason: He was the opposite of Newt Gingrich.
Where Mr. Gingrich was fiery and combative, blamed for going so far as to shut down the government rather than concede to President Clinton, aides say Mr. Hastert is subdued and devoid of ego, a conciliator who works diligently behind the scenes. 
 Never have the men's opposing styles of leadership been more evident than now, a month before Election Day, when Mr. Hastert must go head-to-head with the president in year-end budget negotiations.
With control of the House at stake, Mr. Hastert is more willing than his predecessor to broker agreements with the president without betraying rank-and-file Republicans, a delicate balancing act. It is an approach that brings out the natural dealmaker in Mr. Clinton, a president who is always eager to split the difference and hash out policy details.
Their dynamic harks back to a political era before Mr. Gingrich, when presidents and speakers from opposing parties -- like President Reagan and Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. -- cajoled and disagreed, all without personal animosity.
"I think we've had a pretty honest, open relationship with each other," Mr. Hastert said in an interview. "I'm not here as a person who tries to play games and set traps. I've always told him I'm not going to try to blow smoke at him, and I'll be a straight shooter."
At a time when profound partisanship still dominates Capitol Hill, their bond -- one built on mutual trust -- has led to several successful legislative partnerships, from fighting drugs in Colombia to combating poverty in America.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert spoke for about 20 minutes one day last week on a range of subjects as different as spending bills and breast cancer research, aides said.
The two men occasionally detour into chitchat about their Labrador retrievers or Mr. Clinton's collection of campaign buttons, but aides say Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert thrive on getting down to business. There is little gamesmanship. There are few existential tangents.
"They can essentially level with each other about what they want or don't want, what they can or can't deliver," said the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta. "They are not buddy-buddy, but they have a kind of solid relationship of trying to work to get some stuff done."
This solid relationship is often tested by election-year politics. Mr. Clinton must consider the needs of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Mr. Hastert, who seldom speaks with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, must nevertheless be sensitive to his standing in the polls. Mr. Bush's success or failure could play a pivotal role in whether Republicans keep control of the House.
In fact, the president and the speaker disagree on many things. When gas prices jumped in the Midwest, Mr. Hastert said the Clinton administration lacked an energy policy. They have also traded sharp words publicly on Republican tax cuts that Mr. Clinton has vetoed.
Despite Mr. Hastert's efforts to find common ground with Mr. Clinton, Congressional Democrats say the process does not work that way on the Hill, where they say Republicans have abandoned bipartisanship on major issues like the importing of prescription drugs.
But Mr. Hastert's collegial relationship with Mr. Clinton is in stark contrast to the open acrimony that prevailed on Capitol Hill under Mr. Gingrich, particularly during the impeachment.
And while House Republicans have not necessarily lost their contempt for Mr. Clinton, they recognize that they must work with him or risk being portrayed as unable to govern. Such a conciliatory approach is made more palatable by Mr. Hastert, who has won over conservatives and moderates by including them in decisions. This tactic has earned the speaker the good will of his colleagues and made it easier for him to govern with a seven-vote majority.
Mr. Hastert first dealt with the White House in 1993 on Mr. Clinton's ill-fated health care plan, when House Republicans were still in the minority. But it was not until Mr. Hastert became speaker in January 1999 that he began working with Mr. Clinton regularly.
From the start, Mr. Hastert took a less combative tack, in part because of his longtime ties to Mr. Podesta, a friend since their paths crossed in college.
The first challenge came within months, when Mr. Hastert backed a Democratic resolution in the House to give symbolic support to Mr. Clinton's air campaign in Kosovo. Even though the measure failed in a tie vote, Mr. Podesta said that the speaker took a "constructive role, a nonpartisan role."
Mr. Hastert recalled telling Mr. Clinton: "We'll work with you on the Kosovo thing. We do have a responsibility in Congress to pay for these things. We don't want to be surprised. We'll work with you, but don't take us for granted."
By fall, the president and the speaker were working closely on a bipartisan plan to encourage investment in cities and rural towns with high unemployment rates. In an unusual display of comity, the two met on the south side of Chicago, a short drive from Mr. Hastert's district, to promote the plan.
At the same time, the annual fall showdown over the budget approached. House conservatives were clamoring for Mr. Hastert not to yield on protecting the Social Security surplus. And he stood firm, telling the president that was one line he could not cross. "I'm just telling you the facts," Mr. Hastert said he told Mr. Clinton.
This impressed conservatives, including Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, who had felt betrayed by Mr. Gingrich's penchant for cutting deals with Mr. Clinton without consulting them, Republicans say. The one bit of advice they have given Mr. Hastert is "trust but verify," said Representative John Shadegg, an Arizona Republican who is a leading House conservative.
In June, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert championed a bill to send $1.3 billion to help train and equip Colombian Army and police forces to fight drug traffickers. The two flew to Colombia to deliver the aid.
Mr. Hastert's opening move in this year's contentious year-end budget battle was so conciliatory it unsettled even some of his strongest allies, including Mr. DeLay. Mr. Hastert offered to compromise on a deal to increase the minimum hourly wage by $1 to $6.15 in exchange for tax breaks for small businesses. Both sides are optimistic they can reach a deal. In the end, Mr. DeLay resigned himself to the trade-off.
What has made for this more cooperative relationship is Mr. Hastert's plain, uncomplicated style. He is impervious to flattery, aides say, and his patience is legendary. Earlier this year he presided over a meeting on a health care bill from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.
At the White House, currying favor with Mr. Gingrich was easy, officials and Republican aides said; one time, Mr. Gingrich arrived there to find a copy of Time magazine with his picture on the cover lying on a coffee table. "If you want to get to Denny, you have to throw out Bass Master magazine," said one House Republican leadership aide.
Bill Paxon, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now a lobbyist, said with a chuckle: "I've been around the world with Denny, and I've seen him meet with potentates and princes. He is not a guy who is easily impressed. He's more impressed being out at an old car auction with someone who understands engines."
With Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Clinton in the same room, conversations would often veer off into esoteric tangents and there was always an undercurrent of one-upmanship. The fine details of legislation seemed too mundane, aides said.
"Newt was much more a kind of theoretician," Mr. Podesta said in an interview. "At the end of the day, even on stuff he knows he's going to have to give up, he will spend 20 minutes telling you why you are wrong asking for it. Hastert will say, 'I understand you need this, let's move on.' "
Although Mr. Hastert is often dismissive of House Democratic leaders, he takes a much more hands-on approach in negotiations with the White House and is more pragmatic than Mr. Gingrich was, Republican aides said. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert meet privately about four times a year and speak on the telephone about the same number of times.
Election-year forces may yet conspire to derail this collegiality. While there is some hope for a bill to overhaul managed care, aides say Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert are far apart on legislation to provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly and to make attacks on gays a federal hate crime.
On top of that, Mr. Hastert speaks only for House Republicans. Senate Republicans, led by Trent Lott of Mississippi, feel less vulnerable this campaign season and less inclined to compromise. "What Hastert wants and what he can deliver are two different things," Mr. Podesta said.
Mr. Hastert recognizes that the president faces his own pressures. Mr. Clinton tries to be a straight shooter "as much as he can," the speaker said. "He's pretty much laid things out on the table."
But, Mr. Hastert added, "he has a party he must go back to in the Congress."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: CALIFORNIA;
House Race Important to Control of Congress Draws Outside Interest and Money

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif., Oct. 3

 BODY:
Except for a few placards and a scattering of advertisements on cable television, there is almost no readily visible evidence that an election is being held this fall in California's 36th Congressional District, the sunny ocean-side strip of Beach Boys country, from just south of Santa Monica to just north of Long Beach.
Still, a hot political battle is being waged in the 36th, one that is expected to go down to the wire and play an important role in deciding which party ends up controlling the House. The two candidates -- Steven T. Kuykendall, the Republican incumbent, and Jane Harman, his Democratic challenger -- are having at each other daily, trying to gain traction, even if little attention is being paid. 
 Available polls indicate that of the 52 House races in California this year, this one might be the closest and might be decided by many of the same tax, health care, education and Social Security issues that are at play in the presidential race.
The district is roughly 40 percent Republican, 40 percent Democrat and 20 percent independent and has a history of swinging from one side to the other in elections. It tends to be moderate on social, cultural and environmental issues, and conservative on fiscal issues. For decades it was heavily dependent on the defense and aerospace industries, and on sun-and-surf tourism, but in recent years it has added a balancing and economically stabilizing mix of entertainment and communications industries, along with numerous ventures related to trade around the Pacific Rim.
Mr. Kuykendall, more moderate than many California Republicans because of the moderate tilt of the 36th, won the seat two years ago by just two percentage points, all but guaranteeing he would face a strong challenge this year. Ms. Harman, also a moderate, held the seat for three terms from 1992 to 1998, giving it up in 1998 to run for governor, unsuccessfully.
National Democratic leaders pressed hard to get her to jump back into the fray this year. She says she agreed because, in her view, Mr. Kuykendall has been little more than a status-quo legislator and is too wedded to Republican plans for huge tax cuts and privatization of some of the investment aspects of Social Security and some of the prescription drug provisions in Medicare.
"The role of a member of Congress is to be a leader," she declared a few days ago in the campaign's first debate. "Steve Kuykendall and I stand in very different places."
Mr. Kuykendall readily agreed with the latter point, asserting that little happened on Capitol Hill to help the residents of the 36th "in the six years that Jane Harman was in Congress."
He contends she is too liberal for the district and out of touch with its residents.
"She's a big-government person and she's out of touch because she's never really bothered to get down on the ground and work the district," he said the other day. "The people of this district have needs, and they want answers to them, reasonable answers like good health care and good jobs and fair taxes. But they are not big-government people."
Each candidate has raised well over $1 million in campaign money. Both say they easily could spend more than $2 million each, about double what House candidates usually spend in California. Certainly spending $2 million would be no great challenge for Ms. Harman, since there is great wealth in her family and she did not hesitate to dip deeply into it in her losing run for governor -- a run in which she failed to carry the 36th District, Mr. Kuykendall likes to point out.
Considerable outside money also is being spent on the race by special interest groups and by campaign committees of the national political parties, and national party figures have been visiting to help the candidates raise even more money. If the contest stays close, along with the overall race for control of the House, still more outside money and visitors almost certainly will flow in.
The Los Angeles-area television market is one of the country's most costly, so neither Mr. Kuykendall nor Ms. Harman has started to run television advertisements, preferring to husband money for blitzes in the final weeks. But the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Natural Resources Defense Council and the state and national Democratic and Republican parties have been running commercials.
One of the hardest hitting is a labor federation advertisement contending that Mr. Kuykendall "voted against guaranteeing seniors prescription medicine under Medicare and backed a private insurance plan that will leave millions without coverage." Mr. Kuykendall says that the advertisement is "completely off-base" and that he has a solid history of supporting comprehensive medical care programs for older people.
Neither Vice President Al Gore nor Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has campaigned recently in the district, but Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, caused a splash when he showed up to help Ms. Harman, as did Senator John McCain of Arizona when he came in to help Mr. Kuykendall. In fact, Mr. McCain is due for a return visit in the final days of the campaign.
"What happens here will have great bearing on whether the Republicans maintain control of the majority in the House," he said in his first visit. "A lot is at stake here."
In March, when Mr. Kuykendall and Ms. Harman ran in the state's open primary, he got 42 percent of the vote and she got 41 percent. No independent polls have since been conducted in the district, but each candidate is polling and each says the race remains too close to call.
Mr. Kuykendall says that the polls he has conducted have all shown him and Ms. Harman "running about even, sometimes with me up a couple of points, sometime with her up by a couple." Ms. Harman says her polls have all shown the race "essentially a tie when you factor the possible sampling error."
Nonpartisan political analysts consider the contest a tossup, too.
"The slightest political breeze over the next month could nudge either candidate to victory," said Amy Walter, who follows House contests for the Cook Political Report. "Both sides will be pouring in the television and the mass mailings and working the streets, such as you can work streets in California. If Bush eventually pulls out of the presidential competition in the state to concentrate his efforts elsewhere, that just might give Harman the edge she needs. But then again, suppose Bush hangs in?"

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ECONOMY;
Roots of Prosperity Reach Past Clinton Years

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Any claim that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have to credit for the country's long run of prosperity dates to the evening of Aug. 6, 1993. That was when Mr. Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on the administration's plan to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes and restraining spending, a move fraught with political as well as economic risks.
Republicans, not one of whom voted for it, predicted that the legislation would choke what had been a fragile recovery from the 1990-91 recession. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore asserted that it would unlock the economy's potential by easing the pressure on interest rates, and they say history has proved them correct. 
 "Twenty-two million new jobs and the greatest prosperity ever," Mr. Gore said in touting the outcome in his debate with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday night.
Even critics of the administration acknowledge that the 1993 budget plan did not have the dire effects Republicans had warned of, and there is a widespread consensus that it helped support the wave of business investment that has characterized the economy in recent years.
But many economists say it is a considerable stretch to suggest, as Mr. Gore often does, that the powerful expansion of the 1990's was born with the passage of that plan.
For one thing, they say, other policy decisions played a role in straightening out the government's finances. Among them were a deficit-reduction bill signed by President George Bush in 1990 and a deal between Mr. Clinton and the Republican Congress in 1997 that cut capital gains taxes while further restricting spending.
Moreover, economists and business executives say, much of what happened to the economy in the 1990's had little to do with Washington and was part of a process that began before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore took office.
At the same time that the administration was setting out to address the fiscal mess, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to hold interest rates at rock-bottom levels throughout 1992 and 1993 was giving the economy a kick as it emerged haltingly from the recession that ended in March 1991.
In the private sector, companies were starting to see the benefits of painful steps to make themselves more competitive at home and abroad, including plant closings and layoffs of previously secure middle managers.
And perhaps most important, years of technological progress were beginning to click into place in a way that promised tremendous benefits, most notably through a pickup in productivity, the basic measure of efficiency and the best predictor of long-term economic potential.
By acting as a brake on inflation, the surge in productivity allowed the Fed more flexibility in holding down interest rates in the mid- and late-1990's, and helped generate profits and wealth that in turn created huge new tax revenues for the government and turned budget deficits into surpluses.
"Clinton came in at a time when technological innovation was at a sweet spot," said William C. Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm. "He's gotten the benefits of technical innovation that other presidents didn't benefit from. But he didn't do anything to squelch it, and undertook policies to encourage not squelching it."
Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the economy's recovery in the early years of the administration was mostly driven by the Fed's low interest rates, and that the economic strength in the second half of the 1990's primarily came from investments by business in technology.
"The Clinton administration merits credit for some early deficit reduction and for letting the Federal Reserve have its independence, and that's it," Mr. Jasinowski said. "The amount of credit the administration gets is a bronze medal behind the Federal Reserve and the private sector's expansion of productivity."
When it comes to the economy, the administration often points to its success in opening foreign markets to trade and in helping low-income workers through increases in the minimum wage and an expansion of the tax credit for the working poor. But inside the White House, the 1993 budget plan is seen as the single most crucial turning point.
At the urging of Mr. Gore, as well as advisers like Robert E. Rubin, then chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, and outsiders like Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, Mr. Clinton decided as he took office in 1993 that the economy was being held back largely by the dead weight of the budget deficit, which at that time was projected to grow inexorably.
The administration's 1993 proposal to raise taxes infuriated Republicans, and its plan to restrict spending frustrated Mr. Clinton, who had pledged to increase spending in areas like education. But the administration was betting that there would be an economic payoff in that narrowing the deficit would reduce the government's borrowing needs and would therefore increase the pool of capital available for private investment.
More capital means downward pressure on interest rates. Lower rates would make it more affordable for companies to expand and modernize, and for consumers to buy houses and cars.
There was considerable debate among economists and on Wall Street about whether the strategy would work. In the end, administration officials say, things unfolded just as they had predicted.
As Mr. Gore put it on Tuesday night, the ingenuity of the American people should get credit for the strong economy, but the American people also had plenty of ingenuity eight years ago when the economy was in the doldrums and the deficit was out of control.
"The difference is we've got a new policy," Mr. Gore said in the debate. At times he has been even more explicit about claiming the credit. "I voted and we won and then we've had an economic recovery since then," he said in a speech on the economy late last year.
But while the administration tends to credit the improving fiscal situation with igniting the technology and productivity revolution, many economists and business executives think it was the other way around.
Indeed, there were already powerful forces reshaping the economy before the deficit reduction plan passed.
Five months before Mr. Gore's tie-breaking vote in the Senate that August, engineers at the Intel Corporation in Silicon Valley had introduced their new Pentium chip.
The Pentium was the latest in a string of advances in semiconductor technology and software throughout Silicon Valley that within a few years would help bring the Internet to every desktop while driving computing power up and computer prices down.
And even as the Pentium was being introduced, engineers at Intel, under intense competitive pressure from equally fast and innovative rivals, were halfway through development of a successor that would cram 75 percent more transistors onto a chip and run three times as fast.
"That's when everything really came together," said Albert Yu, a senior vice president at Intel, describing the atmosphere of rapid-fire progress in the technology business in 1993.
Dana G. Mead, who through most of the decade held the No. 1 or No. 2 jobs at Tenneco, a sprawling conglomerate, said that by 1993 his company and others were seeing the combined effects of more aggressive management efforts to cut costs and years of investment in automation and information technology.
"In the early 1990's, after a decade of this investment, we were finally beginning to see real improvement," Mr. Mead said.
So convinced was Mr. Mead that businesses were operating in a fundamentally more efficient way that he took his message directly to Mr. Greenspan at the Fed in 1995. If the Fed could be convinced that corporate America was better at absorbing costs and producing more for less, Mr. Mead said, then perhaps the Fed would not be so quick to raise interest rates when economic growth picked up.
Unbeknownst to Mr. Mead, Mr. Greenspan was already thinking along the same lines. In early 1994, even as the Fed enacted the first in a yearlong series of rate increases, Mr. Greenspan told a closed meeting of the Fed's top policy makers that "something different" was going on.
Long before other analysts noticed anything, Mr. Greenspan raised the possibility of an extraordinary pickup in the growth rate of productivity, which had mysteriously tapered off in the early 1970's and to that point had shown no clear signs of revival, according to transcripts of the meeting made public this year.
Over the next five years, as the Fed chairman became increasingly convinced he was correct, it led him to allow far higher levels of growth in the economy than traditional economic theory held was prudent.
But while Mr. Greenspan had helped convince Mr. Clinton that there would be an economic payoff for deficit reduction, the Fed chairman has always stopped well short of suggesting that there was a direct link between the upturn in productivity and the 1993 budget plan.
Mr. Greenspan takes a much longer view. He often traces today's prosperity to the development of the transistor after World War II, and a whole series of technological advances since then that converged in the 1990's to supercharge the economy in a way that has happened periodically but infrequently throughout history.

As the federal budget has gone from deficits to surpluses in the 1990's, one factor has been strong gains in productivity, which have acted as a brake on inflation. The gains have given the Federal Reserve Board leeway to hold down interest rates, which in turn has helped helped generate the profits and wealth that bring increased tax revenues into government coffers.

HEADLINE: A Skid Row's Time Drifts Away

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
As if dipped in amber, the old hotels seem frozen in time. Inside, the mostly elderly men seem from another time, as well. Some of them planned to flop down for a few nights and stayed for 50 or 60 years.
Walk up a steep, narrow flight of stairs in one hotel, the Andrew's, at 197 Bowery. Look into its dim lobby. It is like a yellowing photograph. Smoke hangs in the dank air. The cigar-stained walls are a smudgy green. Wooden chairs are lined in neat rows across the patterned-tile floor. Grizzled denizens peer out dirty windows onto the wide street and wonder where the years went. Time seems to operate oddly there. 
 The men inhabit a world in Lower Manhattan that is fading fast, but that has been captured in a new book celebrated at a reading at the Bowery Mission the other night. Their homes are in flophouses with names like the Sunshine, the Providence and the Prince, indistinguishable amid the metamorphosing mile-long stretch of the Bowery that was once the nation's most infamous skid row.
Poetry and dignity can be found in just about every corner if the search is hard enough. The stories of the men in the flophouses are chronicled in a new book, "Flophouse: Life on the Bowery," (Random House), by two documentary producers, David Isay and Stacy Abramson, and a photographer, Harvey Wang.
The authors say that eight flophouses, officially known as lodging houses, that cost from $4.50 to $15 a night remain on the Bowery. Fewer than a thousand people stay in them.
But before World War II, tens of thousands of men slept in the nearly 100 flophouses that lined the Bowery. The cubicles in which they lived were 4 by 6 feet and 7 feet high, smaller than prison cells, with no toilets or kitchens. The walls between the cubicles extended only part way to the ceiling, so each cubicle was topped with chicken wire to thwart residents called lush divers from jumping from one room to another and robbing a possibly passed-out neighbor.
With the end of World War II, the authors wrote, the flophouses began to empty as returning veterans were greeted by the G.I. Bill and other new programs that left fewer of them homeless. A change in the city's housing code in 1955 also outlawed the construction of such cubicles.
Whether the decline of the flophouses is good or bad, or simply just a change, is not a debate taken up by the authors.
"We don't have a social agenda to suggest that they shouldn't exist or should," Mr. Isay said at the reading. " It's more of a document, a record, a social history."
The book began as a radio documentary that was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1998 about one flophouse, the Sunshine Hotel. For the book, the authors interviewed 50 men who stay in four flophouses on the Bowery.
The authors say that each flophouse is like a self-contained society, with its own distinctive character, clientele and internal economy. Most of the residents are permanent, and some of them, for example, pay fellow residents to perform small tasks.
The atmosphere at the Sunshine might be described as carnivalesque. Bruce Davis, 51, can be found in the lobby, seated in the lotus position, airing his views on a multitude of subjects. Mr. Davis runs as many as 35 errands a day for other residents, such as trying to buy hard liquor on a Sunday.
He recalled what led to his move into the Sunshine about 10 years ago. "I didn't want to have nothing to do with nobody," he said in a soft Tennessee accent.
Mr. Davis said of the place, "It wasn't what I wanted, but I had my troubles."
That afternoon, the hotel's manager, Nathan Smith, was preparing to visit a resident, a former heroin user, who was in the hospital waiting to undergo a leg amputation. A sign on a wall in the hotel lobby said that the resident welcomed visitors, "especially those who owe him money."
The hotel and other flophouses are a haven for loners and men who want to drop out of life, the authors said. Mr. Smith said that many residents at the Sunshine had emotional disorders, and that the hotel is used as a dumping ground by psychiatric hospitals.
Not far down the street stands the White House Hotel. According to the authors, the hotel was said to have earned its name because it accepted only whites for most of its history. The flophouses, which opened around the turn of the last century, were at one time almost entirely populated by white men. Now, the White House and the Sunshine are the most diverse in race and age.
A business card from the White House, a four-story hotel that opened in 1917, indicates just how much the skid-row Bowery has changed. The card states that the hotel is geared toward students and backpackers, and on a recent afternoon, a few women, including one with a backpack, were staying there.
The Andrew's Hotel, though, remains the most timeless of all. It is home to old-timers like John Knudsen, 82, who said he moved there in 1941. Mr. Knudsen recalled how he used to wait at the window, and would leap to his feet when he saw the truck picking up day laborers pull up. "People didn't hang around back then," he explained. "Everyone had a job."
He is resigned to spending the rest of his days at the Andrew's, looking out the window."What are you going to do? There's no place to go," Mr. Knudsen said, working a lighted Marlboro between his fingers.
Mike Gatto, the 80-year-old owner and manager of the Andrew's, said he doubted that the hotel would survive after he retired. He said there was no future in the business. In any event, he said, flophouse residents have plenty of places to go -- public housing, hospitals and cemeteries.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN 2000: NEW JERSEY;
In New Jersey Senate Debate, Compliments Seasoned With Scorn

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Oct. 8

 BODY:
Representative Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine jabbed at each other for nearly a full hour today in their first debate of the United States Senate campaign in New Jersey, attacking each other's records, campaign tactics and stands on issues like health care, the environment and gun control.
The first public side-by-side confrontation between the two men, who are members of the same church, was a well-mannered slugfest. There was no talk of character or trust, and each man paid the other a compliment or two before deflating him with scorn or sarcasm. 
 Mr. Franks, who is trailing in the most recent polls by as much as 14 percentage points, took every opportunity to paint Mr. Corzine as a spendthrift liberal whose ambitious social programs would drive the nation into deficits, and said Mr. Corzine was contributing to public cynicism by refusing to release his tax returns.
At the same time, Mr. Franks, a four-term Republican congressman who was all but unknown to most New Jerseyans before Mr. Corzine started vilifying him in campaign commercials two weeks ago, sought to portray himself as a common-sense, experienced defender of New Jersey's interests in Washington.
"Everybody in America knows you've got the most liberal agenda of anyone running anywhere in the country today," Mr. Franks said at one point, describing Mr. Corzine's support for universal health insurance, long-term care for the elderly and the disabled, and free preschool and college tuition. "There's only 100 cents in every dollar. I think you would've appreciated that from Wall Street. But I've had to make the tough decisions to finally balance the federal budget."
Mr. Franks, a career politician, bitingly referred to some of Mr. Corzine's statements as "silly" or "unbelievable." But Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, showed he had improved greatly since the Democratic primary debates, when he frequently appeared nervous and inarticulate.
Today, though he remained hard to follow at times, he seemed more relaxed and countered a number of Mr. Franks's barbs with his own critiques of Mr. Franks's tactics and voting record. He said, for example, that Mr. Franks was long on talk about saving the environment but short on money for conservation initiatives.
At another point, Mr. Corzine said his proposal for free tuition at state colleges for students with at least a B average would cost $2.2 billion a year, but that Mr. Franks was claiming the price would be $58 billion. "Sometimes I think that's one of the reasons that people are cynical about political debate," Mr. Corzine said.
The debate, held at the studios of News 12 New Jersey, a cable station, was carried live on that station and a second local cable channel, as well as nationally on C-SPAN. Mr. Franks and Mr. Corzine, each in a dark suit and white shirt, sat in red leather armchairs before a black curtain. The audience of about 30 people included three prominent Democrats -- Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, whom the two candidates are hoping to succeed, and Senator Robert G. Torricelli, with Representative Robert Menendez separating them -- but none of the state's most prominent Republicans.
It was a quick-paced encounter, with no opening statements, and the candidates' differences were starkly drawn right from the start.
In the only question on foreign policy, the two men were asked if they agreed with the United States's abstention from a Security Council vote on Saturday condemning what a resolution called Israel's "excessive use of force" in clashes with Palestinians over the last two weeks.
Mr. Corzine, who says on his campaign Web site that the United States must "veto, whenever possible, anti-Israel resolutions," nonetheless said he approved of the abstention, without explaining why.
Mr. Franks called the vote "a mistake." He added, "When the rest of the world gangs up on Israel, we have no choice but to veto that type of anti-Israel resolution."
The two men also differed dramatically on social issues like gun control. Mr. Franks said he supported an assault weapons ban, trigger locks, and stiffer penalties for gun crimes, but opposed Mr. Corzine's call for mandatory gun licensing and registration. Mr. Corzine complimented Mr. Franks for the measures he supported, but said that as a state lawmaker, Mr. Franks had tried to "strip down" a 1990 assault weapons ban, and that the 1994 ban Mr. Franks voted for in Congress "allows people to own Uzis." He added, "I don't think that's real gun control."
On abortion rights, both men said they supported the Roe v. Wade decision, which recognized a woman's right to choose an abortion. But Mr. Franks said he favored requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions and banning the late-term procedure referred to by critics as partial-birth abortion, which he called "a form of infanticide."
Mr. Corzine, who supports no such restrictions, answered a hypothetical question by saying that if he had a pregnant 14-year-old daughter contemplating an abortion, "Our family would have been open and we would have related to each other enough that we would have that kind of discussion." But he added that for girls with abusive parents, "It is dangerous to try to put frameworks around this that might end up harming the health and life of a child."
Much of the debate focused on government spending for social programs, and quickly fell into a pattern in which Mr. Franks attacked, and Mr. Corzine defended his more ambitious proposals. On health care, Mr. Franks likened Mr. Corzine's ideas to Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed 1993 effort at a national health insurance system. He faulted Mr. Corzine for favoring a requirement that employers pay to insure their workers, using a favorite line, "To me there's only one thing more unfortunate than an employee without health care insurance, and that's an employee without a job."
But Mr. Corzine responded, "The idea that this is going to cause unemployment is about like saying that raising the minimum wage in 1996 is going to throw us into a recession." He added that Mr. Franks's more modest approach, to make health insurance premiums 100 percent tax deductible for the self-employed and for employees of small businesses, would do little to help low-income workers "who may not even be paying taxes."
Mr. Corzine was the aggressor, however, when the men clashed over environmental issues. Mr. Corzine, who was endorsed by two prominent environmental advocacy groups, criticized Mr. Franks for supporting a 1995 bill dubbed by its opponents the "dirty water act," which died in the Senate but which would have removed federal protection from 80 percent of the nation's wetlands. "It was a serious denigration of our environmental laws," he said.
Mr. Franks conceded the 1995 bill was "not an ideal piece of legislation," but defended his environmental record and said he had been leading efforts to ban the gasoline additive MTBE to protect ground water. Mr. Franks attacked Mr. Corzine for failing to "even bother to vote" in a 1998 New Jersey bond referendum to preserve land. "Your commitment to preserving New Jersey's open space is laudable," he said, "but maybe we should vote some more."
Mr. Franks was most dismissive of his opponent when he accused Mr. Corzine of backpedaling since the Democratic primary; he said that Mr. Corzine had stopped calling for "universal health insurance," and now speaks of "universal access" to health care. "I was really looking forward to seeing which Jon Corzine would show up for today's debate," he said. "Only now, when I guess his handlers have described to him just how expensive that would be, he's regrouped."
Mr. Franks repeatedly attacked Mr. Corzine for refusing to disclose his tax returns, and for at first refusing to disclose his charitable donations. When Mr. Corzine revealed those gifts last month, it turned out he had given more than $100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him.
"You know, Jon says he'll take his personal wealth and put it in a blind trust after the election," Mr. Franks said. "He won't tell us where the conflicts of interest may lie. He says, 'Elect me, then I'll do the right thing.' "
But when Mr. Franks tried to corner Mr. Corzine on his finances, he was sidetracked by the moderator, Tom Moran of The Star-Ledger.
Mr. Franks began by telling Mr. Corzine that "the idea that you're trying to buy a seat in the United States Senate" was "the lens through which the people of New Jersey are looking at this contest."
"I wish in order to tell people where all this money is coming from, that today you'd tell us that you're going to disclose finally your complete and unabridged income tax returns for the last 10 years," Mr. Franks said.
Mr. Moran interrupted before Mr. Corzine could respond, asking Mr. Franks what, if anything, he expected to find in Mr. Corzine's tax returns. Mr. Franks refused to say.
"This is a threshold issue," Mr. Franks said. "Do you believe in full, unabridged public disclosure, or are you going to try to hide it?"
Mr. Corzine said again that he was prevented from releasing his returns by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN YUGOSLAVIA: THE FIRST DAY;
KOSTUNICA SEEKING POLITICAL BALANCE TO SOLIDIFY POWER

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica, struggled today, his first in office, to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era.
Mr. Kostunica is president, but some in the 18-party coalition that backed him are afraid that his concern for legal niceties may prove costly in the uneasy vacuum of power that has followed Slobodan Milosevic's ouster. 
 Already, there have been serious behind-the-scenes struggles for control of the police, the courts, the banking system and customs authorities.
Mr. Kostunica's coalition has formed a "crisis committee" that is a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities who were beholden to Mr. Milosevic. They are moving through institutions one by one, trying to ensure support for a new democratic authority.
"We are against revolutionary transformation, but there are always people for revolutionary change," said Dragor Hiber, a member of the crisis committee.
Veran Matic, the president of ANEM, the Association of Independent Electronic Media, said the greatest danger to Mr. Kostunica "is the question of the unity of the democratic opposition."
Mr. Kostunica's problems range from the enormous to the bizarre. One of the most bizarre concerns the visit on Tuesday of the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine. Mr. Vedrine, along with President Clinton -- who called Mr. Kostunica today -- and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, were convicted in absentia of war crimes in a pre-election propaganda exercise here. Formally, Mr. Vedrine and the others face arrest and 20 years in jail, and their photographs are up on wanted posters in police stations and at the airport.
Kostunica officials are afraid that the police may embarrass Mr. Vedrine at the airport. Mr. Kostunica can sign an amnesty, but that is considered politically awkward here. The public prosecutor can void the conviction, but the process is clumsy. So the officials are working, quietly, on the police not to act.
Mr. Clinton spoke to Mr. Kostunica this evening for five minutes to congratulate him. Mr. Kostunica has been reluctant to have William Montgomery, the ambassador who has been running the "Yugoslav embassy in exile" in Budapest, to be appointed the American ambassador in Belgrade when relations are restored. Mr. Montgomery's office in Budapest helped to run and fund the anti-Milosevic campaign, which Mr. Kostunica regarded as overt meddling in Serbia's affairs.
But Mr. Kostunica would go along with the appointment, his aides say, if all sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted, including the so-called outer wall, which blocks Yugoslav access to international financial institutions -- and thus to crucial loans and credits.
Control of the police is a significant issue. The police did not in any serious way oppose the mass protest last Thursday that led to the burning of the federal Parliament, helped along by some prior agreements made with the opposition.
In today's issue of the daily Politika, Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, the backbone of the opposition, said the police "had reorganized, stabilized and realized what the interest of the people is, and the police have become practically immune to orders that could bring them into conflict with the people."
But knowledgeable officials say former police and security officials with connections to Mr. Djindjic attempted to take provisional control of Belgrade police headquarters on Friday morning and again this morning, telling the chief of police, Gen. Branko Djuric, to hand over his authority and his firearm. General Djuric called other opposition officials, with whom he had promised cooperation, and said he would shoot himself first. He asked for protection and someone to guard him at night. The situation has continued, but with the intervention this morning of Mr. Kostunica himself, it appears to have been calmed, officials said.
Mr. Milosevic's head of state security, Rade Markovic, is also said to have contacted Mr. Kostunica's aides complaining about death threats from former security officers, and has discussed resigning. Mr. Kostunica met privately today with top security officials.
On Friday, at the lucrative Customs Department, a close Milosevic ally, Mihalj Kertes, was pressured by armed men working for the opposition to leave office. Weapons were reportedly found in Mr. Kertes' office. To the surprise of Mr. Kostunica and some of his allies, a businessman named Dusan Zabunovic, who is considered close to Mr. Djindjic and owns an import company called M.P.S., was appointed head of customs. The selection caused such an uproar among the opposition leaders themselves that it was rescinded the same day.
There was another drama at the courts, with senior Milosevic judges like Milena Arezina, chief judge of the Serbian trade court, ordering the destruction of documents relating to sensitive cases, like the government takeover of the I.C.N. pharmaceutical company owned by Milan Panic, a Serb-American, and the cases against ABC Produkt, a publisher that owns an independent daily newspaper, Glas Javnosti.
People working in the judiciary called opposition officials to warn them of the destruction of the files, some of which was stopped. There was a similar incident at the Foreign Ministry, though of lesser importance.
Indicative of the problems was the drama on Saturday at the main state bank that clears payments between businesses, an organization known as the Zavod za Obracun Placanja, or Zop. The crisis committee was told that Milosevic officials were transferring large sums of money to private companies to pay for pre-election government purchases of cooking oil and sugar.
The company that created the bank's electronic data system agreed to crash the computers to stop the transactions, but allow for the payment of important benefits like pensions. The crisis committee then appointed Zivko Nesic, general manager of the bank until fired in 1998, to manage it.
Mr. Kostunica and his allies are also trying to assert control over the Serbian government and Parliament, which did not go through new elections. It has been dominated by Mr. Milosevic's coalition, which was allied with the Serbian Radical Party. If, however, the Radicals realign themselves with the Serbian Renewal Movement, another party that was sometimes in opposition and sometimes allied with Mr. Milosevic, they could bring down the current government. Both those parties fear that new elections, which Mr. Kostunica wants in both the federal and Serbian parliaments within the next 90 days, will devastate them.
Mr. Kostunica is trying to convince the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, a wavering Milosevic ally who was also indicted by the war crimes tribunal, to dissolve the Serbian Parliament on the grounds that new elections are required to restore political stability. Mr. Milutinovic, not known for bravery, is being told that now is the time to move or face charges.
If he does not help, and the two other parties do not play along, Mr. Kostunica and his allies are prepared to call for tens of thousands of citizens to rally in front of the Parliament, a form of threat.

HEADLINE: Young Blacks Turn To School Vouchers As Civil Rights Issue

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
When Cory A. Booker talks about fixing America's school system, he invokes the words of Malcolm X: by any means necessary.
To Mr. Booker, 31, an African-American Democrat elected to the Newark City Council in 1998, that means lobbying state lawmakers for smaller classes and teacher testing. It means organizing book drives for the schools in his impoverished neighborhood, and arranging for an insurance company to create a community health clinic at one of them. 
 And it also means the unbridled backing of the contentious notion of giving parents vouchers financed by taxpayers to send their children to private schools.
"It's one of the last remaining major barriers to equality of opportunity in America, the fact that we have inequality of education," Mr. Booker explained. "I don't necessarily want to depend on the government to educate my children -- they haven't done a good job in doing that. Only if we return power to the parents can we find a way to fix the system."
Mr. Booker, a Rhodes scholar who quotes Frederick Douglass and Langston Hughes in his speeches, is part of a growing cadre of young blacks who have embraced vouchers, and school choice more broadly, as a central civil rights issue for their generation.
While established African-American organizations have been among the leaders of the opposition to school vouchers, arguing that they would decimate the public school system, maverick black politicians and community organizers are increasingly the public face of the pro-voucher movement financed largely by white Republican businessmen.
Polls show strong support for vouchers among African-Americans. A new national organization, the Black Alliance for Educational Options, started a pro-voucher campaign this fall. And in California and Michigan, where voters will consider voucher initiatives in November, prominent African-Americans have popped up on both sides of the ballot.
"The old civil rights movement got us to the lunch counter," said Mikel Holt, the author of a new book, "Not Yet 'Free at Last' " (Institute for Contemporary Studies), which defines "the unfinished business of the civil rights movement" as the struggle for school choice. "The new civil rights agenda," he said, "is, can we afford to buy the lunch? And, more importantly, can our kids read the menu?"
Omar Wasow, 29, the executive director of blackplanet.com, a Web site for African-Americans, said he sees school choice as a direct outgrowth of Brown v. the Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that desegregated public schools.
The goal then, as now, was to give poor black children access to the same quality education as their better-off white counterparts, Mr. Wasow said; only the methods have changed. Where his civil rights forebears focused on ending legal discrimination and turned to the government for protection, Mr. Wasow sees the enemy in subtler racism and believes the savior resides in the private sector. Vouchers are his voter registration.
"The black freedom struggle has fundamentally been about trying to produce a society where black individuals have as much freedom and agency as white Americans," said Mr. Wasow, whose parents met in a 1960's program to mentor inner-city youth. "As long as black people are trapped in failing public schools, we will never achieve the kind of dignity and power that has been the central cause of the black freedom struggle for more than 200 years."
Vouchers, first proffered by the economist Milton Friedman in a 1955 essay, are among the most divisive issues in education, a critical point of dissension between this year's two major presidential candidates. Vice President Al Gore, who has been endorsed by the teachers unions, shares their adamant opposition to vouchers of any kind. Gov. George W. Bush has proposed allowing parents of children in failing schools to take $1,500 in federal money and use it for any education purpose, including private-school tuition, but has avoided the word voucher.
Only about 12,000 of the nation's 52 million schoolchildren -- in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Pensacola, Fla. -- use public money to attend private schools, but the idea is growing in popularity and is on the legislative agenda in many states.
Advocates contend that only market pressure will force the radical changes they believe are necessary to improve student achievement, particularly in poor urban communities, and that parents deserve the right to choose a school for their children. Opponents contend that, when used in religious schools, vouchers muddy the line between church and state, and that any loss of financing would further weaken the struggling public schools left behind. Evidence has been mixed as to whether vouchers have any effect on children's learning.
Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, called education the civil rights crucible for the 21st century but said that vouchers were the wrong tool.
Voucher proponents offer false promise to poor parents because there are too few private-school slots to accommodate them, Mr. Henderson said, and most voucher proposals fall short of covering the entire cost of top academies, leaving truly disadvantaged families without a full range of choices. Mr. Henderson also questioned the integrity of pro-voucher politicians who claim concern over failing schools but have long fought efforts to improve school buildings, reduce class sizes and raise teacher salaries. And he worried that blacks were being exploited by free-market ideologues whose interest in inner-city children was mostly strategic.
"Many of the interests that are suggesting privatization of public resources and vouchers are the very forces that have helped to thwart the kind of meaningful education that Brown promised," Mr. Henderson said, referring to the landmark court decision. "Quality education can best be provided with high-quality public institutions. We're committed to their establishment, restoration, revitalization."
Terence Baine, the education chairman for the Newark chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accompanied Mr. Booker and about 30 other legislators and community leaders on a recent fact-finding mission to Milwaukee, home of the nation's oldest and largest voucher program. But after hours of pro-voucher cheerleading, Mr. Baine remained unconvinced: would private schools accept disabled students and others who are hard to teach? Why not focus on bringing innovation and accountability to public schools?
"I just believe you can't have a financial incentive in public education -- it's scary," said Mr. Baine, 37. "It's really like a way of government walking away, giving up. Disgusting."
African-Americans on the other side insist that they, too, want to improve public schools -- but say they cannot wait.
Howard Fuller, who served as Milwaukee's school superintendent after helping create the city's voucher program in 1990, says his goal is simply to level the playing field. White, middle-class families escape failing schools by moving to better neighborhoods or opting for private schools, he noted, while poor, minority families are stuck.
"People with money in America today have choices," Mr. Fuller, a veteran of the Black Power movement, told the New Jersey group at a Catholic high school in Milwaukee last month.
"Our argument back then was power to the people," he added. "You tell me how you empower people in America if you don't ever give them control over the money."
Because of their focus on equality of opportunity -- as opposed to free-market philosophy -- Mr. Fuller, Mr. Booker and many other African-Americans oppose universal voucher programs, like the one on the ballot in California, which would give all the state's students $4,000 vouchers to attend their school of choice. They prefer programs like Milwaukee's, which targets low-income families, or the proposal in Michigan, which focuses on schools with dismal dropout rates.
Powered in recent years by philanthropic financiers, the voucher movement has a growing grass-roots component of low-income parents in large cities.
A 1999 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 60 percent of African-Americans favored vouchers -- compared with 53 percent of the overall population -- and support swells to 72 percent among blacks earning less than $15,000 a year.
To help change the face of the movement, Mr. Fuller formed the Black Alliance for Educational Options. Board members include a Colorado businessman who was ousted as president of his local N.A.A.C.P. chapter for writing a pro-voucher article; a minister who is co-chairman of the Michigan initiative; Ohio's Secretary of State, J. Kenneth Blackwell; and Dwight Evans, a Democratic state legislator from Philadelphia. There are also several young professionals involved in charter schools and online education ventures.
"My generation must harness the power to guide our children out of mental slavery, by any means necessary," Amber Blackwell, a 29-year-old mother of two who is on the Black Alliance board and plans to open a new school in Oakland, said in an e-mail interview. "Our liberation looks different in 2000 than it did in the late 60's and 70's. We are fighting for the last chains to be taken from our minds."
To that end, Mr. Booker's schedule in recent weeks has been filled with voucher events. He was featured at a lunch for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, where his table at the Harvard Club was filled with businessmen; he debated an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Grand Rapids, Mich., who marveled that Mr. Booker gets good ratings from her organization on all other issues; and he led the New Jersey mission to Milwaukee, where he tossed a football with children at a public elementary school and visited a Catholic school and a school dedicated to high technology, both of which have benefited from vouchers.
At the Harvard Club, in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Booker told a story of tutoring in East Palo Alto while an undergraduate at Stanford University, and asking the children to stretch their hands as high as they could -- then stretch three inches more. When Mr. Booker offered $5 to the child who could reach the highest, a small boy, Robert, ran from the room. He was headed for the roof.
"The impossible is the least we can demand," Mr. Booker said, quoting James Baldwin. "Not just a three-inch change. We can find a way to get to the roof."

INTERNATIONAL A3-9
 
Clinton Seeks Meeting To Cap Mideast Violence
President Clinton asked the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to convene an urgent summit meeting where Mr. Clinton could meet the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, a senior administration official said. Mr. Mubarak did not immediately agree to a mid-week regional summit meeting in Egypt, but said he would discuss it with Yasir Arafat when the Palestinian leader arrived today in Cairo. A1 

High-level diplomatic intervention and military talks kept the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from growing into an even broader and bloodier confrontation, but leaders on both sides braced for a possible escalation of the fighting. A8
 
Hillel Lieberman, a distant cousin of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, was found slain near the West Bank town of Nablus. Mr. Lieberman, who had lived in Israel for 15 years, had been abducted by Palestinian rioters as he tried to defend a Jewish holy site, Israeli and American officials said. A8
 
Mr. Mubarak appealed for restraint by Arab nations as talks continued in an effort to develop a common Arab response to the crisis. Arab protests against Israel also continued. A9
 
Scandals Plague Argentina
Ten months after President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina took power, the economy remains in the doldrums and a federal judge is investigating whether cabinet members paid bribes to up to 11 senators. And with the resignation of Vice President Carlos Alvarez, above, Mr. de la Rua is scrambling to save his government. A4
 
Forging Democracy in Belgrade
President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia is struggling to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era. His coalition has formed a "crisis committee," a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities linked to Slobodan Milosevic. A1
 
Townspeople in Cacak, Serbia, gathered in the main square to celebrate. Residents of the town, one of the most determinedly anti-Milosevic places in Serbia, were core participants in the crowds that overran the federal Parliament last week. A6
 
NATIONAL A10-16
 
Administration Will Issue Rules on Patients' Rights
With legislation to define patients' rights languishing in Congress, Clinton administration officials say they will soon issue rules that establish many of the same protections for more than 130 million Americans with private health insurance. The rules will set new federal standards for the handling of claims under employee health benefit plans. A12
 
Spending Bills Pile Up
Congress is trying to cram a session of work, including the passage of nine spending bills to keep the government running, into four days beginning tomorrow. Republican Congressional leaders must negotiate with the White House on three spending bills laden with politically charged issues like abortion, gun control and education funding. A10
 
Gore Plans to Delegate Attacks
Vice President Al Gore's campaign is planning a multimedia offensive this week that assails Gov. George W. Bush over his record in Texas and his occasional slips of the tongue, Gore aides said. The strategy calls for Mr. Gore to delegate attacks so he can remain above the fray. A14
 
Many Blacks Back Vouchers
While established African-American organizations have opposed school vouchers, maverick black politicians and community organizers are increasingly the public face of the pro-voucher movement financed largely by white Republican businessmen. Polls show strong support for vouchers among African-Americans. A1
 
Evaluating the Guard
The last of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard returned home last week, eight months after they were called away to active duty. The 49th erased at least some of the doubts about the National Guard's role in military operations. But its experience also raised questions about how often the Pentagon can turn to part-time soldiers. A16
 
Endangered Species Cloned
Scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company say they have cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. It is expected to give birth to the gaur next month. The gaur, an oxlike creature, would be the first clone of an endangered species and also the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother. A16

Clinton and Lazio Agree On Mideast, but Little Else
In their second debate, New York's two main Senate candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, condemned the United States for abstaining on a United Nations resolution censuring Israel for the violence in the Middle East. But they offered opposing views on campaign financing, abortion, gasoline taxes, potential Supreme Court appointees and public financing for a proposed stadium in Manhattan. A1
 
Corzine and Franks Trade Jabs
Representative Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine jabbed at each other for nearly an hour in their first debate of the United States Senate campaign in New Jersey, attacking each other's records, campaign tactics and stands on issues like health care, the environment and gun control. B1

HEADLINE: A Path to Fairer Property Taxes, Where Politicians Fear to Tread

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Over the next few weeks, property assessors carrying digital cameras will fan out across Nassau County to begin the gargantuan task of updating the assessed values of about 416,000 parcels of real estate. It will be the county's first full revaluation in 62 years.
Revaluations are an essential responsibility of local government, and Nassau's reluctance over six decades has left its property tax system so off kilter that nearly everyone pays too much or too little. The county now spends about $100 million a year on refunds to taxpayers who challenge their bills. 
 While Nassau has delayed unusually long, and its foot-dragging is all the more visible because of its larger fiscal crisis, the county is not alone in failing to maintain fair taxes. In many communities across the New York region, the expectation of paying one's fair share, inherent in any tax system tied to property values, no longer exists.
In Westchester County, where real estate prices have shifted widely as the suburban population has boomed in recent decades, many towns have not revalued property in more than 40 years. Efforts in the last five years by the State Legislature to force a countywide revaluation have all failed.
In Newark, the last revaluation was in 1961. After a 28-year court fight, the State of New Jersey recently won permission to order a revaluation against the city's wishes.
And in Rockland County, N.Y., a threat of litigation over disparities in school taxes led officials in the county's five towns to agree to an exceedingly rare joint revaluation, which began last year.
Many experts say that to guarantee fairness, revaluations should be done every year. But of the three states in the New York region, only Connecticut explicitly mandates revaluations, requiring them every four years.
Local governments have had many reasons for putting off revaluation. The process has always been expensive and labor-intensive, requiring a small army of assessors to visit and inspect each property. And for most of the last century, major social changes -- like urban decay and the shift from an industrial to a service-based economy -- provided the argument that revaluation would hit homeowners too hard.
New technology -- including constantly updated databases of property sales, computerized maps and digital photographs -- has made revaluations much easier. And the relative economic and social stability of the last decade has meant that once the tax rolls are updated, there is far less chance of unpredictable changes in tax bills.
Still, there is rarely a rush to revalue. Taxpayers and politicians generally see nothing but peril in tinkering with property taxes. Taxpayers fear that no matter what happens, they will end up paying more, and elected officials worry that they will be blamed for any increases that occur.
Over time, almost inevitably, inequities develop as land values change and wealthier property owners pay less than their fair share while poorer owners pay more than theirs. Owners of homes worth similar amounts often have tax bills that differ by thousands of dollars.
In Nassau County, the disparity has also played out on racial and ethnic lines. In the predominantly white hamlet of Manhasset, assessments on average are 27 percent too low, according to a statistical analysis conducted last year by Newsday. In Roosevelt, which has a large black and Hispanic population, property was judged to be overassessed by about 16 percent. A lawsuit brought by minority residents forced Nassau into the revaluation that is about to begin.
Another hindrance in Nassau and elsewhere has been the hodgepodge of local and state laws and court rulings -- often antiquated and at times conflicting -- that regulate property taxes. Even these laws are often upended by the haphazard granting of exemptions and other discounts.
But the largest obstacle to property tax reform, experts say, is the fear among elected officials that they will be held responsible by voters whose tax bills increase. And those whose bills increase tend to be affluent or middle class, and thus more vocal and politically active.
Dick Netzer, a public policy professor at New York University, said politicians find safety in the status quo. "It's been like this for a long time -- nobody has been voted out of office because of it," he said in explaining their thinking. " 'If we change it, somebody is going to be hurt and maybe I will be voted out of office. So let's leave it.' "
In some places, the worries are reasonable. In tax districts that have seen an erosion of industrial and commercial property, like Newark, revaluation will shift the tax burden heavily onto middle-class homeowners. Homeowners say that amounts to a punishment for building a stable neighborhood.
New Jersey law requires property assessments based on full market value, which would seem to require annual revaluations. But that simply does not happen in many places, and the state's ability to enforce the law is limited. New York, which is widely regarded to have some of the most convoluted property tax systems in the country, has laws that are similarly difficult to enforce.
But Professor Netzer and other experts say the fearful thinking underscores just how little most people, even most elected officials, know about how property taxes work and what revaluations accomplish. Assessors say the resistance to revaluation proves another point: forget fairness -- every taxpayer wants to pay less than the next.
What makes revaluation complicated for many people is that it is not a straight raising or lowering of everyone's tax bill. The goal of a revaluation is not to change the total amount of taxes collected by the local government but to rebalance or equalize the tax burden in light of market changes.
Whether taxes go up or down depends on the budget drawn up by a local executive and legislature. Local finance officials determine how much revenue is needed from the property tax, and accordingly the tax rate -- a fixed amount per $1,000 of assessed value -- is raised or lowered in the annual budget.
What a revaluation changes is how much each property owner pays in relation to others. If every house in a town doubles in value, everybody's taxes stay the same. But if some values rise while others drop, those with increasing values will pay more tax, while those with reduced values will pay less.
Professional assessors say that in theory, everybody wins in a revaluation because the property tax system is made fair, contributing to the overall fiscal health and well-being of a community. Tax challenges are reduced. Local budget directors can make more accurate spending plans.
But it seems that no matter how many local assessors' offices distribute pamphlets trying to explain this very point, the prospect of a revaluation immediately sends property owners and the politicians who represent them into a frenzy. Who will win out, by paying lower taxes, and who will lose, by paying more?
This mind-set was certainly the case this month in East Meadow, on Long Island, when the Nassau County assessor, Charlie O'Shea, attended a meeting of the local Chamber of Commerce to discuss the impending revaluation. Before the meeting, Mr. O'Shea predicted a friendly crowd because East Meadow would get lower taxes.
"All reports here have shown that they will benefit from a reassessment," he said. At the meeting, questions from local business owners quickly focused on how they would be affected. Rather than stressing the equity of an update, Mr. O'Shea made clear that East Meadow would "make out."
Mr. O'Shea, a former state legislator, said he hoped to move to an annual cycle after Nassau's revaluation is completed in 2003. Recognizing the benefits, New York State now offers an incentive -- $5 in state aid per parcel of property -- to local governments that revalue annually. About 250 districts have expressed interest, said Thomas G. Griffen, executive director of the State Office of Real Property Services.
The incentive program requires the physical inspection and reappraisal of property at least every six years -- a practice that some assessors, including the New York State Assessors Association, say should be state law.
New York City now updates its property assessments annually by using a sampling of inspections and statistical estimates. The city has won praise for trying to stay up to date, but critics caution that estimates are no substitute for physical inspections.
Inspecting every property can be expensive, costing tens of millions of dollars in large tax districts. But computers and mass appraising techniques now make it possible to conduct fairly accurate revaluations without the cost of hiring inspectors.
Greenwich, Conn., an affluent town with a robust residential and commercial tax base, has a tradition of maintaining a low tax rate. Its current revaluation, using every available technological tool, demonstrates how a diligent local government can keep pace with even a fast-changing real estate market.
Among the tools Greenwich employs are computerized maps, with overlays showing wetlands and other areas that might affect property values; aerial photographs of the town that show construction changes not visible from the street; and a constantly updated database of property sales.
As part of a revaluation about to be completed, Greenwich is taking digital photographs of every residential and commercial property in town, making comparisons easier. And, where many municipalities would use a single assessing firm, Greenwich is using at least five, each with different specialties. One, for instance, is assigned to assess golf courses.
Still, the town assessor, Harriet S. Gotz, sees room for improvement. "Ideally, I would prefer to do every year," she said. "I would love to move toward having an annual revaluation."
Cathy L. Conklin, the chairwoman of the multitown task force overseeing the revaluation in Rockland County, said New York State could improve simply by passing a law that requires revaluations at some regular interval.
Inequities in school taxes, which make up a large portion of the property tax, seemed to develop in Rockland because towns with shared school districts had revalued at different times. Clarkstown, for example, last revalued in 1985, while the town of Ramapo had not revalued since the early 1970's.
"To have some sort of a cycle bill in place that essentially mandates that assessments have got to be at least in the same decade with each other would make sense," Ms. Conklin said.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN 2000: The New York Senate Debate;
Excerpts From Second Debate Between Mrs. Clinton and Lazio

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate between the New York senatorial candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, as recorded by The New York Times. The full text is available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com.
 
MARCIA KRAMER -- Good morning. I'm Marcia Kramer, political correspondent for WCBS-TV. Well, the stage is set, our candidates are here. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Rick Lazio. I'm joined by our panel of reporters who will be joining me in questioning the candidates. First, CNN senior political correspondent Jeff Greenfield; New York Daily News political columnist Lars-Erik Nelson; New York Times columnist Joyce Purnick; and representing The New York Post, political reporter Gregg Birnbaum. . . .
Mrs. Clinton, figures from the Independent Budget Office show that New York State lost over $200 million in federal aid after Chuck Schumer defeated Senator Al D'Amato and New York no longer had a senator in the majority party. Since the Senate is expected to stay in the Republican hands, how would you deliver for the State of New York as a junior senator from a minority party, and a person that the Republicans would clearly want to humiliate? 

HILLARY CLINTON -- Well, Marcia, first let me thank you for moderating this discussion, and I thank our panelists and the audience and mostly everyone who's watching at home. And I do want, Mr. Lazio, to put your mind at ease, in case you've been worrying. I won't be coming to your podium today.
But I will be addressing the issues that are important to New York. And one of the issues I've been talking about ever since I got into this race was how we could get more of New York's fair share. I think this is a problem that Senator Moynihan has put on the table and we need to really address it. We have a chance to do that because we now have a surplus. One of the biggest injustices is the Medicaid formula, and I've come forward with a plan that would get us more money in New York.
I believe that the objective of the Senate is to do the best job you can for the state you represent, which I intend to do for New York. And I look forward to working with Chuck Schumer, who has been a vigorous and effective advocate.
Now, the problem is that the Republicans have control of the Senate and the House. I hope that changes in this election. I think there's a good chance it will. But the Senate is dominated by people who don't necessarily agree with how we need to do things here in New York, and I would be a vigorous proponent of what we need and an opponent of what would hurt New York, and I would look forward to being a good partner with Chuck Schumer.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

RICK LAZIO -- I think this is incredibly important for New York. New York has had a history, up until this last election, of having one senator in each party of influence. I'm looking forward to working with Chuck Schumer in the Senate. I work with him in the House. I have been in the minority and the majority, and let me tell you, I know that in the majority -- it's the people in the majority who craft the bills, who write the language who are in the position to actually get the job done. Now, New York sends $15 billion a year more to Washington than we get back. I think we need somebody in the majority party who can work well with others, who can cross party lines, who can be independent, and who's got the ability to make sure that New York gets its fair share, and I think I'm that person.

KRAMER -- O.K., Mr. Lazio, our viewers wanted to know about your relationship with Newt Gingrich. Mr. Lazio, you were the deputy whip under Newt Gingrich at a time when government was actually shut down and you voted under the Contract With America to shut down the United States Department of Education. Are you proud of the work that you did, and do you think that the Gingrich policies were good for New York?

LAZIO -- Well, first of all, Marcia, I would say that's not accurate. What we did do is to try to send bills to the president, which the president vetoed. In fact, it was the work of people like me on the budget committee that got to the first balanced budget in a generation. The fact is, on education, for the last three years I voted for the highest levels of federal aid to education in our history, in part because we made the tough decisions back in 1994. Yes, we voted to balance the budget. Yes, we voted for welfare reform. It's had the result here in New York of sending hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers back into the work force, ending dependency. Yes, we voted for a strong national defense. I believed in those things then, I believe in those things now, and I think the votes that we took back then helped put us on the path where we're able to make the investments in education, where we're able to reduce the welfare rolls, where we're able to reduce taxes and create jobs here in New York.

KRAMER -- Well, Mrs. Clinton?

CLINTON -- Well, it's not my opponent's association with Mr. Gingrich that bothers me, it's the fact that he voted with him. He voted with him time and time again to shut the government down, to eliminate the Department of Education, to cut $270 billion from Medicare. Now, this is not ancient history, because just last week on "Meet the Press," when he was asked what he thought about those votes, he said that Gingrich was a figure of historic importance and he had absolutely no regrets. I think we need someone representing New York who would not have voted with Newt Gingrich. If it had not been for President Clinton, the government would have been shut down and many of the programs that my opponent now talks about wouldn't even be in existence anymore.

KRAMER -- O.K., Mrs. Clinton, we asked our viewers to come up with some questions for this debate, and we were surprised at what they wanted to know about you. They want to know more about you as a person. Quite frankly, Mrs. Clinton, they wanted to know why, after all the revelations and pain of the last few years, and because you are such a role model, why you stayed with your husband.

CLINTON -- Well, you know, Marcia, I've answered that question and I've addressed it in various forums. For my entire life, I have worked to make sure women had the choices they could make in their own lives that were right for them. I've made my choices. I'm here with my daughter, of whom I'm very proud; we have a family that means a lot to us. And I'm going to continue to stand up and speak out for what I believe, what I think is important. And many of my experiences in my life will give me insights into what I can do to be a good senator. You know, I've had firsthand experience in balancing family and work. I've had to worry about making sure that my parents -- my late father and my mother -- were well taken care of as well as taking care of my daughter. The choices that I've made in my life are right for me. I can't talk about anybody else's choice, I can only say that mine are rooted in my religious faith, in my strong sense of family, and in what I believe is right and important.
I want to go to the Senate to stand up for women's choices and women's rights as I have done around the world in every chance that I've been given. And I want to be sure that there's a voice in the Senate that reminds us that with all the advances that women have, we're still threatened with the right to choose that might disappear if the wrong person is elected president, the wrong people are elected to the Senate. So I think my experience as a woman, as a person, will make me the kind of senator who will really understand what's at stake.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, a rebuttal?

LAZIO -- Well, I think this was Mrs. Clinton's choice, and I respect whatever choice that she makes. The fact is that this race is about the issues, about who can be most effective for New York. Who's got the skills to build bipartisan alliances and get the job done? Who can go out there and make sure that New York gets its fair share? Mrs. Clinton raised this issue, as she has before, of the so-called cut in Medicare. It's false. The New York Daily News, in their editorial, called it false. In fact, we would be spending more money this year on Medicare than we would have under the president's budget last year if we would have supported the bill that she criticizes now. The fact is is that we've been increasing our commitment to Medicare, and I think New Yorkers should know that.

KRAMER -- O.K., Mr. Lazio, choice is a big issue in this campaign. The next senator from the state of New York will have to approve as many as four Supreme Court justices. I'd like you to take a look at the nine current members of the Supreme Court and tell me which one specifically most typifies the kind of jurist you would vote for and why.

LAZIO -- I would -- may I? I would say Sandra Day O'Connor. I think she had the right -- she's got the right intellect, the right experience, she has a respect for precedents. I think she has had a distinguished career on the bench. And that's what, I think, a senator should look for when it comes to confirmation. And this is consistent with, frankly, what both Vice President Al Gore said and what Governor Bush said in their debates: look for the most experienced, qualified person. No litmus tests. Let's make sure we get somebody who has a healthy respect for precedent, who's got the ability to make good decisions, and who's got, hopefully, a good experience of being on the bench and having the temperament that we would want to have as somebody who's going to be serving on America's highest court.

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton?

CLINTON -- Well, I think that the fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance in this election. If we take Governor Bush at his word, his two favorite justices are Scalia and Thomas, both of whom are committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, ending a woman's right to choose. I could not go along with that. In the Senate, I will be looking very carefully at the constitutional views that any nominee from, I hope, Vice President Gore, but in the event, unfortunately, President Bush, as to what that nominee believes about basic, fundamental constitutional rights. Just as I could not support a nominee who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, I wouldn't support someone who would vote to overturn Brown v. Board of Education. . . .

KRAMER -- O.K., the next question is from Jeff Greenfield of CNN to Mrs. Clinton.

JEFF GREENFIELD -- Mrs. Clinton, there are Democrats -- Senator Bob Kerrey, one of them -- who thinks it's a good idea that workers should be able to take some of their money and invest it on their own. You say that's too risky, that the government's going to do that for them. There are Democrats like Bob Reich, former labor secretary, who says it's really important that poor folks maybe get vouchers to get them out of failed public school systems. You're adamantly opposed to vouchers for those folks without the means; it's public schools or nothing. And there are Democrats, John Kennedy was one of them, who favored across-the-board tax cuts. You favor targeted tax cuts, which means that they go to people who engage in activities the government approves of. My question is, why are you so reluctant to let people without means make the choices that more affluent people make for themselves?

CLINTON -- Well, Jeff, I believe strongly in empowering people to make the best decisions in their own lives. With respect to the Democratic Party, we have a broad range of views. There are Democrats who don't agree with me on a balanced budget or welfare reform or the death penalty. So there's a very vigorous debate within the Democratic Party.
With respect to the issues you've raised, I think we are currently underfunding our inner-city schools, our urban school districts. I could not go along with siphoning money off for vouchers that would take money away from the schools that I go into around this state, schools that teachers are teaching in partitioned hallways, where the teacher has the only textbook in the classroom. Any voucher scheme that I've had described to me would be either too little, or raise constitutional objections. We know what works now in public education. If we can get class size down, if we can provide qualified teachers, if we can focus on the learning objectives, then I know that we can make a difference. And I have a plan to do that, I've set forth in great specific detail.
And we have differences, my opponent and I. I support adding 100,000 teachers to lower class size. He has voted against that. I support the bipartisan school construction funding authority that would permit New York to have the school construction it needs without raising property taxes. He's opposed that. So on these issues there is certainly vigorous disagreement, but I believe that when you have 90 percent of our children in the public schools, we need to pay attention to giving the public schools the resources they need.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- Well, I think we've heard some fiction, now let's try the facts. I have voted twice to support hiring additional teachers for the classroom. And under my plan that I support, New York would not get shortchanged. Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, New Yorkers would once again be subsidizing Southern states.
No. 2, I would say that I am in agreement with people who believe in empowerment, Jeff, who trust people. I think it's immoral to force a child to go to a school where they can't learn. There are over 107 schools in New York where children are trapped in failing schools. Some schools have been failing for 10 years. Poor parents want to have the choice to give their children the education that I want for my children, and they deserve to have that choice. They deserve to have their children go to a school where they can learn. I trust parents to make that decision and that's a major philosophical difference.

KRAMER -- Jeff, your next question is to Mr. Lazio.

GREENFIELD -- Mr. Lazio, we heard Mrs. Clinton say she supports a woman's right to choose. I'm going to ask you, and I hope, Mrs. Clinton, to help us see how you'd finish the sentence. Right now, a woman can choose to have an abortion for pretty much any reason -- health, life, if she gets a sonogram that says she's carrying a girl and she wants a boy. And depending on what state you're in, she can abort that -- choose to abort a child either six months into the pregnancy or perhaps almost up to birth. And I would like to know specifically, do you believe there are some circumstances where the government, as a matter of law, should say to a woman, "Under these circumstances you don't have a right to choose"?

LAZIO -- Well, I have a pro-choice record in the House and I believe in a woman's right to choose and my record clearly reflects that. But I do support a ban on partial-birth abortions. I think most New Yorkers support a ban on partial-birth abortions. Senator Moynihan called it infanticide. Even former Mayor Ed Koch agreed that this was too extreme a procedure. This is an area where I disagree with my opponent. My opponent opposes a ban on partial-birth abortions. She is supported by Naral that is so extreme on this issue that it wants to kick the Vatican out of the U.N. because of its positions. And one of her supporters is a person who developed partial-birth abortions, and who's done it hundreds of times. I don't agree with that. . . . But I do support a woman's right to choose, and my record reflects it.

CLINTON -- Well, my opponent is just wrong. I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I've met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it's a horrible procedure; no one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman's choice. Now, the Republicans, rather than wanting to craft legislation that would carve out the constitutional exception that Sandra Day O'Connor pointed to in her most recent decision about life and health, instead they'd rather play a political football game with this and put women's lives and health at risk.

KRAMER -- The next question is for Mrs. Clinton from Lars-Erik Nelson of The Daily News.

LARS-ERIK NELSON -- Mrs. Clinton, good morning.

CLINTON -- Good morning.

NELSON -- In 1993, you were part of the health care task force that tried to extend coverage to more Americans, in fact, all Americans. That failed, as you know. Now, Mr. McDermott from Washington and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota both have universal coverage bills in the Congress. If you're elected, would you support those bills or do you think, having been burned by the previous experience, that you'd want to do it step by step?

CLINTON -- I'd rather refer to it as having been a learning experience, Lars-Erik, because indeed it was. And one of the things that I learned is that I think we need to take step-by-step progress toward the ultimate goal of providing quality affordable health insurance for every American. That's why when we weren't successful I got back to work and worked to end drive-by deliveries, worked to expand Medicare to include mammography and worked especially on the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is doing very well here in New York as a good example of what can be done.
I think that what we have to do now is add on these successes. That's why I'd like to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program further, all the way up to families making $51,000 a year. I'd like to make it possible for people between 55 and 65 to buy into Medicare. I'd like to make it also possible to deduct some of the cost of health insurance from families that don't have employer-based health care and aren't eligible for one of the publicly supported programs. I want to see mental health considered on parity so that we treat a mental illness the same as we treat any other illness.
But there are big differences between me and my opponent. He's opposed the real patients' bill of rights that is supported in a bipartisan coalition, as well as by 300 medical and health groups. And he's gone for the Republican version of the prescription drug benefit on Medicare, which wouldn't cover 650,000 New Yorkers and millions of Americans.
So there's work to be done, and I'd like to be part of that work.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- Yeah. First of all, let me just say that Mrs. Clinton's plan in 1993 would have been an unmitigated disaster for New York. No New Yorker would ever have written a bill that would have led to 75,000 jobs being destroyed, health care rationing and the destruction of many of our teaching hospitals, which are an incredible asset for New York.
I support biomedical discovery. I want to continue our search for a cure. That's why I have supported doubling the amount of money that we spend on health care research. I don't just talk about it, I've actually voted for deductibility for those employees who are not covered by an employer's plan to drive down the real cost of health care insurance. And to allow full deductibility for the self-employed, which is an increasing percentage of New York's population in this new dot-com economy.

KRAMER -- Lars, do you have another question for Mr. Lazio?

NELSON -- Mr. Lazio, yes sir, good morning.

LAZIO -- Good morning, Lars.

NELSON -- The Senate is a lot closer than anybody once thought to maybe changing hands. There are races where Democrats are doing better and Republicans are doing worse. That would mean your election here as a senator could keep the Senate in the hands of the party that pretty much despises this state. We have Jesse Helms as chairman of Foreign Relations, we have Orrin Hatch as chairman of the Judiciary. Why should a New Yorker want to vote to keep that lineup?

LAZIO -- Let me, first of all, disagree with your characterization, Lars, with all due respect. As a matter of fact, Republicans who have run this state like Gov. George Pataki, who's in this audience, I want to acknowledge him, have turned this state around, have helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and opportunity for New York, have driven down the welfare rolls that have helped New York. And Mayor Giuliani, who has brought safety back to our streets in New York City. These are Republicans who care about New York and who are effective. And I think, for New Yorkers, they need to have people that are effective legislators, who are effective representatives. And to have one person in each party -- now we already have Chuck Schumer, who is a Democrat and has got his foot in one party -- I think it's important for New Yorkers to have somebody who has a foot in the other party of influence.
I disagree with you. It's the Republican Party. But whether it's the Republican Party, Lars, or the Democratic Party, the point is is that we want somebody who's got the flexibility, the independence, who's got the ability to cross party lines and work well with others to be effective and get the job done. That's what I've been doing as a member of the House of Representatives. . . . I've worked closely with the people in New York to make sure that New York got treated not just fairly but well. . . .
I am from this state. My friends and family are here, my roots are here and I'm going to protect and put New York first every single day in the Senate.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your time is up.

CLINTON -- Well, I don't think I could defend Jesse Helms and Trent Lott and the people that Mr. Lazio will have to vote for. His first vote will be for continuing Trent Lott's majority leadership, unless what I think will happen, and that is, the Democrats take over.
You know, I believe in bipartisanship but there are certain things you cannot support and there are certain votes that I would never make. And I would never be beholden to a Republican leadership that would say, "O.K., it's time for us to have another one of those votes that we need."
If you go back and look at my opponent's record, time and time again he's cast his lot with people who have not had New York's best interest or America's best interest in mind, as far as I'm concerned. I think it's very likely that we'll have a Democratic Senate. But in any event, Chuck Schumer and I will be there fighting for New York.

KRAMER -- O.K., the next question for Mrs. Clinton is from Joyce Purnick of The New York Times.

JOYCE PURNICK -- Good morning. How are you?

CLINTON -- Good morning.

PURNICK -- Mrs. Clinton, I wanted to ask you about the drug war. We have been hearing increasingly from people on both sides of the aisle that it isn't working too well. A lot of people are saying that, in fact, it's failed. We've lost the drug war. We're spending $20 billion a year in federal money. There's still addiction, there's still demand, there's still supply and we have millions of people, many of them minorities, in prison. Some of them are there, in fact, many of them because of nonviolent, low-level drug connections and drug actions. My question is, given the ramifications of this policy and the cost, why the silence? Why haven't we heard from you and from you, Mr. Lazio -- you will be rebutting on this question -- about an issue that has such an impact on so many people in this country?

CLINTON -- Well, I have spoken out for quite some time, even before this race, on my belief that we should have drug courts that would serve as alternatives to the traditional criminal justice system for low-level offenders, for users. There are good examples around the country where such a court serves as a diversion. If the person comes before the court, agrees to stay clean, is subjected to drug tests once a week, at the end of the year they are diverted from the criminal justice system.
I also believe strongly that we need more treatment. It is unfair to urge people to kick a habit, to get rid of their addiction, and not have the treatment facilities available that will be there when someone finally makes up their mind to go and get treatment.
On both of those counts, I think we have not done enough. And in the Senate, I would fight for, especially New York having, the kind of diversionary programs, more of them than what we do have now. But around the country it's important because drugs, as we know, go across borders. And I would fight hard for more treatment.
You know, we've made progress, though. I would have to take some issue with that. We have survived the terrible crack epidemic of the 1980's. We have a dropping rate of drug usage among many of the population groups in our society. But I certainly couldn't disagree that we have more to do. . . .

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- The truth is, Joyce, that, as a matter of fact, under this administration, under the Clinton administration, there has been a dramatic and troubling increase in drug use and drug abuse by our children. And that has not been addressed. In fact, it was many of us in Congress who sought to develop a drug, antidrug task force at the community level.
I crossed party lines in 1994 and built a coalition of Republicans that passed the crime bill. If it were not for that, we would not have drug courts right now. We would not have community policing. We would not be addressing some of the prevention strategies that we are addressing now. We need to do a better job. . . .

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, out of time. The next question is from Joyce Purnick to Mr. Lazio.

PURNICK -- I still don't know why you don't talk about it in the campaign. But I will move on.
I'd like to ask you about an issue that's come up in the last few days, which is campaign finance reform. I think it's fair to say that voluntary deals are not the best way to go about this, as we have learned. It's almost impossible to pull off. The McCain-Feingold bill that both of you support has loopholes and raises constitutional questions. My question for you, Mr. Lazio, is, will you reconsider supporting public financing of campaigns, as we have in New York City? Mayor Giuliani is here, you can ask him, he's a Republican. I believe he supports it, he participated in it. Can you change your mind and consider it, since it seems that everything else, when dealing with what John McCain says corrupts us all, seems not to work?

LAZIO -- Well, I think first of all, you correctly note that I've supported McCain-Feingold. Actually, it's Shays-Meehan in the House, twice. I've voted for a whole range of different campaign finance reform measures. And I have run this campaign with that intention by abiding by McCain-Feingold. We have not raised nor spent a dime of soft money to air any commercials in this race.
I do not agree with public financing because I think that people, the voters, should decide who actually is elected. I think people should demonstrate that they get some grass-roots support. I've gotten the support of over 100,000 people who have given me, on average, checks of under $100. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
I don't think that we should have welfare for politicians. I don't think the taxpayers should be forced to support a candidate that they don't believe in. I think it's the essence of democracy, frankly, for us as people in public office and candidates to go out and to make the appeal and to talk about the issues, talk about our experience, talk about whether or not we can be effective in representing them. And for people to make that choice as to whether or not they contribute.
I think that's very important. That's what I support.

CLINTON -- Well, I certainly could support public financing. I have said that in the past. I think we need to change the system of campaign financing. But I just have to remark that Mr. Lazio's campaign violated the very simple agreement that we entered into. It was a self-enforceable agreement that anyone could follow and see whether we were abiding by it. The New York Times editorial yesterday put it very well when he said that it violated the terms of the campaign-financing agreement.
You know, last month Mr. Lazio said that this was an issue of trust and character. He was right. And if New Yorkers can't trust him to keep his word for 10 days, how can they trust him for six years on issues like Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs and education?

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton, you were recently honored by the World Jewish Congress for your efforts to help Jewish victims of the Holocaust, many of whom worked in slave labor camps during World War II, and you helped them to get reparations from Switzerland, Germany and many other countries. My question is, are you now willing to help African-Americans whose ancestors were slaves here in the United States get reparations from our country for their years of slavery?

CLINTON -- Marcia, I was very honored to be one of the people mentioned and given and honor by the World Jewish Congress for the work, although mine was a minor role, the work that led to the recovery of those assets. That was an important piece of history that had to be put to rest.
And on issues of reparations with respect to African-Americans, Native Americans, we have some mental and emotional and psychological reparations to pay first. We have to admit that we haven't always treated the people in our own country fairly. We have some issues that we have to address when it comes to racial justice right now.
So I'm willing to work hard to be a strong advocate for civil rights and human rights here at home and around the world. I want to do everything I can to make sure that the programs and policies that have helped generations of African-Americans have a better life in this country continue. I think we should be focused on the present and on the future.
I was very moved when I visited Goree Island, twice. First on my own with my daughter and then with my husband. And we do owe, as my husband said that day, an apology to African-Americans for hundreds of years of slavery.
But I think that the people I know and the people that I work with want us to stay focused on the future, keep our economy going, keep providing good public education, quality affordable health care, do the things that will enable people to have the best futures for themselves. And that's what I'm committed to doing.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- Yeah, I need to go back to the last question, if I can. Mrs. Clinton, please, no lectures from Motel 1600 on campaign finance reform. I mean, the fact is, I took a legitimate contribution of clean hard money. My opponent objected. So because I have such a commitment to campaign finance reform and to this agreement that I fought so hard for, I refunded the money. I did that quickly, I did it responsibly and I did it ethically.
Now, on this issue, let me say this, as someone who serves on the Holocaust Assets Commission, as somebody who wrote legislation to extend the commission and to fund the commission, I think this work is incredibly important. I believe in it deeply. I also believe that it is time for us to move past the issue of reparations among African-Americans and work for ways in which we can bring more opportunity and better educational opportunities to African-American children.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your time is up. And you get the next question. Mr. Lazio ----

LAZIO -- Goody.

KRAMER -- ---- a federal panel has attacked the New York City Police Department for racial profiling. Mayor Giuliani has heatedly denied that there's racial profiling, but I ask you, do you agree with the federal panel, and what do you think should be done? Do you think a federal monitor should be appointed to oversee the New York City Police Department?

LAZIO -- I believe that New Yorkers can take care of New Yorkers. I don't think we need more federal monitors in here to either tell us how we're going to resolve our land claims situation; kick off private landowners, which is what the Justice Department does, or attempts to do; and try to tell us how to keep our streets safe. In fact, the streets of New York are at their safest point ever.
Do I believe in racial profiling? No, I do not. As a former prosecutor, I know that we can do the job without that tool, and we should do the job without that tool. We need to build confidence, use community policing, and I think the Giuliani administration has been doing the job for the people of New York. The streets are safer. People can go out again. You see children being wheeled around in carriages, and that's a good sign -- families coming back into New York City. It's because people believe that the quality of life is increasing in New York City because of the work that's been done and the partnership that's been developed between Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki, and they're going to add one more partner next year in the Senate: Rick Lazio.

KRAMER -- Hillary, rebuttal?

CLINTON -- Well, I would just point out to Mr. Lazio that the criticism of your grasping for loopholes came from The New York Times, not from me.
I disapprove of racial profiling and believe that there's no room for it in any law enforcement effort. The report that's been referred to hasn't even been released yet. I'm going to withhold judgment on that. But I've spoken out about the need to rebuild trust between our police officers, who put themselves on the line every single day, and the communities that they're pledged to protect. I want to go to the Senate to make sure that our police have the resources and tools they need to do the very best job, but I also want to go to make sure that our communities feel safe and well protected. We need to protect and respect, and that's the kind of formula that I'll take to the Senate.

KRAMER -- The next question is from Gregg Birnbaum to Mrs. Clinton, and he's from The New York Post.

GREGG BIRNBAUM -- Mrs. Clinton, the United Nations Security Council has just passed a resolution condemning the excessive use of force by Israel against the Palestinians, but the resolution makes no mention of violence against Israelis. Some consider this to be one of the most anti-Israel resolutions in years. The United States didn't oppose it. The United States abstained. Mr. Lazio said the U.S. should have used its veto power, and he charged the Clinton administration has unjustifiably vacillated in its support of Israel.
A statement released by you last night makes no mention of the United States abstention. Do you believe America did the right thing?

CLINTON -- No, I believe we should have vetoed it. I believe that it was a wrong move not to have vetoed it, that it was inaccurate and one-sided. It did not address the violence that I believe is fomented by Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority. It did not address what Israel has tried to do, such as showing good faith by pulling out of Lebanon and the fact that there's violence on that border. I was very disappointed, because to me the responsibility lies clearly with Chairman Arafat. I've said that on several occasions over this past week.
But we have to focus on ending the violence. It is escalating out of control. We're seeing the capture of Israeli soldiers, the desecration of Joseph's Tomb. It's imperative that Chairman Arafat do everything in his power immediately to end the violence, and that people get back to the negotiating table to try to resume moving toward a comprehensive peace settlement that would make it clear that Israel's security would be safe and guaranteed.
The United States remains the guarantor of Israel's security, and in the Senate, I would certainly be a strong voice for doing whatever was required. I've also called on ending -- on conditioning aid to the Palestinians on their willingness to end violence, on their willingness to rid their textbooks of anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli statements. I feel very strongly right now that we're at a moment of danger and peril. We need to have everyone speaking out, and Chairman Arafat and the Palestinians must respond.

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton, time. Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- Well, Gregg, you correctly noted that in fact I did issue a statement immediately disagreeing and expressing my strong disappointment with the -- America not using its veto power. I don't know why we have a vote if we don't exercise it in a case like this.
For several generations, and for -- and several administrations from both parties, we have had unequivocal support for the state of Israel. This sends all the wrong messages about whether or not we stand firmly behind our democratic ally in the Middle East. They need to know that we stand behind them, stand by their side. I'd not support a call for a Palestinian state. My record is one of 100 percent consistency for security of the state of Israel and for our alliance.

KRAMER -- Gregg, your next question?

BIRNBAUM -- Mr. Lazio, I'd like to ask you about a quote from one of your recent speeches. I'll read it: "I think this is the most important race of my generation. This is a race that will determine whether character still counts in public service, whether or not integrity matters, whether the rule of law applies to all or just to some privileged people."
That was in Watertown on Sept. 29. But you say those words almost every time you address a crowd, so I'd like to ask you to explain them and how they apply to Mrs. Clinton.

LAZIO -- Well, let me not talk about how they apply to Mrs. Clinton. I think it's more important that I talk about myself. For 17 years, I've served New York. I have served as a prosecutor, as a local legislator, and for the last eight years I've served in the United States Congress. I'm known as somebody who brings people together. I'm known as somebody whose word you can trust, that you can work with.
I believe that I have demonstrated an integrity in terms of my public service, and I've been effective for the people of New York. That's why the people of my district have sent me back by the widest margins in the history of my district, because they know they can count on me, that they believe in me. And they know that I will vote my conscience.
So when I say that, I think that -- what I'm trying to say is that I try to be a man of character. I try to be a good role model for my two little girls, Molly and Kelsey, who are going to second and third grade right now. I'm going to try and be a good role model to other children as well. I'm going to stand up for the values that I believe have made New York strong.
As the grandson of immigrants that came over, saw the Statue of Liberty and then got processed through Ellis Island, as the son of a small-business owner that came back from World War II without a dime in his pocket and fulfilled his dream to start a small auto parts store, and now, as somebody who's lived the dream himself of being able to go to represent the people of New York in Congress, I believe I have not just an obligation, but it's my sense of honor to go out and to make sure I do the job the way I think they want me to do it.

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton, your rebuttal?

CLINTON -- Well, you know, I'm also the granddaughter of immigrants, and the daughter of a small-business man, but I was raised to believe that we had to look out for each other and that we had to be willing to work hard to provide opportunities for ourselves, our families, and others. I can't even imagine voting with Newt Gingrich to shut our government down. I can't even imagine being on the side of those who time and time again vote against our most fundamental beliefs -- voting for the first two welfare reform bills that the president had to veto that would have been devastating to New York. And time and time again, if you look at my opponent's record, he'll only tell you half the story. You've got to look behind it to understand exactly what he's talking about. You can just take me for what I say when I tell you that I will work for the issues I've worked on for 30 years.

KRAMER -- O.K., Mrs. Clinton, recently a number of proposals have been put forth to build a large domed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Do you think that taxpayer money should be used to build such a stadium?

CLINTON -- Well, with all due respect to Mayor Giuliani, who's sitting in the front row, the answer is no, I don't. I love sports and I love the opportunity for people to go to sports, but I don't think that's a good use of that space and place or of taxpayer dollars.
I think there is a lot of work that we need to do to upgrade the infrastructure of New York. That's why I support the Second Avenue subway. That's why I support the East Side connector, why I would support a rail link to La Guardia and to J.F.K. There is work we need to do to repair our bridges and our roads to make sure that we're prepared for the 21st century. I've worked very hard to educate myself about all the infrastructure needs that are required around the state of New York, because I think we have to follow in Senator Moynihan's footsteps in saying that we need to have public buildings and public works that really reflect the greatness of New York. I will go to the Senate to continue the work on Penn Station and others that Senator Moynihan has started. And one of my fundamental disagreements during this campaign with my opponent was when he called for the repeal of the gas tax. Now, the gas tax is one of those few taxes that New York actually gets more money from Washington than we send. And we are totally reliant on it to do things like finishing I-86 in the Southern Tier, or the fast- ferry harbor works up in Rochester, as well as the work we need to do here in the city. So you can count on me to support infrastructure, but I'm sorry, Mayor, I can't go with the domed stadium.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your response.

LAZIO -- Yeah, first of all, let me say this: I think it's important that New York gets the Jets and the Giants back here. I think it's important that we have a focal point where we build economic development. And this is not just a plan for a stadium, it's also a plan for expansion of convention space, which is very important. I think private money needs to be on the line here as well, though. I don't think this should be funded with public money entirely. But I believe that this is an important development, an important initiative to try and build jobs, more jobs for New York.
I should note, and I think my opponent knows this, that when I did call for the repeal of the gas tax, and I know she loves the gas tax, but let me say this: we would not take one dime from the trust fund. We made that clear when we had the proposal. I voted against the gas tax back in ----

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your time is up.

LAZIO -- I'm opposed to it now.

KRAMER -- Your time is up. But you get another opportunity to talk, because I'm going to ask you another question.

LAZIO -- Good.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, how would you address the dichotomy that has developed over regional jet air service in New York? On the one hand, upstate New York is woefully underserved with direct flights, while in New York City, in the metropolitan area, the world's most congested air space is plagued with delays and delays and delays. And airports like La Guardia have run out of runway space. Now, with Air 21, the federal government is allowing airlines to add hundreds of flights. In fact, at La Guardia alone, they're allowing them to add 200 flights a day to the 1,200 that already depart from that airport. How would you propose to fix this?

LAZIO -- I think first of all, we need to open up more of these slots to lower-cost competitive airlines that will bring the kind of quality service at low cost to some of our upstate areas that they desperately need to thrive economically. I did that down on Long Island. We partnered together with the local level, with the town supervisor that controls the airport, guy by the name of Pete McGowan. We made sure we went after Southwest Airlines. I did my job. We made sure we delivered the federal dollars that were necessary to upgrade the airport so it made it more attractive for Southwest to come in.
And because they came into Islip, they're now going into other areas throughout upstate at costs that are very low. That's good news, and it's good news for other airlines, other low-cost airlines to come in and to compete with Southwest. I think the point is is that you've got to have the ability to work with local people to get the job done, to stay focused, to deliver federal resources. That's my experience. I think we need to make sure that we do not overburden our capacity for having safe flights in and out of our two busiest airports, J.F.K. and La Guardia. I also think it's important, though, for us to continue to open up new slots for lower-cost, discount airlines to service the upstate economy and those airports down on Long Island as well.

CLINTON -- I agree with what the congressman said. I think that we do need to make sure that those increase in slots will provide more low-cost transportation up to upstate. That's been part of my specific upstate economic plan for a year now, that we need to do more to get the price of transportation down and get the adequacy up all across upstate. But I think we also have to be very concerned about the environmental effects and the safety implications of any expanded service. I think that we have to look carefully at La Guardia and J.F.K. to make sure that we prioritize among the flights that are going in, and that we don't overburden those flights and the neighbors who live in those areas who are already suffering under a lot of noise and other inconvenience to them.

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton, your time is up. I have another question for you, though, so you could continue if you wanted to. But I'd like to ask you how you stand on federal bill 602-P. I'm going to actually tell you what it is.

CLINTON -- I have no idea.

KRAMER -- I'm going to tell you what it is. Under the bill that's now before Congress, the U.S. Postal Service would be able to bill e-mail users 5 cents for each e-mail they send, even though the post office provides no service. They want this to help recoup losses of about $230 million a year because of the proliferation of e-mails. But if you send just 10 e-mails a day, that would cost consumers an extra $180 a year. So I'm wondering if you would vote for this bill, and do you see the Internet as a source of revenue for the government in the years to come?

CLINTON -- You know, based on your description Marcia, I wouldn't vote for that bill. It sounds burdensome and not justifiable. . . .
I have been a supporter of the moratorium on taxation on the Internet. I think that we do have to let loose this extraordinary communication device and see how far it can go in connecting people up. And I'd like to monitor this closely and take a look at it in the time when the moratorium expires.
But it is important that we do everything we can to build the infrastructure of New York to take advantage of the Internet. I have been all over this state, to all 62 counties, and I've been in countless schools. And some of them are the best in the world and the most highly wired, and others are not. If we're going to take advantage of the new information economy, then we have to be sure that all of our citizens and particularly our children are well prepared.
That's why I have proposed high-tech infrastructure bonds as part of my economic plans that would enable us to provide low-cost Internet access and broadband access around the state. It's why I hope that we'll do a better job in providing the computers and Internet access to all of our children in all of our schools so that no child gets left behind. And it's why we need to close the digital divide throughout the state. . . .

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your rebuttal?

LAZIO -- I am absolutely opposed to this. This is an example of the government's greedy hand and trying to take money from taxpayers that frankly, it has no right to. We need to keep the government's hands off the Internet. The industry has the capacity for creating more jobs, more high-paying jobs for New Yorkers than any other potential sector in the future.
That's why I have voted for a moratorium on taxes on the Internet. That's why I have a 100 percent record on high-tech issues because I know that's important in New York. I've been building partnerships with local businesses to create jobs for our young people. And I'll tell you, it's very, very important for us to keep our taxes low.
And I've distanced myself, frankly, from Mrs. Clinton's 15 different support, 15 different tax increases ----

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your time is up, but I have another question for you. I'd like to direct your attention again to the Middle East and to what is believed to be the thing that started it all off, and that was Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount. It has now escalated in Israel to the point where just yesterday, Palestinians attacked a sacred Jewish shrine, the Tomb of Abraham. I'm wondering if you blame Ariel Sharon for setting off the violence. And how you can guarantee Israel that other shrines that it might have to give up in the peace process would not fall in a similar situation and can be protected?

LAZIO -- I think that every Palestinian, every Israeli, every Jew from the world is really entitled to have access to Temple Mount. I don't think the fact that Ariel Sharon went there led to the violence. Let's put the blame where the blame is due. It's on Yasir Arafat. Yasir Arafat is the one who unleashed the violence. Yasir Arafat is the one who has been developing camps for Palestinian children to learn how to kill Israeli children. That's absolutely wrong.
The violence that has occurred is the result of an orchestrated effort to try and undermine, I believe, the peace process. And I think the responsibility lies with Yasir Arafat. That's why it was so important for America to exercise its veto yesterday. And it failed to do that, and I am gravely disappointed about that.
That's why it's important for America not to vacillate. To stand in an unequivocal way and say we're going to stand foursquare behind the security of Israel. . . .

KRAMER -- Mrs. Clinton?

CLINTON -- Well, I have said that I think any person who shows respect toward any religious shrine or holy place should be permitted to visit. So I cannot point a finger or blame someone who did that. It should be open to all people. In fact, since Jerusalem was once again under Israeli control that has been the case. That Jews, Christians, Muslims are all welcome to come to the holy places that they revere.
The blame does belong on Chairman Arafat and his refusal to exercise his total authority and complete power to end the violence. People are losing their lives, Israeli soldiers are being captured, tombs are being desecrated. This must end.

KRAMER -- O.K. We have time for one last question. It's going to be addressed to both of you. You each have 90 seconds to answer the question. Mrs. Clinton, you will go first.
Mrs. Clinton, there is a term that has been thrown around a lot in this campaign -- very simply, define a New Yorker.

CLINTON -- Well you know, E. B. White and others have done that over the years. And what's so great about being a New Yorker or defining a New Yorker is that New York has always been a magnet for people from literally all over the world. People are drawn to New York because this is a place that you can stake your claim, you can build a future, you can dream your dreams.
It is the place that my grandparents came through as well. And it is a place that I've always known welcomed everyone from everywhere, including immigrants from Washington, D.C.
So for me, New York represents the best not just of America but of the entire world. . . .
We have the opportunity to demonstrate in New York that what it means to be a New Yorker is to be the best human being you can be, to do the best with your life you can do, to dream the biggest dreams and to get along with everyone else. To demonstrate that we can make this wonderful patchwork quilt of a place not only work but demonstrate to the rest of the world that people from different backgrounds and experiences not only can get along but build a better future.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio, your 90 seconds?

LAZIO -- Well, I think New Yorkers have a saying. They say, "You know, you've got to tell it like it is." And for me and my life, I think very much a lot of New Yorkers can relate with the things I've been talking about. I can relate with their lives. The fact that we have a great melting pot here in New York. Our ethnic diversity is our strength. It's dynamic, it's changing, it's exciting. That's why people from throughout the world want to come to New York.
We're tough, bottom-line people. Let's face it, we want to see results. We want people who are going to be effective. We don't want to hear a lot of stories and talk. We have a respect for people that get the job done and tell the truth. We have a history of rolling up our sleeves, of building the tallest building in the world at the time, the Empire State Building, and calling it the Empire State Building . . . of doing the things that helped build the name that we call our state, the Empire State.
I'm very, very proud to have been a lifelong resident of this state, to have had all my roots here, my friends and my family from this state. And I'm going to be very proud next year to go back, with the voters help and God willing, to represent this great state in a way that will make it proud. . . .

KRAMER -- . . . The question portion of the debate is now concluded. Now each candidate will have 60 seconds for their closing statements. . . .

CLINTON -- Well, I want to thank you all for giving us this opportunity to talk about the issues.
You know, for months now my opponent has been sending out a campaign fund-raising letter that says that all you need to know about this election are six words: I'm running against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Well, I think New Yorkers deserve more than that. How about seven words? How about jobs, education, health, Social Security, environment, choice? How about the issues that New Yorkers talk to me about and that I've been talking about as I've been running a campaign on the issues?
I want to go to the Senate to make sure we keep the economy strong. That we do what's necessary to bring down the national debt, preserve Social Security, provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare and offer affordable tax cuts. Like making college tuition tax-deductible. And I want to fight for education, for health care, for the environment and for a woman's right to choose.
Now those are the kinds of issues that I will work on because they are part of what I have done my entire life and part of what I've done in this administration. And I would appreciate your help and your vote to be able to carry on that work.

KRAMER -- Mr. Lazio.

LAZIO -- Thank you, Marcia. Thank you for the opportunity. At the beginning of this 21st century, the outcome of this race will define what New Yorkers value most. Will it be bipartisanship and effectiveness? Will it be building alliances and working well with others? Will it be a proven record for the job, relevant experience and a lifelong devotion to this state, New York?
These are the qualifications that I bring to this position. A position of high trust, the United States Senate.
Now, I think we have an opportunity here in New York. We have an opportunity to send a message nationwide. Let our message be that it's people rather than government that we trust most. That the most compassion is a plan that works. That the right incentives can make things better. And that if you don't stand up for something, you'll put up with anything. I ask for your support.

Excerpts From Debate Between Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate between New Jersey senatorial candidates Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, as recorded by The New York Times. Tom Moran of The Star-Ledger was the moderator. More excerpts are available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com.

TOM MORAN -- Welcome to the first debate between the major candidates for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey. They are Democrat Jon Corzine, former chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs, who is seeking his first public office, and Republican Bob Franks, a member of Congress since his election in 1992 and former chairman of the state Republican Party.
The debate is sponsored by The Star-Ledger. It's being broadcast on News 12 New Jersey, CN8 and C-Span. The candidates are competing for the seat held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring from the Senate after 18 years. . . . 
 We'll skip opening statements and go directly to questions from our three-person panel. They are Ron Marsico of The Star-Ledger, Lynn Doyle of CN8, and Christopher King of News 12 New Jersey. Ron Marsico, let's begin with your question. The first goes to Mr. Corzine.

RON MARSICO -- Mr. Corzine, yesterday the United Nations Security Council condemned Israel in a resolution for excessive force in the Gaza and the West Bank. The United States abstained. Do you agree with the United Nations action?

JON CORZINE -- . . .
I have the view that the United States voted properly by abstaining. I don't think the United Nations needs to be intervening in an internal matter, which I think is very clearly consistent with a history in the United Nations, not recognizing the rights and responsibilities of Israel to protect its own national security.

MORAN -- Mr. Franks?

BOB FRANKS -- I think the vote by the United States was a mistake. I think it's most important that as we conduct our foreign policy that we stand as a reliable friend for our allies. We have no reliable ally in the Middle East more than the State of Israel. . . . We have no choice but to veto that type of anti-Israel resolution.

MORAN -- The prime minister has said if the demonstrations don't settle down by Monday night that he'll allow his army to remove restraint. Is there a point at which you would say that's too much, Israel, we have to break company with you, those tactics go too far?

FRANKS -- The peace process is all about developing a secure and reliable peace for every country in that very dangerous region. The people of Israel have a right to go to work and live in peace. The Palestinians have a right, as well, to occupy portions of that land, and this negotiating is difficult and tenuous. But we can't allow violence to override the peacemaking process. Israel has a right to protect herself, and if Arafat will not stop the terror, then people are going to have to pay the consequences. . . .

LYNN DOYLE -- Good morning, gentlemen. Congressman Franks, my first question to you is on the issue of abortion. Your position on the abortion plank of the Republican Party differs from the traditional Republicans in that you support a woman's right to choose in certain situations. Can you explain to us under what conditions you feel a woman, or perhaps even a girl, could end a pregnancy?

FRANKS -- I strongly support the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. I believe that in that process a woman and her physician and her clergyperson have the right, a woman ultimately, the right to make a decision as to what to do about her pregnancy.
But having said that, I think it's a national disgrace that we have the reliance on abortion that we do. I think we need to work together as a community to reduce the need for abortions, and we need to do that by working together. I have supported certain restrictions, including a ban on partial-birth abortions, which in my judgment, are overwhelmingly medically unnecessary and represents the most horrendous medical procedure that I can think of. I view it as a form of infanticide.
For 20 years I strongly supported parental notification laws. . .

CORZINE -- I'm unequivocally a pro-choice candidate for the United States Senate. I believe strongly in Roe v. Wade. I believe that the primary issue is protecting the life and health of the mother, and I think these decisions are private decisions, ones that should be left to the choice of the woman, her doctor and the people in her family and those that she looks to for spiritual guidance. . . .

CHRISTOPHER KING -- . . . Mr. Corzine, my first question is to you. You've proposed an ambitious plan to provide universal access to health care. At its core is a requirement that businesses provide coverage to their employees and cover most of the cost. Would that hurt small businesses, and is it politically possible?

CORZINE -- Well, I think that it would not hurt small business because I would create a situation where the employee takes up part of the responsibility for paying for the insurance, with support on a means-tested basis for the employee. And I would work to encourage regional pools, which the federal government then would provide subsidies to. . . .

FRANKS -- To me there's only one thing that's more unfortunate than an employee without health care insurance, and that's an employee without a job. If we mandate health coverage on all small businesses, even those that today are existing on the margin, we will cause a rapid increase in unemployment among those who are less skilled and may find it more difficult to get placed in a job elsewhere.
I believe that it's important to give small businesses and those who are self-employed fair treatment under the tax code. . . .

MORAN -- The Kaiser Family Foundation sponsored a study that looked at what impact change in the tax rules would have on expanding health insurance coverage and found that it would be less than a million additional people that would, under your proposal, would receive insurance. There are 45 million without it now. Is there something else you can propose, or is this problem just too big for us to solve? How else do we get to those other 44 million, let's say we do everything you suggest.

FRANKS -- I don't believe that the answer exists in Hillary Clinton's universal health care program, which Jon talked about during the primary campaign. . . . By permitting pooling together, by permitting 100 percent deductibility for the self-employed as well as for those employees in a small business where the employer doesn't cover them, we can move to begin to close that gap.

MORAN -- And Mr. Corzine, if small businesses do have to pay this bill, even with a pool you would set up and with a subsidy, they seem to take it quite seriously -- this is something that they consider a tremendous burden to them. How do you square that with your belief that it would be manageable?

CORZINE -- Well, I think they have to understand that it is going to be a co-pay arrangement with the employees and there will be support for the employees based on means-testing, and that there will be substantial subsidizations to these regional pools that Congressman Franks is talking about, it's the same thing that I'm suggesting. If that's the case, the cost will be less, and frankly, the idea of using tax deductions for low-income workers who may not even be paying taxes, maybe even in an earned-income tax credit basis, is not going to provide the kind of access at health care that's going to make sense for a lot of the folks that work in these low-paying jobs.
And the idea that this is going to cause unemployment I think is about like saying raising the minimum wage in 1996 was going to throw us into a recession. The fact is the economy has continued to grow, grow very effectively. . . .

MORAN -- You supported an increase in the minimum wage, didn't you, Mr. Franks?

FRANKS -- I did, both back in 1996 and again this year to increase it further by a dollar over the course of two years. . . .

MARSICO -- Congressman Franks, in 1995, you were the only member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation to vote for a revision in the Clean Water Act, an action that environmentalists considered so awful they dubbed it the dirty water act. In 1998 the environmentalists, however, endorsed you. This time they've endorsed your opponent Mr. Corzine. Have you had a change of heart on the environment, and if you had it to do all over again, would you vote differently in that 1995 bill?

FRANKS -- I'm proud of my record protecting New Jersey's precious environment. I'm proud particularly of the fact that just two years ago both the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters stepped into a very competitive congressional election involving my candidacy and both of those organizations endorsed me. I'm proud of that record. . . .

CORZINE -- Well, I think the classification of the dirty water bill speaks for itself. It took away 80 percent -- protection, federal protection of 80 percent of the wetlands in New Jersey. It cut back on funding. It made for the E.P.A. and OSHA, took away standards and enforcement standards, and was a serious denigration of our environmental laws. And these kinds of actions have continued with votes that the congressman continues with -- supports dredging of the Delaware River, which environmentalists are very, very much opposed to. . . . Vote after vote on funding for E.P.A. and environmental agencies are missing in Congressman Franks's record. That's why the Environmental Federation, the Sierra Club, I think, have turned to a positive view about my record and what I will stand for. . .

DOYLE -- Mr. Corzine, I'd like to address the so-called 800-pound gorilla that has dominated this campaign, and quite frankly, that's your money -- both your personal fortune and the amount of money's that been spent on this campaign. So far it's a record-breaking $50 million, as compared to the roughly $3 million spent by Congressman Franks. He's accused you of trying to buy the state of New Jersey because you don't have a public record on which to stand. Can you explain to us why you'd need to spend so much money to secure this seat?

CORZINE -- Well, first of all, I'd make the point that elections are about ideas. If people stand for a prescription drug benefit for seniors, if they stand for registration and licensing of all guns, if they stand with protecting and securing Social Security and locking up and making sure that it's not privatized over a period of time, I think those ideas are what voters will ultimately pull the lever when the go into the voting booth about. I think there is an assumption that voters aren't smart enough to determine who it is that will represent their interests best.
We were -- we do not have 23 years of experience in political life. I have a very public record in my private life. I've been very active in my community. I have a foundation which I've revealed almost everything about. People know the kinds of things I've stood for. I've spent 18 months being very clear about the positions that I'll fight. . .

MORAN -- Mr. Franks?

FRANKS -- Jon, you know, the idea that's a center focus here is the idea that you're trying to buy a seat in the United States Senate. That's the lens through which the people of New Jersey are looking at this contest. That's why interest exists across the country. Because you've shattered every all-time spending record to try to buy a seat in the United States Senate. . . .
I admire success you've had on Wall Street. But I wish, in order to tell people where all this money is coming from, that today you'd tell us that you're going to disclose finally your complete and unabridged income tax returns for the last 10 years. . . .

MORAN -- Mr. Franks, can I ask you on that question, which has been a nagging question for the entire campaign -- on your tax returns, Mr. Corzine -- what is it that you're looking for that you can't find in the Senate disclosure forms? Can you tell us the kind of thing that would raise an alarm with you, the type of investment you would consider out of bounds? Are you worried he's invested in child labor or, you know, trades with Iraq? Give us some specifics, and then I'll ask Mr. Corzine, can you reassure us on those specifics?

FRANKS -- Tom, as I understand it, Goldman Sachs owns hundreds if not thousands of companies. And back in the days when it was a partnership, before last year each one of the partners had to detail their involvement in those investments. But now that Goldman's gone public, Mr. Corzine merely declares on his personal financial disclosure form his interest in Goldman Sachs.
What we don't know is all the companies that Goldman owns. What are their past practices? I candidly don't know specifically what I'm looking at or for, but I think the people of New Jersey have a right to look at the totality of the personal finances of someone who's seeking one of the most important positions of public trust anywhere in this country.

MORAN -- If you could name certain things that would bother you, I'll ask Mr. Corzine, do your investments come from that certain thing ----

FRANKS -- No, Tom, this is a threshold issue. Either you're going to come clean with the people of New Jersey and put it all out for us to review -- I'm not going to play the game of is this in it or is that in it. That would be entirely misleading and disingenuous. Let's -- it's a threshold decision. Do you believe in full, unabridged public disclosure, or are you going to try to hide it?

MORAN -- Mr. Corzine, you've said you have an agreement with your partners at Goldman Sachs not to release certain information. Should that agreement take precedence over the understandable concern of a lot of New Jersey voters that you are buying this election?

CORZINE -- Tom, it's a legal, binding agreement. I think that people in New Jersey have the common sense enough to know that I shouldn't start my public career by breaking a legal agreement. It makes no sense for one to sign contracts and commit yourself, just as I am going to commit myself to fulfill the kinds of pledges that I want to make trying to solve the problems of the people New Jersey would like to see dealt with, by breaking a contract.
And we have gone beyond the letter of the law by releasing exactly what my assets are, what the range of income that comes from them. I have put up summaries that have been certified by public accountants of what my 1040's are back to 1996. We have released the tax returns of my foundation, which are not subject to these issues, listed everything that we have given contributions to right up through September. We have pledged that we will put my assets in a blind trust if elected. And I will release my tax returns once I am free of these confidentiality agreements for the years going forward.
And it is very clear, I think, that if anyone wants to review any of this material, it's on my Web site: www.votecorzine.org, and people can make their own assessment of whether I have been fully disclosed about what my financial ----

MORAN -- Do you think it was a mistake to make that agreement, given that you're making a run at public office?

CORZINE -- When you're in a partnership, we have -- I have signed an agreement, starting in 1980, every other year, right up to the end of my career at Goldman Sachs.

MORAN -- Mr. Franks, what about that? Are you asking him to break a legal agreement?

FRANKS -- You know, Tom, this is becoming a bipartisan tradition in New Jersey. When you run for statewide office you release your tax returns. Senator Torricelli, who's here in the audience today, releases his. Governor Whitman releases hers. Jim McGreevey, the last Democratic candidate for governor, released his. For the last 10 years I've released mine. It just seems to me that if we're going to deal with this issue of public cynicism and public mistrust of elected officials in both political parties, we need to go the extra mile to engender their trust and their confidence in the institutions of the government.
I don't think Jon's purposefully trying to cause greater cynicism or disrespect for the government, but unintended consequences are going to flow from this decision. People are going to question this entire political system.

MORAN -- Let's go to the next question. Chris?

KING -- Congressman Franks, in the presidential debate last week, Al Gore criticized the tax cut proposed by George W. Bush, saying it was too large and that more than 40 percent of the dollars would go to the richest 1 percent of the population. Do you share those concerns, and would you vote for the Bush tax cut package?

FRANKS -- I do share some of those concerns, and I would not vote for the Bush tax cut package as it is today. I'm concerned that it would crowd out other compelling priorities. This nation should first meet the obligations that we've already pledged. We need to save Social Security. We need to save Medicare. We need to continue to pay down the national debt. We need to first honor the commitments we've already made.
Now, having said that, I want to attack immediately the marriage penalty tax. That marriage penalty imposes an obligation on some 800,000 New Jersey couples by forcing them to pay $1,400 per year in higher federal taxes. Mr. Corzine says he wants marriage penalty relief, but the bill that he supports wouldn't give essentially any relief here in New Jersey . . . Let's enact the marriage penalty relief bill now, and get rid of one of the most onerous features of our current tax code.

MORAN -- Mr. Corzine?

CORZINE -- Well, this is one of the most important issues for comparison of Congressman Franks and myself. Last -- this month, in New Jersey Business Week -- or Monthly -- he proposed that we eliminate the capital gains tax. He talked about across-the-board tax cuts. He talked about the marriage penalty proposal that he's talked about, which actually is a new way of providing tax cuts for high-income folks, in addition to the folks that do deserve marriage penalty relief, and an elimination of the inheritance tax. If you add all those up and just divide by two what Governor Bush's proposal is with regard to tax cuts on an across-the-board basis, you come up to 1.8 trillion in tax cuts. That will foreclose anyone from having the ability to invest in our education, protect our environment, our health care, shore up Medicare, all of the things that I think people want to see us invest in. . .

MORAN -- Just for the record, are you for eliminating the capital gains tax?

FRANKS -- As a long-term policy objective, we should reduce the tax rate on capital gains. We still have one of the highest rates on taxation on capital gains anywhere in the industrialized world. It will help us create more jobs and economic growth and prosperity if we work to continue to reduce the tax on capital gains.

MORAN -- Do want to address the question of distribution?

CORZINE -- Well first of all, the statement in the magazine written by Bob is eliminate the capital gains tax. The view that I take is that we should have targeted tax cuts including, by the way, with respect to addressing a number of the factors with regard to the marriage penalty. I both want to raise and equalize the standard deduction for married couples and I also want to raise the top of the 15 percent tax bracket will take care of that $40,000 couple that Bob is talking about.
I believe that we need to take careful aim at where we do have targeted tax cuts, working for long-term care, earned income tax credit expansion at the lower end where people are struggling to make ends meet. . . .

KING -- Mr. Corzine, aside from universal access to health care and long-term care, you propose access to universal preschool and higher education. How much will all this cost? Can we afford it? Can you name a significant social program that you might oppose?

CORZINE -- Well, I'll tell you one thing it won't cost is the estimates that I see on Bob Franks's Web site. We're talking about hope scholarships which provide access for middle-income families to higher education. We've used the same assumptions that Georgia used to start out, of the number of high school graduates, the number of people who apply to colleges, the number of people who go to colleges, maintain B averages over a period of time. And we come out with a $2.2 billion program on an annual basis. Congressman Franks is saying that will cost 58 billion. Sometimes I think that's one of the reasons that maybe people are cynical about political debates.
Similarly when I'm talking about preschool I am talking about fully funding out Head Start. Making sure that the 55 percent of the kids who are eligible for Head Start actually have access at it. That'll cost about $5 billion a year and Congressman Franks is talking that this will cost about, if I read his website correctly, $38 billion a year.
Just like all the other assumptions with regard to a lot of my programs that The Star-Ledger has gone through and scrubbed down completely, come out with 110, he's says they're 756 billion, I'd say are $60 billion programs.

MORAN -- Mr. Franks?

FRANKS -- Tom, I was really looking forward to see which Jon Corzine was going to show up for today's debate. Whether it was the Jon Corzine who went before the Democratic primary voters this spring and declared, with $21 million worth of TV spots, universal long-term care, universal higher education. There were no conditions attached. There were no caveats. It would've taken just about a half a second to add the word "access," universal access.
But that's not what Jon chose to do. He went way beyond that and promised universal higher education and universal long-term care. Only now that I guess his handlers have described to him just how extraordinarily expensive that would be, he's regrouped. Now he's got universal access proposals.
In higher education it means you have to now maintain a B average. You have to choose a state school. And most importantly, the state will have to agree to fund fully half the cost.
Jon, I don't know, was it you in the primary or is this you today?

MORAN -- Do -- go ahead and answer that.

CORZINE -- Bob, the programs that I proposed in the primary are the same programs that I am now talking to the voters of New Jersey about. Same Web site discussion. No alterations, no changes. The same discussions we had in the primary with Governor Florio and the debates we had there are the same ones we're talking about today.

MORAN -- Let me take a closer look at one of those. Long-term care, universal long-term care, which Congressman Franks says would cost over $500 billion dollars a year.

CORZINE -- Five hundred and fifty.

MORAN -- O.K. And you have a proposal that would cost two-and-a-half?

CORZINE -- Two-and-a-half billion unless we have a refundable piece for low-income Americans, which if we have the budget room, I would implement. As in all of the programs I've talked about, I would not spend us back into deficit spending, which would be the case if we implemented all these tax cuts their people are talking about. And I want to make sure we execute these in an affordable manner.

MORAN -- I want to follow up on his point though, that when you say I propose universal long-term care -- or health care, other things -- but to look at long-term care, the 2.6 billion would finance a modest tax cut that Clinton has proposed. Correct? That's not exactly universal --

CORZINE -- The refundable piece would make major inroads and to people who have low income. And I've also, if you read further than just going through the tax credit, we've talked about trying to implement programs that would allow for the prepayment of life insurance to purchase long-term care. We've talked about the ability to possibly restructure pension funds to also support that. And tax deductibility with regard to the purchase of it.
So it's not just money. There are a whole series of steps that can lead to effective long-term care.
Right now, we have a universal long-term care program developing. It's people spending themselves down into Medicaid and allowing the most expensive source of funding for long-term care developing through the Medicaid system.

MORAN -- When you say universal preschool, that's different than an expansion of Head Start, isn't it? Because not everybody ----

CORZINE -- Head Start -- if Head Start were made available to everyone, then there would be access at -- for everyone that met the economic means test -- then there would be access at universal preschool.

MORAN -- And your health care plan you would expect, of the 45 million who don't have health insurance now, I understand you expect roughly half of them to get insurance through your plan?

CORZINE -- It is voluntary, so it will not necessarily lead to universal absolute coverage but it will provide universal access, particularly when you put it together with expanding CHIPS -- Children's Health Insurance Program -- not only for the kids that are available, but to the parents, and also, including offering Medicare to people 55 to 65.

MORAN -- O.K. Mr. Franks?

FRANKS -- Tom, this is unbelievable to me. Universal long-term care for $2.5 billion. You know, it's not me, Jon, it's the newspapers in New Jersey and New York who've looked at your program and made the assessment that it represents the largest expansion in the federal government in history. Everybody in America knows you've got the most liberal agenda running anywhere in the country today, and the most expensive. You say you won't backslide into deficits. You will push us back into deficits, and I want to honor the commitments that we've already made to Social Security, to Medicare, to paying down the debt, and yes, to getting rid of the marriage penalty tax. In my judgment, you're going to crowd out those options by these huge new spending programs that only now you're trying to scuttle back to try to see if you can reconfigure and make them sound as if they're affordable. But Jon, they're not. There's only 100 cents in every dollar. I think you would have appreciated that from Wall Street, but I've had to make the tough decisions to finally balance the federal budget.
And what you also have said, in the Democratic primary, was there will be times when we'll have to engage in some modest level of deficit spending. Jon, government doesn't know moderate levels of deficit spending. You break that balanced budget and we're going to go in a very slippery slope steep down.

CORZINE -- Tom, I have pledged over and over on the campaign trail that we will not go into deficit spending, unless we enter into a recession, when the automatic stabilizers in our economy for unemployment insurance and other things kick in to cause that. I will not vote for any bill that will put us into deficit. And furthermore, I won't vote for any tax increase, except possibly with regard to tobacco taxes, in the first six years that I am in the United States Senate. And the whole idea that we're going to have $1.8 trillion in tax cuts -- and if Congressman Franks follows the leader the way he has in the House, we are going to have even more tax cuts that are going to leave us with no ability to pay down the debt, no ability to invest in our educational system, no ability to do the things that I think the voters of New Jersey would like to see us invest in. Investing actually will lead to progress and prosperity as we go forward, and I think it's absolutely essential that we have a sound, prudent fiscal policy. I know what real numbers are. I've been working with them for 25 years in the private sector, putting together budgets, making them work, showing up and making sure that you're held accountable for them. I'm talking about real numbers.

HEADLINE: Immigrants in the Middle;
Some Workers Want a Union; Others Fear the Costs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 8

 BODY:
The fortresslike bakery was founded nine decades ago by an immigrant from Italy who sold bread from a bake shop in a barn. The founder, John Joseph Cassone, prospered by offering baked goods to fellow immigrants in a town that then, as now, had an earthier, more working-class feel than the rest of Westchester County.
Over the years, the J. J. Cassone Bakery has grown into a modern giant with 250 employees, several 100-foot-long ovens and an elaborate system of conveyors, mixing machines and steam-filled vats. Its 100-yard-long, red-brick walls dominate a neighborhood where two families often squeeze into a single home and immigrants from Latin America have supplanted those from Italy. 
 Now, this sizable industrial enterprise finds itself in an unusually fierce labor battle between management and union. In the sprawling, sweaty room at the heart of the bakery, some workers complain about scorching temperatures, on-the-job injuries and compulsory 72-hour weeks. Some workers -- almost all the workers are immigrants, many of them illegal -- say co-workers sometimes faint from heat and exhaustion.
"I came to the United States because it was the country of my dreams, but at this point it's turned into a nightmare," said Roberto Lostaunau, a 39-year-old from Peru who is a leader in an effort to unionize the bakery's workers. "This is a nightmarish company."
His view is not shared by all. For some workers at the bakery, like Antonio Torres, an immigrant from El Salvador who works from 4:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. placing bread and bagels into the ovens, the long hours provide the paycheck he needs to support his family.
"When you work a lot of hours, you make a lot of money," Mr. Torres said.
The labor battle at Cassone (pronounced kuh-SOHN) has become a national cause for the union movement, and underscores labor's stepped-up efforts to organize more immigrants, including illegal ones. But the Cassone battle pits immigrant against immigrant, with some looking to the union as the savior for their problems in the workplace, while others see it as an unwelcome intruder.
Seemingly out of place in genteel Westchester, the dispute is exceptional for its bitterness. So far, it has involved firings, litigation, unionization votes and divisions among immigrants who come from the same countries, but who have very different sensibilities and desires. The battle reflects the labor movement's hopes -- and problems -- in dealing with a fast-changing labor force in which legal and illegal immigrants account for an ever-larger share of the working population.
Convinced that immigrants are ripe for labor's message, union officials have devoted extensive manpower to try to organize the bakery's workers, who they say are horribly exploited. But to labor's surprise and chagrin, many of the immigrant workers praise Cassone's 72-hour weeks and even its modest wages, viewing them as the key to achieving their American dream of buying a house and a family car.
Several immigrant workers said management used an especially worrisome tactic to keep the union out. They said supervisors threatened to call in the Immigration and Naturalization Service to clean out the place if the workers voted to unionize -- something management has denied. In recent years, unions have had a hard time unionizing workplaces with many illegal immigrants because these workers are often fearful of deportation and reprisals by management.
In some ways, the labor war in working-class Port Chester grows out of tensions roiling just beneath the surface of Westchester's affluence. As in other wealthy suburbs, the county's economy is increasingly relying on immigrant laborers. But for these workers, it is often a daunting challenge to make ends meet in a county where housing, and so much else, is so expensive.
At the heart of the unionization drive is the alluring pitch that a union contract could provide such large pay increases that the bakery's employees would need to work just 40 hours a week, not 72, to support their families and begin their climb to the middle class.
But several workers at Cassone said the union has misunderstood the immigrants' desires and work ethic. Indeed, the main reason that several workers gave for voting against unionization was the fear that a contract would limit them to 40 hours a week. Mr. Torres said that thanks to the 72-hour weeks, he has been able to buy a house, support his wife and three children and take a two-week family vacation to Disney World.
"If you work just 40 hours a week, there's no way you can afford a vacation like that," said Mr. Torres, who has worked at the bakery for 11 years. "Do you think you can work 40 hours a week and still buy a house?"
For most of the bakery's workers, pay runs from $6.50 to $11 an hour, which translates to about $13,500 to $23,000 a year, based on a 40-hour workweek. But for a 72-hour week, with time-and-a-half pay for overtime, those hourly earnings add up to $29,000 to $49,000 a year.
Officials from the Bakery and Confectionary Workers Union, the labor group that is trying to organize Cassone, say that if management paid the $11 to $15 an hour that some unionized bakeries offer, the employees would not need to work 72-hour weeks.
Mr. Lostaunau, the union supporter, has a far grimmer view of the bakery and its long hours than Mr. Torres does. Mr. Lostaunau, who spent 20 years working for a Peruvian oil company before moving to New York, complained about earning $7.10 an hour, about the exhausting hours, and about the withering heat from working alongside an oven. He also complained of injuring his left shoulder when he slipped on a floor slick from water and flour.
He tensed up, his expression turning angry, as he described an episode several months ago in which he was not scheduled to take a break for five hours. After four hours of loading loaves into the oven, he recalled, he left his work station to use the bathroom, not being able to wait any longer. Mr. Lostaunau, who was working the 3 a.m.-to-3 p.m. shift, said his boss told him he was being fired for leaving his oven without permission, even though he said he had found a co-worker to substitute for him.
"My boss was yelling and screaming and cursing at me, and he told me, 'You're fired,' " Mr. Lostaunau said, noting that his boss, after cooling down, reduced the punishment to a three-day suspension.
Marc L. Silverman, the bakery's lawyer, denied that Mr. Lostaunau had been punished for merely going to the bathroom. He said Mr. Lostaunau had been punished for taking 15 minutes to go, and for not having someone substitute for him.
J. J. Cassone's managers said that the bakery was a contented place and that the union had manipulated immigrant workers into maligning their employer.
"If they're trying to make us out to be the bakery equivalent of a sweatshop and a labor law violator, they're dead wrong," Mr. Silverman said. "Many of our employees are happy. They can work substantial hours and can make $35,000 and up a year in what is basically a minimum-wage industry."
Mr. Silverman said the workers did not want a union. He pointed to last December's election, in which 118 workers voted against joining the union and 37 voted in favor of joining.
Union officials said the election had been poisoned by what they insisted was illegal behavior by management. They said management had fired four of the most outspoken union supporters to chop the head off the organizing drive and to scare other workers. They said management threatened to close the bakery if the workers backed a union.
Federal law prohibits companies from firing workers or retaliating in any other way for supporting a union.
Several workers said management's most effective weapon was its threat to have illegal immigrant workers deported if they voted to unionize.
"They would tell us they're going to fire us if the union wins," said a pencil-thin illegal immigrant from Guatemala, who would give only his first name, Antonio. "They'd say they're going to get rid of all the undocumented people. That made a lot of people very afraid."
The union has pointed to such threats in urging the National Labor Relations Board to overturn December's election. Yet some workers back management's version of events.
"Nobody talked about getting rid of the undocumented workers," said Gustavo Cardenas, 37, an immigrant from Mexico who works in shipping and receiving. "That's a lie."
Jose Mario Castro, a 33-year-old from El Salvador, said he concluded that a union was needed soon after he began working at Cassone seven years ago. Most weeks, he put in 67 hours a week cleaning the machinery, often working months at a time without a day off.
"For five and a half years, I worked seven days a week," Mr. Castro said. "I had no days off. We need a union because of the very low wages and for better treatment. Nobody can complain by themselves."
Mr. Castro said management fired him in April after he arrived at work a half-hour late. Workers are rarely punished for minor lateness, he said, asserting that he was dismissed because he had campaigned for the union.
Mr. Silverman said all the fired workers were dismissed for legitimate reasons, like lateness.
Many workers say no union is needed because the bakery provides pensions, sick days and four-week vacations to longtime workers.
"This is the best job around," said Mr. Cardenas, the shipping worker. "The union can't give me anything that I can't get from the company."

HEADLINE: New Economy;
Finding some middle ground in a world obsessed with the new and impatient with the old.

BYLINE: By John Schwartz 

 BODY:
HERE comes that darned future again, threatening to tear everything up. Take a look, for instance, at the latest issue of Fortune, which puts the star power of Ben Affleck on the cover and declares, "The future of the Internet: Everything is about to change -- again."
The world is obsessed with the new, and impatient with the old. Our futurists have taken the undeniable changes wrought by the computer and the Internet -- changes that justify the overused word "revolutionary" -- and try to take the concept farther, into some kind of technological Reign of Terror. It is not enough to have a revolution, they seem to say: the past must be wiped out as well. 
 The Internet, the seers have boldly asserted, will be the end of the retailer, as brick-and-mortar stores give way to clicks. The end of the university, because online learning will bring the Ivory Tower down. Of the newspaper (say it isn't so!). The end of taxation, because electronic payments will be untraceable. And geography? So yesterday, now that the Net allows you to be anywhere.
But there are other voices, people who say the end is NOT nigh, and they aren't just professional neo-Luddites. John Seely Brown has surfed technology's long wave for decades as the head of Xerox's famed Palo Alto Research Center, the birthplace of such innovations as the mouse-driven computers. And while the company famously fumbled in bringing its scientists' brainchildren to market -- we use Macintoshes and Windows PC's today, not Xeroxes -- no one can deny that Xerox has served as one of the most creative centers for technology the world has ever known.
And from that, Mr. Brown, 60, has learned a measure of humility. He has been at the forefront and recognizes that evolution is more common than revolution -- and that what's really interesting about the new economy might be what's old about it.
The Internet can transmit information, but conveying knowledge is a much bigger job. Knowledge comes from understanding the context of information, seeing it in practice and learning the things that are tacitly understood but rarely stated. And so change is less radical than we might expect.
Mr. Brown has laid out his views in a recent book, "The Social Life of Information," co-written by Paul Duguid, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley. The book takes on the facile predictions -- especially the strain of prophesy he calls "endism." He recounts ruefully that his own company was part of the group in the mid-1970's that predicted the "paperless office."
"That was a great idea, we thought, 20 years ago, until we grew up," he said in an interview. Paper, he noted, is genuinely useful and dependable. "A piece of paper never runs out of power. You never have to reboot a piece of paper. A piece of paper never turns blue and says 'sorry: unrecoverable error.' " Most of all, he observed, "paper has infinitely better resolution than the world's best displays today."
We don't just read the data in a book. We do, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and from other cues. We feel its weight, espy the cut and texture of its pages, and assess the underlinings and wear it may have gotten from its last reader.
Geography, too, remains important, because the world is not just made up of bits of information. Silicon Valley flourishes because it is a physical community. And Mr. Brown, who projects a slightly old-world look with his beard and maroon suspenders, asks for a face-to-face meeting to hash out his ideas most effectively.
To explain what he means by the "social life" of information, Mr. Brown points to a Xerox project to build a database of information about fixing copying machines. To begin with Xerox did something smart: it hired an anthropologist to study how its copier repair staff really did their jobs.
What Xerox discovered was that they were often most productive over coffee before work started in the morning. They would toss around stories and build a living database. So Xerox tried to augment that kaffeeklatsch by equipping the workers with two-way radios, and then created a database of stories, not just procedures, that were grounded in practice. The process turned out to be so useful that, at a convention of copier repair staff, the one who contributed the most useful tips received a standing ovation.
Since he published the book in February, the world has only served up more and increasingly desperate warnings of endism -- culminating, perhaps, in an essay earlier this year from the technoseer Bill Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems and one of the world's truly certified Smart Guys. Mr. Joy predicted that the combination of unregulated technologies such as exceedingly miniature nanotechnology could lead to biological disaster and the end of, well, everything.
While Mr. Joy's thesis was widely read and highly regarded, to Mr. Brown it just looked like the same endist pitch but with a bigger ball. He describes it with one of his favorite aphorisms about the futurist class -- that they count "one, two, three, one million." Life is more gradual than that, the graybeard sighs.
Mr. Brown left Xerox in June and has created a new investment company, Twelve Entrepreneuring, with some star entrepreneurs: Halsey Minor, the chairman of Cnet; the former McKinsey & Company e-commerce expert John Hegel, and Eric Greenberg, founder of Scient. They are trying to figure out what makes a company, in Mr. Brown's words, "truly transformative."
Mr. Brown is not saying much about the new company yet, but suggests that the key is making sure that knowledge is shared throughout the enterprise -- that it "leaks" across the boundaries that separate, say, the researchers who dream up new technologies from the engineers who manufacture the company's products, and that the knowledge is "sticky" enough that trade secrets stay within the company.
Mr. Brown says he is looking to new models, but within traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses, because he says the lessons of the new age are not only for callow dot-coms. "How do you use the clicks to deeply augment the bricks?" he asked, saying he hopes "to replace this ridiculous mind-set that the e-world is everything."
It feels good just to hear somebody say that out loud.

 CORRECTION:
The New Economy column in Business Day on Oct. 9 about the views of John Seely Brown, former director of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and the author of "The Social Life of Information," misstated his role at the investment firm Twelve Entrepreneuring. He joined the firm after it was created by Eric Greenberg, Halsey Minor and Benchmark Capital; he did not create it with them. The article also misspelled the surname of the firm's chief strategy officer. He is John A. Hagel III, not Hegel.

HEADLINE: WORLD BUSINESS: A Rift Deepens in Canadian Labor;
Nationalism Fuels Auto Workers' Feud With Other Unions

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Canada has long been a stronghold of organized labor. But now two of its biggest union organizations are slugging it out in a very public power struggle.
The animosity between the two, the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Canadian Labor Congress, has reached such a point that at last month's Labor Day celebration in Toronto the auto workers boycotted the parade attended by other Labor Congress members and held a party in a hotel instead. 
 It was the first time that the 220,000-member Canadian Auto Workers union, the largest private-sector union in Canada, had not turned out in force for the parade.
Many leaders in the Labor Congress, an umbrella group that represents 2.4 million workers, or two-thirds of all unionized employees in Canada, say the rift is a result of a blatant grab for members and power by the auto workers. Members of the auto workers say their union is fighting for workers' democratic rights, including the right to break away from foreign-controlled unions.
Without a resolution soon, organized labor runs the risk of looking decidedly disorganized. And businesses, which see this fight as a barometer of labor militancy in Canada, are watching closely.
At the center of the dispute is an attempt by potentially as many as 30,000 Canadian members of the Service Employees International Union -- about one-third of the union's total membership in Canada -- to leave their Washington-based parent and join the Canadian Auto Workers. The Canadian Labor Congress, to which the service employees union also belongs, found that the auto workers had raided the service employees' locals, and the congress imposed sanctions against the auto workers in early July. The measures prevent auto worker officials from speaking or voting at congress meetings.
Basil E. Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said his union was not guilty of raiding because it did not initiate recruiting. Dissident service employees union leaders approached his union, he said.
Kenneth Georgetti, president of the Canadian Labor Congress, says his group's handling of the issue has been entirely in keeping with its constitution, one that was created with the help of the Canadian Auto Workers. The auto workers union, he said "was found by an independent third party to have violated the C.L.C. constitution" by raiding the service employees locals. "The sanctions being applied are not arbitrary," he added.
Changing affiliations, though rare, is nothing new for Canada's labor movement, and ideology is usually the uniting or dividing factor. But now, said Anil Verma, a professor of industrial relations at the University of Toronto, "there is more self-interest," more of an emphasis on growth.
"Mergers and takeovers are fair game in the business world," he added, "and they are also fair game in the labor world."
Although he and other experts doubt that the quarrel will change Canada's labor movement greatly, the auto workers union's strong stance on labor issues has wide appeal among workers. In time, that could prove important. Unions have a bigger social and economic role in Canada than in the United States. A third of Canadian workers belong to unions, about twice the level in the United States.
The auto workers' discontent with the labor congress has been simmering for years. Canadian nationalism runs strong in the union, which split acrimoniously from the United Automobile Workers in 1985. Among other things, the union wants to end foreign -- that mostly means United States -- control of Canadian union units.
Membership in foreign unions, once dominant in the Canadian Labor Congress, has fallen to about 30 percent, "and I believe that in time they will all change over," Mr. Hargrove said.
He acknowledged that some unions based in the United States provide responsible leadership for Canadians, but he said he did not count the service employees among them. In a letter to Canadian Auto Workers members in mid-August, he said the Washington-based group had "seized local union assets, fired staff, and sued dissident leaders personally for millions of dollars."
According to court filings by the service employees union, five employees who the union said had been secretly working for the Canadian Auto Workers turned over membership lists, destroyed records and put about $1 million of service employee locals' funds into Canadian Auto Workers trust accounts. The money was returned by court order, and the former employees are being sued for destruction of property.
"An aggressive, powerful union is putting the labor movement back many years with this feud," said Sharleen Stewart, Canadian vice president of the service employees union. But fighting the auto workers is not going to be her focus any longer. Members are more concerned about government cuts to health care spending, she said, and the service employees union is close to creating a separate Canadian arm, with Washington's blessing.
Mr. Georgetti of the labor congress has tried to smooth matters by explaining that the auto workers union is only under sanction, a step short of expulsion. But Mr. Hargrove says his union has been exiled. In July, the Canadian Auto Workers board passed a resolution to explore the creation of an alternative umbrella group.
The auto workers union, meanwhile, is adding more service employees locals to its membership rolls. So far, 6,600 workers have voted to switch and only 40 have voted to stay.
Growth has been a primary objective of the Canadian Auto Workers since it broke away from the United Auto Workers. Membership since then has increased 80 percent -- 100,000 people -- and now less than 40 percent of all members are employed in the auto industry.
The Canadian subsidiaries of Detroit's Big Three automakers are assembling more vehicles than ever in Canada, but with fewer workers, and the Canadian Auto Workers has been unable to crack the new Japanese-owned plants. It has also failed to win over workers in factories owned by Canada's largest auto parts supplier, Magna International Inc.
If the Canadian Auto Workers forms a rival coalition, there could be a noticeable increase in labor militancy, Professor Verma said. "The appeal of the C.A.W. is that it can get more than other unions, so those other unions will also have to be more aggressive," he said. "That will show up at the bargaining table, and it will affect all of us."

HEADLINE: In His Arrest, Chinese Editor Sees Success Of His Journal

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
As he was being questioned by the political security department of the Beijing police in August, Huang Beiling suddenly realized that he had achieved literary success.
For six years Mr. Huang, 40, a Boston-based poet and editor who also uses the pen name Bei Ling, had spent several months a year in China hand-delivering Tendency, a quarterly Chinese literary journal he edits. The 2,000 to 3,000 copies were printed in Hong Kong or Taiwan and ferried across the border by Mr. Huang and his friends in bulging suitcases. 
 On Aug. 11, Mr. Huang was arrested outside his apartment in Beijing. A day later he was charged with illegal publishing and put in a crowded city jail. Two weeks later, after protests from the West, the Chinese authorities collected $2,400 of a $24,000 fine and deported him back to the United States, where he has permanent residence status although he is a Chinese citizen.
Mr. Huang, recounting his experience in a recent interview in New York, said he realized during his initial 10-hour interrogation just how successful his efforts had been.
"I understood that the Chinese government was more and more angry that this issue was everywhere in the country, in the cities and outside," he said. "They said they saw it everywhere, even in bookstores, and they didn't like it."
What they didn't like, it seems, was his lack of concern that the Communist Party did not officially approve his journal.
Before his arrest Mr. Huang had a reception in Beijing to welcome the latest edition and was planning a colloquium to discuss its contents, which include an interview, poems and essays by the Irish poet Seamus Heaney and a collection of Chinese underground poetry written during the Cultural Revolution. Mr. Huang even opened a Beijing office, included its address on the journal's last page and decided to have it printed at a small official printer in Beijing who agreed to take the risk (and, Mr. Huang later found out, was interrogated and fined).
Tendency was first published as an underground poetry magazine in 1988, and its fourth issue, which honored two Chinese poets who died in the tumultuous year of 1989, was seized by the police in Shanghai. The journal started up again in 1994 as a more literary, intellectual publication based in Boston. When its editors decided to print one third of the run in Shenzhen, in southern China, the authorities stepped in again and confiscated all 1,000 issues.
This year the authorities went further, although their action against Mr. Huang backfired. His arrest and jailing and the jailing of his brother and partner, Huang Feng, caused a stir. The PEN American Center published an open letter calling for Mr. Huang's release, and it was signed by Arthur Miller, Susan Sontag, Czeslaw Milosz and Nadine Gordimer. The United States government also protested.
Mr. Huang said that the government was showing increased nervousness about China's publishing boom. He said 15 publishing houses had been closed, a handful of them permanently, and he cited a ban on the writing of two Shanghai feminists. Some Western books, including photography books about the Clinton presidency and about high fashion, that were printed in China for Western markets have been confiscated recently on grounds of being politically offensive or overtly sexual.
"What we are seeing is a tightening of the rules," said Michael Roberts, executive director of the PEN American Center. "Before, certain things were allowed for economic reasons, and now there seems to be concern about how to control the printing business."
It is still not clear which invisible wire Mr. Huang tripped with his latest issue of Tendency. It may have been the photograph of Wang Dan, a leader of the student movement that was crushed in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, which he printed with Mr. Wang's pledge to "continue his struggle against the Communist Party regime."
In a last-minute decision, Mr. Huang dropped one of the two Chinese characters that form the word "against" as well as Mr. Wang's family name in hopes of avoiding official anger. The authorities were aware of the sleight of hand and chided Mr. Huang for trying to "play games." Regular readers say it is not the first time Tendency has tiptoed across the line into quasi-political activity.
"The journal is ostensibly literary, but Huang Beiling has published Havel, he has published underground literature, " said Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University. "He really does push the edge."
When it started in 1988, Tendency wanted to give underground or alternative Chinese writers a place to publish, and to be a forum for authors to "bear witness" to events in China.
To his list of firsthand experiences, Mr. Huang can now add time in a Chinese prison. "In China, the situation in the jails is very bad," he said. "Someday, I have to write about it."
He spent his first night in a cell jammed with men, women and infants, mostly out-of-towners rounded up as illegal migrants. Mr. Huang said that many of his cellmates had been held for more than the authorized 24 hours without food or water and were subject to beatings.
Later he was transferred to a city jail where he shared a room with 16 to 25 men who slept in shifts and were assigned times to use the single toilet and wash basin in the cell. When they were taken out for interrogation, prisoners had to squat on their heels and keep their hands behind their necks, he said.
The only inmate to escape this treatment was the manager of the cell, a convicted prisoner appointed by the authorities as their spy. "He lived like a king," Mr. Huang said. "There were two people assigned to give him a massage in the morning. He had a double space to sleep."
When he tried to warn the guards that they were dealing with the holder of a United States green card, they laughed, he said. "They said, 'Who cares,' " he said. " 'Here you are a small potato.' "
Toward the end of his second week, Mr. Huang was moved to a hostel, and a higher-ranking police official came to question him, pressing him to admit that he had violated regulations by publishing an unregistered journal. Mr. Huang said he refused to use the word criminal but did agree to sign a statement saying that he was not in compliance with regulations.
When he was told that he was to be released and deported, he said he could sense frustration on the part of his jailers. "They just want to stop this magazine," he said. "They don't want to see it anywhere in China. And they know if they release me, this magazine will continue. And it will."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Name-Dropping

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Let's not mince words here: George W. Bush did not come in second last week in the debates. He came in fourth, because anyone watching could see that Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman all had a better command of the issues than Mr. Bush and seemed more like presidential timber than he did.
That voters noted that is unquestionable. But whether they will care on Election Day is another question. Will voters care more about Mr. Gore's intelligence, or his maddening tendency to pander and fib? Will they punish Mr. Gore for his intellectual arrogance, or reward Mr. Bush for his affable ignorance? Whom will voters prefer? A candidate who can't tell the truth, or one who can't pronounce it? A candidate who sometimes will say anything or a candidate who sometimes seems to know nothing? 
 These are all open questions. But there are still two more debates for Mr. Bush to regroup in. The place he must improve most tomorrow is on foreign policy. Mr. Bush's answers to the foreign policy questions were so deeply, deeply shallow that you could only wonder: Is he that unfamiliar with the material and uncomfortable with the issues, or have his foreign policy advisers simply not prepared him because they themselves are unprepared for this world? I think it was a little of both.
Consider the moment when Mr. Bush was asked how he would respond to another sudden global financial crisis. He said: I would call Alan Greenspan and I would gather the facts. Wonderful! So would my mother. But she doesn't think she should be president. This is the essence of Mr. Bush's foreign policy. I would call Colin Powell. I would call Alan Greenspan. But what will he ask those advisers, and what happens if they disagree? For that Mr. Bush actually has to know something himself, and he appears to be a man with little intellectual curiosity. Mr. Bush seems to believe that by simply mentioning the name Colin Powell on foreign policy, he has a foreign policy. Had Mr. Bush listened to Mr. Powell on Kosovo, there would probably never have been a U.S. air war against Slobodan Milosevic and he would still be in power.
Mr. Bush's non-answers were a reflection of the shallow level of thinking about foreign policy generally in the Republican Party today. The fact is, the mainstream of the Republican Party, which for decades had the cold war and anti-Sovietism to guide it abroad, has simply gone brain dead since the cold war ended. It has lived off Clinton gaffes and a kind of drive-by foreign policy, in which Republicans drive by the White House, shout some insult at the Clinton team and drive on. The only original efforts to come to terms with the end of the cold war in the Republican Party have been the hyper-isolationist American nationalism of Pat Buchanan or the hyper-interventionist American nationalism articulated by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. Since Mr. Bush is not interested in either, it is not surprising that when pressed on foreign policy he falls back on name-dropping or on neo-cold-warism, such as his vow to "rebuild military power," which "starts with a billion-dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform."
That would be fine if we were still fighting the cold war, and what threatened America today was the strength of Russia, China, Pakistan or Indonesia. But the fact is, what really threatens our security and the stability of the world we live in today is the weakness and potential collapse of all these post-cold-war states -- because of their lack of institutions and total corruption. If anything, we should be spending a billion dollars on upgrading our diplomatic tools, such as the international development banks, on restructuring foreign aid and debt relief to help countries build the necessary democratic institutions for governing, and on strengthening the U.N., precisely so it can do the peacekeeping and nation-building that we want to avoid.
The best you can say about Mr. Bush is that he has thought about the world and decided that it's still the 1980's, and therefore he plans to solve the problems of his father's era with his father's old advisers. The worst you can say is that deep into this campaign he still hasn't been able to master his briefing book on foreign policy and has evinced zero interest in thinking about the world afresh.
Since he may be our next president, both alternatives are troubling.

HEADLINE: Fleet Bank Sued Over Credit Card

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 9

 BODY:
A lawsuit has been filed against the Fleet Bank, accusing the company of misleading consumers and violating a pledge to charge a fixed interest rate on credit card balances transferred to Fleet accounts.
Fleet Credit Card Services advertised a 7.99 percent annual rate, then raised the rate, violating state law, according to the lawsuit, which was filed last week in State Superior Court. Messages left today at Fleet's public relations office were not immediately returned. 
 Peter Wasylyk, a lawyer from Providence, filed the lawsuit on behalf of Tyler Chavers of Eagle River, Alaska, and asked for class-action status so thousands of other cardholders could be included.
Mr. Chavers transferred the balances from three credit cards in April to obtain Fleet's advertised rate. A month later, Fleet told him the rate would be increased to 9.5 or 10.5 percent, depending on when he had joined, the lawsuit said. "Fleet believed it could increase the fixed rate at any time, and in fact, never intended to provide the fixed rate as advertised," Mr. Chavers said in the lawsuit.
Fleet is now known as FleetBoston.

HEADLINE: Tap the Oil Reserve, and Entrepreneurship Flows

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Four stories above the streets of central Harlem, Lance Stroud has created a one-man oil company that, after going head to head with the multinationals, may now play a role in the nation's energy agenda.
Lance Stroud Enterprises, a corporate 97-pound weakling, elbowed into the midst of oil giants last week when it was chosen as one of 11 companies that will receive a total of 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. With winter and the elections approaching, the White House decided to release the oil to replenish low supplies of heating oil in the Northeast and Midwest. Mr. Stroud, in his oil deal, offered to buy four million barrels worth more than $120 million. 
 "I feel like I'm the front of the boat and the government is the rest of the boat," said the 35-year-old Mr. Stroud, relishing his luck. "I'm parting the waters of this energy crisis with the weight of the government behind me."
Based in a room more college dormitory than executive suite, with a flooring of sweat socks, sneakers, soup cans and literary anthologies, Lance Stroud Enterprises received the second-largest allotment from the government's oil reserve, just behind BP Amoco, one of the world's huge oil companies.
The Energy Department structured the release of the oil as a swap, which means that the companies will take 30 million barrels now and return 31.56 million barrels between August and November 2001. A third of the oil is going to little-known companies, which besides Lance Stroud Enterprises include Burhany Energy Enterprises of Tallahassee, Fla., and Euell Energy of Aurora, Colo. -- a surprising turn of events that has ignited speculation in an oil market driven as much by juicy rumor as dry numbers.
Traders speculated that the small companies were fronts for mysterious entrepreneurs or shams to prop up the auction. "Really and truly what it says is that the government sold 20 million barrels and not 30 because those little guys don't know what they will do with it," a longtime trader said. "My best theory is that those barrels will never move."
But many of those same traders and big companies are now sidling up to Mr. Stroud, as if he were an orphan come into a kingly inheritance, hoping to buy his oil.
"The oil industry is like a close-knit family," Mr. Stroud said. "I don't have any animosity toward them. Besides, they might need some heating oil."
Mr. Stroud's intention is simple: he plans to sell the oil to a larger company in hopes that the commodity price of oil will fall, allowing him to pay less to return his allotment to the government and pocket the difference.
Robert S. Kripowicz, the Energy Department's acting deputy secretary for fossil energy, said that start-up companies had previously received oil from the reserve. This time, "after the small companies got their bids, major traders and oil companies called our contract people at D.O.E. to say they were in serious negotiations with all three of them," he said.
Mr. Stroud thinks that selling the oil should be easy. Sitting in his office overlooking an air shaft, he said he was negotiating with several concerns to buy the oil, including BP Amoco, which confirmed that it was in talks.
The challenge, he said, may be in finding enough oil to repay the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. To speed the flow of crude oil to refineries in time for the winter heating season, the Energy Department did not require financing up front, which it has in the past, thus providing entry to small players like Mr. Stroud. It instead tapped businesses that extended the most favorable swap terms. Mr. Stroud's offer of 12 percent more oil than he will receive, about 4.5 million barrels, placed him at the upper range of bidders, the Energy Department said.
"Why 12 percent?" he said. "Because I don't have bricks-and-mortar or 70,000 employees I need to pay every week. And I don't need to earn enough for 60 generations to live on off this one contract. I just want this to be my coming out."
For Mr. Stroud to make money on the deal, the price of oil would have to fall by at least 12 percent over the next year, which traders said was probable.
To protect against default on the swap, the winning bidders have to secure letters of credit by Thursday, and Mr. Stroud said he was talking to a major European lender about providing the guarantee. If he fails to get the letter, the Energy Department must decide whether it will auction the oil once more.
Little in his life prepared Mr. Stroud, whose two-year-old company is not even listed in the phone book, for such wheeling and dealing. After four years in military intelligence, he said, he worked as a bus driver, a security guard, a computer programmer and recently, to make ends meet as he set up his business, a census taker. He shares an apartment with his mother and keeps a second office in his sister's apartment two flights up, where his computer keyboard sits on an upturned drawer and a lamp with Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore, taken from his son's nursery, illuminates a small corner.
A math buff with a front tooth missing from basketball, Mr. Stroud was attracted to the oil market because, he said, "everything that moves, moves by vehicle, and that needs oil; I wanted my hand in everything that moves."
By following the weekly statistics that traders, economists and oil companies use, he saw that supplies of heating oil were growing tight worldwide, especially in the Northeast. Then he received an e-mail message from the Energy Department soliciting bids for the oil from the reserve. "I was ready to participate in remedying the energy crisis in New York," he said, "and this fell into my lap."
He understands that trading in millions of barrels of oil could "make or break" him. But like the winner of any lottery, he holds on tightly to his ticket out of a life of odd jobs and bleak fourth-floor views.
"If this works out," he said, "I'll have to move. If someone around here makes a lot of money, something could happen. See, when one crab tries to climb out of the box, all the others will pull him back in."

HEADLINE: A Boycott of Procter & Gamble Is Planned

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John Sweeney, plans to ask consumers to boycott three products made by Procter & Gamble to show support for actors who are on strike against the advertising industry.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 13.1 million workers, will ask consumers to forgo the use of Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Ivory soap. The boycott is scheduled to be announced at a Tuesday morning rally in Bryant Park in Manhattan. Celebrities like Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, are scheduled to attend. 
 "This strike has been going on for some time and I think it deserves even more attention than we've been giving it," Mr. Sweeney said. "The actors aren't alone in fighting for the future as the economy shifts, and employers sometimes value profits over people."
Actors also plan to stage protests at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Cincinnati on Tuesday and at a Procter & Gamble plant in Oxnard, Calif.
Union officials said Procter & Gamble was chosen because it is one of the largest advertisers in the world and it has continued to make commercials during the strike using nonunion actors, said William Daniels, president of the Screen Actors Guild, which is representing the actors along with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
"We can't just target corporate America," said Mr. Daniels, noting that Procter & Gamble is not the only offender. "You have to pick out a target."
The boycott announcement comes as the two sides agreed to resume talks, which are being overseen by a federal mediator, on Oct. 19 in New York. Talks broke off on September 27. The actors have been on strike since May 1.
"It's unfair to target just one company, particularly one with such a strong, long-standing history of partnership in producing commercials like Procter & Gamble," said Tom Millikin, a company spokesman. "The advertising industry has proposed a fair and lucrative contract which is in line with previous contracts the union has ratified." He added that the company would continue to make commercials using nonunion talent, but that Procter & Gamble remained committed to negotiating a settlement.
Griffin Dunne, an actor and director who has spoken in support of strikers, acknowledged that the announcement of a date for resuming talks did leave him with some concerns regarding the boycott. Still, he said, he supported the action.
"We're not going to hold back," Mr. Daniels said. "We simply don't have a deal."
While negotiators resolved one serious sticking point during the most recent talks -- going back to the status quo system of paying residuals for work on networks and a flat fee for cable -- they deadlocked on how much the cable work would pay. The unions supported increases over the three years of the contract that would ultimately pay $2,460 in the final year. The industry set the maximum payment for the third year at $1,850.
Although the unions are not pressing to negotiate fees for commercials made exclusively for the Internet, they do want advertisers to recognize them as the exclusive bargaining unit for actors who perform on the Internet. The industry wants to study the issue over the next three years. The monitoring of how frequently commercials are shown has also been at issue.
Negotiations with advertisers broke down late last month after nearly two consecutive weeks of talks. Mr. Daniels said the actors remained firm in their position.
"The union has never been stronger than in the face of all this adversity, and this strike, that's gone on longer than any we've had, really kind of galvanized our union," Mr. Daniels said.

HEADLINE: Chicago Journal;
Crusader Makes a Salsa a Hot Topic

BYLINE: By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
His salsa was so hot his friends said it should be a crime. So Russell Moore, a chef by day, named his culinary creation, Homicide Salsa.
But this is Chicago, the city of Al Capone, where memories of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 still linger. In more recent years, it has been the gang wars over drug turf in inner-city neighborhoods, like Englewood on Chicago's South Side, that have left the stain of loss and bloodshed. It is no wonder that someone would take offense to the name of Mr. Moore's salsa. 
 The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest known nationally for his crusades against alcohol billboards in black neighborhoods, marched into a small South Side grocery store this summer accompanied by a Fox Television news crew after learning that the salsa was on the store's shelves. Father Pfleger demanded that the owner remove the bottles of Homicide Salsa, saying that its name was offensive and that its makers seemed to be trying to cash in on the neighborhood's misery. The owner of the store, the only place selling the salsa, obliged.
Mr. Moore, 32, and his business partner and sister, Dora Moore, 41, contend that their startup venture was carried out purely in the spirit of capitalism. And they continue to tell anyone who will listen that their label, which features a flaming chalk outline of a body, was simply an effort at savvy marketing in the highly competitive world of salsas, where braggadocio about a sauce's spiciness is as important as its contents.
"You wouldn't name a sports car the GT Molasses," Mr. Moore said. "Nor would you name a salsa Chef Russell's Peace and Serenity Salsa. Last I checked, America was a capitalist country. You can sell stuff. If you don't like it, don't buy it."
For the Moores, there is but one issue: the right to bottle and sell their product. For Father Pfleger, the dispute hinges on a lack of sensitivity in even selling something called Homicide Salsa, especially in a neighborhood where there were 782 homicides from 1989 to 1999, including 50 last year and 55 the year before, according to the Chicago Police Department. So far this year, there have been 37 homicides in the Englewood police district, the police said.
Father Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Church, said the Moores crossed the line of social responsibility and poor taste. He learned of the sauce, he said, from a parishioner whose relative had been murdered and was upset when she saw the label while shopping.
"I thought it was crazy," Father Pfleger said. "I thought it was a sick play. I've never heard the word 'homicide' used for anything except for violence. We just felt that we don't need to glamorize or glorify this negative thing. If you say that violence is wrong and you have items on store shelves that have the name Homicide, you get comfortable. You legitimize it."
The Moores say that it is not that simple and that they are no less sensitive than Father Pfleger to Englewood's troubles. Father Pfleger is white. The Moores are black and grew up in Englewood, largely a working class community, where poverty and hope coexist, like tree-lined streets and sturdy brick houses that make up some blocks and the bald vacant lots and abandoned buildings that dot others. Ms. Moore still lives in Englewood with her mother.
Father Pfleger, 51, is well known for his fight against alcohol billboards and against store owners who sell drug paraphernalia. Most recently, he has paid prostitutes for their time so he could preach the Gospel to them. But the Moores believe that in their case he reacted too quickly and too harshly.
"I think he thought we were a bunch of white people selling this product and trying to profit off crime," said Ms. Moore, who earns $12 an hour as a waiter for a catering company. "Now, if I came out with a product called Crack House Five, that would be offending someone."
"I admire some of the work he did," she said of Father Pfleger. "But he's sort of jumping the gun on this one."
Mr. Moore said Father Pfleger's opposition to his product was not "a solution to what's happening in the Englewood community."
"With so many pressing issues that the community is plagued with, I was really thrown a loop when he came after my hot sauce," Mr. Moore said. "He probably had to pass a good 50 well-known crack houses just to get to the store to get to my sauce."
Father Pfleger is not budging. He has vowed to campaign against Homicide Salsa should it show up again at local stores.
At the same time, however, another member of the local clergy, the Rev. Albert Sampson, has come to the Moore family's aid. Mr. Sampson, who is black, has promised to help sell their salsa, but also hopes to persuade them to create what would likely be a less controversial "soul" salsa.
"I cannot allow a white man without an economic program to stop some black folks who have some economic initiative," said Mr. Sampson, who is pastor of the Fernwood United Methodist Church. "We're very disturbed that a man of Father Pfleger's stature would reduce our people to labels. He owes the African-American community an apology. And he owes the brothers and sisters an opportunity to buy the product."
The Moores make two kinds of salsa: Homicide -- described as very hot -- and Second-Degree Homicide -- a milder chili starter. The 16-ounce bottles sell for $2.50.
Over the last two months, the salsa has been the subject of a Chicago Sun-Times columnist and also has trickled into the discussions of local radio stations. In every instance, the Moores have pleaded their case to the public. They even supplied a D.J. with a case of salsa to give away to callers to let them judge for themselves.
For now, the Moores are taking mail and telephone orders for their sauces, although they have not begun distribution.
One thing the entrepreneurs said that they had neglected to do before they sunk $2,000 into their new business was to get a city business license. As soon as everything is legal, however, they intend to start delivering their salsa and trying to get it stocked on grocery shelves. That could happen as early as this week, they said.
Meanwhile, they insist they will not change the name.
Mr. Moore's friends say he also makes one heck of a sauce for buffalo chicken wings. Mr. Moore figures on bottling that too. He plans to call it House Arrest.

HEADLINE: John T. Connor, 85, Former Commerce Secretary, Dies

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
John T. Connor, who was Commerce Secretary under Lyndon B. Johnson and the chief executive of two major corporations, died of blood cancer on Friday at a hospital in Boston, said his wife, Mary. He was 85.
Trained as a lawyer, Mr. Connor had held the top job at the pharmaceutical company Merck & Company for almost 10 years when President Johnson made him his first cabinet appointee. In Washington, he fought to keep inflation under control during the escalation of the Vietnam War. 
 His strong opposition to the United States role in the war and disagreements with the president about the effects of the war on the economy led Mr. Connor to resign after two years, said John Pickering, a lawyer in Washington and a longtime friend.
"He found working for L.B.J. very difficult," Mr. Pickering said. "I recall Jack saying once that L.B.J. thought he could snap his fingers and the business and industrial machine would just turn around."
Mr. Connor, known as Jack to his friends, was the Commerce Secretary from 1965 to 1967, but was better suited to the corporate world than to government, said Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who served as Johnson's attorney general. "I think," he said, "that Jack, having been a former chief executive officer, had trouble taking orders from another chief executive. But he did it."
Looking back, Mr. Connor later said, "I don't know if I helped the government much but the government surely taught me a lesson."
But Mr. Connor did not go quietly. In May 1970, he shook up a meeting of the Business Council at a resort in West Virginia with a speech that called on President Richard M. Nixon to withdraw troops from Vietnam and end the war. Over the years, he spoke out against other federal policies, including the Nixon administration's wage and price controls.
As soon as Mr. Connor left Washington, he joined the Allied Chemical Corporation as president and chief operating officer. He became Allied's chairman and chief executive in 1969 and held those jobs until he retired in 1979. For the next eight years, he was the nonexecutive chairman of the New York operation of Schroders, the London-based merchant banking firm.
A native of Syracuse, Mr. Connor held degrees from Syracuse University and Harvard Law School. He worked for the New York firm now known as Cravath, Swaine & Moore for three years, then spent two years as general counsel for the Office of Scientific Research and Development, a war agency.
In 1944, he joined the Marines, serving as an intelligence officer. A year later, he was a special assistant to Navy Secretary James Forrestal and helped draft legislation that created the Defense Department.
A longtime resident of New Jersey, he had homes in North Palm Beach, Fla., and Cotuit, Mass.
Besides his wife, Mr. Connor is survived by three sisters, Mary C. Waters, Jane C. Kendrick and Nancy Connor, all of Syracuse; two sons, John T. Connor Jr. of Lake Wales, Fla., and Geoffrey M. Connor of Oldwick, N.J.; and a daughter, Lisa Forrestal Connor of Oakland, Calif.

HEADLINE: Indians and Washington State Are at Odds Over Alcohol Ban

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOPPENISH, Wash., Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Yakama Nation was hoping to temper the ravages of alcohol abuse when it banned alcohol sales on its reservation in south central Washington.
But most tavern owners on the reservation are not members of the tribe and have continued selling liquor after the ban was enacted three weeks ago. 
 The state attorney general has sued the tribe, contending that, despite Yakama Nation sovereignty, it cannot impose its regulations on the 20,000 nontribal members living on the reservation.
Yakama leaders in turn have asked United States Attorney Jim Shively in Spokane, Wash., to enforce an 1830's federal law that prohibits intoxicants on Indian land.
"As some kind of tribal ordinance, we don't have the resources to enforce it," said Jack Fiander, a tribal council member and a lawyer.
Yakama leaders are not interested in prosecuting alcohol possession for personal use; instead they are taking aim at sales.
Alcohol is frequently cited as a problem for some of the 2.4 million Indians in 558 tribes in the United States. Leaders on reservations across the country have taken various steps to deal with it.
On the Yakama reservation, home to 5,000 tribal members, empty liquor bottles are found at nearly every crime scene. There are 13 unsolved killings involving Indian women, most of whom were last seen in a tavern.
Alcohol has long been banned from the parts of the reservation open to tribal members only, as well as at its casino and convenience store.
"The Lower Yakima Valley is a fairly small, mostly rural area," Mr. Fiander said. "To have 50-plus commercial establishments selling alcohol, that's too big a part of the economy."
He told of a grocery store owner complaining that the ban would ruin her business, which made 78 percent of its profits from beer and wine sales.
"That was sort of our point: if 80 percent of your profits were from selling alcohol, that's not a grocery store," Mr. Fiander said. "It's a liquor store."
Earlier this year, the state closed its two liquor stores on the reservation, but the owners of 47 other businesses that sell alcohol could lose their livelihoods and their investments to the ban.
"This business is not worth a dime," Buster Windsor, owner of Little John's tavern in Toppenish, said when the ban took effect on Sept. 17. "I couldn't give it away."
The state's attorney general, Christine Gregoire, has asked the Federal District Court in Spokane to find that the liquor resolution did not apply to people who were not tribal members or who were on property owned by nonmembers.
The state, which issues liquor licenses, filed the lawsuit reluctantly, and has no quarrel with the tribe's efforts to regulate its members, said Gary Larson, a spokesman for Ms. Gregoire's office.
"We're very understanding about the desire of the tribe to address the serious problems of alcohol," Mr. Larson said.
The suit, he said, was intended to clarify whether the tribe could impose restrictions on nontribal members who did not have a vote in the decision.
Yakama leaders started talking about the restrictions in 1993 after studying fetal alcohol syndrome, which can afflict children born to mothers who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. The rate of children born with the birth defects is about 500 percent higher on the Yakama reservation than in the population in general, Mr. Fiander said.
The rate of traffic deaths is also higher, said Gary Carter, an environmental health officer for the tribe. From 1993 to 1996, 78 percent of the motor vehicle deaths on the reservation were alcohol-related, compared with 39 percent for the state of Washington and 48 percent for the nation.
For the last two years, the Blackfeet Tribal Council in Montana has banned alcohol during certain celebrations.
"They recognize our heritage and culture and tradition without alcohol," said Emorie Davis-Bird, director of the Blackfeet Department of Revenue.
Similar to the Yakama Nation, the Blackfeet reservation is a checkerboard of privately and tribal-owned land. Most of the taverns, licensed by both the State of Montana and the Blackfeet tribe, are owned by non-Indians, Ms. Davis-Bird said.
There were complaints, but in the end "everyone was very respectful," she said.
Across the country, there are both dry and wet reservations.
In Washington state, the Makah reservation does not allow alcohol, but three others have tribal liquor stores.
At the Tulalip reservation, in western Washington, alcohol is constantly debated. The center of the reservation, where most tribal functions occur, is alcohol-free, but liquor is sold at a casino and three stores on the eastern edge of the reservation.
In Nebraska, Indian activists have unsuccessfully tried to shut down liquor stores in Whiteclay, two miles from the dry Pine Ridge Indian Reservation over the state line in South Dakota.
Four stores in Whiteclay sell millions of dollars worth of beer each year, most of it to Oglala Sioux.
The Yakamas may be breaking new ground by going from wet to dry.
"As far as I know, we're the first tribe that's done this by changing course midway through its history," Mr. Fiander said. "It's symbolic when you enact something that excludes alcohol from the reservation. It's like you're casting it out."

HEADLINE: Drama of the Debates

 BODY:
In the current New Yorker, the magazine's Washington correspondent, Joe Klein, recounts an exchange from a 1992 campaign debate in which President Bush gave a fumbling answer to a question from the audience about how the national debt affected the "economic problems of common people." Because the woman who asked the question was black, Mr. Bush noted that he had been to an A.M.E. church recently. Then he veered awkwardly to the subject of teenage pregnancies. When Bill Clinton's turn came, he stepped toward the woman and said, "Tell me how it's affected you again." In Mr. Klein's view, this demonstration of Mr. Clinton's superior empathic ability was a pivotal moment in their competition. The observation touches on the perennial questions of what voters look for in the candidate debates and how they process what they see and hear.
In our view, the history of televised debates since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met in 1960 demonstrates that mastery of facts is seldom decisive. Kennedy exaggerated the "missile gap," and many contemporary observers famously thought that Nixon had won. In 1980, Jimmy Carter outpointed Ronald Reagan on substance. Last week Vice President Al Gore demonstrated a superior grasp of every aspect of domestic and foreign policy, but his presentation apparently set the stage for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to leap past him in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. 
 The point, we hope, is not that intelligence does not matter, but rather that voters are not looking only for the smarter contestant or the more articulate or the more experienced, as the elder Mr. Bush was in 1992. The act of political bonding that must take place between a candidate and the voters is more complex than that. A certain level of intelligence is required as table stakes, so to speak. But the examples of Mr. Reagan and -- so far -- Governor Bush show that the public cannot be spooked by jokes and commentary to the effect that a given nominee may not be the brightest bulb on the tree.
The explanation may be that people are looking for something that cannot be strictly measured by I.Q. or by checking a resume for the number of years in Washington. Debate audiences are trying to gauge something more mysterious and unpredictable, which is whether a given individual has a presidential temperament. Nostalgia for past presidents probably plays a role, too, as time exaggerates their virtues and blurs the defects. Who wouldn't like a candidate who combined J.F.K.'s charm, Mr. Reagan's optimism and Mr. Clinton's empathy?
The importance of such unquantifiable qualities probably means that Mr. Gore's concept of the debates as "like a job interview" is too limited and even politically dangerous for Mr. Gore, given his passion to explain his qualifications over and over. A more expansive metaphor has been used by campaign strategists who say that in political broadcasts the television camera works like an X-ray, exposing all aspects of a candidate's personality, character, intellect and inner commitments.
But no conceptual model fully covers the odd drama that will have its second act when Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have their next meeting tomorrow night. The vice president believes that the voters will succumb to a relentless reading of the facts on his inner teleprompter. The Texas governor thinks he can charm them into overlooking the manifest gaps in his knowledge and experience. In the end, the outcome could well be decided by some symbolic moment that inspires swing voters to a leap of faith.

HEADLINE: Williams-Sonoma Warns on Profits as Catalog Sales Slacken

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Williams-Sonoma Inc., the kitchen goods and home furnishings chain, said today that its third-quarter profit would fall on lower-than-expected catalog sales and higher costs. The statement sent its shares down as much as 30 percent.
The company also said that its chief financial officer, John Tate, would resign as of Nov. 1 after just 18 months. 
 Profit in the quarter ended Oct. 29 will be 4 to 6 cents a share, down from 16 cents in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected 18 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Sluggish demand for products in the autumn and early holiday catalogs hurt sales, forcing price markdowns and more advertising. Higher interest rates and gasoline prices have prompted shoppers to reduce spending.
"This company has had difficulty in the past making their numbers when things slow down," said David Magee, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey. "This is another piece of evidence of that."
Shares of Williams-Sonoma, based in San Francisco, tumbled $7.88, or 29 percent, to $19. Earlier, the stock fell to $18.81.
"We are embarrassed, we are angry, we are all of those things," Howard Lester, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. "We expect to fix this. Don't bury us."
Mr. Tate is taking a job at another company, which was not identified. He is being succeeded by Sharon McCollam, who joined Williams-Sonoma earlier this year as vice president for finance. She was previously vice president and chief financial officer for a division of the Dole Food Company.
Sales will rise to $380 million to $395 million, less than forecast, from $324 million in the period a year earlier, the company said. Mr. Magee had expected sales to reach $398 million.
The company estimated sales at stores open at least a year would rise 4 percent to 5 percent, down from 9.6 percent in the period a year earlier. Williams-Sonoma's forecast was in line with Mr. Magee's estimate for a 5 percent gain.
Williams-Sonoma is increasing the circulation of its catalogs by 15 percent in the third quarter and 10 percent in the fourth quarter, Gary Friedman, the company's president, said on the conference call. The company's catalogs include Hold Everything and Chambers in addition to the Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma books.
The revised sales forecast comes just two weeks after Mr. Tate said that Williams-Sonoma expected Internet sales to increase fourfold this year, to $40 million, as customers buy more from the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn sites.
Catalog and Internet sales account for about 40 percent of Williams-Sonoma's annual sales. The company began its Williams-Sonoma Web site in November.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: EDUCATION INITIATIVES;
Frustrated Parents Hope Their Votes Will Change Schools' Ways

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Voters will consider a record number of education questions on state ballots next month, including whether to offer private school vouchers to parents, shut down bilingual classrooms, pay teachers based on student performance and virtually eliminate any mention in the classroom of homosexuality.
That millions of dollars have been spent gathering signatures to get 11 of these initiatives on state ballots is a reflection of parents' frustration with public-school performance. 
 And while education has been a prominent issue in the presidential race and in most other major political contests, such sensitive issues as vouchers and ending bilingual education are likely to have a greater chance of being enacted through ballot measures than by politicians.
"People aren't satisfied with either the course we're on in the schools or the pace of change," said Robert Schwartz, the president of Achieve, a nonpartisan education policy organization. "They don't know quite what to do, so you see people flailing about with these various attempts to take education policy directly into their own hands."
In a major test of the voucher movement, voters in California and Michigan will decide whether to direct their states to use public money to reimburse parents for at least part of the tuition they pay to parochial and other private schools. The California program would be open to all of the state's 6.5 million public- and private-school students by 2005, which would make it the largest such effort in the nation, while in Michigan the vouchers would be reserved for several hundred thousand children in low-performing schools.
An Arizona measure, similar to one that passed in California in 1998, would eliminate bilingual education and would immerse native Spanish speakers in yearlong crash courses in English.
Voters in Oregon will decide whether to outlaw instruction that "encourages, promotes or sanctions" any "behaviors relating to homosexuality and bisexuality," as well as whether teachers' pay should be linked to students' performance.
And under a measure in Colorado, where education spending has declined in recent years, school budgets would be required to increase at the rate of inflation plus at least one percentage point, over each of the next 10 years. Similarly, a California initiative would require that school spending exceed the national average, while in Michigan the amount spent per pupil would not be permitted to drop.
In a sign of the range of measures before voters -- and the divisiveness of the voucher issue in particular -- the nation's largest teachers union, the National Education Association, voted this summer to impose a $3 annual surcharge on members' dues, solely to mount a response to ballot initiatives. The effort has raised $5 million.
Much of that money is being spent in Michigan and California, where the union says that vouchers siphon money from public schools, but the union has also thrown its support behind a Washington State measure that would tie teachers' salary increases to cost of living indexes.
Though the presidential candidates have talked a lot about education, their sway in the classroom is limited: the federal government provides an average of only 7 cents of every dollar spent in American schools, compared with 48 cents from the states and 45 cents from localities, federal statistics show.
Many of the most significant changes in public education in recent years have thus originated in the states, spreading like a folk tale from one to the other, including the standards and standardized tests that every state but Iowa now uses.
Of the 32 major education initiatives to be voted on this year, 11 were petitioned onto the ballot, often by grass-roots organizations, more than double the previous record of 5, in 1996, says the Initiative and Referendum Institute, a nonpartisan organization that has tracked such measures since 1904. The remaining 21 school measures were placed on ballots by legislatures, which were usually seeking permission to raise money for school construction and other additional spending.
The California initiative, Proposition 38, which would offer a $4,000 chit to every student in the state who wished to attend private school, has touched off a pitched battle stoked by millions of dollars. Supporters of the initiative have even tried to woo voters to visit the campaign Web site by raffling Apple iMac computers and Hawaiian vacations.
Thus far, the gimmicks appear to be failing: in a survey of 1,099 likely voters last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, an independent research organization, 53 percent of Californians opposed the measure, 37 percent supported it and 10 percent were undecided.
The driving force behind the initiative, Tim Draper, is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist dissatisfied with the public-school education that his four children received. Mr. Draper has pledged $20 million to the campaign to pass Proposition 38, enough money to build a small high school.
Chris Bertelli, a spokesman for Mr. Draper's political organization, Prop. 38 Yes, said, "The goal is to provide access to a quality education to every child in California."
Though the National Education Association and its California affiliate have pledged $4.5 million to defeat the measure, some of the measure's unlikeliest opposition has come from conservative leaders who have backed voucher experiments in almost every other city or state that has tried them.
They have objected to Mr. Draper's attempt to begin a voucher program on a statewide basis, regardless of a family's income, and they worry that his effort, should it fail, would tarnish the voucher movement nationwide as it seeks to expand beyond experiments in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Florida.
"Voucher proposals are more likely to be acceptable to citizens if they start with the neediest children," said Terry M. Moe, a self-described "very strong voucher supporter" who is an expert on education policy at the Hoover Institution in California. "I wish Draper had not done this."
The nation's school-choice proponents, a loose-knit coalition of business and religious leaders, conservative academics and minority parents, have strongly supported the Michigan proposal. The plan would offer a voucher of about $3,300 to each student in a school district in which fewer than two-thirds of all high school freshmen graduate within four years.
There are currently seven such districts, including Detroit, with a total enrollment of about 180,000, according to the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, an independent research organization.
The Michigan voucher supporters, who call themselves Kids First! Yes!, have not lacked for financial resources: one of the campaign's chairmen, Dick DeVoss, the president of the Amway Corporation, has promised to raise $5 million. But the National Education Association has also weighed in, with $1.7 million spent in opposition. Voter surveys in recent weeks have suggested that the race is too close to call.
That is not the case in Arizona, where voters seem poised to end bilingual education, just as California did two years ago. A survey of 602 likely voters conducted last month by The Arizona Republic found nearly three-quarters of them in support of placing all limited-English speakers in a yearlong English immersion course.
Supporters of the measure, No. 203, have lamented that in a state where 1 of every 8 students is not a native speaker of English, some Spanish-speaking students have spent upward of eight years in bilingual classes that were intended to serve as a short-term transitional bridge to mainstream English courses. Supporters of the measure received encouraging news from California last month, when results of standardized tests released by the state suggested that the scores of limited English speakers had risen in the two years since bilingual education programs ended.
"Bilingual has lost its mandate to teach English to Mexican children," said Hector Ayala, a native of Mexico and an English teacher at Cholla High School in Tucson who is the co-director of English for the Children of Arizona, a sponsor of the measure.
But Sal Gabaldon, an English teacher at Pueblo High School in Tucson, said the immersion courses would be too abrupt, and would threaten the native language literacy of tens of thousands of Spanish-speaking students, as well as of thousands of speakers of American Indian languages.
In Oregon, a survey of voters last month by The Oregonian found them evenly divided on Measure 9, which states: "The instruction of behaviors relating to homosexuality and bisexuality shall not be presented in a public school in a manner which encourages, promotes or sanctions such behaviors."
Patricia Smith said her organization, the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a coalition of conservative activists, had placed the measure on the ballot in response to complaints from parents. "This business of going into the classroom and saying homosexuality is normal, that has got to be stopped," said Ms. Smith, a parent whose grown children attended public schools.
Among those fighting the measure are an array of social service agencies that have argued that, by its broad language, the measure could deny students potentially lifesaving education about AIDS.
Another group of voters, Oregon Taxpayers United, has placed a separate measure on the ballot that would eliminate teacher pay scales based on seniority, in favor of raises tied to how students perform.
But the measure leaves it to the state and districts to sort out the critical question of whether standardized tests or principal evaluations should be a measure of performance. An editorial in The Oregonian last month suggested that the initiative had been "sketched on a cocktail napkin."

HEADLINE: HIGHER FUEL PRICES DO LITTLE TO ALTER MOTORISTS' HABITS

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT with BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
When the price of oil tripled in the mid-1970's, Americans' consumption of gasoline fell sharply. Congress approved sweeping new rules calling for a doubling of the fuel efficiency of cars. Gasoline-sipping Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas became some of the most popular cars on the road, shaking the confidence of the American automobile industry.
Over the last two years, energy prices have tripled again, but one would hardly know it from looking at America's roads. 
 Few people have sharply cut back on their driving or have begun shopping for cars based primarily on fuel efficiency, according to interviews around the country and data from the government and auto industry. The nation is on pace to use almost the same amount of gasoline as it did last year, which was the most ever. Sport-utility vehicles and other trucks continue to gain market share slowly.
Instead, Americans are tinkering.
Thousands of drivers have stopped using expensive premium gasoline, and some families have tried to eliminate the small number of trips they deem unnecessary. Sales of the very largest S.U.V.'s have slipped, although analysts remain unsure of the reason.
"We've seen some effect" of higher gas prices, said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, "but it's small."
A large part of the difference between then and now springs from the fact that today there are no actual oil shortages or gas station lines. By themselves, higher gas prices tend to change people's behavior only gradually, economists say.
In addition, even after rising steadily for the last 20 months gas prices remain significantly lower, adjusted for inflation, than they were in the 1970's and 1980's. Perhaps equally important, upper income consumers, who are relatively indifferent to gas prices, consume a larger share of gas than they once did because of their affinity for S.U.V.'s.
Oil demand, consequently, shows little sign of abating in the United States. With Americans accounting for about one quarter of the world's energy consumption, the strength of gasoline demand in recent years is a major reason, economists say, that prices are at their current level.
Certainly the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has contributed to the situation by tightening oil supplies. And demand for oil has picked up elsewhere, too, particularly as Asia's economies have recovered from their financial squeeze. Yet America's underlying energy use has received far less attention than the other culprits that the major-party nominees for president have castigated: the United States government and big oil companies.
Some 60 percent of the public reports being worried about energy costs, according to the Gallup Organization. That helps explain why both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have made the topic an important issue during the campaign's final weeks.
Mr. Bush has proposed increasing oil supplies by allowing energy companies to drill in parts of Alaska that the Clinton administration wants to keep environmentally protected. Mr. Gore, by contrast, has accused large oil companies of price-gouging and has promised to provide incentives to pursue alternative energy sources.
For all the political drumbeating, though, the reaction by consumers remains relatively mild.
"People are reluctant to change their driving habits unless they're forced to do it in a dramatic way," said Christopher W. Cedergren, an analyst at Nextrend, a market research firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., that has been interviewing S.U.V. owners in recent weeks.
Take Karyn Fitzpatrick, for example. When she was filling the tank of her Volkswagen Beetle during the oil crisis of the mid-1970's, she liked to think about all the people who drove larger cars than she did. "I remember feeling, 'Ha, ha, ha,' " said Ms. Fitzpatrick, who needed to stop for gasoline only once every two weeks.
These days, Ms. Fitzpatrick, a 45-year-old real estate agent in Southern California, drives a year-old Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle that easily holds her husband and two children. After the tripling of crude oil prices in the last two years, it costs about $70 to fill the tank. "Now it's ha, ha, ha on me," she said.
Still, Ms. Fitzpatrick has no plans to return to the old days and begin shopping for a smaller, more fuel-efficient car. Instead, she is using her eight-passenger, V-8 Suburban less often and driving the family's Mercedes to work. Her husband, she said, has begun urging her to switch to a lower grade of gasoline, and they may consider buying a smaller sport utility if gas prices climb further.
While the Fitzpatricks have considerably more money than the average family, they typify the changing tastes of American drivers.
Today, the average owner of a large S.U.V. -- which typically goes about 13 miles on a gallon of gas -- is part of a family with $103,000 in annual income, according to General Motors. Those people are less sensitive than others to fluctuations in gas prices, particularly because gas prices have actually fallen over the last two decades. In 1980, for example, a gallon of regular unleaded gas cost over $2.50 in today's dollars, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.; this year, it has cost, on average, around $1.50.
"A 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline is not as significant as a 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline was in 1974," said David Greene, a corporate fellow at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Today, many people are "more concerned about whether they have leather seats and what kind of stereo they have and the vehicle's horsepower than fuel economy," he added.
This summer, Americans spent about 2.7 percent of their after-tax income on gasoline and fuel, Economy.com reports, and the number has not exceeded 3 percent since the end of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war. In the early 1980's, gasoline spending reached as high as 6 percent of income, over double its current level.
Even though both gas prices and borrowing costs have risen over the last year, neither increase has been big enough to trip up the light-truck boom. Together, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all new vehicles bought in the United States during the first nine months of the year, said Mark Cornelius, the president of Morgan & Company, an automotive consulting firm in West Olive, Mich.
The truck-based vehicles' increased popularity also helped reverse the decade-long decline in Americans' per-capita consumption of gas that began in the mid-1970's. That decline was set off by the federal government's 1975 passage of fuel-economy standards and the shift in consumer preferences toward more fuel-efficient cars. The rules for light trucks are less strict, though, and as more Americans have bought minivans and S.U.V.'s, the average fuel economy of new vehicles has fallen by about 7 percent since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency said. It is now at the same level as it was in 1980.
For many drivers today, spending a few extra dollars -- or even $10 or $20 more -- when they go the pump is a small price for being in a vehicle that is not dwarfed by others on the road.
"Driving a small car now would be like taking a knife to a gun fight," said Doug Johnson, who owns a small construction company in Austin, Tex. Mr. Johnson and his wife once drove Volvos, he said. Today, she drives an S.U.V.; he drives a pickup truck.
"As much as I'd like to be more fuel conscious, I'm not going to compromise my kids' safety," he said. (Federal research has shown S.U.V.'s to be no safer for their drivers than cars, but some consumers continue to name safety as a reason for their appeal.)
Anyway, Mr. Johnson said, "higher gas prices don't make that much difference in the total cost of owning a car."
One sign that gas prices may be playing some role in consumers' purchases is the slipping popularity of the largest sport utility vehicles. Last month, sales of large S.U.V.'s fell 10 percent, compared with Sept. 1999, while sales of midsize and small trucks gained slightly. Auto analysts remain unsure about the reasons, saying mediocre stock market returns and the introduction of newer car-based models could be having as much of an effect as gas prices.
Brenda Van Loggem, a visiting nurse who lives in Bronxville, N.Y., faces a decision next month when the lease on her Ford Explorer Sport expires. With her gas bills climbing, she said she might switch to a four-cylinder truck instead of the six-cylinder one she now owns.
She does not expect to buy a car, though. "You get used to driving one of these," said Ms. Van Loggem, while standing in the parking lot of a Westchester County shopping mall last weekend. "It's nice to be high up, and I think it's safer."
The most noticeable reaction among consumers has come in their decision to shun the more expensive types of gasoline that car manufacturers and oil companies say help some vehicles run more smoothly. Through the first seven months of the year, sales of midgrade and premium gas together have fallen 21 percent, the Energy Department reported. By contrast, sales of regular gasoline -- which is typically about 10 percent cheaper -- grew by 5 percent, and it now accounts for more than three out of every four gallons sold.
"In people's minds, they're not giving anything up because they probably don't detect any difference in performance" between premium and regular gasoline, Mr. Cedergren said. "They're getting the same thing for less money."
Cutting back on driving has been a less common reaction, largely because most people cannot quickly change the manner in which they commute to work, run errands or pick up children from school. (The Gallup poll did not ask whether consumers' concern had caused them to act differently, but it did show an even higher level of worry among people with low or moderate incomes.)
Americans are using roughly the same amount of gasoline that they did last year, and the Department of Energy projects that the number will remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly by the end of the year. It would be the first decline since 1980.
In the meantime, Americans are coping as best they can with high gasoline prices. Stacy Coulson, a pastry chef who recently moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles, lives with her sister. They have decided to drive only Ms. Coulson's 1997 Nissan pickup truck and not her sister's Pontiac Grand Am, which is less fuel efficient.
They also do not buy premium gas, avoid crowded freeways, drive out of their way at times to a less expensive gas station and go to the grocery store only once a week. "I limit my mileage, and I don't drive on the highway because it's stop and go," Ms. Coulson said.
Stop and go, she noted, because of all the other drivers still out there.

Chart: "An Enduring Appetite for Gasoline"
After oil prices rose sharply in the 1970's, the government set new standards for fuel efficiency and Americans started buying smaller cars. As a result, average fuel economy for new vehicles rose rapidly in the late 1970's and 1980's and helped bring down the per capita consumption of gasoline. But the recent popularity of less-efficient trucks and sport utility vehicles has contributed to a revival in gas usage. (pg. C6)

HEADLINE: Japanese Insurer Files for Bankruptcy and Sets a Record

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's largest insurers, filed for bankruptcy protection today after the government unsuccessfully sought to force other financial institutions to throw it a lifeline. Chiyoda's failure, with nearly $27 billion in liabilities, made it Japan's biggest postwar bankruptcy.
The company has long been known as perhaps the most financially unsound of Japan's generally unsound life insurers, having failed to attract a foreign investor or Japanese bank for help, so its downfall came as little surprise. But like the collapse of the Sogo department store company nearly three months ago, the Chiyoda bankruptcy was a reminder of the enormous corporate debts that still infect the Japanese financial system. 
 Chiyoda had debts totaling 2.94 trillion yen, or $26.95 billion at current exchange rates, surpassing the record bankruptcy two years ago of the Japan Leasing Corporation, which had debts totaling 2.4 trillion yen. Sogo's debts totaled 1.87 trillion yen.
The problems at Chiyoda represent an extreme version of the broader trouble confronting most of Japan's life insurance companies, which are paying out an average of 4 percent on insurance policies sold a decade ago, when interest rates were far higher. With interest rates now at less than 1 percent, their return on assets is far lower than their obligations.
Chiyoda took advantage of new laws that permit financial companies to reorganize under court protection. Its president, Reiji Yoneyama, said today that the American International Group Inc., an insurance company based in the United States, has expressed interest in joining forces to reconstruct the company.
Chiyoda had had discussions with foreign companies that included Allianz of Germany. Those talks broke off last week.
Chiyoda, founded 96 years ago, is Japan's 12th-largest life insurer, with more than 400 branches and 13,000 employees. It is not a publicly traded company because it is owned by policyholders.
It is unclear what impact, if any, the bankruptcy would have on Japan's financial markets, which were closed today for a holiday.
Perhaps the most surprising outcome of the Chiyoda bankruptcy was the failure of "convoy capitalism," a system of good companies rescuing bad at the behest of politicians and bureaucrats, a hallmark of the Japanese economy since the end of World War II.
Just a day before the bankruptcy filing, Hideyuki Aizawa, head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency in charge of overhauling Japan's financial system, said the government had asked financial institutions with a relationship to Chiyoda Life to help bail it out.
"If Chiyoda Life should collapse, it will be the failure of a very large life assurer, which will affect policyholders, lenders and employees," Mr. Aizawa said. "As far as possible, we want to avoid bankruptcy and ensure its survival."
He indicated that Tokai Bank, one of the largest shareholders of Chiyoda, would be a likely source of assistance.
Chiyoda Life had asked Tokai for 300 billion yen, or $2.75 billion, but Tokai avoided coming to the rescue, saying it was in the middle of preparaing for its merger with Sanwa Bank and Toyo Trust Holdings.
Then, last week, when the three banks signed their merger agreement, Hideo Ogasawara, the president of Tokai, said Chiyoda Life would have to find an ally, possibly a foreigner, and drastically change its business model before Tokai would make any further investment in it.
That is tough talk from a Japanese bank president. It suggested a growing independence among Japanese financial institutions, which have long been obedient to the wishes of powerful bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance.
But banks and other financial institutions are now overseen by a new set of regulators. And the rules of the game seem to be slowly changing, albeit in a "two steps forward, one step back" pattern.

HEADLINE: Stock Picking's Newest Wave: Democracy

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
When Djordje Radulovic took a job as a research associate at an Internet start-up in May, he never thought he would fulfill his daydream of becoming a professional money manager, and certainly not by the beginning of the fall. But earlier this month, Mr. Radulovic, a 25-year-old employing a bargain-hunting investing style made famous by Warren E. Buffett, started his own investment fund.
It is called the Djordje Radulovic Space-Age Defense Fund -- Mr. Radulovic's stock picks include Northrop Grumman and Raytheon -- and it is one of 11 new investment portfolios being offered by his employer, Maxfunds.com, a privately held Ann Arbor, Mich., start-up that is one of six companies aiming to give individual investors a shot at managing money. 
 Certainly, inexperienced managers have run mutual funds before, and Mr. Radulovic is not unfamiliar with finance -- he has a master's degree in economics from Central Michigan University. But the mutual fund industry grooms recruits as stock analysts before they are given a public fund and generally supports its managers with research, analysts and managers, as well as direct contact with corporate executives. Mr. Radulovic does his research on the Internet, by himself.
This begs a question. Why would anyone want a money manager without that Wall Street pedigree?
"I see it as a benefit because there are a lot of people out there who follow the market and have great ideas," said Mr. Radulovic, who hopes to be able to outgun the $33.7 million Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace fund, his closest conceivable competitor.
Not surprisingly, it is easy to find critics of the idea of turning to untrained newcomers for investment advice -- many find the notion a hangover from last year's happy-go-lucky bull market.
Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund industry consultant, called the approach a "lottery" and said there were no guarantees that amateur investors could maintain stellar short-term performance gains.
"I think all of these are creatures that are popping up at the tail end of the greatest bull market in history," he said. "There is just a great deal of ego and chutzpah, for want of a better expression, on the part of people who would invest in and be captivated by this approach."
But a half-dozen companies have sprung up in the last year and a half peddling the idea, and it has attracted the backing of some of the mutual fund industry's innovators.
Hiring relatively inexperienced people to run mutual funds is only one approach being tried by a handful of new power-to-the-people investment companies. Another seeks to try to tame the maelstrom of the market by taking investment advice from a community of voices with all ranges of experience. Four companies have taken up this approach, known as collective intelligence.
StockJungle.com, a small Los Angeles firm, opened the StockJungle.com Community Intelligence fund last November. The fund tracks the portfolios of volunteer stock pickers who visit its Web site, then the fund's managers cherry-pick ideas from the site's community and do further research before making a final decision. They also use the community to find larger investing trends.
Why would anyone bother to share their stock picks on a Web site? Michael White, StockJungle.com's head of marketing, believes people who come to the site enjoy the competitive game of outdueling other investors and also feel compelled to share. The community's stock picks and track record are posted on the Web site, for anyone to use.
"There is an ethic on the Internet -- if I take value, I'm going to give back value," he said. "It's almost like Napster in a way. It's a lending library of investment portfolios."
He also said the company's tracking mechanisms, which record a user's buy and sell recommendations, expose people trying to promote what they know are worthless stocks or otherwise manipulate the market.
The StockJungle.com fund, which has gained 23.4 percent this year, is one of the year's top 10 large-company growth funds, according to Morningstar, a fund-tracking firm. But the $7 million StockJungle.com fund is so new that it is hard to tell whether its track record is more than a fluke.
Several firms are picking up the baton. The newest is WeVest, of Berkeley, Calif., which has as its vice chairman Tom Seip, a former Charles Schwab executive who was the architect of the company's groundbreaking One Source mutual fund supermarket.
WeVest's Web site says that the firm is planning a series of "collaborative" funds that appear somewhat similar to StockJungle.com's, but will use a more quantitative approach, with sophisticated computer screens culling suggestions from as many contributors as they can muster.
"Coming from Charles Schwab, you have a very strong belief in the individual investor and the wisdom of the individual investor," Mr. Seip said. "The collective wisdom of the individual investor, as an idea, ought to be even more powerful."
Two other firms, MutualMinds.com of Dallas and IPS Advisory of Knoxville, Tenn., have already filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for collaborative mutual funds of their own.
"The market is this superior entity that may not have a physical body, a will or an agenda, but it knows things before people know them," said Robert A. Loest, a fund manager and the chief executive of IPS Advisory. Mr. Loest said his planned IPS iFund, which will take its stock picks from a community of investors, is "kind of like the market in miniature."
"We're hopeful we'll see an emergent intelligence," he added, likening the approach to the wisdom of a bee hive over a lone bee. "The hive operates at a high level of intelligence," he said.
The other approach, the one preferred by Mr. Radulovic's employer, is focused on giving individuals outside of the mutual fund industry a chance to manage money. Looking beyond Wall Street has had some success before. Until recently, the $4 billion Firsthand Technology Value fund stood as the best performing mutual fund in any category over the last five years. The fund was run by Kendrick W. Kam and Kevin Landis, who had been executives at technology and health care companies before starting an investment club and then deciding to try their hand at managing a mutual fund.
"Firsthand proved you didn't need to be a Wall Street pro to be a good investor," said Mr. Kam, who co-founded Novoste Inc., a medical device manufacturer in the 1980's. He left Firsthand earlier this year to start Marketocracy, a Los Altos, Calif., firm. Since the company's Web site went up in July, Mr. Kam said he had enlisted 14,000 people to set up mock portfolios. He plans to track these portfolios for three years and then start a family of mutual funds run by the winners.
So what if one of the winners is, say, a 14-year-old kid?
"Well, then, it's a 14-year-old kid with the best three-year track record in the world," Mr. Kam said. "As a mutual fund shareholder, do you care if he's 14 if he delivers performance? As long as it's legal."
Every mutual fund has to be reviewed and approved by the S.E.C. StockJungle.com's fund has already passed muster with the commission.
Mr. Radulovic's employer, Maxfunds.com, is the most unconventional of any of these companies. It has created what it calls "synthetic funds," stock recommendations offered in conjuction with a new investment product called folios -- baskets of stock sold at a volume discount. Folios are seen as an alternative to mutual funds that allow investors to buy stocks directly. Maxfunds.com's service is aimed at investors who use folios but also want the kind of advice they would get from a mutual fund manager.
Initially, the service is free, but eventually Maxfunds.com and managers such as Mr. Radulovic will split monthly fees charged for their fund management services. To start, Maxfunds.com has enlisted the publisher of a technology newsletter, a small investment adviser and Mr. Radulovic to run portfolios. It also has devised several unusual index portfolios, including one that tracks the largest public companies in Atlanta.
"There are too many of the same old mutual funds and not enough unique and interesting ideas," wrote James J. Atkinson, president of Maxfunds.com, in an essay on the company's Web site. "The mutual fund industry usually comes to the party late, often after the stocks have already moved upward."
For Mr. Radulovic, a native of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, who moved to Michigan when he was in the third grade, Maxfunds.com's new funds are "incredible news."
"I got really excited when I first heard about it," he said.
Mr. Radulovic, whose day job is monitoring Maxfunds.com's database of mutual funds and synthetic funds, has an unusual investing approach for a 25-year-old, certainly not a style one might expect from a member of the freewheeling Internet generation.
He is a value investor who searches for bargain stocks that have fallen out of favor, in hopes of riding a rebound. In the last few years, value investing itself has fallen out of favor. This year, though, it has been resuscitated by a broad slump that has punctured the bull market.
In college, Mr. Radulovic invested in a real estate mutual fund and a European stock fund. Last year, he mostly avoided Internet stocks and, as he called it, the "tech craze." This year he has bought two battered blue chips, the AT&T Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. Both, he said, are good companies whose stock prices have fallen to unreasonably low levels.
He sees military industry stocks as having been undervalued in the past. The sector has revived this year.
Of his competitor, the Fidelity fund, he said, "it's not a true defense fund," noting that one of its top holdings was B. F. Goodrich. Though the company was known for its tires, it now manufactures aerospace components like landing gear and cockpit instrumentation. Mr. Radulovic acknowledged that he did not have the facilities of Fidelity, the Boston mutual fund giant that manages $1 trillion.
"I don't have the resources or capability to go out and meet management," he said, adding that he did most of his research on DowJones.com and Hoovers.com, which he uses for corporate profiles and S.E.C. filings.
But he will be judged against Fidelity and other fund companies. Maxfunds.com intends to track all of its synthetic funds and compare them against traditional mutual funds, like Fidelity's military fund.
"The goal is clearly to beat the performance of that one, but I'd like to be able to have a return of at least 20 percent," Mr. Radulovic said. "Otherwise it's not worth it. Why not just get an S.& P. 500 index fund?"

HEADLINE: For Mrs. Clinton, One Topic on Voters' Minds Stays Taboo

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns across New York State, she talks about everything from gasoline prices to the Buffalo economy to her first experience hunting ducks. But there is one taboo subject, always on the minds of voters, that came up yet again in Mrs. Clinton's debate with Representative Rick A. Lazio on Sunday. Why, she was asked, did she stay in her marriage?
Mrs. Clinton, who will mark her 25th wedding anniversary tomorrow, responded that "the choices that I've made in my life are right for me," then cited her daughter, her religious faith and her "strong sense of family." What she did not do was bow to the suggestion that the state of her marriage was anybody's business. 
 Both Clintons do talk readily about their work together on her campaign and have joked about their role reversal and its effects on their marriage. "She had so many people who wanted her to run and wanted her to do it that she really decided that she ought to try," Mr. Clinton said at a reception with his wife in Little Rock, Ark.
"And then I just practically beat her up time and time again, working on this announcement speech. She said, 'I've given a zillion speeches, why do you keep doing this?' I said, 'Because an election is a job interview, and if you get the job it helps to have decided in advance what you intend to do when you get there.' "
Mrs. Clinton responded: "I'm trying to do the very best job I can, but I want to take back every time I ever said to Bill, 'You know, you could have said it like this.' And there was that delicious role reversal when he was working on my announcement speech and making me practice in front of him, and saying, 'No, no, say it like this.' And it was a great moment for both of us."
Last weekend, the president had planned to be with his wife in Chappaqua on Saturday night and then was to watch her Sunday morning debate from the couple's home on Old House Lane. Violence in the Middle East changed his plans, but Mr. Clinton still flew up to Chappaqua at 6:15 p.m. on Sunday, stayed overnight with his wife, then left late yesterday morning for Washington with the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea.
Mr. Clinton has, in fact, stayed overnight with his wife at the Clintons' Chappaqua home at least 20 times since the couple moved in on Jan. 5, or an average of two or three nights a month. Although many of the trips were tied to Mrs. Clinton's campaign events or to presidential meetings and fund-raising in New York, at other times the president quietly left the White House at 9 or 10 p.m. after work, then returned to Washington late the next morning.
Mrs. Clinton also spends some nights with her husband in Washington, and talks with him up to six times a day on the phone.
Although it is impossible to know whether the president made those 40-minute flights on Air Force One to work on his marriage or simply to turn up for the cameras at Chappaqua coffee shops, he did publicly address the subject of his betrayal in August. "I'm now in the second year of a process," he said, "of trying to totally rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made."
The president also speaks in glowing terms of the wife he humiliated, and who is now the Clinton with a political future and the potential for carrying on the family legacy.
"When we first met and fell in love, I actually felt guilty about it because I thought I was robbing her of the career I felt she should have," Mr. Clinton said at a Silicon Alley fund-raiser for his wife last month in SoHo, one of some two dozen he has attended in the last year to raise $5 million for her campaign.
"I thought she was better organized than me. I thought she understood things about public policy I didn't know. I thought she had more talent as a public servant than anybody I ever met. I want to see this seat occupied by someone, yes, that I happened to have loved for three decades, but more important, whose love can change the future of America and New York in a positive way." Then he kissed her forehead.
Despite such displays of affection, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers have, as a matter of tactics, made a decision not to discuss publicly her relationship with the president, seeing it as an explosive topic. If Mrs. Clinton were to speak of her love for Mr. Clinton, her advisers say, she might be greeted with skepticism or even derision. If she were to talk of the difficulties in her marriage, they say, she would distract from a campaign that she is trying to win with her positions on issues.
Although the advisers acknowledge that in largely ignoring her marriage the first lady risks appearing cold and opportunistic -- and bolsters the view of many voters that she has remained in the marriage purely for political power -- they say that any discussion of the relationship would hurt more than help. "We don't want to talk about it, because she's the one running, not him," said one of Mrs. Clinton's senior campaign advisers.
The president may in any case do enough talking for everyone. At a Washington fund-raiser last month at the home of the Clintons' longtime friend, Vernon Jordan, Mr. Clinton effusively described the first-time experience of voting for his wife in the Sept. 12 New York primary. "I was happy as a kid on Christmas morning," Mr. Clinton said. "It was amazing. We got to go in and shake hands with all the election officials. And I got into this little voting booth and I realized what I was doing and it was just an unbelievable feeling."
At another Washington fund-raiser for his wife, in June, Mr. Clinton recalled his wife's entry into the Senate race. "I was surprised she'd even think of it," he said. "I said, 'Do you know how much this is going to cost you?' She said, 'You're talking to me about money?' She laughed at me. She said, 'You, who have never cared if we had a nickel in the bank?' "
Mrs. Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for this article, returns the coziness with an almost detached admiration for her husband's presidency, although she has on occasion been more personal. "I would not be standing here tonight were it not for Bill and were it not for all he has done for me," she said to a hushed audience in Albany on May 16 after the New York State Democratic Party nominated her for the Senate.
Longtime friends of the Clintons, who adamantly insisted that their names not be used, say that although the first lady in effect froze out the president for six months after he admitted to his relationship with a White House intern, he begged for forgiveness and told his wife that he would do anything for her. The Senate campaign, they say, presented an ideal opportunity.
David Gergen, the former Republican adviser to Mr. Clinton and three other presidents, basically agreed with that view by arguing in his new book, "Eyewitness to Power: The Essence of Leadership: Nixon to Clinton," that the president would not challenge his wife once her health care plan was failing -- in part out of guilt.
"The president asked the first lady in part because he believed in her talents, which was justified," Mr. Gergen writes. "He acted, too, because he wanted to promote women as national leaders, which was welcome. He also liked to share with his wife, which was generous. But does anyone doubt that he also wanted to placate her? Had it not been for his own past, I doubt he would have placed his presidency so fully in her hands."
After news articles first appeared about Paula Corbin Jones, Mr. Gergen writes, "it became obvious that the stories had privately humiliated Mrs. Clinton and her husband was deep in her doghouse."
Mr. Gergen adds that "perhaps I am wrong, but over the next several weeks, I sensed that he was in no mood -- and no position -- to challenge her on anything."
Whatever the case, Mr. Clinton has at times seemed like half of a classic New York-Washington commuter marriage. On April 5, after spending the day at an economic conference at the White House and entertaining Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter and six of their grandchildren over dinner, the president flew up to Chappaqua. He lifted off in a helicopter from the South Lawn as the Carters, who were to spend the night in their old home, waved to him from the White House.
A week later, the president returned to Washington about 8 p.m. on Air Force One after a trip to Denver, dropped off the press and much of his staff at Andrews Air Force Base, then switched to a smaller plane, a C-9, for a flight that night to Chappaqua. (The larger Air Force One, a 747, cannot land at the small Westchester County Airport.) Mr. Clinton had no public schedule in New York, and was back in Washington the next day in time to speak to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
In some of the more intimate fund-raisers the president attends on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, he speaks freely about his wife. "Not much gets me mad anymore, I'm feeling pretty mellow, but one of the things that still kind of steams me is when I hear somebody say, well, why is she doing this," Mr. Clinton said at the fund-raiser at Mr. Jordan's house. "She wouldn't be doing this if she wanted to be his wife and the first lady.
"The truth is, if she hadn't decided to spend the last 30 years helping me, helping other people, being a public servant as well as a private lawyer, she could've been doing this 25 years ago."

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Tangled in Web Of Drug Dollars

BYLINE: By LOWELL BERGMAN 

 BODY:
On a rainy day last June, a group of corporate executives gathered in a conference room at the Justice Department for a meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and other top government officials.
The executives represented some of the pillars of corporate America -- Hewlett-Packard, Ford Motor Company, Whirlpool. The session was not publicized because those at the meeting shared an unlikely and potentially embarrassing problem: their companies, they feared, were being singled out in the nation's war on drugs, and neither they nor the government was quite sure what to do. 
 With the intensifying federal crackdown on money laundering, agents had been tracking drug money into the accounts of American corporations and their distributors and dealers. In fact, federal officials said, about $5 billion a year in Colombian drug money is used to buy goods and services -- from cigarettes to computer chips -- from American companies.
What makes that possible is a system known as the black-market peso exchange, a complex money trade that law enforcement officials say has become increasingly important to the Colombian narcotics trade.
The system -- really a network of currency brokers with offices in New York, Miami, the Caribbean and South America -- is essentially an underground money market that lets the traffickers exchange American dollars for Colombian pesos. Those dollars, which stay in the United States, are then bought by Colombian companies that use them to buy American goods for sale back home.
But the government's efforts to seize that money have put it on a collision course with corporations, which say they are victims with no way of knowing that they and their distributors are being paid with drug money.
As they met on June 6, those executives, lawyers and law enforcement officials found themselves grappling with a conundrum: when does drug money stop being drug money? How far does a company's responsibility go?
The questions have been confronting law enforcement officials for years.
"What are we going to do?" asked Greg Passic, a former drug enforcement agent who now advises the government on the economics of the narcotics industry. "We've got the Fortune 500 involved in our drug-money laundering process."
For a long time, because of lax enforcement of United States currency laws, the drug traffickers were able to launder billions of dollars through American financial institutions. A crackdown in the 1980's pushed traffickers to what they saw as a virtually fail-safe system for getting back their profits -- the black-market peso exchange.
Their growing reliance on that system shows how deeply the drug trade has become entwined in the legitimate economies of the United States, Colombia and other nations.
Colombian officials said that as much as 45 percent of their country's imported consumer goods are bought with money laundered through the peso exchange.
On the American side, law enforcement officials said the exchange has largely eliminated the trade deficit with Colombia. The market, said the customs commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, "is the ultimate nexus between crime and commerce, using global trade to mask global money laundering."
So far, no large American company has faced criminal charges. And companies have almost always been able to prevent federal officials from keeping money that has been seized.
But in the last few years, as frustration has risen, the government has taken a tougher line. There have been Congressional hearings intended to put companies on notice by name. Prosecutors have issued warnings and stepped up efforts to seize laundered money.
At the same time, the government has encouraged companies to institute "know your customer" policies similar to those used in the financial industry. The policies gave dealers and distributors techniques for recognizing money laundering. Thus educated, the government thought, the companies would be less able to argue that they simply could not have known.
In drawing the line between legitimate and illegitimate profits, the government must not only prove that the money came from drug deals; it must show that the recipient "knew or should have known" its source.
In the war on drugs, that line has proved very fuzzy.
 
Trading Dollars for Pesos
Congress passed the first money-laundering laws in the early 1970's -- requiring, among other things, that banks report any cash transaction over $10,000 -- but the laws were loosely enforced. By 1979, the Federal Reserve Bank in Miami had more cash than the other federal reserve banks combined.
It took the uproar over the cocaine epidemic in the early 80's for banks to comply with the law. And with the resulting crackdown, traffickers resorted to the black market, which for decades had provided Colombian businesses with dollars at less than the official exchange rate of 2,000 pesos to the dollar. The rate in Colombia is fixed by the government.
One peso broker recently agreed to describe how the system works.
The process begins when the broker receives a call from a Colombian drug trafficker or his American representative. The two negotiate an exchange rate for pesos, usually 30 percent to 40 percent below the fixed rate. So $10,000 might be worth 12 million pesos instead of 20 million at the official rate.
The dollars are then delivered to the broker, who promises to deliver pesos to the trafficker's bank account after the dollars are sold to Colombian businesses. The dealer's insurance is the broker's knowledge that to do otherwise would almost surely mean death.
The broker maintains several runners -- "smurfs," in law enforcement lingo -- who deposit the cash into hundreds of United States bank accounts in amounts of less than $10,000, to avoid scrutiny.
At the same time, the broker's office in Colombia negotiates with business people there who want cheap dollars to buy everything from consumer goods to helicopters.
Usually, that exchange rate is 20 percent below market, so a business owner in Colombia might pay 16 million pesos, instead of 20 million pesos at the fixed rate, for $10,000.
The pesos are then transferred -- in this example, 12 million pesos -- to the traffickers' accounts. The broker keeps the difference, 4 million pesos in this instance. Then at the businessman's direction, the dollars in the American banks are used to pay for American goods.
The peso brokerage is one part of the process that supplies Colombia with inexpensive goods from the United States and around the world. Colombian authorities said the goods were often smuggled into the country, costing Colombia more than $300 million a year in tax revenue.
Colombia has made collecting that lost revenue a priority. But the black market has considerable appeal because it puts a lot of inexpensive foreign goods on the Colombian market.
The exchange has also increased American exports to Colombia.
"This is positive for U.S. business, there is no doubt about it," said Mike Wald, who runs a consortium of law enforcement agencies in Florida focusing on the peso exchange. "The Colombian, if he pays less for his dollars, can buy more goods. That's a pretty obvious economic fact. But we have to realize where this money originates. It's drug money."
 
Tangled With Drug Money
Two companies that have turned up in the American government's anti-laundering efforts are Phillip Morris and Bell Helicopter Textron.
Phillip Morris products in particular have been a major presence in Colombia. Marlboro cigarettes are readily available at prices investigators said indicated that they were bought with black market dollars and smuggled into the country.
Earlier this year, Phillip Morris was sued in the Eastern District of New York by the Colombian tax collectors. The federal lawsuit accused the company of being involved in cigarette smuggling and in the laundering of drug proceeds.
Phillip Morris has denied the allegations, saying that it did not know its products were being exploited for money laundering. In addition, without admitting wrongdoing, it recently signed an agreement with Colombia, pledging to stop its products from entering the black market or being used to launder money.
In 1995, in Federal District Court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Phillip Morris's former distributors in northern South America were indicted for laundering $40 million in black market pesos.
A member of the defense lawyers said the money was used to buy Phillip Morris cigarettes, liquor and other products for the Colombian market. But the defense team member said the defendants did not know that the money came from drug sales.
Phillip Morris severed its relationship with the defendants in 1998 and said it did not know that its products were being smuggled or that black market money was used to buy them.
In another case, Bell Helicopter is challenging the seizure of $300,000 from its accounts, money, according to court documents, that was generated by drug smuggling.
It was part of more than $1 million that the United States believed was supplied a peso-exchange broker to buy a Bell aircraft. The helicopter was seized in Panama at the request of the United States.
The case has become a sore point for American law enforcement in part because the helicopter was sold to a Colombian businessman linked to the country's right-wing paramilitaries.
 
Seeking Cooperation
The deepening struggle between prosecutors and business executives is what led to the meeting with Attorney General Reno and other government officials, including Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder and Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat. The companies invited were Hewlett-Packard, Ford, General Motors, Sony, Westinghouse, Whirlpool and General Electric Company, Treasury officials said.
None of the companies returned phone calls seeking comment, except General Electric and Sony. Sony said it would have no comment. But General Electric's counsel, Scott Gilbert, said his company instituted a strict compliance program five years ago, after reports that its refrigerators were being used in money-laundering operations.
As part of its policy, Mr. Gilbert said General Electric warns dealers to be aware of "red flags" -- a customer's lack of interest in discounts, an unwillingness to give information about the company, or unusual forms of payment like large amounts of cash or checks written on the account of a third party.
The new policy has cut sales of appliances to Latin America by 23,000 units, or over 20 percent, said an executive at General Electric.
Alan Dooty, a customs official, said the companies had been selected for the June meeting because their products had shown up in the black market in Colombia. The exception was General Electric, which he singled out as a "good citizen."
Before the meeting, some of the companies expressed concern that they would be punished. But once they arrived, Mr. Dooty said, they were assured that the government was seeking cooperation.
A follow-up session in July bogged down in legal murk.
An industry representative familiar with the meeting said: "The Justice and Treasury Departments realized that they were trying to identify drug money that had morphed, been transformed, in layers of transactions involving distributors, authorized dealers, financing arrangements with unregulated money lenders called 'factors' and the other realities of commercial life."
More meetings are scheduled for this fall.

BROOKLYN: MAN SHOOTS INTRUDERS
Two would-be robbers were thwarted yesterday when the owner of a Brooklyn card shop drew a pistol and shot them both, the police said. The authorities said the owner, Ming Chen, 43, fired several shots at the men inside Joe's Card Store on Cortelyou Road after one pointed a semiautomatic pistol at him and demanded money. One of the men, James Baylor, was in critical condition at Kings County Hospital Center with four gunshot wounds. The other, Antoine Miles, was struck once in the abdomen and was in stable condition, the authorities said. Both men were charged with attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon. Mr. Chen, who the police said used a legally registered pistol, was not injured or charged. C. J. Chivers (NYT) 

GARDEN CITY: CURB OF COUNTY EXECUTIVE URGED
A referendum on whether to restrict the Nassau County executive's ability to award certain contracts without competitive bidding will be placed before voters on Nov. 7. If adopted, the change would make what is now a governmental agreement into a matter of law: the County Legislature's Rules Committee can approve personal service contracts, like those with law or computer firms, which are often worth $25,000 or more. The same arrangement is now in effect as an an agreement between Judith A. Jacobs, the Legislature's presiding officer, and the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, above, said Darren Bloch, Ms. Jacobs's chief of staff. Al Baker (NYT)
 
ALBANY: 25 MILLION ROTTING TIRES
Legislation signed late last week by Gov. George E. Pataki is the state's latest attempt to solve a decades-old problem: what to do with 25 million tires rotting in illegal dumps. The problem has become more urgent because the dumps are also prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes. West Nile virus, which has sickened at least 17 people in New York City and New Jersey and killed one this year, is carried by mosquitoes. The dumps could become larger as a result of the recent nationwide recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires. The law creates the State Council on Scrap Tire Management, which will give grants to businesses to recycle dumped tires. (AP)

WILDWOOD: REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
For years preservationists have championed the pink flamingos and plastic palms of the 1950's motels in the struggling beach resort town of Wildwood. Yesterday, the city officially embraced its low-brow culture by presenting a $40 million redevelopment plan that would include a neon gateway arch on Rio Grande Avenue and eliminate a pedestrian mall on Pacific Avenue, the main commercial strip. Officials said the 1987 mall was a misguided attempt to compete with nearby Cape May, a beach resort of Victorian inns. "We are not Cape May," Mayor Duane Sloan said. "We need to embrace our character and not abandon it." Steve Strunsky (NYT)
 
TRENTON: SCHOOLS TO GET COMPUTERS
New computers will soon be arriving to start computer centers in places like housing projects, to bridge a gap between students at urban schools and those in the suburbs. The state has granted 26 school districts a total of $4.8 million to establish innovative computer programs to reach disadvantaged children and their parents who have little access to such technology. The program will eventually total $7.4 million in federal aid once another 24 grants are distributed. (AP)

FAIRFIELD: GREAT PUMPKIN RECOVERED
Four men, age 17 to 21, were charged with larceny after they were found with a 340-pound pumpkin in the front seat of their car. The police said it was stolen over the weekend from the front porch of its grower's house. Lt. Richard Gunter said the police spotted an immense object on Sunday morning protruding from the front seat of a car driven by Jason Razowski, 19, of Derby. The front passenger door could not be closed because of the pumpkin, and when Mr. Razowski was questioned, the police said, he said he and three friends picked up the pumpkin on the side of the road.

LITCHFIELD: TOWN OPPOSES HISTORIC HOUSE
The man seeking to rebuild the childhood home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, at left, the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," has hit a snag. The man, Chandler Saint, has not been able to find a temporary or permanent site for the house, which was dismantled and is now stored in two trailers on state land. The Litchfield Historic District Commission denied Mr. Saint permission to construct a building to cover the trailers because the building would violate local zoning laws. And in late August, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said that he did not want to override local laws to store the dismantled house. (AP)

HEADLINE: As Homework Load Grows, One District Says 'Enough'

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., Oct. 6

 BODY:
Her daughter's tears would start the minute Linda Markowitz arrived home from work.
It was homework again: math problems, a science report, worksheets. By the time Mrs. Markowitz had read enough of her daughter's science textbook to figure out how to help, it was 10:15 and they still had to go on the Internet to do research. Then, more tears as they argued over whether her daughter had time to practice her saxophone and get a good night's sleep before getting up at 6:45 to catch the school bus. 
 And that was just fourth grade.
This year, there are no more tears. There is time for dance lessons, Hebrew school, and even the occasional board game.
This year, Piscataway stood up to homework.
The school board in this district of about 7,000 students limited it on weeknights, from 30 minutes in elementary school to two hours in high school, "discouraged" homework on weekends, and prohibited teachers from grading it or using it as punishment.
The school board, which unanimously voted for the policy, said homework was putting too much pressure on students' already over scheduled lives, too often dragging parents into helping finish it -- read, doing it -- and becoming a substitute for good teaching in the classroom.
Some parents and teachers worry that fewer assignments will leave students less prepared for college. Some studies suggest that rigorous homework leads to better scores; other researchers say there is no correlation.
Still, the policy has made the superintendent of schools in this middle-class suburb about 35 miles southwest of Manhattan something of a hero among parents, not only those like Mrs. Markowitz here in Piscataway, but across the state and even the country, who have been phoning him at his office and on call-in radio shows to ask how they can push their schools to do the same.
Homework has come in and out of vogue through the longstanding debate over whether children need more rigor or simply more time to be children.
Experts say it is hard if not impossible to know how many school districts nationwide limit homework. The National PTA and the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, encourage limits similar to the ones imposed here; on the other hand, in 1998, the rural community of Akron, N.Y., outraged some parents by imposing minimum daily requirements that are about the same as what Piscataway sets as a maximum.
There is no question that officials in Piscataway have tapped into a growing frustration among parents who say homework is consuming not only their children's lives, but their own.
"We're attacking the fabric of an institution," said the superintendent, Ronald E. Bolandi. "I think we've opened up people's eyes. If Piscataway is in the forefront, so be it."
It was really not so long ago, in the 1930's, that cities including New York and Chicago banned or limited homework, and the American Child Health Association classified it as child labor. But after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, raising concerns about the state of American education, and again after the "Nation at Risk" report in 1983, policy-makers and parents came to see homework as a solution for schools that lagged woefully behind their counterparts in other industrialized nations. When the school board in the tiny California town of Half Moon Bay considered banning homework in 1994, it became something of a laughingstock, and the proposal was quickly scuttled.
Yet in recent years, many educators see a growing desire for more limits.
"Today, homework is not so much an issue because of legitimate pedagogical concerns, but because of increasing pressure on parents' time," said John Buell, a former teacher and co-author of "The End of Homework: How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, and Limits Learning" (Beacon Press; 2000). "It's not that parents don't want interaction with their kids, it's that when they get home from work, they don't want that interaction determined by another boss, i.e., the school. We don't want to have to again do someone else's chores. There are enough things we have to order our children to do anyway; there is enough stress in that relationship. Why aggravate it?"
Some teachers say they feel constrained by the limits, that the school board seems to be second-guessing their lesson planning. "A.P. parents expect kids to come home with homework," said Michael Modugno, who teaches senior English as well as the Advanced Placement class. "If they don't see books to read, plays to read, essays to write, I get calls asking what's wrong."
And in practice, the homework policy can be hard to monitor. Already, parents say assignments that teachers say will take a half-hour take two. And some high school students said teachers were finding ways around the policy, grading homework as part of class participation or saying homework assigned on a Friday is not "weekend homework." Several said they saw homework as a fact of life, policy or no.
"No one likes it, but if you don't do it, you only have to study more for the tests," said Troy Ogilvie, 15, a 10th grader at Piscataway High School, who was lugging a bulging backpack on a Friday afternoon.
In a town fiercely proud of its schools, where 70 percent of students go on to college, academic preparation is prized.
Teresa Hopkins, a mother of three, said: "You're not going to be competitive in the world by doing the least you have to do. That's the message we're sending. All you have to do is show up to school."
A University of Michigan study last year found homework increasing overall from 1981 to 1997, with the biggest increase falling on students ages 6 to 8, whose homework load tripled.
Mr. Bolandi found the same thing, anecdotally, when he toured the schools here, a former farming community now given to low corporate office parks and tidy new colonials. Parents complained that children were arriving home with four or five hours of homework, and that teachers were sending home assignments without teaching the concepts first, meaning parents had to brush up on their own skills or hire a tutor.
He also said that he was worried about the inequities that homework caused. Piscataway is notable for its economic and racial diversity -- the district is about one-third black, one-third white and one-fourth Asian, with 75 languages spoken in the schools. Some students cannot afford tutors.
Mr. Bolandi cites studies that show no link between homework and high achievement. But others studies are varied. One found higher standardized test scores among Chinese-American students whose parents demanded they spend more time studying. Another suggested that homework improved achievement, especially as students grew older.
Parents complained that assignments cut into family life, and into other activities that helped round out their children.
"For college, they say you have to see the kid as a package," said Linda Bellew, whose son is a high school sophomore. "I'm trying to give him that package, but a lot of homework makes it very difficult."
In middle school, Mrs. Bellew said, her son's homework forced him to cancel appearances at birthday parties and a christening. He sat at the dinner table with an open book many nights, and his assignments provoked countless arguments about whether he had time to go to karate lessons. She doubted whether he was even learning from it.
"If you have six hours of homework, you're not doing it to learn, you're doing it to get it done," she said.
Mrs. Markowitz envisioned more homework headaches when her daughter entered sixth grade this year: not only was she moving to a junior high school, she was going to be taking accelerated math classes.
"The last two years were nightmares," she said. "This was an A student losing her interest in school, losing her desire to learn. I just didn't see why they had to give 40 math problems when 10 would show that they get it."
The change in her daughter this year, she said, is remarkable.
"She is looking forward to doing her homework, because she knows she's not in for three or four hours of hell."

HEADLINE: Alaska's Voters to Decide On Legalizing Marijuana

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Oct. 5

 BODY:
"Vote Yes Prop 5," proclaims the large yellow mural painted on the side of a building here, complete with a large cannabis leaf. A poster on the window offers a quote from Ronald Reagan, though he has certainly not endorsed this particular measure: "Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves."
And just inside the door here at the headquarters of Free Hemp in Alaska are more than a dozen versions of pamphlets offering reasons for Alaskans to support the broadest marijuana legalization initiative ever to appear on a state ballot. 
 One pamphlet proclaims that marijuana is a far safer drug than alcohol, another says that passage of the measure would "free police resources to fight real crime."
And a third, "Marijuana and the Bible," has a drawing of Jesus Christ and observes: "Nowhere in the Bible does it forbid people to grow, use or smoke cannabis hemp."
Here, in a state that many Alaskans like to describe as the most libertarian in the nation, voters are being asked in the Nov. 7 election to say "yes" to marijuana in a single, sweeping measure that would not only legalize consumption of the drug for anyone age 18 and over but also create automatic amnesty for those convicted of marijuana-related charges and even require the state to consider restitution for such people.
Supporters of Proposition 5 are visible all over Anchorage, holding up roadside banners, handing out the leaflets, displaying stickers on their car bumpers. They gathered signatures from more than 41,000 registered voters to get the measure on the ballot, more than twice the needed number and a figure that represents nearly 10 percent of all voters in the state. And if marijuana users are derided by drug critics as laid-back and apathetic, the frenetic energy that many are bringing to the cause belies that image.
"It's a travesty that we lock people up and make criminals of them for personal use of marijuana," said James Garhart, a 51-year-old messenger who says he has used marijuana on a "semi-daily" basis for years and is now spending almost all of his free time working for the Yes-on-5 campaign.
"I think most people believe it's simply not a sane policy," Mr. Garhart said, "So I think this will pass."
Some opponents of the measure fear that the measure will pass because, they say, supporters are running a campaign that appeals to Alaskans' libertarian, leave-me-alone instincts and that often refrains from using the word "marijuana." The leading organizations for the measure have names like "Free Hemp in Alaska" and "Hemp 2000," championing a cousin of marijuana that has many industrial uses and only a tiny fraction of the drug's psychoactive properties.
"I'm concerned that the word is not getting out about what this measure would do," said Wev Shea, the United States attorney here during the Bush administration and now a lawyer in private practice, who is a leading critic of the measure. "This thing is so overbroad, unless you really take the time to look at it, you don't realize the vast scope of it."
The measure has plenty of prominent critics, including Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat who calls it "foolish and dangerous," and Chief Duane Udland of the Anchorage police, who has warned that the measure could create a "drug culture" that would attract wayward elements from all over the world.
Many state leaders remain confident that there is no way the measure will pass, with many citing the recent Alaska Poll, a periodic statewide survey conducted by David Dittman, a prominent pollster here.
Of 518 residents surveyed in the last 10 days of September, 42 percent said they were "strongly against" the measure and 19 percent "generally against," while 35 percent indicated they were supporting it.
Alaskans voted two years ago to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana, and Mr. Dittman said there might be strong support for decriminalizing the drug in some fashion because the state electorate did indeed have libertarian tendencies.
"There's certainly an element of that in the Alaskan mentality, but it does not extend to amnesty, to restitution, to the idea that marijuana would all of a sudden be legal for teenagers," Mr. Dittman said. "I think that's where they went too far."
Beginning in 1975, under a right-to-privacy ruling by the Alaska State Supreme Court, residents were allowed to possess small amounts of marijuana; in 1990, voters decided to recriminalize the drug. Still, private use of marijuana is rarely prosecuted here and, in interviews on the streets, it is clear that many Alaskans find that situation acceptable.
But that hardly means the measure will pass. For one thing, many voters seemed concerned that it would legalize the drug for people as young as 18. After all, Alaskans must be 19 to buy cigarettes and 21 to buy liquor.
Others said the amnesty was simply too broad or expressed fears, as one man put it, that passage of the measure would "attract a lot of the deadwood to move up to Alaska, get their check and get stoned." (Oil revenues enable the state to send a check from the so-called Permanent Fund to every Alaskan: this year, nearly $2,000.)
At the busy offices of Free Hemp in Alaska, workers answer phones and hand out brochures. People, some curious and some committed, wander in for information. A big sign reads: "Absolutely! No smoking anywhere, anything in the building."
Sil DeChellis, the treasurer of Free Hemp, explained that he and many other workers on the campaign detested cigarette smoke.
Next door, at the Cafe Pax, a coffee shop where painted cannabis leaves are part of the decor, the chairman of Free Hemp, Al Anders, ticked off the ways he thought life in Alaska would improve if Proposition 5 passes.
"We'll save money on law enforcement costs, and the police can fight real crime," he said.
"We'll have a stronger economy, and some increase in tourism," continued Mr. Anders, who said he did not like to smoke marijuana because it aggravated his bronchitis. ("I prefer it in my chili," he said.) And, he added: "There may be more government revenue, because people will figure out how to tax it."

HEADLINE: Timorese Refugees Tell of Terror By Militias After Foreigners Left

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: MALIANA, East Timor, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Across the river from this small border town, beyond the banana palms that glow in the early morning sunlight, lies Indonesia's latest scene of terror, where armed gangs have run wild, holding tens of thousands of refugees hostage in defiance of international condemnation.
There, in the Indonesian territory of West Timor, the defeated East Timorese militias have regrouped, rearmed and reasserted themselves, shaming the Jakarta government and its military and jeopardizing billions of dollars in international aid. 
 Almost every morning, small groups of frightened refugees emerge from behind the banana trees and ford the shallow river to safety, bringing with them accounts of intimidation, abuse and shrinking food supplies in a no man's land where power has been ceded to the lawless.
Since the killings of three United Nations workers a month ago and the subsequent withdrawal of all foreign workers from West Timor, the escapees are the main source of information about the fate of the refugees who fled or were forced from East Timor a year ago after its vote for independence from Indonesia.
"We now have 100,000-plus people in a hostagelike situation, in complete darkness where there is no international presence to monitor what is happening," said Bernard Kerblat, director of operations in East Timor for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Debriefed at the edge of the river, their feet still wet from their crossing, the escapees say that the militias have been tightening their grip in the absence of a foreign presence.
"They tell us there is a roll call every night," Mr. Kerblat said. "If they go to the market or to trade at the border they have to leave behind relatives in the camps. When they go to the fields there are militia on motorcycles watching them. What they are also telling us is that they are living on the edge of survival since the unplugging of United Nations aid."
The militias appear motivated by what seems to be the unrealistic hope of reversing the independence vote or chopping off a chunk of East Timorese territory. Or, as in their rampage there after the vote when they forced more than a quarter of the population across the border into the west, they may also be acting now out of sheer hatred and revenge.
Despite pleas and pressure from abroad, the Indonesian government has failed to disarm and disband the militias and free the hostage refugees. In response, the United States and others have threatened to postpone a meeting this month in Tokyo at which donors are to agree on the disbursement of $5.6 billion in aid to the struggling Indonesian economy.
Indonesian officials have reacted with a now-familiar mixture of promises, prevarications and angry nationalistic language. Some diplomats say the statements of President Abdurrahman Wahid suggest that he is not being fully informed on the situation.
Humiliated by the militia killings of the United Nations workers on Sept. 6 -- while he was visiting the United Nations in New York -- Mr. Wahid sounded plaintive when he said: "I received a telephone call today saying we are in full control of the area."
For Indonesia, the militias are in some ways an attack dog that has turned against its trainer.
Recruited and armed by the military in a failed attempt to subvert East Timor's independence referendum last year, the militias, now numbering perhaps 2,000 men, have become a rogue force that highlights the government's weakening control of portions of its territory.
Still backed by elements of the military and by antigovernment spoilers, the militias are also a symptom of the fraying of the military chain of command, in which Jakarta's mandate in unstable areas like Aceh, Irian Jaya and the Maluku islands seems only a distant echo.
The issue will come before the United Nations Security Council again on Wednesday, when Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab is scheduled to present Indonesia's case.
"I've enough ammunition to convince the United Nations that what they have been saying about Indonesia being unable to control the situation is incorrect," he told reporters in Jakarta. "If there is someone saying that people are afraid to walk about in the refugee camps, I'll say that's incorrect."
West Timor has become an international issue both because of the attacks on United Nations workers and because the aggressive militias now threaten to destabilize both East Timor and Indonesia.
In East Timor, they appear bent on complicating the fragile birth of a nation that voted for independence from Indonesia on Aug. 30, 1999.
In the last two or three months, they have stepped up armed incursions across the 100-mile-long border, clashing several times with foreign peacekeepers and killing two of them. The peacekeepers report that the militias, operating in small units, are increasingly well armed and trained, with new boots and bullets to spare.
Speaking in New York a week ago, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations administrator for East Timor, noted that there had yet to be arrests in the Sept. 6 killings although a large crowd -- including passive members of the Indonesian police and military -- had witnessed them.
"There could hardly be a more eloquent demonstration of Indonesia's current inability to deal effectively with the problem," he said. "This is impunity running rampant."
It is an impunity that the militias learned last year in East Timor. Although they failed to stop the population from voting overwhelmingly for freedom, they did succeed in laying waste to much of the territory, killing more than 1,000 people and destroying about 70 percent of its buildings.
And in a breathtaking logistical exercise, they mobilized ferries and convoys of trucks to transport perhaps 250,000 people, out of East Timor's population of 800,000, into West Timor.
Although about half of those people have returned to East Timor, the others remain for a variety of reasons. Some stay voluntarily, others against their will.
Some are members of the militia or East Timorese members of the Indonesian military who, along with their families, do not wish to return home, or are afraid to. Some worked in the Indonesian civil service and would lose their government pensions and benefits if they returned to what is now a foreign country.
But officials estimate that 60 percent of the people in the camps would return if they were not prevented from doing so by force and by disinformation. Escapees say the militias have told them that United Nations peacekeepers have run amok in East Timor and will rape and kill them if they go home.
"The militias abuse us and they abuse the soldiers too," said one escapee, Fernando Noronha. "They walk around with machetes and knives and homemade pistols. They say, 'If you want to go home, please do, but when the peacekeepers leave we will come and kill all of you.' "
The window for escapes may not last long. And if it closes, West Timor may become an even darker and more hidden place.
In the days leading up to the international donors' meeting in Tokyo, the Indonesian police and military have begun a high-profile sweep for weapons in the camps where the militia both control and blend in with the population.
Only a handful of guns have been recovered, which has led foreign officials to call the sweep "pathetic" and "lame in the extreme." In one instance, a group of militia members confronted the police and seized back a number of automatic rifles.
In some areas, though, the sweep appears to have pushed militia leaders into hiding, and their momentary departure has allowed the current trickle of escapes.
But whatever happens next inside the camps, the border itself will soon become impassable. The annual monsoon rains are about to begin, the river will swell and escape will become more difficult than ever.

HEADLINE: COLLECTING;
The Man With 40 Corvettes, and Other Classic Tales

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM

 BODY:
IN this, the Internet era, when "instant" is too slow for some people, millions of Americans still want to go fast the old-fashioned way -- with lots of chrome, authentic hubcaps and engines that evoke a mechanical age, not a technological one. Some crave power, some chase status, all seek to be one with their car of yesteryear.
But not just any car. It must be the right car. A car that says, "This is who I really am." 
 Sheathed in metal, literally wearing the thing they love, drivers of vintage and collectible cars exist in a comforting and contemporaneous past, transcending time. If motoring can be romantic, a 1958 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 is Freud on overdrive.
Day to day, of course, we drive minivans to take the children to soccer. We drive aging Corollas to the train station. But some of us also drive ancient MG's or Thunderbirds or Coupe DeVilles to get to places even MapQuest cannot pinpoint.
The conventional wisdom goes like this: Baby boomers, with empty nests and expendable income, are prepared to indulge their automotive fantasies, and you can always tell who owns what. New-economy entrepreneurs demand investment-grade European cars; middle-aged former denizens of high school auto shop covet muscle cars like the Plymouth Barracuda and Dodge Challenger. Losers end up with the A.M.C. Gremlin.
Yes and no. Most car people are tinkerers. Many have been enamored of intake manifolds since adolescence. Some want to make a statement. Some want a link with their childhood. Some just like the car. And some, like Chip Miller, like the car a lot.
At 57, he has been wiping greasy hands on overalls since junior high school. He owns 40 vintage Corvettes. "I have insane amounts of garage space," he said.
"I was in the car culture when it was really happening," added Mr. Miller, who, with his partner, Bill Miller (no relation), owns the Carlisle, Pa., fairgrounds, home to two big car meets, Spring Carlisle and Fall Carlisle.
"I was 13 1/2 years old, and I had a one-mile walk home from school," he said. "I found this tiny car magazine in the gutter, about half the size of a regular magazine. I must have read that thing 10 times. I didn't know anything about cars. My parents hated cars except to drive them. My dad would never check the oil. He'd wait for steam to come out before checking the water level in the radiator."
AT 15, a year before he could get a driver's license, Chip Miller bought his first car, a 1951 Ford coupe. Price: $100. It needed work.
While his classmates at Jenkintown High School, near Philadelphia, were playing baseball, he was scouring junkyards for transmission bolts.
One car led to another, even as life intervened. He graduated from the two-year engineering program at the State University of New York at Farmingdale. He married. He bought another old Ford. Eventually, Fords gave way to Corvettes, and the passion intensified.
In the early 70's, the two Mr. Millers met at a car auction. Chip Miller owned a '54 Corvette at the time. He had planned to take it to the big meet at Hershey, Pa., but exhibitors were limited to models from 1940 and earlier. Feeling left out, the two men started their own show, in Carlisle. The first, Prewar '74, attracted cars from the 40's, 50's and 60's. There were 800 stalls at the first show. Now, on 81 acres, there are 8,200 stalls and a car corral with 1,800 classic cars.
Among them is one of Chip Miller's Corvettes, with the lowest mileage of any car at the show from the first production year.
"They only made 300 in 1953," he said. "I paid $5,000 for it in 1972. It's the centerpiece of my collection. The only one I ever borrowed money for. Today it's worth $250,000, and the odometer reads 8,788. I'm committed never to turning it to five digits."
Chip Miller's story begins to sound familiar once you start talking to other owners of old cars. Some, like Mr. Miller, have made careers out of their passion. Others simply enjoy weekend drives, or going to a car show and preening. They are, or have become, what they drive.
No one who knows the vintage-car field can quantify the obsession. Hemmings Motor News, the car traders' bible, won't even guess, although it lists more than 9,000 car clubs on its Web site. The Antique Automobile Club of America, in Hershey, says it has no idea how many collectors exist or how much they spend on restorations each year.
But Ty Bennett, a spokesman for Kruse International of Auburn, Ind., an auction house that sells cars nationwide, provided a hint. Kruse, the largest auctioneer of its kind, says it has sold 350,000 vintage or collectible cars in the last 30 years for $3.5 billion. The size of the huge secondary market in accessories and auto parts is anybody's guess. If all these buyers voted in a bloc, American politics might be changed forever.
RICHARD BEABOUT bought his first DeSoto in 1986. It was a 1947 sedan that had been in a barn for 20 years. He had never owned a DeSoto, but had driven Chryslers for years. He and his wife, Betty, needed an older car to enter an antiques-auto hill climb -- timed like a drag race -- near their home in Marshall, Ill., a town near the Indiana border about 90 miles west of Indianapolis. So they trucked the car home and went to work.
"Well," said Mr. Beabout (pronounced BEE-bout), 64, a retired machinist for Caterpillar Tractor, "just before we got the '47 ready for the hill climb, a friend of mine in town said he had a '54 DeSoto. And I bought it." He paused. "Then I had two DeSotos."
In the hill climb, Mrs. Beabout drove the '47 and the '54. His wife won the competition.
"She's now known as the racing grandmother in the national DeSoto Club," Mr. Beabout said.
After the DeSotos came a '36 Chrysler Airflow and then more DeSotos. "I have six cars in a two-car garage," he said, laughing. "But we've expanded several times."
If Mr. Beabout is an accidental DeSoto owner ("It could have been a Hudson or a Packard, I guess"), Joel Cooper, a 46-year-old mail carrier in Hartford, is the man with a mission: the 1970 Dodge Dart. No other year will do.
"I've probably stripped 25 of them, to get parts for the ones I'm working on," Mr. Cooper said.
There was a time when he could barely change transmission oil. "I knew nothing," he said.
But the big Dodge engines available in the early 70's, and the lure of street racing, sold him on the Dart, a car that started as a compact family sedan and grew to be part of a Dodge-Plymouth cohort with names like Demon, Duster and Barracuda.
Mr. Beabout is a DeSoto guy. Mr. Cooper is a Dodge guy.
Until recently, it had never occurred to me that I, too, could be a car guy. I drove a 1992 Mercury Topaz, a car I did not wish to be, and a car decidedly not of pedigreed vintage.
My Topaz was too much like the cars I grew up with: anonymous, unreliable, uncool. And certainly not collectible. At the end, it was barely functioning as a station car, with 130,000 miles on the odometer, no air-conditioning (I gave up after it failed for the third time) and a $900 brake job on the horizon. Its book value, if perfect, was less than $500.
Which made it worthy of inclusion in the pantheon of clunkers that my father had owned: a sinister black 1948 Mercury sedan, a used '54 DeSoto convertible with the transmission that caught fire and a '63 Dodge Dart with turquoise, grease-absorbing upholstery.
Only one of Dad's cars ever worked well -- the bilious green 1955 Plymouth Plaza. But like the Topaz, it began to show its age. Same problem with the old Mercury. Brand new in '48, it looked a lot like a '39, the year Ford first brought out the Mercury line.
By the early 50's, once war shortages ended and design studios cranked up, American cars started to look more like bullets than homburgs. Sitting in the driveway, hearselike, five years after my father drove it off the lot, the Mercury was a brooding, humpback thing, compared with the flashy two-tone Pontiacs and Chevys that gleamed outside neighbors' garages. By 1960, I was the only kid on the block whose family car did not have dual headlights and tail fins.
But now I want that '48 Mercury back, or maybe the DeSoto. Or a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, the Doris Day of automobiles.
"It's adolescence," said John Heitmann, a professor of history at the University of Dayton who teaches a course on the automobile and American life. "They are the cars that were around you and wanted. Or maybe the cars you couldn't have."
"My dad had a '48 Chevy," Dr. Heitmann, who is 52, added. "That was the car I grew up with. A couple of weeks ago, I came across a '48 Chevy convertible at a cruise-in in nearby Kettering. I couldn't take my eyes off it. All those knobs on the dashboard, those little nuances of the interior."
Professor Heitmann drives a 1971 Porsche 911.
"Well, I don't think there's one pattern to collecting," he said. "But there are parallel kinds of motives. The overall pattern I see far more is with people who really know how to appreciate a technological past that puts the person in touch with the machine. The man-and-machine relationship emerges. People who drive old cars are like people who choose a Swiss mechanical watch over a quartz movement, or the fountain pen over an inkjet printer. The difference between my Porsche and the newer ones is like night and day. There is a phenomenal feel to an older auto."
Professor Heitmann is on to something. A combination of aesthetics and performance, something an owner-tinkerer can control.
This dovetails nicely with the thesis of John Armstrong, a research fellow in philosophy and the director of the aesthetics program at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.
"When we get really passionate about a particular kind of car," Dr. Armstrong said, "it is often because it taps into a deep longing we have. But for what? In a beautiful car, everything is 'just right.' The shape of the headlamps complements the lines of the radiator grille; the bonnet relates perfectly to the boot. If the chassis were an inch higher off the ground the car would lose its appearance of power; an inch lower and it would seem to drag.
"You can actually possess and drive a car -- you can get within this beauty and be part of it -- the better you handle the car, the more fully its qualities are revealed," said Dr. Armstrong, whose book "An Intimate Philosophy of Art," was published last month. "This enacts an ideal of what life ought to be like but almost never is."
That leaves nostalgia partly unaddressed. In the century that made them not only popular but also indispensable, cars have become part of the family story. You can trace family mishaps, milestones and personalties through them.
MY father's old Mercury let us down on several occasions, including in a snowstorm on the way to my grandmother's house. We sat in the cold for hours, and I got the measles. The used '54 DeSoto, which Dad insisted on taking to Vermont for a vacation one summer, caught fire as we pulled into a gas station on the New York State Thruway. The '63 Dart was totaled by a school bus that my mother did not see. Is that part of the reason those cars appeal to me?
Joseph J. Tecce, a 66-year-old psychology professor at Boston College, has spent years examining the collector in American society. He said people collect things -- cars, for instance -- for the satisfaction of being known and being knowledgeable, or to protect memories of the good old days. What we collect can make us feel good about ourselves, he said. In particular, cars can function as "social midwife or automotive alter ego."
And while Professor Tecce (the name rhymes with fetch) has graduated from the Volkswagens of the 60's and 70's ("I guess I was saying, 'Look at me, I am a humble college professor' ") to the security of a Toyota Camry, he cannot forget his 1948 Plymouth. "Inside it was comfortable and roomy, economical to run," he said.
"You know, wanting an old car like that Plymouth," he went on, "is kind of like wanting to go back and reverse the clock and get away from the Teflon, automatic, fast-paced jet age that we live in. To go back via the car, when there were fewer cars, less road rage, less road stress.
"It's two things," he said. "We can turn back the clock automotively, and we can turn back the clock psychologically. Some will want to do one, and not the other. Some will do both."
So the old Mercury beckons. And the Topaz? The Topaz, a discontinued model, is gone, given to charity for a tax deduction. I do not miss it. But surprisingly, my 14-year-old son was sorry to see it go.
He said he had hoped to fix it up, cover the seats with fake leopard skin and apply flame decals to the front doors.
He had hoped, he said, to get his license in that old car.

HEADLINE: In a Better World, Five 'Halo' Cars That Would Have Been

BYLINE: By THOMAS HINE; Thomas Hine is the author of "Populuxe" and "The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager."

 BODY:
IN 1956, a Newsweek cover depicted a car of the 21st century. It had a fighter plane's plastic bubble-roofed cockpit with a little spire antenna, three tail fins and wheels that were tucked well out of sight, perhaps because the designers were embarrassed that it did not fly. Half a century ago, cars dreamed of being airplanes.
But progress is not what it used to be. While we still expect automobiles to improve, their appearance need not dramatize their prowess. As long as they work well and are safe to drive, cars are free to be vehicles of pure emotion. Thus, the phenomenon of the "halo" car -- the PT Cruiser, the New Beetle, the reinvented Thunderbird -- which creates new audiences for designs that are decades old. 
 Newsweek's car of the future was based on the Nash Metropolitan, a cute, chubby two-seat Anglo-American economy car that, as it turned out, barely made it to 1960, let alone 2000. The hard-bodied futurism predicted for the car seemed at odds with the cuddly, eccentric Toontown character of that vehicle. In the unlikely event that designers decided to reinvent the Metropolitan as a halo car, it would be one in which Betty Boop would feel more at home than George Jetson.
Best, though, to leave it alone. The Metropolitan was perfect, in its perfectly ridiculous way. All the designs of the automotive past -- old favorites, youthful enthusiasms, false starts, dead ends and failed masterpieces -- are up for grabs in this age of automotive design. Here are five candidates I have chosen for reinterpretation.
1954 CADILLAC ELDORADO -- If ever a car marque needed a halo, it is the Cadillac, which has been trying to rediscover its identity for decades. The mid-50's models, with their tail fins and what Harley Earl, the General Motors styling chief, termed "graceful bulk," epitomized American excess. Now that American excess is very much back in style, it may be time to revisit your grandfather's Cadillac.
Compared with, say, a Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle, these outrageously luxurious cars of nearly half a century ago seem almost sensible. Sensible, though, is beside the point. These cars represent a high point in vulgarity, the triumph of nouveaux riches. Today, one would drive the car with a touch of irony about its nouveau riche appearance, while secretly reveling in its triumphant vulgarity.
1936-37 CORD -- This is a luxury car that is the opposite of the mid-50's Caddy, a consensus classic of elegant, subtle design. The Museum of Modern Art featured it in a 1951 exhibition, 14 years after it went off the market, terming it "a most solemn expression of streamlining." This pioneering front-wheel-drive car was designed by Gordon Miller Buehrig to be a smaller, more affordable version of the legendary Duesenberg, which he alsodesigned. The company was going broke. Most of the cars produced had mechanical problems. But the Cord remains an iconic car.
The front fenders were monumental, separated from the engine compartment so that you could see the horizontal louvers of the grille reach down the sides, all the way to the front door. This exaggerated the apparent length of the car, which was almost imperceptibly tipped upward toward the rear to give it a look of power barely under control.
1932-34 FORD V-8 B-400 CONVERTIBLE -- With the popularity of the PT Cruiser, which looks as if it ought to be carrying Edward G. Robinson and a bunch of thugs with machine guns, how about a real getaway car? These are the "dandy cars" that Clyde Barrow, of Bonnie and Clyde fame, always stole "when I could get away with one," during his Dust Bowl-era bank-robbing spree, as he noted in a fan letter to Henry Ford himself. "For sustained speed and freedom from trouble, the Ford has got every other car skinned," he wrote. Barrow was ultimately gunned down in one.
As a design, the Ford is admirably direct, a no-frills machine that delivered horsepower at a good price.
1950 STUDEBAKER CHAMPION STARLITE COUPE -- Because of its distinctive wraparound rear windshield, jokers used to say that this car didn't know whether it was coming or going. But its distinctive bullet nose really left no doubt. This was another aspiring airplane.
Like most other post-World War II Studebakers, this was designed under the supervision of Raymond Loewy, whose exploration of unornamented, fast-looking but unstreamlined forms reached something close to perfection in the classic, though commercially unsuccessful, Loewy coupe of 1953. The 1950 model, by contrast, was odd yet quite popular. Perhaps its strangeness could give a designer some clues about how to add excitement to the mainstream family car.
BUCKMINSTER FULLER DYMAXION TRANSPORT -- What the world needs now is a three-wheel lightweight car that holds 11 passengers, goes 120 miles an hour, gets 30 miles a gallon, can do a U-turn in less than its length, and looks as if it came from the Planet Mongo.
Actually, the Dymaxion looked more like an Airstream trailer with nothing pulling it, or like an airplane without wings, which was essentially what it was. Fuller, the visionary-tinkerer best remembered for the geodesic dome, produced several prototype cars over a decade, beginning in 1933. I am particularly taken with a later five-passenger model whose wheels could all turn when you wanted to park in a space exactly the size of the car. (Each wheel had its own small motor, too, though you didn't have to run them all.)
These were strange cars, and obviously required getting used to. The conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was one of the few people to actually own a Dymaxion, apparently found driving it terrifying and kept it only a few months. The day may come when we have to worry once again about the air we pollute and the oil we deplete when we drive. Fuller's characteristically American response to the challenge was not self-denial but invention. He liked to drive, and nobody thought "outside of the box" quite the way Bucky did.

HEADLINE: All Aboard the Foreign Language Express

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
Richard M. Crain had a sound business reason for teaching himself Japanese. "I looked around, and I said to myself, who has money?" said Dr. Crain, a dentist in Larchmont, N.Y. So he hired a Japanese dental assistant and, with her help, began learning basic phrases. He also installed a phone line with an answering message in Japanese, had his dental forms translated into Japanese and posted notices in convenience stores frequented by the growing Japanese community in Westchester County.
The plan worked. So far, he has treated some 500 Japanese patients. 
 There were a few bumps along the way. Once, Dr. Crain meant to say "please spit" but used the word for sushi instead. The patient just stared at him. Today, though, with an arsenal of Japanese words and phrases at his command, and an English-Japanese dictionary nearby, he said, he can "pretty much handle the whole thing."
Eric Ploumis, an orthodontist whose office is a few doors away from Dr. Crain's, has also given his business a linguistic boost. Dr. Ploumis treats many of the children who attend the local French American school, and about a year and a half ago, he hired a tutor to teach him French.
He did so, not to communicate more clearly with his young patients, who are mostly conversant in English. No, Dr. Ploumis also wanted to be able to connect with their mothers. "Whether it's how to write a thank-you note to a mother in French, or how to say, 'Your child needs four teeth removed,' " mastering French "certainly enhances my business," he said.
Dr. Ploumis and Dr. Crain are just the tip of a linguistic iceberg that has barged rather suddenly into the American workplace. As more immigrants pour into the country and as more Americans do deals with foreign companies, learning a foreign language has increasingly become a career plus, and sometimes a career must.
While nobody seems to track the number of Americans who are studying a foreign language, private language school enrollments reflect the trend. Karen Decker, president of the International Center for Language Studies, a school in Washington that teaches over 80 languages, says about 90 percent of the students attend for work purposes. Cheryl Gordon, founder of Language Plus, in El Paso, says the number at her school is closer to 98 percent.
And Helen Hamlyn, an official with Language Testing International in White Plains, an arm of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, says the number of language-proficiency exams administered by companies to employees has soared by nearly 1,000 percent in 12 years.
It is not foreign-bound executives who are leading the trend, either, Ms. Hamlyn says. Rather, languages are being spoken more and more by rank-and-file workers at banks, telephone companies and other service providers that have lots of foreign-born customers. Demand is highest for proficiency in Spanish, but is also growing for Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian and Hindi.
Sometimes, the goal is more to familiarize people with a foreign culture than to make them fluent in a foreign tongue. After entering into a business liaison with Nikon of Japan recently, for example, the microelectronics division of I.B.M. in East Fishkill, N.Y., put a group of its employees through a two-day immersion course in Japanese. The idea was to teach them a few common greetings and also a little bit about Japanese customs.
Margaret Cogswell kicked off the course with a briefing on the formality of Japanese culture and the complexities of exchanging meeshi, or business cards, with Japanese executives. "Japan is a society of manners," she said. The group paired off to tackle words like konnichiwa, hajimemashite and dozo yoroshiku ("Hello, How do you do? Pleased to meet you") and to practice the arts of handing out business cards and bowing.
Carl Bohnenkamp, a senior laboratory specialist, said the class made him realize he probably came on too strong in previous dealings with the Japanese. "I'm going to try to be a little bit more open and sensitive to their culture" in the future, he said.
The classes were conducted by the Language Immersion Institute of the State University of New York at New Paltz, which says it is getting more and more requests for such specialized training. The institute has taught Spanish to personnel at a New York area hospital and even given lessons in "party French" to executives of a New York media company who wanted to take Parisian clients out for a night on the town.
English, of course, is the lingua franca of the global economy, so American executives can travel abroad without uttering the native language. But such ignorance can put them at a disadvantage, while just a little effort can pay big dividends, educators say.
"Even though they hold the meetings in English, you miss the asides," said Harriet Barnett, a consultant at the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in Yonkers. Just making an effort to say a few words in the native tongue can make a good impression, she said, and "it sends a subliminal message that 'we are equal.' "
The movement has spread to some blue-collar workplaces, especially construction sites, where failure to communicate can result in accidents. John Dusch, the 54-year-old safety director of MKB Construction Inc. in Phoenix, said its safety record had improved since English-speaking workers took Spanish lessons this summer so they could converse with Spanish-speaking colleagues. And for the first time, "the entire crew eat lunch together," he said.
The linguistic demands of work can take some surprising turns. Police officers in El Paso once acquired drug-sniffing dogs from Czechoslovakia, and were unable to communicate with them. So they went to Ms. Gordon of Language Plus, who had taught some of them Spanish. Should they learn Czech, they asked, or should they teach the dogs English? Given how hard it is to retrain dogs, and that Ms. Gordon's expertise was with humans, they learned Czech.

HEADLINE: South Korea Points Fingers On Two Recent Failed Deals

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The South Korean government began trying to assign blame today for the recent failures of two large business deals that have raised questions about the country's commitment to economic reform.
Last month, the Ford Motor Company abandoned a $6.9 billion bid to buy Daewoo Motors, and a week ago, a group of investors led by Nabors Capital, a Houston-based firm, walked away from a proposed $480 million purchase of the Hanbo Steel Company. Both Korean companies are insolvent. 
 The Financial Supervisory Service criticized the Korea First Bank and the state-run Korea Asset Management Corporation, major creditors of Hanbo, for failing to shape a contract that would have penalized the Nabors group for pulling out of the deal.
And it faulted the Daewoo Restructuring Committee and its head, Oh Hogen, for failing to prepare for an event like the Firestone tire recall and the impact that might have on Ford's bid for Daewoo Motors. The government has insisted that Ford's decision to walk away was based solely on Ford's own problems and had nothing to do with Daewoo Motors itself.
"Daewoo's creditors failed to arrange a contingency plan for the deal against a possible pull-out in relation to the Firestone tire recall," the Financial Supervisory Service said in a statement. Ford has said its decision to abandon the Daewoo deal had nothing to do with Ford's Bridgestone/Firestone problems.
The government seemed to time its criticism especially to embarrass Mr. Oh, an aggressive advocate of painful corporate change. He was already scheduled to leave his job as head of the Daewoo Restructuring Committee on Wednesday, when his contract expired, but the government forced him to pack up today.
"It's funny, really," he said in a telephone interview this evening. "They had to have someone to pin the responsibility on, and I was that person. That's it."
In an interview on Aug. 10 in Seoul, Mr. Oh said that his last day in charge of Daewoo's restructuring would be Oct. 11, when his contract expired. "I have no intention of extending it," he said at that time, speaking of his contract.
He foreshadowed some of what transpired today in that August interview. "It's been a tough job," he said, speaking not only of his time at Daewoo but also his previous role as head of the Corporate Restructuring Committee, which supervised the overhaul of many Korean conglomerates in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 1997. "When you've done well, you hardly get any thanks for it, and very often, the people who are supposed to be on your side don't recognize the problems and want only quick solutions, not fundamental fixes."
The government is not his only critic. He left behind a string of angry foreign bankers, who were irked when Mr. Oh forced them to accept a deal under which they would receive on average only 40 percent of their loans to Daewoo.
"It's not just the government that wants to blame me," he said today.
He said he did not expect the government's criticism to hurt his prospects for work in the future. "I'll find something to do," he said.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
An Industry on the Brink of Good Cheer?

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
AMERICANS are drinking more good wine than ever before, and regardless of what happens to the economy, they could, by 2015, be drinking a whole lot more.
At least that's the way a respected California consulting firm sees things, and it backs up those rosy predictions with some fascinating figures. Since 1994, according to Motto Kryla & Fisher, wine industry analysts and consultants based in St. Helena, Calif., adult Americans' per capita spending on wine has increased 83 percent, to $64 a year from $35, while their yearly consumption has risen 22 percent, to 8.4 bottles from 6.9. 
 During the same period, premium wine sales among the same group have grown 77 percent, to 4.6 bottles a year from 2.6. "Premium" is a wide category; it includes all wine selling for $3 or more a bottle.
What is more, the consultants say, "if current consumption in key areas is projected to their future populations, total wine sales could increase 80 percent by 2015." Which is another way of saying that if, for example, the good people of Cleveland, a city noted neither for its profligacy nor its abstemiousness, continue to drink wine at their current rate, while their numbers increase at officially projected rates, wine sales in Cleveland will be 80 percent higher than now.
Heady stuff for Clevelanders, especially their wine merchants.
"We've never seen a period like this in the history of the wine industry," Vic Motto said. "The outlook is not only positive, it's euphoric."
In its euphoria, Motto Kryla & Fisher brushes aside the impact that an economic downturn might have on the wine industry. A cooler economy would be unlikely to "significantly reduce overall wine consumption," the firm contends, because it is "driven more by marketing and cultural factors than economic ones."
Maybe so, but is ours really "a wine culture"? There are probably Americans who have adopted wine as an integral part of their lives, but not all that many. Any astute wine merchant will agree that much of his income derives from other people's discretionary income. And as for being part of the culture, why have the French and Italians been drinking less wine every year since the end of World War II? Cheap wine may have been part of their lives for centuries, but they dropped some or all of it when cold beer and soft drinks became widely available.
As for marketing, most of it is concentrated on fighting over market share. Wine sales may be booming, but the domestic market is still unimpressive by world standards, and recent consumption is actually less than it was 15 years ago. Figures from the Wine Institute, a trade group, showed that in 1999 consumption came to about 2.02 gallons per capita, substantially less than the 2.43 gallons in both 1985 and 1986 and well below the 16.2 gallons consumed in the same year by Italians and the 15.8 gallons consumed by the French.
Worth noting, too, is the domestic per capita consumption of soft drinks (54 gallons) and coffee (30 gallons).
And not all the wine industry is getting in on the fun. In the Central Valley of California, where the grapes for most nonpremium wines grow, prices this year are at all-time lows. While cabernet sauvignon in the Napa Valley is selling for $3,000 a ton or more, Central Valley growers with long-term contracts are getting about $500, and growers with no contracts with wineries are being offered $100 a ton. A big grape crop was cited for the lower prices.
The 2000 grape harvest in California is expected to be 10 to 30 percent larger than the 2.6 million tons brought in last year. Wine exports, while still growing, were up only about 2 percent last year, compared with 26 percent in 1998. Analysts cite increasing competition from other wine-producing countries, the Wine Institute said.
While the wine boom is not confined to the high end of the market, overall figures, like those for per capita consumption, are more modest. All wines entering United States distribution channels last year set a record, 551 million gallons, but the increase was just 5 percent. Wine sales in supermarkets were up about 3 percent.
Still, the action in the expensive end of the market was fast and furious. According to the Motto Kryla & Fisher report, the more expensive the wine is, the faster the market grows. In luxury wines, those $25 or more a bottle, the market grew 30 percent last year and is expected to extend even further as baby boomers grow older and more affluent. Farther down the scale, consumers were moving up to better wines, or at least to more expensive wines.
In 1994, when adults drank 6.9 bottles of wine each, 4.3 of those were generic wines, a nice way of saying jug wines, and 2.6 were "premium" wines costing $3 or more. By last year, with adult consumption up to 8.4 bottles, the categories were reversed: 4.6 bottles were premium and 3.8 generic.
Taste was growing more sophisticated in other ways. White wines were still the most popular, accounting for 39 percent of all purchases, but red wines, at 35 percent, were the fastest-growing category. Roses, blush wines and others were off 3 percent, to 26 percent of purchases. Chardonnay was, yet again, the most popular varietal, with 18 percent of sales; white zinfandel was second, with 15 percent; merlot third, with 9 percent; and cabernet sauvignon fourth, with 8 percent. Merlot's performance was impressive -- its sales increased 26 percent to beat cabernet sauvignon for the first time.

HEADLINE: There's No Fair Price

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In his Oct. 4 column about price fairness and Amazon.com's charging different customers different amounts for the same products, Paul Krugman raises an interesting issue that is at the heart of all transactions in our new economy. The idea is to charge the maximum price that the individual or the market at large can bear without any regard to the cost of production or "fairness."
The dictum is in evidence from health care (different prices for different patients for the same procedures and drugs, depending on who is paying for it) to automobiles to open bidding for public and private contracts. Further, even if cost was a consideration for pricing, the relevant cost is debatable -- should it be based on full cost, marginal cost or life-cycle cost? 
 Finally, fairness is arbitrary as well: Fair to the buyer, the seller or society?

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
A Start-Up's Hiring Attracts Unwanted Attention

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
Like a lot of start-ups, Cardima Inc., a maker of medical devices in Fremont, Calif., found it hard to predict how big a permanent staff it would need. So, in 1993, the company hired mostly independent contractors to fill the gap.
Independent contractors work for a specified length of time for specified pay, and the move made good business sense. But it also created a management problem. Because companies do not withhold taxes or make Social Security payments on the earnings of such workers, any decision to rely on large numbers of them usually sounds an alarm bell at the Internal Revenue Service and state employment agencies. And that is exactly what happened. 
 Four years later, the Employment Development Authority of California investigated Cardima, reviewing records, sifting through accounts and interviewing employees, to determine if the company was unwittingly misclassifying its independent contractors on tax forms. Instead of being independent contractors, the agency wondered, perhaps they were doing the job of a traditional employee and should be classified as such? It turns out that some of Cardima's workers were not correctly classified.
"This is a usual thing with companies, especially start-ups," said Ron Bourquin, Cardima's chief financial officer. While he was confident it had not purposely done anything illegal, he says, he ended up hiring PrO Unlimited, a company in Burlingame, Calif., that manages contingent workers for clients, just to be on the safe side. (Contingent workers include independent contractors; freelancers, who do occasional work for companies at a set fee; outside consultants; and temporary, part-time and seasonal employees.)
Hiring PrO Unlimited was probably a smart move, legal specialists say, because the law is so complicated and executives can probably spend their time more fruitfully planning strategy than trying to figure out all the rules.
"It's very important for business entities to be advised of how independent contractors are properly engaged," said Scott Brenner, an employment lawyer with Barton Barton & Plotkin, in Manhattan. "If a company improperly characterizes employees as independent contractors, or consultants, there is risk that the arrangements could be recharacterized by the I.R.S., sometimes having grave unforeseen financial consequences. We advise clients that this is not generally an area to take great risk."
Indeed, the question of how to classify members of a company's work force has become more pressing as the hiring of independent contractors has become more common. The American Management Association said that 93 percent of the companies it surveyed last year employed some kind of outside workers. The study found that twice as many employers reported more use of temps and contract workers in 1999 than they had in 1996. As of February 1999, a total of 8.2 million workers -- or 6.3 percent of the work force -- were independent contractors, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Management is recalibrating its relationship with labor, and changing it to be more flexible," said Barrie Peterson, associate director of Seton Hall University's Institute on Work in South Orange, N.J. He helped write the American Management Association study.
Terrie Weinand, the chief operating officer of PrO Unlimited, the company hired by Cardima, says it is easy for managers to become confused. After all, they are focused on putting out a product, not interpreting tax law. What they ought to do is to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, Ms. Weinand says.
"We try to tell people that if they know they are doing something looked upon as shady, don't mess with the I.R.S.," she said. "In 90 percent of the companies they investigate, they do find at least some that misclassify workers."
Some specialists estimate that in Silicon Valley alone, employers have paid nearly $50 million in back taxes and fines to the I.R.S. as a result of misclassifying workers. And though many companies have policies on handling contingent workers, "the I.R.S. doesn't care what you wrote down in a policy manual, they want to know what you did," Ms. Weinand said.
"Under the law, independent contractors are not a worker, they are a business," she added. "But when they walk across your lobby and start acting like employees, that's when the trouble starts. If they sit in a cube all day, bill hourly, have no financial investment in the business and do similar work to what your full-time employees do, then they are, technically, an employee."
It is not just the I.R.S. that is becoming involved, either. Because independent contractors receive no company benefits, the Labor Department is quick to step in if it suspects abuses. Two years ago, for example, it sued Time Warner for failure to pay health and retirement benefits to scores of workers. A company spokesman said the matter was in litigation and declined to comment.
And in 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco ordered Microsoft to pay benefits to hundred of workers that the company said were independent contractors but that the courts found otherwise. Since then, Microsoft has begun reclassifying temporary workers as company employees if 12-month assignments have to be extended.
"This is Microsoft's way of saying to managers, 'Don't just make this a temporary assignment because it could be looked at that way. Is it a temporary assignment?' " said Kimberly Kuresman, a Microsoft spokeswoman. "If you need someone longer, let's make it a real position and hire someone full time."
She will not get any argument from Mr. Bourquin, Cardima's chief financial officer. Cardima had to pay about $25,000 in back taxes for independent contractors found to be employees, and he does not want to have to repeat that painful experience.
"The important part is going forward and knowing you are in compliance with the law," he said. "The state then sees that you made an effort and it makes everything you do more credible."

Chart: "Playing It Safe"
Five tips for employers who hire independent contractors.
 
Make sure all new independent contractors classify themselves as businesses for tax purposes.
 
Keep track of how long they stay with your company.
 
Pay them a set fee for specified projects, not an hourly wage.
 
Make sure they return all company badges, keys and passes at the end of each day.
 
Make them sign nondisclosure agreements.

HEADLINE: Why U.S. Giants Are Crying Uncle;
Europe's Top Antitrust Regulator Steps Up Merger Scrutiny

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 10

 BODY:
If American companies have any lingering doubts about Mario Monti's toughness, they are likely to be dispelled on Wednesday.
Mr. Monti, the European Union's chief antitrust regulator, is expected to approve the proposed $165 billion merger between Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc. -- but not without extracting a heavy price. 
 Already, after weeks of sparring with Mr. Monti and his merger task force, Time Warner reluctantly agreed last Thursday to abandon a separate $20 billion deal to combine the operations of Warner Music with the EMI Group of Britain.
America Online and Time Warner, meanwhile, have promised, among other things, to open their online networks to competing providers of entertainment.
This is the latest but hardly the only case in which European and American corporations have had their mergers thwarted or at least modified by Mr. Monti, a soft-spoken, silver-haired Italian economist.
Since he became the commissioner in charge of competition affairs last year, Mr. Monti has become feared and respected as a man with the power to derail some of the world's biggest mergers if he is convinced they would restrict competition.
Last spring, he blocked WorldCom's planned $115 billion combination with Sprint. Shortly before that, his objections forced Sweden's two big truck manufacturers, Volvo and Scania, to abandon their plans for a $7 billion merger. Also this year, Mr. Monti effectively blocked a $17 billion merger of three of the world's biggest aluminum companies, Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland.
This toughness is not entirely new. Mr. Monti's predecessor, Karel Van Miert, almost blocked the merger of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas in 1997. Boeing salvaged the deal by capitulating to demands that it abandon its exclusive long-term sales contracts with several airlines.
But Mr. Monti has stepped up the pace. With a staff of only 47 investigators on his Merger Task Force, he has picked his shots carefully but plunged ferociously into many of the world's biggest and most complex deals.
"People say he is much tougher," said Christopher Norall, an antitrust lawyer at the firm of Morrison & Foerster here. "But, to be fair, these cases present new issues where each wave of mergers brings successive waves of concentration."
Over the last decade, the European Commission has rejected only 13 mergers outright. Three of those rejections have come in the year since Mr. Monti took office, and two other companies rescinded their plans before they were officially rejected. But the number of mergers has escalated rapidly, and the vast majority are still approved without controversy. This year, commission officials predict that they will review 340 mergers, up from 292 in 1999.
Indeed, American antitrust officials have reached many of the same conclusions as Mr. Monti. Within days of the European Commission's decision to block the WorldCom-Sprint merger, for example, the United States Justice Department went to court to block the deal as well.
American officials did not appear as worried as the Europeans about the deal between Warner Music and EMI. But they may well be much tougher about Time Warner's merger with America Online, because Time Warner can use its vast cable television operations in the United States to provide high-speed online services.
In Europe, by contrast, Time Warner has no cable television systems and America Online is smaller than local online services in every European country.
Mr. Monti, a methodical man who measures his words carefully, often speaks like an academic and was in fact a professor of economics and adviser to the Italian government earlier in his career. Though Mr. Monti professes loyalty to the "social market economy," he has long been a champion of deregulation and free trade.
Before taking his current job, he spent four years as the European Union's commissioner in charge of harmonizing the various countries' conflicting rules. In essence, Mr. Monti led the effort to dismantle the legal barriers among the 15 members of the European Union.
He pushed for years to persuade European governments to adopt common tax practices, a Sisyphean task that remains mostly unfinished.
But he also showed himself ready to disregard relentless pressure from both governments and corporations. His biggest political battle and success was in rescinding the tax-free status of duty-free shops at airports and harbors.
Trivial as it sounded, the issue provoked furious protests and even street demonstrations by workers in various industries, including duty-free retailers, airlines and liquor companies.
Mr. Monti argued that duty-free shops merely allowed affluent travelers to avoid sales taxes because duties between European Union countries had already been eliminated. After a long battle, he finally won.
He replaced Mr. Van Miert as the competition regulator last year, after accusations of corruption led to a complete overhaul of all the top posts. Neither man was among those accused of any impropriety, but both joined all the other commissioners in voluntarily resigning. Mr. Monti was among a handful of people reappointed to a commission post by Romano Prodi, the European Commission's new president.
Mr. Monti differs sharply from Mr. Van Miert in both style and substance. Mr. Van Miert, a former leader of the Flemish Socialist party in Belgium, routinely made off-the-cuff remarks in public well in advance of final decisions. He also liked to bargain with companies, extracting as many concessions as possible without having to wage a full-court battle.
The current antitrust chief keeps his opinions to himself and he has been much more distant in dealing with the companies. Rather than starting with aggressive demands and backing down, Mr. Monti has picked his targets carefully and then has held firm.
Time Warner and EMI may have learned this a bit late. Mr. Monti objected that their deal would severely reduce the number of worldwide rivals in music distribution, and he was not satisfied when EMI offered to spin off some of its smaller European labels.
Under the rules, the companies were supposed to offer any proposed remedies by Sept. 18. But it was only two weeks ago, after the companies realized that Mr. Monti was ready to block the deal, that they offered to sell Virgin records, one of EMI's major record labels.
It remains unclear whether Time Warner and EMI simply miscalculated by waiting so long. But Mark Powell, an antitrust expert in Brussels with the law firm of White & Case, said the commission had been much stricter about deadlines precisely because it wanted to limit last-minute bargaining.
"There is much less room for maneuver," Mr. Powell said. "At the least, companies going into these deals should have thought through all their fallback positions in case the going gets tough."

A Retirement Fable

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
There once was a land where people lived only two years. In the first year they worked; in the second year they lived off their personal savings.
There came a time when the government decided to help out the elderly. So it instituted a system called Social Security. Every young, working individual would pay a tax, which would be used to pay benefits that same year to each older, retired individual. 
 For the first generation of beneficiaries, Social Security was a great deal. They had not been obliged to pay in when young, yet got the benefits anyway. But subsequent generations misunderstood the system. They thought of their required contributions as investments, though they really were tax payments, needed to pay benefits to their parents' generation. And they imagined that they could get higher returns investing that money in the market.
So eventually an ambitious politician came along, declaring: "It's your money! I trust the people, not the government!" He said he would let workers invest half their contributions themselves. When critics tried to point out that this money had already been promised to older citizens (whose own contributions had been used to pay benefits to the previous generation of retirees), they were drowned out by chants of "No fuzzy numbers!" And so the scheme was put into effect.
And the next year Social Security went broke. Without enough money coming in, retirees could not be paid their promised benefits.
I wish I could say that this fable oversimplifies this year's Social Security debate in some important way. But it really is that simple, and George W. Bush's proposal -- which calls for putting part of Social Security contributions into individual accounts, without any replacement for the diverted funds -- really is that irresponsible. Because Americans live more than two years, the drama will take longer to play out. Social Security won't go broke for about 30 years, so the victims will be those who are currently middle-aged, not those who are already retired. But the crisis will come much sooner, as the impending disaster becomes obvious.
Mr. Bush has made an important political discovery. Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged, because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likable would do that sort of thing. In last week's debate Mr. Bush again declared that he plans to spend a quarter of the surplus on popular new programs, even though his own budget shows that he plans to spend less than half that much. ("No fuzzy numbers!" roared the crowd -- but these are his own numbers.) And he insists that he has a plan to save Social Security, when his actual proposal, as it stands, would bankrupt the system.
But aren't there good economists, even experts on Social Security, who support Mr. Bush's proposal? Think of it as a Faustian bargain -- selling their souls not for power or wealth (maybe that too, but that's not my department) but for reform.
For there is a good case for Social Security reform -- if we are prepared to pay the price. The current system in effect promises today's workers that future generations will take care of them, just as they are taking care of today's retirees. As a Bush adviser, Martin Feldstein, has pointed out, this makes people feel richer than they really are, leading them to consume too much and save too little.
But to fix this problem would take a lot of money -- money to pay off the system's existing obligations. Or to put it differently (making the same point from a different angle): Since the problem with Social Security is that it makes people feel artificially rich, any real reform has to make them feel poorer. But that, of course, is not what Mr. Bush is selling.
What economists who support his proposal presumably believe is that after the election this can all be fixed. When the real plan is announced, it will actually make sense.
But it's hard to see how. Try to imagine a victorious Mr. Bush explaining that he has to slash benefits after all, or abandoning his tax cut so that he has enough money to pay for Social Security reform.
What is certain is that Mr. Bush's actual Social Security proposal would bankrupt the system. That's not a fuzzy number -- it's a cold, hard fact.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
A new look for an old standby: Con Edison revamps its corporate image.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ONE of the best-known companies in New York is undergoing the first substantial makeover of its brand identity since John V. Lindsay was mayor, Nelson A. Rockefeller was governor and a subway token still cost 15 cents.
Can you dig it? For those of you with memories of New York of the 1950's and 1960's, that is a hint about which company is changing its public face. 
 Yes, nostalgia buffs, it is Consolidated Edison, the electric and gas utility once known for the signs decorating its construction projects that read "Dig we must." Con Edison, as the company is popularly known, is introducing the identity overhaul this week, along with a logo -- the stylized letters "c" and "e" nested together -- meant to symbolize its business operations.
The changes are emblematic of the substantive shifts in the once-staid world of utilities as deregulation and competition require suppliers of natural gas, electricity and telephone service to vie for the attention of fickle consumers along with the purveyors of products like soft drinks, automobiles and fast food.
"The energy business is changing," said Frances Resheske, vice president for public affairs at Con Edison in New York, who is responsible for tasks like advertising, public relations and employee communications. "It's important we educate customers as to what's going on."
For instance, Con Edison is "now the transportation part of the business instead of the generation part," she added, "because we sold our generating plants as part of deregulation."
This is the first such overhaul for the Con Ed identity since 1968, according to Ms. Resheske. About the only element left unchanged is the corporate color scheme, which remains blue and white, evocative of Columbia University (at least to a columnist who was admitted there but attended Northwestern University instead.)
The rebranding is being brought to the attention of current and potential Con Ed customers with an elaborate advertising campaign by AG Worldwide in New York, which also developed the new identity program. The ads carry the theme "On it" -- sort of a cross between "Just do it," the longtime Nike slogan, and "Bring it on," the phrase now tripping off the tongues of the youth of America.
Con Ed plans to spend more than $3 million for the ads, which will be centered on employees at work around the five boroughs and Westchester County. The campaign was planned, Ms. Resheske said, before the actors' strike against advertisers and agencies that began in May, which has led to the substitution of workers for strikers in many ads.
The new logo presents the name Con Edison as conEdison. The "E" is meant to suggest words like energy, experienced, economic, equipped and experienced as well as to salute the company's founder, Thomas A. Edison. The logo will be emblazoned on everything from trucks to hardhats to bills.
Speaking of which, the revamping is undoubtedly likely to raise the hackles of those who reflexively condemn promotional campaigns for public utilities as unnecessary and extravagant every time they sit down to pay their electric, gas or telephone bills.
"If a company is evolving, that message has to be sent directly to the consumer," said Peter Arnell, chairman and executive creative director at AG, which since March has been part of the Draft Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"It's not ethereal in this case," he added of the rebranding, "because it's important for Con Edison to be seen in a new and different way."
Ms. Resheske agreed, saying: "This is not an image campaign. We are focusing on important nuts and bolts. It's about who we really are and what we really stand for, our commitment to our customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and our 14,000 men and women."
The choice of AG to modify the Con Edison identity is surprising because the agency is far more practiced in developing and polishing brands for fashion and apparel marketers than for prosaic purveyors of power and heat. Con Edison is no Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger or Donna Karan, to name just a few of the most familiar AG clients.
"Con Edison spent more than four months interviewing us," Mr. Arnell said, "and they really did dig" -- that a purposeful echo of the old Con Edison slogan, which he correctly recalled in a pop quiz.
"What we know in fashion and style applies to any industry," Mr. Arnell said, "how to distill the essence of a brand and how to represent it in a clear, simple way."
Besides, he added, "they loved the fact I grew up in Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
The business aviation industry is working to change its image.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
I'M here with the DNA," Michael Cessna McVey said, introducing himself at the National Business Aviation Association's annual convention and trade show, which opened here yesterday.
Oh swell, I'm thinking. Here's another guy touting me another new business airplane with code letters that I'm supposed to recognize, like BBJ, Boeing's hot airliner-sized business jet, or GV-SP, the new-generation General Dynamics' Gulfstream that will fly nine passengers from New York to Tokyo nonstop at Mach 0.83, or Cessna's seven-passenger Citation X, newly enhanced with boosted-thrust Rolls-Royce AE3007C-1 engines to fly at nearly the speed of sound, or Mach 0.92. 
 Turns out, though, that Mr. McVey wasn't alluding to an airplane model. He was referring instead to the genetic fact that he is a great grandson of Clyde Cessna, an early airplane manufacturer and one of the founders of the private aviation industry that ultimately spawned today's rapidly growing business-aircraft market.
Unlike most of the 30,000 people who attended the annual convention, Mr. McVey doesn't sell, buy, design, fly, supply, manage, charter, maintain, or even fly in business aircraft. Rather, he came to the convention, he said, to pick up information for a Web site he is designing to promote the pioneering aviation spirit of his great-grandfather, whom he described as "a dirt farmer from Kansas who was an excellent mechanic and who one day got the hankering to fly instead of riding around on his tractor."
Nevertheless, it was obvious that we were a long way from Kansas as this aviation extravaganza unfolded with more than 900 exhibitors on the vast acreage of the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center downtown, and several hundred more at New Orleans Lakefront Airport, where visitors crawled through dozens of the most popular models of today's business aircraft.
The business aviation industry has fully recovered from a slump after the 1980's that was partly caused by public and shareholder outrage about abuses of corporate aircraft by highflying wheeler-dealers who didn't hesitate to dispatch the Gulfstream, for example, to deliver a pet poodle to a summer house in Nantucket.
With more companies clamoring to own, lease or buy fractional shares of corporate aircraft, and with manufacturers and suppliers scrambling to dish up new luxury products like corporate jets with the size and luxury appointments of executive suites, the only question is how long the good times will roll.
Although some analysts warn that the industry is unlikely to see much more of the kind of growth it enjoyed in recent years, and is subject to a big fall if the economy sours, the numbers appear to be holding up. According to an annual Honeywell Aerospace forecast quoted in Aviation Week, manufacturers will deliver 6,800 new business jets valued at $90 billion in the next 10 years. And already this year, said Ed Bolen, the president of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, overall business-aviation billings and shipments are running 18 percent higher than all of last year.
"Ten years ago, hardly anyone got to fly on the corporate plane except the senior executives," said Marilyn Richwine, the vice president for corporate communications at Cessna Aircraft, which is now a Kansas-based subsidiary of Textron. "Today, companies are using their aircraft to transport middle management teams, and even mechanics and hourly employees. Companies have become so diverse and are located in so many different places, that they're using their airplanes almost like a company airline, sometimes even with regular shuttle schedules."
Ms. Richwine echoed a familiar theme in today's business aviation industry.
The theme is that a business aircraft is a tool, not a perk. Jack Olcott, the president of the National Business Aviation Association, said that the industry had assiduously sought to "change stubborn public perceptions" of luxury corporate jets and their fat-car passengers by promoting the company plane as a cost-efficient, if sometimes expensive, way to increase productivity.
This summer's record commercial airline delays, which still have some business travelers seething about days wasted in airports, have bolstered his case. He pointed out that business aircraft have access to 5,400 airports in the United States, and not just the 580 airports that are served by commercial airlines. At the same time, the business-aviation industry is lobbying hard to try to thwart growing community-based opposition to increased business-aircraft activity, and attendant noise, at smaller and regional airports, most prominently in Van Nuys and Burbank, Calif., and in White Plains.
But for now, business aviation remains on a roll. The number of United States companies with their own flight departments grew to 8,778 last year from 6,584 in 1990. Worldwide, the number of business jets in use has more than doubled since 1980 to more than 10,000.
Mr. Olcott pointed out that turnout for this year's convention was a record at more than 30,000. That's up from 16,000 10 years earlier, when the convention was also in New Orleans.
But perceptions are tenuous. There is still a small frisson of nervousness when exhibitors are asked questions having to do with cost and luxury on the vast convention floor. Among the exhibitors are purveyors of New Zealand sheepskin aircraft recliner seats and custom hardwood cabinets. They share space with sellers of the latest big-ticket items in the "heavy metal" segment of the industry, the truly big corporate jets, which now come outfitted with lushly appointed executive suites and even private bedrooms.
"It's what these people are accustomed to in their offices, in the hotels they stay in on the road, even in their automobiles," said J. Mac McClellan, the editor in chief of Flying, an aviation trade publication. "We don't criticize that level of comfort in those circumstances, so why should we in a plane, when they're conducting business?"
Still, a pilot who asked that his name not be used, said that while ostentatious nonbusiness use of the company jet might have become muted, it had not disappeared.
"Just recently, I was talking to a flight crew for a corporate jet in Dartmouth, N.H.," he said. "They'd just made a trip to drop off an executive's daughter at college. She was the only passenger."

HEADLINE: North Korean at White House, Continuing a Warming Trend

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton today became the first president to meet with a North Korean official, who carried with him a letter from the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, that White House officials said contained a series of proposals for a further easing of half-century-old tensions on the divided peninsula.
Officials described Mr. Clinton's hour at the White House with Jo Myong Rok, first vice chairman of North Korea's National Defense Commission -- and therefore one of the country's top military leaders -- as polite but somewhat stiff. 
 But the content of the meeting -- which included discussion of the North's efforts to become a nuclear power, missile proliferation and the search for the remains of Americans killed or captured in the 1950-53 Korean War -- was less remarkable than the fact that it occurred at all.
During the crisis over North Korea's refusal six years ago to allow international inspectors access to its main nuclear weapons complex, Mr. Clinton ordered stealth bombers, Patriot missile batteries and reinforcement troops to South Korea, fearing that a confrontation could result in a resumption of hostilities on the peninsula. That crisis was averted when the North agreed to freeze its nuclear program.
General Jo arrived at the White House today in a gold-braided uniform, which American officials said was intended to denote that for the first time the powerful North Korean military, rather than the country's far weaker diplomatic corps, had taken center stage in the negotiations with the United States.
His arrival also marked the culmination of a six-year-long dance that has included the gradual relaxation of economic sanctions against the North and talks about the control of its missile program.
Mr. Clinton stopped short of describing the contents of the letter from the North Korean leader, but a senior administration official said it was a response to a letter from Mr. Clinton to President Kim delivered last year in Pyongyang by William Perry, the former secretary of defense. "It described Kim's hopes and introduced General Jo, who clearly came here with discussions to talk about the full range of issues," the official said.
Those included American demands that North Korea permanently freeze its missile tests -- it has suspended those tests during talks with Washington and a slow warming with South Korea -- and that it end its missile exports. North Korean officials have periodically suggested that the country would be willing to halt those sales in return for payments from the West, but one official said today that "Jo hasn't yet been specific on that issue."
One of the mysteries of the negotiations with the North is whether Mr. Kim, the son of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, is truly in charge of the talks or is being led by a faction of the military.
Either way, the North has recently surprised the administration by its willingness to come out of its shell. The summit meeting this summer between the leaders of North and South Korea was a milestone; the session today in the Oval Office was, as one of Mr. Clinton's aides said, "unthinkable two years ago."
But the history of negotiations with North Korea is that every step forward is followed by a hesitant step back, as the North's leadership debates how much it can afford to expose its people to influences from South Korea and the West. Clearly, though, the leadership has become intoxicated with the thought that aid and investment may begin to flow into one of the few countries that missed the Asian boom of the last half century.
General Jo started today with a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. At the time, he was dressed in a business suit, but changed into his military uniform before meeting with President Clinton -- the image that he knew would be beamed back home. Later he toured Washington's monuments and even walked though Mount Vernon, the home of General Washington on the banks of the Potomac. Tourists were kept out so that the North Korean official could enjoy a private tour. Tonight he dined with Dr. Albright and Congressional leaders.

HEADLINE: France Telecom Seen in Talks On Data Networking Merger

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
France Telecom is in talks to take control of Equant N.V., a Dutch-based operator of a huge data communications network, in a deal that would combine Equant with the French company's Global One division, people close to the negotiations said today.
The complicated transaction would take several steps to complete and could value Equant at roughly $9 billion, these people said. 
 One option under consideration, they said, is for France Telecom to buy the 34 percent of Equant owned by SITA, a consortium of major airlines, for $3 billion in cash. France Telecom would then merge its Global One assets with Equant in return for additional Equant shares that would increase its stake to more than 50 percent.
Equant has been talking to numerous potential partners in the last year, including Global Crossing of Bermuda and Infonet Services of the United States. Initial talks with France Telecom broke down over the summer, but discussions resumed several weeks ago. A major stumbling block to any deal had been the valuation placed on SITA's stake and its demand for cash.
By combining Equant with its Global One business, France Telecom would gain economies of scale in data communications networking, which could help it toward profitability. Global One's sales are projected to reach $2.2 billion this year, or 9 percent of France Telecom's overall sales, but profits are not expected to materialize until 2002, analysts said.
Earlier this year, France Telecom gained full ownership of Global One when it bought out Sprint and Deutsche Telekom, with whom it had created the company in 1996, for $4.36 billion in cash.
For Equant -- which lost $34.5 million after special charges last year on sales of $1 billion -- joining a larger company would bolster its existing network. Created in 1995 by transforming an airline reservations system into a global communications provider, Equant now operates in more than 220 countries. In addition to offering voice, data and Web host services, Equant, in conjunction with Reuters, established Radianz in June to provide a secure Internet network for financial services companies.
Equant and Global One between them would have clients like British Airways, Samsung, Coca-Cola and Hewlett-Packard.
SITA -- for the Societe Internationale de Telecommunciations Aeronautiques -- has been looking to get out of its initial investment in Equant for some time. It sold shares in Equant's February 1999 secondary offering as did Morgan Stanley Capital Partners, a division of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which now owns 1.9 percent of Equant.
It is likely that France Telecom would be obliged to offer Equant's other shareholders, who hold 66 percent of the company, terms similar to a deal reached with SITA, a person close to the France Telecom situation said.
France Telecom, Equant and Morgan Stanley all declined to comment. SITA could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Leader Denies Woes Amount To a Crisis In Argentina

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, would appear to have some problems.
In the last few days, his vice president has resigned over a corruption scandal, his poll numbers have tumbled and the country's stock market has plunged. Members of his governing alliance's congressional delegation are publicly bickering with his intelligence chief, putting his legislative agenda in jeopardy. And a leading political magazine published his photograph this week under the title "Joke of the Year." 
 But according to Mr. de la Rua this is merely a blip of turbulence that will soon pass.
"Things are O.K.," he said in his office at the presidential palace today, smiling tightly. "There is no crisis. The president is functioning."
"These are days of some conflict but everyone is attempting to strengthen the Alianza," he said, referring to the governing coalition.
More substantively, only four days after Vice President Carlos Alvarez resigned protesting that the administration was not doing enough to fight corruption, Mr. de la Rua denied that any officials in his government bribed opposition senators to enact a new labor code. He said the government's anticorruption office had examined the secret accounts of his intelligence chief and found nothing askew.
"There is no concrete evidence," Mr. de la Rua said of the allegations that his government had paid up to 11 opposition senators to approve the new labor code, which makes it easier for businesses to fire newly hired workers and lower business costs.
In a swipe at Mr. Alvarez, the president said, "The episode was in the Senate, not the government, and the vice president was president of the Senate."
Mr. de la Rua also insisted that a cabinet shake-up last week would make his economic policies more effective. He promised not to change his emphasis on reducing budget deficits through spending cuts and higher taxes as a means of bringing down interest rates, and said he hoped that better commodity prices next year would increase economic growth. Growth this year is projected at 1.5 to 2 percent after a 3 percent decline in 1999.
Anxiety over the economy among investors grew last week when Mr. Alvarez resigned, threatening to splinter the governing coalition at a time when speculation is growing that Argentina may have trouble paying the interest on its debt next year.
"The political crisis could not come at a worse moment," wrote Walter Molano, head of research for BCP Securities, a brokerage firm in Greenwich, Conn., in a report to investors today. "Attempts to trim back pork-barrel spending, subsidies and special initiatives in the provinces are generating a great deal of political infighting."
Mr. Alvarez said he had decided he could no longer serve in the government when two officials -- the intelligence chief, Fernando de Santibanes, and Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique -- survived the cabinet shake-up last week though both had been implicated in the bribery scandal. Mr. Flamarique was promoted to become the president's chief of staff last Thursday, but resigned the next day after Mr. Alvarez stepped down.
Now Mr. de la Rua is in damage control mode. Normally reluctant to give interviews, he has become suddenly talkative with the press. Appearing Monday night on Argentina's most popular talk show with his wife, daughter and two grandchildren, he denied four times that there was any crisis.
Mr. Santibanes, the second most powerful man in the government, is working hard to clear his name, surprising reporters by calling them at home to grant them exclusive interviews they never asked for.
"The people who are calling for my resignation cannot claim corruption," Mr. Santibanes said in an interview. "It's politics. There are people who do not like me."
He identified his political enemies as Mr. Alvarez and several congressmen aligned with Frepaso, a social democratic party in the governing coalition.
Asked if any bribes had been paid to senators to approve the new labor code, Mr. Santibanes responded: "We have no evidence of that. I'd rather not give my personal opinion on this. We are looking."
Since resigning from the vice presidency, Mr. Alvarez has repeatedly attacked Mr. Santibanes, saying he had conspired against him and others in the Frepaso party, and has demanded the intelligence chief's resignation.
But today Mr. de la Rua stood by Mr. Santibanes and said the conflict would soon be resolved.
"The fight against corruption is basic for this government," he said. And he predicted that his coalition would wrest control of the Senate from the opposition next year "if we overcome these problems in the coming days."

HEADLINE: European Union Moves to Embrace Yugoslav Leadership

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The world began to embrace the new Yugoslavia and its new president, Vojislav Kostunica, in earnest today, with the visit here of the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, representing the European Union.
Praising the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic, Mr. Vedrine said: "I have come here to express my admiration to Mr. Kostunica and the Serbian people. Together they have written a huge page in the democratic history of Europe." 
 Mr. Vedrine arrived the day after the European Union lifted some major sanctions against Yugoslavia and promised $2 billion in aid. Mr. Kostunica will attend a European Union summit meeting in Biarritz, France, probably on Friday.
Though his own domestic politics remained unsettled, with a good deal of political jockeying, Mr. Kostunica also moved to improve relations with the United States, whose policies he has often criticized, not least NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia over Kosovo. James C. O'Brien, the chief Balkan adviser to President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, is expected here Thursday.
The United States is eager to restore diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia after Mr. Milosevic's departure and to build a relationship with Mr. Kostunica.
In a telephone interview, Mr. O'Brien said he "looks forward to a good discussion" with Mr. Kostunica, hoping "to begin to create a normal relationship" and offer help, if wanted, to build democratic institutions after 13 years of Mr. Milosevic's rule.
Mr. Vedrine has kept close touch with Mr. Kostunica, who regards improving relations with Europe as more important and less harmful to Serbia's interests than warming ties with the United States. Still, Mr. Kostunica describes himself as by no means anti-American, but wary of a superpower that, as the guarantor of the 1995 Dayton agreement, kept Mr. Milosevic in power much longer than necessary.
Mr. Kostunica said today that the European Union's decision to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia will "enable us to move closer to what always has been our natural environment -- Europe." The United States is also expected to lift most sanctions, but the process is more cumbersome legally.
The situation remained muddled with the government of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Mr. Kostunica and his allies in the 18-party coalition that supported his candidacy continued trying to assert control over the powerful government of Serbia and its Parliament, which was not up for election on Sept. 24. But they found new resistance from Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party and the Radical Party of the ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj.
The Serbian Parliament will be disbanded for new elections on Dec. 17, but there is bitter fighting over ministries in the temporary government that is supposed to rule until then.
Both the Socialists and the Radicals said they were suspending talks on a new, provisional, all-party Serbian government until "the end of riots, violence and lawlessness in cities and against the citizens of Serbia."
The complaint is seen as a bit disingenuous, given the pattern of Mr. Milosevic's rule, and seems a cover for bargaining about jobs -- in particular the Interior Ministry, which controls the police. Mr. Seselj wants that job for his party, and the Socialists want it for themselves, but Mr. Kostunica's allies insist that they must have it to protect their victory over Mr. Milosevic.
Some Kostunica allies warned tonight that they would bring more popular protest and pressure to bear on the Serbian Parliament if it did not stop obstructing the new order. Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak, a center of the opposition to Mr. Milosevic, said today, "Serbs are so eager to see changes, and I do not know who will protect Socialists, and how, if they continue to drag their feet."
But the way Mr. Kostunica's more revolutionary allies have moved to assert control over the police, customs operations and some state-owned companies, sometimes with the aid of armed men, has caused wider complaints.
Major banks, ministries, university faculties and important companies and factories were being taken over, but often by employees who are trying to restore rights, like university autonomy, stripped from them by the Milosevic government. Often, too, companies are removing managers imposed on them by the ruling parties, often the Yugoslav United Left party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
There is concern among the Kostunica group, too. A statement from his economic and policy advisers today appealed to "all employees and those in managing positions in institutions and companies to protect property and prevent various abuses."
Today, for example, former Prime Minister Milan Panic, a Serbian-American, regained control of a pharmaceutical plant that had belonged to his ICN Pharmaceuticals and was taken over by the Serbian government last year. The government failed to pay the factory for its goods and then took it over. This evening, after a visit and calls by Mr. Panic, shareholders of the Galenika factory met at the request of workers and agreed to return majority ownership to ICN.
An important member of the coalition that backed Mr. Kostunica, Zoran Djindjic, complained today that the Socialists and their allies were also meddling with the police. State Security, led by a Milosevic ally, Rade Markovic, "is still closed to us," Mr. Djindjic said, warning that telephone tapping had resumed after a break of a few days.
"There are attempts of consolidation within Secret Service," Mr. Djindjic said. "We have warned them we do not want conflicts. We expect that the people from that service realize that the situation has changed."
Mr. Kostunica is also trying to mend fences with Serbia's smaller sister republic, Montenegro, and its president, Milo Djukanovic, who wants a new constitutional arrangement with Serbia in a Yugoslavia that would look more like a confederation.
Mr. Kostunica, as federal president, is chairman of the Supreme Defense Council, which consists of the Serbian and Montenegrin presidents. He announced that the council would meet on Wednesday -- the first time it has met in years and the first time Mr. Djukanovic has attended since he broke away from Mr. Milosevic in 1998. But the meeting has been delayed because Mr. Djukanovic is recovering from a minor road accident.
After meeting Mr. Kostunica, Mr. Vedrine and his wife took a walk in central Belgrade and discovered the ambivalence felt by many here toward the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year over Kosovo.
France and Serbia have traditionally warm relations, and Mr. Vedrine began his walk at a large monument to the two countries' alliance in World War I.
One man said, "Vive la France!" and others clapped. But another man shouted: "Aren't you ashamed to show your face here? I have my children here. You bombed them."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE;
Turning Tables, Gore Camp Raises Truth Issue

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Faced with a Republican assault on Vice President Al Gore's truthfulness and credibility, the Gore campaign has mounted a counterattack, accusing Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, of being the ones with credibility problems.
In a series of statements in the last two days, Mr. Gore's aides have used language that almost exactly echoes the Bush campaign's daily challenges to Mr. Gore's trustworthiness. They accused Mr. Cheney of telling "a real whopper" in the vice-presidential debate when he said that his wealth had nothing to do with government and of "distortions" in describing Mr. Bush's tax cut proposals. 
 And Ron Klain, a Gore adviser, said today in a conference call with reporters that Mr. Bush "is being misleading to the American people" in how he describes his Social Security proposal.
The Gore counteroffensive comes as strategists in both parties acknowledge that perceptions that Mr. Gore embellishes stories have gained traction on the eve of the second presidential debate.
The race is now in a statistical dead heat and The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press has found in a new voter survey that recent events, including the first presidential debate, have taken a toll on Mr. Gore when voters are asked about the candidates' likability and honesty.
At the same time, the Bush campaign has begun using the charges about exaggerating and embellishing to try to discredit Mr. Gore's policy proposals and fend off new Democratic television ads that criticize the governor's record in Texas.
The Bush campaign today, for example, charged that Mr. Gore "continued to exaggerate his proposal" for universal preschool. It said Mr. Gore fails to say his proposal would not apply to 3-year-olds.
Mr. Bush has long sought to make character a major issue in this campaign and to link Mr. Gore to the flaws of President Clinton. But Mr. Gore shook off questions about his personality and Mr. Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, by pronouncing himself his "own man."
But in the last few weeks and the first debate, Mr. Gore gave the Republicans new openings. At one point in the debate he tried to one-up Mr. Bush by saying he had visited Texas fire victims along with James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He later said he had made a mistake and had traveled to Texas but not with Mr. Witt.
"The grass has always been very dry under Al Gore when it comes to his habit of embellishing and exaggerating," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. "He himself lit the fire when he did it before 35 million Americans."
Democrats say that the Republicans are magnifying trivial misstatements. But they also admit such statements take on added weight this year because voters remember Mr. Clinton's finger pointing denial that he had had sex with a White House intern and are putting a premium on honesty.
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he thought the focus on Mr. Gore's misstatements was overblown and would "fade into the ether." But he also said Mr. Gore and his aides needed to "create a situation where they can move on to something else." Another Democrat who did not want to be identified said that in a case like this. it was useful to "muddy the waters" by echoing the charges of the opposition.
The Gore campaign is trying simultaneously to nullify the Bush attacks on credibility and focus on issues that they think favor the Democrats. "Our focus is on their distortions of major issues that actually impact people's lives," said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.
Today the Gore campaign put forward Mr. Klain and Alicia Munnell, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to argue that Mr. Bush is being misleading on Social Security. They said he was not telling the public that most experts believe a plan like his to put some Social Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts would have to be accompanied either by cuts in the guaranteed benefit or huge infusions of new money into the program.
The Gore camp also said that Mr. Cheney had overlooked many of Mr. Bush's own proposed new tax credits for things like health insurance when he said in the vice-presidential debate "they like tax credits -- we like tax reform and tax cuts."
And one line of attack was personal. Two days in a row, citing news and opinion pieces, the Gore campaign said Mr. Cheney was "not being fully honest" when he joked in the vice-presidential debate that government had nothing to do with his financial gains after leaving Washington.
The Gore camp said Mr. Cheney's contacts from his years in government made him attractive to the Halliburton Company, and they said Halliburton had benefited from financial guarantees from federal agencies.
Mr. Bush's aides and some Republican pollsters said that any Gore attack would not take hold because it does not play into the perceived vulnerabilities of th Republicans. Mr. Fleischer dismissed the charges, saying "the worse they are doing in the polls the more they exaggerate and make things up."
White Ayres, a Republican pollster, said the Gore campaign should have tried another tack. "The accusation isn't going to fly," he said. "They would have been better off counterattacking on anything which voters already suspect is true."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN 2000: TODAY -- ABORTION;
The Enduring Battle Over Choice

 BODY:
The subject of reproductive rights has long been difficult terrain for politicians. Abortion is an intensely private question and a moral issue for many Americans, but the debate over reproductive rights is also about the broader cultural struggle over women's social and economic autonomy and the role of government in policing the most private sphere of American life.
So it is not surprising that though abortion rights have been constitutionally protected for a generation, the political and cultural battle over this issue rages undiminished 27 years after Roe v. Wade. As Vice President Al Gore said in his first debate with Gov. George W. Bush, the issue of abortion rights "is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it." It emerged as a point of difference in the vice-presidential debate and the one on Sunday between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio in the Senate race in New York, and is animating Congressional and state legislative races across the nation. 
 The fact is that in the nearly three decades since the Roe decision, a woman's right to choose abortion is becoming ever more fragile. In thousands of communities it is nonexistent. Years of violent attacks on medical clinics by anti-abortion protesters and increasing efforts by state legislatures to hinder abortion rights have taken an enormous toll. The number of abortion providers has dropped by 30 percent since 1982. Some 86 percent of counties in the country have no abortion services.
In 1992 the Supreme Court upheld the right to choose abortion, but gave states greater latitude to discourage the practice. Anti-abortion forces have since seized on the opportunity to impose waiting periods, mandatory counseling and requirements for parental notification and consent before abortions can be performed. In 1999 alone, state legislatures enacted more than 50 measures to restrict choice. Some 31 states have enacted bans on so-called partial birth abortions that could apply to even common abortion procedures at any stage of a pregnancy. Versions of that ban were ruled unconstitutional by a divided Supreme Court this year.
While states have increased attacks on abortion, it is the president, Congress and the Supreme Court that will ultimately determine the limits of reproductive freedom in this country. Twice in the past five years Congress has passed partial birth abortion bans, which were vetoed by President Clinton. Congress's hostility to reproductive rights is evident in measures that barred American military hospitals overseas from providing abortions and made drastic cuts in international family planning aid. Anti-choice Republicans even now are fighting to bar international women's health groups from receiving American aid, even if they use their own money to lobby foreign governments on abortion policies.
The harshest limits on abortion have been imposed on poor women in this country. Under federal law, Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs may not pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of a woman's life. Currently only 18 states use their own funds to pay for abortions for low-income women for health reasons.
The next president will determine whether a woman's ability to make this private decision will be strengthened or dismantled. For starters, he may well make two or more appointments to the Supreme Court that could result in a profound shift on privacy and abortion rights.
The two presidential candidates have starkly different positions. Mr. Gore, who early in his political career opposed federal funding for abortion, now supports federal funding and is resolutely pro-choice. Mr. Bush is pro-life, though he seems eager to avoid extended debate on this matter so as not to alienate moderate voters. Mr. Gore says he will appoint justices who will respect women's reproductive rights. Mr. Bush, who says he will not impose a pro-life litmus test on a Supreme Court nominee, cites Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as his models. Both justices believe the Roe decision was wrong and should be overturned.
The president's power in this arena is not limited to Supreme Court appointments. Veto threats by President Clinton have killed several measures in Congress to limit abortion rights, and his pro-choice stance has also helped to curb efforts to restrict access to contraception. Just last week a bill was introduced in the House to severely restrict the use of RU-486, the abortion pill recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Gore has said he fully supports the F.D.A. decision on the drug. Mr. Bush, however, has questioned the F.D.A.'s review process. Although he has said he cannot overturn the approval, he might have to decide whether to sign or veto a bill to deny vast numbers of women access to the drug.
The majority of Americans continue to support abortion rights, and for many that issue will be a key factor in their vote. This is a pivotal moment in the long struggle to allow women the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies. The next president's views will have much to do with whether reproductive freedom is protected here and promoted abroad.

 BODY:

THE HOUSE
 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG DEBATE -- Representative E. Clay Shaw, Republican of Florida, is trying to turn the prescription drug issue around on State Representative Elaine Bloom, his Democratic challenger in a South Florida congressional race considered one of the most important in the struggle for control of the House.
For weeks, Ms. Bloom has been using the issue, one of the year's hottest, against Mr. Shaw, charging that he has failed to help the thousands of elderly voters in his Fort Lauderdale district obtain reasonably priced drugs. Yesterday, Mr. Shaw countered with a tough television ad that ties Ms. Bloom to Andrx, a drug maker recently found guilty of accepting $89 million from another drug company to keep cheaper heart medication off the market. 
 Ms. Bloom served on the board of Andrx from 1993 to 2000. In response to the Shaw ad, which concludes, "Elaine Bloom: Millions in drug company profits while seniors paid higher drug prices," she said that her sole goal at Andrx was to help the company develop "an alternative to higher prices." Carl Hulse (NYT)
 
THE STATES
 
FROM THOMAS TO 'TOMAS' -- Change happens in politics, both in substance and style. Some candidates change on the issues. Some change their hair style. Thomas Wesson, a Republican candidate for constable in Dallas County, Tex., has changed his name, to Tomas Eduardo Wesson.
Mr. Wesson, who is listed on county records as Thomas Edwin Wesson and who ran as Thomas Edwin Wesson in two unsuccessful bids for city council, is not Hispanic. But he hails from a heavily Hispanic precinct. Still, he insists he's not trying to deceive Hispanic voters by showing up on this year's ballot as Tomas Eduardo. "That's my name," he says.
His Democratic opponent, Mike Dupree, thinks otherwise and has filed a complaint with the local district attorney. "Someone said I should change my name to Miguel," Mr. Dupree told The Dallas Morning News recently. Jim Yardley (NYT)
 
THE GREEN PARTY
 
A GAUNTLET THROWN -- One of the stations along the presidential campaign trail is the luncheon speech to the Detroit Economic Club, and yesterday Ralph Nader made his stop, taking a big bite out of the hand that had just fed him.
Looking out over an audience laden with auto industry executives, Mr. Nader said they had been "craven and myopic," opposing tougher vehicle safety and fuel economy standards in order to make bigger profits. Then he asked: "What is it about this industry, which has such talent and such an obligation to the global environment and to highway safety, that it is constantly putting the brakes on itself unless it is dragged kicking and screaming by government regulators or lawsuits?"
Silence.
But Mr. Nader, whose landmark 1965 book "Unsafe at Any Speed" led to many tougher federal auto standards, was not deterred and for the next 50 minutes stayed on the attack, challenging the auto officials to "set an example for the rest of the world by acting as if people mattered."
"The next time you get a presidential candidate to speak here and he panders to you," Mr. Nader concluded, "you should feel insulted." (NYT)
 
THE ISSUES
 
GUN CONTROL MEASURE ON BALLOT -- The Colorado Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for a ballot question that will allow voters to decide whether background checks should be mandatory for all buyers at gun shows.
Opponents of the initiative had asked the court to keep it off the Nov. 7 ballot because efforts to get it on were begun before its wording could be approved by the court. The court rejected that reasoning.
Gun control advocates began pushing for the measure after authorities said some of the guns used in the shootings last year at Columbine High School near Denver were bought at a gun show. When the state legislature refused to act, the gun control forces decided to try the initiative route. (AP)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
AN EYE ON THE OVAL OFFICE -- The guy who once thought it would be fun to have a 24-hour camera in outer space to beam back pictures of Earth says he would consider having a 24-hour camera in the Oval Office. That's Vice President Al Gore, who said "maybe so" when Yahoo's Internet Life, a magazine published by the Web site, asked him if he would consider a Web cam in the Oval Office. He expressed some concern that a 24-hour camera could give away security secrets, but said me might approve of "episodic" glimpses (audio and video) into the heart of the White House.
As for his proposal for an all-Earth, all-the-time satellite, that is seeming less far-fetched than when Mr. Gore first raised it in March 1998. The proposal, part of the NASA authorization bill, passed the House last month and is pending in the Senate. The so-called Tirana Satellite would cost $35 million. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)
 
THE REPUBLICANS
 
BUSH STUMBLES ON 'I.R.A.' -- Gov. George W. Bush has no trouble articulating the broad differences between his tax-cut plan and Vice President Al Gore's. It's the little details that keep dragging him down.
On Saturday, he sank into a quicksand of numbers and decimal points. Then yesterday he misstated what he said would be one of the impacts of all the complications in Mr. Gore's proposal.
Speaking at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., he said, "It's going to require numerous I.R.A. agents" to decipher Mr. Gore's formulas. He meant I.R.S. agents, and although it was an isolated flub, it was an example of the kind of small verbal spasm that could cause a big tremor in a debate. Frank Bruni (NYT)
 
THE RUNNING MATES
 
LIEBERMAN GETS 'A' IN VOCABULARY -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman can go to the head of the class. Of the four candidates in last week's presidential and vice presidential debates, he used the brainiest language, speaking on a grade level of 9.2, according to calculations by the Princeton Review, the test preparation company. His verbiage included words like rhetoric and aspirations.
George W. Bush, the Review figured, spoke at a grade level of 6.7, showing a fondness for the the word fuzzy, whereas Al Gore, who liked the word squander, spoke at the 7.9 grade level. Because Dick Cheney tossed around words like convene and decimated, he came in at the 8.5 grade level.
The Review graded the debates using a Defense Department test that measures the level of education required to understand various reading material. (AP)

HEADLINE: Demolition Begins On Old Buildings Of Hotel in Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Two years ago the legendary Concord Hotel closed its doors in what local residents and summer visitors regarded as the last gasp for the once-thriving Catskill resorts.
Yesterday, a developer began demolishing the old buildings on the property along Kiamesha Lake for what he said would be a $150 million resort and conference center that would hark back to the area's golden days. 
 Louis R. Cappelli, who heads the group that owns the 1,600-acre property, said that he would build a four-star, 525-room hotel as well as a ballroom, meeting rooms and a spa.
Amid snow flurries and fireworks at the groundbreaking for the project, Mr. Cappelli said he would also rebuild the Concord's Imperial Theater, which opened in 1958 with the singer Harry Belafonte. The Concord was the largest of the 400 hotels scattered across Sullivan County and the Catskills, 90 miles northwest of New York City.
"We intend not only to keep this sense of history alive," Mr. Cappelli said, "but to create a new, full-service luxury hotel."
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who owns a summer house in Sullivan County, said that he hoped the project would be the "launching pad for an economic renaissance" in the Catskills.
The county's beleaguered economy received a boost in August when Alan Gerry, a cable television tycoon and local resident, unveiled plans to build a $40 million performing arts and music center on the site of the original Woodstock music festival in nearby Bethel, N.Y.
Mr. Cappelli and Reckson Strategic Venture Partners bought the property in bankruptcy court in January 1999 for $10.25 million, a seemingly paltry sum for so much land.
But the Catskill resorts had fallen on hard times, beginning in the late 1960's when relatively cheap air fares to Europe lured away many patrons. Over time, many of the hotels and bungalow colonies fell into disrepair.

Mideast Violence Subsides As Diplomats Confer
Israelis and Palestinians haltingly backed away from confrontation as armed clashes subsided for the first time in 12 days, and a parade of diplomatic visitors urged both sides to rein in violence. There was one life-threatening casualty, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in Gaza who was critically wounded. A1 

Eight years of dealing with Yasir Arafat has left White House officials feeling exasperated, bewildered, even betrayed, as the Palestinian leader ignores their entreaties for the restoration of calm in the Mideast, officials said. A1
 
The Mideast violence has confused and angered American Jews, and left many more doubtful than ever that Mr. Arafat and his people truly want peace. A10

Second Debate Brings New Worries for Nominees
Vice President Al Gore's aides have warned him that he had better watch his performance in the second debate tonight and not come on too strong, as many of his advisers said he did the first time. Mr. Gore's advisers said they were worried about a perception from the last debate that he embellished stories. A1
 
Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore has yet been able to pull ahead in the presidential contest, with each man's weaknesses becoming magnified in the minds of voters, according to five polls out this week. When the polls are averaged, Mr. Bush's support is 45 percent and Mr. Gore's 44 percent. A29
 
Bush campaign workers in Florida have mailed pamphlets to older Floridians that accuse Mr. Gore of planning to force elderly people into a "government-run drug H.M.O." A31

HEADLINE: The Honking Heard 'Round the World

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
"Congestion is a result of demand exceeding supply, said James J. MacKenzie, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a Washington based non-profit organization that studies environmental problems.
Then he got to the point: There are too many vehicles on too few roads.
Mr. MacKenzie was speaking a global truth. Bumper-to-bumper backups are hardly limited to the Lincoln Tunnel approach or the Santa Monica Freeway. Drivers, spanning from Latin America to Southeast Asia, suffer them daily. And their pain will only get worse. By the end of the next decade, according to World Bank estimates, nearly 3.3 billion people will be living in urban areas, and they will be driving 816 million automobiles.
Not surprisingly, a recent report by the Texas Transportation Institute rated Los Angeles as the American city with the worst traffic. Drivers in the city where the car is king face longer rush hour commutes, more lost time, more wasted fuel and increased potential risk of accidents, than do their counterparts in any other municipality in the country.
Internationally, there is no definitive study. But World Bank transportation specialists indentifed five cities with traffic conditions that easily rival those in Los Angeles. They are New Delhi, Lagos, Cairo, Manila and Jakarta.
In each of these cities, a litany of depressingly familiar problems play out day after day. The streets, stifled by constant gridlock, are smog-ridden and deafening. Old
and badly maintained vehicles burn fuel
at an alarming rate, belching out a cocktail of toxic and carcinogenic pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons. Those gases make up 30 percent of the greenhouse gases that many scientists say are responsible for global warming. To add to the noxious mix competing in the dizzying anarchy of crowed streets, diesel trucks and buses release microscopic suspended particulates containing as many as 40 known human carcinogens.
These conditions are not only maddening and unhealthy, they are also costly, running as much as 5 percent of a country's gross domestic output, according to Edward Dotson, an urban specialist at the World Bank.
Efforts to improve traffic congestion
 in these cities have been sporadic. In New Delhi, for instance, commercial vehicles more than 8 years old have been banned. In Jakarta, legislation has been passed that sets emission levels for all cars, forcing owners keep their vehicles up the standards or pay for maintanance.
Most attempts to play on public concern have been met with a cynical reaction, or almost no reaction at all. In Europe and Latin America, a plan to lessen traffic density by restricting daily driving according to odd and even number license plates has failed because wealthy drivers simply buy additional cars, insuring they had one for each day. Many others continue to drive, openly risking citations.
Last month, more than 800 cities worldwide heeded the call to observe car-free day, on which use of private vehicles was restricted. But many drivers ignored it, and some criticized the whole idea as as a gimmick, not a lasting solution.
Mr. Dotson pointed to Singapore, where drivers are restricted from traveling within the city's central area unless they pay a permit fee, as a rare positive example.This method successfully deters people from driving and increases the use of mass transport, he said.
On the other hand, mass transit often fails to serve suburbs. Without a comprehensive network, roads from suburb to suburb are as congested as suburb to urban roadways, said Mr. Mackenzie of the World Resources Institute.
And while building more roads may solve the problme of congestion in the near-term, he said, it could actually increase density and automobile dependence. It's a short grace period, then you are right back to where you started.

HEADLINE: Courted by State, I.B.M. Plans Huge Chip Factory

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
I.B.M. said yesterday that it would spend $2.5 billion to build "the world's most technologically advanced" chip factory in East Fishkill, N.Y.
The project will be eligible for a package of tax breaks, grants and other incentives amounting to $660,000 for each of the 1,000 permanent jobs it is expected to create. State officials said the investment would be profitable for taxpayers in the long run. 
 The announcement comes just seven years after the International Business Machines Corporation, the lower Hudson Valley's largest private employer, rocked the region with large-scale cutbacks. The factory would represent the single largest investment in New York State by a business and the largest in the computer giant's history.
I.B.M. will build the factory within a building where it had shut down a major chip production line in 1993, at the tail end of cutbacks that led its work force in the region to tumble from 30,700 workers in 1985 to fewer than 14,000. Although the area has since rebounded and now has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the state, state and local government officials have avidly courted the company.
Gov. George E. Pataki hailed I.B.M.'s return to large-scale chip production in the region as an internationally visible endorsement of his efforts to make New York more attractive to businesses. "New York's ability to compete against other states and nations to win I.B.M.'s historic investment is an indisputable validation of the turnaround in the New York State business climate," Governor Pataki said in a Midtown news conference with Louis V. Gerstner, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive.
The new factory will be among the first in the world to make chips on silicon wafers that are 12 inches in diameter, rather than the current industry standard of 8 inches, allowing two and a half times as many chips to be made from a single wafer. It will also make use of a number of I.B.M. innovations, including copper circuitry and patented methods for placing transistors on microscopic layers of insulation to increase speed and cut power consumption.
I.B.M. said it would spend an additional $2.5 billion to expand I.B.M.'s semiconductor manufacturing capacity at its existing plants in Burlington, Vt., and overseas while the East Fishkill factory was being built.
Although Mr. Gerstner said that I.B.M. could have built the plant anywhere in the world, there were signs for several years that East Fishkill was the front-runner because I.B.M. already had many of the regulatory permits needed.
I.B.M. had said in 1997 that it would spend $700 million to move research and development efforts for the next generation of chip technology into the vacant building, and local officials were told then that a decision to expand to a full-scale production line was a strong possibility, according to Roger Akeley, Dutchess County commissioner of planning and development.
Under the current plan, the research and development operations will move into the building in the middle of next year and will occupy about one-third of the space. I.B.M. expects to employ about 1,400 construction workers and reach full production in 2003, with 1,000 permanent workers on the payroll.
While state officials cited the Pataki administration's tax cuts, regulatory reforms and investments in education as important lures for I.B.M., more direct financial incentives clearly played a role as well.
Under legislation passed early this year that focused economic development efforts on designated "Empire Zones" like I.B.M.'s sprawling East Fishkill complex, the company will get $475 million in state tax credits. It will also be eligible for $28.75 million in state grants and loans and $156 million in state and local tax benefits related to construction.
The Empire Zones are intended to allow new plants like I.B.M.'s to operate nearly tax-free for up to 10 years, the state said.
However, during the next seven years, the state calculates that I.B.M.'s investment will generate more than $1 billion for the state economy, said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.
Local officials welcomed I.B.M.'s plans but cautioned that at a time when business in the region is booming, the expansion would lead to new strains on transportation, housing and the environment.
"This is an ideal location for industrial growth and these are good jobs," Mr. Akeley said. He noted that I.B.M. officials had told him wages for the highly skilled work force the plant will employ would average about $50,000 annually.
But, Mr. Akeley added, the expansion could exacerbate the existing shortage of affordable housing for low-wage workers. It will also require building a water pipeline from Poughkeepsie so that the East Fishkill complex, which now draws water from an aquifer, can be supplied from the Hudson River.
Representatives of local small and midsize manufacturers like Harold King, director of the Council of Industry of Southeast New York, said they are nervous about the impact I.B.M. could have on the local labor market, which is already showing the effects of 20 consecutive quarters of economic growth. According to a July survey, wages in the region had risen 4 to 5 percent, up from 3 to 4 percent in earlier surveys, Mr. King said.
"It's hard for all companies in the region," said Thomas Phillips, a former I.B.M. employee who is now executive director of the Hudson Valley Technology Development Center in Fishkill. "The No. 1 issue is the available work force."
For all that, Mr. Gerstner cited the region's skilled workers as a fundamental reason for the investment decision. I.B.M. executives said they would recruit from other I.B.M. plants around the world as well as locally.
One obvious target, an adjacent chip plant that I.B.M. recently sold to Philips Semiconductor, is largely off limits under the terms of the two companies' agreement, according to John E. Kelly III, the senior vice president who oversees the I.B.M. microelectronics division.
Some of the new workers will come from I.B.M.'s close relationships with programs that train computer researchers at the State University of New York and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
That was underscored by the presence at the news conference of Alain Kaloyeros, executive director of the New York State Center for Advanced Thin-Film Technologies at SUNY Albany. The center is planning to build a $300 million research laboratory using technology similar to that at I.B.M.'s East Fishkill site. "We are thinking of painting it blue," Mr. Kaloyeros joked, referring to I.B.M.'s nickname, Big Blue.

HEADLINE: Parents Want High Schoolers Closer to Home

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Worried that most public high schools are not good enough for their children, middle-class and affluent parents across New York City have begun campaigning for a return to the traditional neighborhood high school.
The movement, based in affluent enclaves from the Upper East Side to Park Slope in Brooklyn and Riverdale in the Bronx, is led by parents who have been pioneers in rejuvenating elementary and middle schools that had been declining since the 1970's. These parents turned mediocre and even failing neighborhood schools into popular ones, where test scores are rising and students feel safe. 
 Now, these parents and their children are looking toward high school and concluding that the system just does not measure up. New York City once had a system of zoned high schools, reserved for students who lived in the immediate neighborhood, from John Jay in Brooklyn to John F. Kennedy in the Bronx. But in the late 1960's, the boundaries of many of the zones were redrawn to promote racial integration, and the schools lost their distinct neighborhood character. The ties slackened more over the last 15 years, as the city moved to a system of choice, which allows students to apply to any high school regardless of where they live.
But to create new high schools, the well-organized parent groups, backed by local lawmakers, are asking to exclude thousands of poor black and Hispanic students who travel long distances to attend schools now housed in the same buildings the wealthier parents covet. Even though the proposed schools would have substantial proportions of minority students, the parents fighting for new high schools, most of whom are white, face a quintessentially urban problem: their efforts have left them open to charges of elitism complicated by race, even though they say they are only trying to help their children.
Similar movements are taking hold in other cities, like Cleveland and Omaha, as parents push for a return to neighborhood schools after three decades of court-ordered desegregation and busing, said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's biggest urban school systems, based in Washington. In response to parental pressure, Chicago has gone a somewhat different route, setting up a network of schools with screened admissions, like Stuyvesant High in Manhattan.
"I think elementary school is wonderful," said Dr. Jeanne Kassler, a physician and the mother of two sons at Public School 6 on East 81st Street, the second-highest-scoring elementary school in New York City. "The middle schools seem doable. Then it drops off a cliff."
New York has always had a few elite schools, which admit students on the basis of competitive examinations, as required by state law.
But with New York City in the middle of a baby boom that has been barreling through the schools grade by grade, these parents say there are few high school options for ordinary middle-class children, especially those who cannot get into the exam-based schools, like Stuyvesant or the Bronx High School of Science.
Not long ago, these families would have fled to the suburbs, or borrowed and saved to pay for private school. But now, the increased desirability of city life and the admissions squeeze in many private schools has spawned a demand for the return of the zoned neighborhood high school, a movement that would have been surprising just a few years ago.
As depicted at meetings attended by hundreds of parents -- who say they represent thousands more -- and in glossy volumes studded with statistics and testimonials, the proposed new schools are intended to give the children of these residents an education on par with the best suburban high schools.
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has met with some parents and lawmakers who are advocating new schools, but has made no public commitment to them. Other school officials said the proposals were "potentially explosive" and had to be considered carefully.
Many of the neighborhood schools whose boundaries were expanded during the 1970's produced lackluster academic results, and the Board of Education began breaking them up into clusters of small schools with imaginative themes, known as magnet schools. By creating choices, officials hoped that middle-class families would return to the public schools and the schools would get better. But parents say that while the magnet schools may be better than what they replaced, they are still not good enough.
The Partnership for an Upper East Side High School, as a group of parents based at P.S. 6 call themselves, has developed a 41-page proposal calling for a "rigorously academic, college preparatory high school in our community."
"Despite paying the highest tax rates in New York City, we don't have a school that will prepare our children to go to the superior colleges they are qualified to attend," the document says.
Anticipating the charge that parents are espousing an elitist school, the document goes on to say, "Diversity comes in many guises." As examples of diversity, the document says that children on the Upper East Side come from a wide range of countries; that their parents include building superintendents, struggling artists and professionals; and that some families have been "traumatized by divorce, illness and unemployment."
On Sept. 25, about 50 parents turned out for a meeting in a Hunter College auditorium to lobby for a new East Side high school. In an indication of the potential clout of these parents, most of the lawmakers who represent the neighborhood -- an assemblyman, a state senator and two Council members -- spoke at the meeting, offering at least rhetorical support for the school.
"We want to help you keep your children within a 20- to 30-block radius of your home," said Assemblyman John Ravitz, urging the Board of Education to consider using the Julia Richman Educational Complex, at East 67th Street and Second Avenue, as a location.
Once a failing traditional school, Julia Richman has been broken up into four small high schools and an elementary school, all in one building. Parents say it draws almost all of its students from the Lower East Side and East Harlem, and statistics published by the Board of Education show the most recent combined reading and math SAT scores for three of the high schools averaging 800 or less out of a possible 1,600. The fourth high school, the Urban Academy, does not disclose the SAT scores of its students.
"In good conscience, I just couldn't send my kids to schools where they're averaging 800 combined" on SAT scores, said Melanie Cissone, who has a fifth grader and a third grader at P.S. 6.
Small-school advocates say that if parents are dissatisfied, the moral and responsible thing to do is to send their children to existing schools and try to improve them. Ann Cook, co-director of the Urban Academy, said, "Would you go to Dalton and say, 'Well, gee, you're serving kids from outside the neighborhood, we'd like you to stop'?"
The first victory in the campaign was won this year by parents in Riverdale, an affluent section of the Bronx. For several years, parents had sought an alternative to the local high school, John F. Kennedy, with more than 4,000 students, abysmal test scores and a reputation for chaos. The Board of Education agreed to expand Middle School 141, a sixth- through eighth-grade school, to include grades through the 12th grade, beginning this fall. The change, to be phased in grade by grade, is expected to nearly double the proportion of white students, to at least 30 percent from 17 percent, but also exclude 200 students from nearby Marble Hill, a largely minority neighborhood.
In Brooklyn, parents in the middle-class neighborhoods of Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill are trying to reclaim John Jay High School. Last year, according to the community school district, only 220 of the district's 1,346 eighth graders enrolled in John Jay, on Seventh Avenue. Under a plan supported by the district and the teachers' union, John Jay would become a sixth- to 12th- grade school and eventually restrict students from outside the neighborhoods.
In turning their back on the small magnet schools, parents partly blame a decade-old admissions quota, now under review by the Board of Education. The quota was intended to promote equity, but parents say that instead it rewards students who do poorly and punishes the high achievers.
The quota governs the city's magnet schools, which are often the only alternative to neighborhood high schools and which admit students by application. It requires these schools to select as many students -- 16 percent -- from the ranks of the lowest achievers as they do from the highest.
On the Upper East Side, students who are rejected by the magnet schools they apply to, often because the quota has been filled, are automatically placed in the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, on West 18th Street. It has average combined SAT scores of 861, out of a possible 1,600.
Meanwhile, competition to get into the specialized schools is ferocious. Last year, 23,339 students citywide took the test for Stuyvesant, and 846 were accepted.
The report by the Partnership for an Upper East Side High School meticulously documents the failings of neighborhood high schools, using test scores from the Board of Education's annual school report cards. But it omits the pages of those report cards that detail the racial composition of the schools. A closer look hints at the complicated racial, political and educational questions that the movement to reclaim neighborhood schools raises citywide.
Enrollments at the elementary schools that the East Side children attend are largely white -- 77 percent at P.S. 6, 67 percent at the Manhattan New School on East 82nd Street, and 58 percent at P.S. 158 on York Avenue. Even the hot middle schools, which draw from a much wider radius, have more white students than the citywide average of 17 percent: 58 percent at the Lab School for Collaborative Studies on Third Avenue, 51 percent at East Side Middle on York Avenue and 43 percent at Robert Wagner School on East 76th Street. The racial balance in the high schools is almost reversed, ranging from 19 percent white at Bayard Rustin to 3.7 percent white at the Richard Green High School of Teaching on East 88th Street.
Parents bristle at the notion that they are being exclusionary.
"Nobody's talking about opening up a school that will only be for anybody whose name is Schuyler or Buffy," said Jordan Bobby Brown, a writer and producer at ABC Radio who is African-American. He is the father of Sean, a seventh grader at the East Side Middle School. "We're talking about people on the East Side who have middle incomes and need a neighborhood school."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Oct. 11 about a campaign by New York parents for a return to traditional neighborhood high schools misstated the address of the Lab School for Collaborative Studies, a magnet school that draws students from all over the city. It is at 333 West 17th Street. Another Lab School, at 1700 Third Avenue, is an elementary school.

HEADLINE: A TALE OF TWO DOWNTOWNS;
After Worst of Times, Building for the Best

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE old warehouse on Auburn Avenue was long an eyesore, and Alton Evans, 40, can remember when it was worse. Just a few years ago, he said, the building sat gutted, a haven for transients and drug dealers. That was the mid-1990's in the central city neighborhood known as the Old Fourth Ward, and anything could happen. In those days, residents say, the area resembled the Wild Wild West.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Evans stood on the same site, at the center of a different sort of activity. He hunkered in his tidy metalwork studio, putting the final touches on an Adinkra symbol from West Africa. His neighbors, Ursallie Smith and Celeste Alexander, laid out swaths of bold-patterned fabric -- "Ursace," Ms. Alexander calls it, to rhyme with Versace -- in their interior design showroom. Around them, in place of urban decay, a concrete honeycomb of lofts buzzed with painters, sculptors, Internet developers, glass blowers, designers of all disciplines. 
 Mishele Lesser, 27, a graphic artist and painter, left her door unlocked so neighbors could visit her roomy loft. "I always wanted to live in a loft," Ms. Lesser said, looking up from a computer. "Living here has made me be more free, because I can get different people's opinion on my work."
She was talking about Studioplex, Atlanta's $18.3 million, 225,000-square-foot experiment in urban redevelopment. Two years ago, a nonprofit group called the Historic District Development Corporation took over the disused cotton compress warehouse with a bold plan: in a city of epic suburban sprawl, the group envisioned an arena-size loft community to draw artists and Web pioneers to a poor downtown neighborhood. Some would live and work there. Others, like Mr. Evans, would set up shops to lure visitors. Nonartists were welcome as well. "We figure that anybody who wants to live with artists is O.K.," said Mtamanika Youngblood, president of the development group. "I look at them as patrons."
David Green of Brock Green Architects carved a courtyard down the middle of the old brick warehouse, a 500-foot-long grass swath separating two rows of lofts, galleries and retail spaces.
Then last year, artists and others started moving in: racially diverse, often young, often single and collectively not beholden to the time clock. A community was born.
In the evenings, residents gather in the long public courtyard, buoyed by conga drumming from the dance studio upstairs. "I like to go there and talk about art and smell all the different things cooking," said Jim Alexander, 65, whose showroom loft bustles with his photographs of Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and other musicians. "Been a real long time since you had white people with an Auburn Avenue address," Mr. Alexander said, laughing gently. "It's getting to be a good mix of people around here."
The complex is the ambitious anchor for a larger, block-by-block program to rejuvenate this neighborhood of wooden ranch houses, bungalows and shotgun houses that was once home to the city's affluent black community. Auburn Avenue, once dubbed "the richest Negro street in the world," includes the birth home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the King National Historic Site, the city's top tourist attractions.
But the area has been in decline since the 1950's, when cheap land and good highways carried Atlantans to the suburbs, leaving behind a population that was poorer, older and politically weaker. In the 1960's, as in many black neighborhoods, construction of an elevated highway cut Auburn Avenue in two, casting a blockwide shadow across what remained of the business strip.
As locals left or holed up indoors, open-air drug markets flowered along the main avenues; moonshine sales and a nickel numbers racket -- literal small change -- endure even today. On a bright morning, Dave MacDonald, 43, who moved to the Old Fourth Ward in 1992, wistfully remembered some of his old neighbors. "One crack addict drag queen used to walk down the center lane of Edgewood Avenue in a drum majorette uniform at rush hour, holding up traffic," said Mr. MacDonald, a social worker and community advocate. "I canceled my cable because nothing was as dramatic as what was happening on the street."
Now, Mr. MacDonald said, suburban sprawl and its clogged highways are starting to attract a new population to the Old Fourth Ward, with resources the neighborhood needs. "There was an underground arts movement here 10 years ago," said Mr. MacDonald, who is also a sculptor. "Studioplex is bringing it aboveground."
The building now offers 112 living lofts, as well as 41 galleries and commercial spaces, many punctuated with floor-to-ceiling windows to draw in sunlight. About 60 percent of the residents are artists; 20 percent of the lofts are set aside for tenants with incomes below $22,700.
Amy Sherald, who lives in one of the subsidized lofts, pays just $600 rent for 1,038 square feet, where she lives and works. Ms. Sherald, 27, has spiky brown braids, and Japanese characters tattooed on both arms, "artist" on one side, "strong and tall" on the other. On a recent afternoon, one of her oversize canvases awaited further work, and a handful of others hung on the loft's spacious walls: naked, shaven-headed figures in cobalt blues and ruddy browns, vistas of strong color vibrant in the natural sunlight.
Before she moved to Studioplex, Ms. Sherald lived in small apartments with no room for her large works, and she gave up painting. "I don't think anybody can create in a space where they don't feel comfortable," she said. "I feel comfortable here. And I've gotten a lot of exposure here."
The complex hopes to follow successful programs, including several begun by the Minneapolis-based Artspace, where developers used artists -- and federal tax credits -- to jump-start renewal in tough neighborhoods. Besides Studioplex, the development group has built 51 new single- and two-family homes, and rehabilitated another 35, sweeping through the neighborhood a block at a time. Though the Old Fourth Ward is the inner city, most of its terrain is low-density, free-standing homes; a handful of solid structures could anchor a block, Ms. Youngblood said. The new houses follow the mixed grid of the neighborhood, a modest shotgun house, which might sell for as little as $89,000, next to a grander, and much more expensive, Victorian. Mr. Evans, the metal sculptor at Studioplex, saw the bright, pastel new homes as the march of history. "I was concerned about coming here," he said, "until I saw them building $300,000 homes across the street."
Dana White, a professor of urban studies at Emory University, has watched nearly three decades of renewal programs fail in the neighborhood. Most fell short, he said, because they were largely cosmetic; even after the improvements, the stabilizing elements in the community continued to sheer off to the suburbs. Between 1960 and 2000, the city population dropped by 11.8 percent, while that of the city and near suburbs combined more than tripled, according to the Fiscal Research Program at Georgia State University. The current initiative, by contrast, aims to bring in a new urban tribe, to draw on a generation tiring of the suburbs. The 1996 Olympic Games provided early help by bringing people and development money downtown. "It seems to be the beginning of the first major change in half a century," Professor White said, taking care to qualify his optimism. Studioplex will be a test for the development program. Unlike past measures, "it's building a new type of downtown," he said, adding, "Whether there's enough there to draw visitors and be fully viable, we'll see."
For Attiya Melton, a sculptor and ceramist, the complex has been an incubator for collaborative creativity. Ms. Melton, 49, lives in a second-floor loft and has a 3,400-square-foot studio and showroom below. She likes to fire the kiln in the middle of the night, go back up to bed, then come down later to work through dawn. Sometimes, she said, she has to remember to leave the building.
Since she moved to Studioplex last December, Ms. Melton has found an almost small-town bonhomie among the other artists. Web designers helped her document her work digitally; Mr. Evans advised her on indigenous American symbols to use in her work; other artists helped her build walls, lent their equipment and shared tips about the best places to buy supplies. It is a place, she said, of "informal mentoring, just being in the same place, gathering and talking."
It is also a place, potentially, for artists to do some business. Louis Delsarte, 56, a painter from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is raising his 6-year-old daughter in the complex. "I miss New York," Mr. Delsarte said. "That's why I'm here. This, so far, is the closest I've felt to being in New York, because of the communication and the energy."
Though he does not show his work at any of the Studioplex galleries, Mr. Delsarte has made valuable contacts among the people visiting the center. In the six months since he moved in, he said, he has sold "four or five" paintings, at prices of up to $6,000. Because he sold the paintings himself, he did not have to share money with an agent.
Nor is the development done. Next March, the development group plans to open a restaurant and coffeehouse in the scrubland behind Studioplex, with a commercial strip to follow. Plans are in the works to build a performing arts theater and to reopen the neighborhood's only school, which closed in the mid-1990's.
David Patton, 34, who moved to the neighborhood in 1994, left his job as assistant dean of students at the Emory University School of Law to start the restaurant. After living through the area's rough years, said Mr. Patton, who is president of the development group's board, "we want to rebuild something that resembles the community when Dr. King lived here, with mixed incomes, and the elderly taken care of."
As a retail location, Studioplex has not lived up to what many of the artists hoped. The galleries and shops have had little success drawing tourists from the King sites just down Auburn Avenue. Though a recent National Black Arts Festival drew thousands to the complex, on most days, foot traffic is little more than a trickle. "If I had to rely on the people who come through here, I couldn't survive," said Ms. Smith, 37, the interior designer.
Michael Syphoe, who oversees commercial development for the development group, argued that the artists underestimate the marketing required to make their businesses work. He named a handful of Studioplex tenants that he expected to fail in the next year. "This is a business," he said. "I've got some folks who are not go-getters."
For all the improvements, the Old Fourth Ward is still rough around the edges. Drug dealers, moved off some corners or buildings, resurface elsewhere. Last Friday, Ernie Geyer, a co-owner of one of the neighborhood's bright spots, a new luncheonette called Thumb's Up, was shot in the leg while taking the day's deposit to the bank. Mr. Geyer was not hurt seriously and has returned to work.
Even so, the neighborhood is already threatening to become the victim of its own success. Though the development group has taken care not to uproot its poor neighbors, private developers are not always as fussy.
Dave MacDonald said that the darker signs of gentrification, what he calls "the predators," are creeping in among the pretty renovations. Lately, he said, signs have appeared on telephone poles, saying, "Christian man seeks to buy your house." The offers, he said, are aimed at the neighborhood's poor and elderly residents. "The predators see a chance to make a buck, and offer people $20,000 for their houses." Mr. MacDonald said he rips the signs down, a meager gesture against an unpleasant tide.
Meanwhile, shiny new houses jostle with decaying shells, competing visions of the neighborhood's future. Studioplex has a waiting list of 150 names. For Amy Sherald, the painter, the area's future is already visible, and both wondrous and frightening. With all the new housing going up, she said, "I'm scared of how traffic is going to be." In this town, there is no greater sign of success.

 BODY:

ASIA
 
MYANMAR: U.N. ENVOY MEETS ACTIVIST
The United Nations special envoy to Myanmar met the pro-democracy activist Daw Aung San Suu Kyi at her home in Yangon, the capital, ending more than two weeks of isolation for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is under house arrest. The envoy, Razali Ismail of Malaysia, spent two hours at her residence, accompanied by local United Nations officials. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has been confined to her home with her telephone cut since Sept. 22. (Reuters) 

PHILIPPINES: CARDINAL URGES PRESIDENT TO QUIT
Cardinal Jaime Sin and a council of 75 Catholic priests urged President Joseph Estrada to resign, saying a payoff scandal had destroyed public trust in his leadership. The presidential palace rejected the call, saying the embattled former movie actor, accused of receiving $8.7 million from gambling lords, would not step down. Demonstrators rallied outside the Senate depicting Mr. Estrada as "The Godfather," above. In 1986 the cardinal helped lead a revolt that toppled Ferdinand E. Marcos. (Reuters)
 
PAKISTAN: RIGHTS SITUATION ASSAILED
Human rights conditions in Pakistan have deteriorated since the military took power a year ago, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said. Its report said political activities have been suppressed, and that opponents of the military regime have been subjected to prolonged detention without being charged. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
BANGLADESH: FLOODS RECEDE
Floods that have killed more than 130 people and left another two million homeless have begun to recede, allowing many people to return to their homes, officials announced. The rains, which started on Sept. 26, have swept away more than 675 miles of road and done major damage to rice crops. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
EAST TIMOR: REQUEST FOR MILITIA CHIEF DENIED
East Timor asked Indonesia to hand over the pro-Jakarta militia leader Eurico Guterres for questioning about massacres in the territory last year. But Indonesia quickly rejected the request, saying Mr. Guterres, 27, would remain under arrest in Jakarta in connection with separate investigations. A spokesman for the United Nations, which administers East Timor, said warrants had been issued for Mr. Guterres's arrest in the slaying of scores of civilians in two attacks before the territory's independence vote in August 1999. (Reuters)
 
JAPAN: 6 HELD IN NUCLEAR ACCIDENT
Six former top officials of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant were arrested for an accident last year that killed two people and exposed hundreds to radiation. The suspects face charges of negligence resulting in death in the Sept. 30, 1999, accident at the plant 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The six men could each get up to five years in prison or be fined $4,630, a police official said. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: MORE SUPPLIES FLOWN IN
Turkish and Syrian planes landed in Baghdad with aid and medical supplies to offset the effects of United Nations sanctions. It was the second time this week that both a Turkish and Syrian plane had landed at the recently reopened Saddam International Airport, airport officials said. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: ISLAMIC CODE SHELVED
The northern state of Kaduna, torn by sectarian riots this year, said it had shelved plans to adopt the strict Islamic Shariah penal code. Gov. Muhammad Ahmed Makarfi cited the cosmopolitan nature of the state as a reason for the move. His announcement is expected to defuse the anxiety of non-Muslims, but could also anger Shariah's ardent backers. Hundreds of people died in Christian-Muslim fighting in Kaduna city last February and May over reported plans to introduce the law. (Reuters)
 
SOMALIA: PARLIAMENT MEMBERS ATTACKED
About 100 members of the new Parliament came under heavy fire from militiamen as they flew into Mogadishu in a step toward restoring central government after almost a decade of anarchy. One gunman was killed and nine people were wounded when the legislators' convoy was attacked outside a hotel. The legislators, none of whom were hurt, arrived from Djibouti, where the 245-member Parliament was set up in August as part of a peace conference bringing together representatives from Somalia's rival clans. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
PERU: FUJIMORI AGREES TO REFORMS
President Alberto Fujimori and the opposition have agreed to key judicial reforms, ending a deadlock in talks over re-establishing democratic institutions in preparation for new presidential and congressional elections next year. The accord does away with a system under which the president appoints provisional judges whom he can hire and fire any time, allowing for manipulation from the executive branch. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: 4 QUIT GOVERNING COALITION
Four members of the lower house of Congress said they would leave the government coalition because of their disagreement with President Fernando de la Rua's economic policies, making it tougher for the government to enact its legislative program. The Alianza has been splintering since the resignation last week of Vice President Carlos Alvarez, leader of the social democratic Frepaso party, which is joined in the government with the centrist Radical Party.Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
TURKEY: GREEK ARMY RETURNS
More than 75 years after they left Turkey as a defeated army, Greek troops returned, joining NATO exercises on Turkish territory for the first time. About 30 Greek soldiers jumped off Spanish and Italian helicopters ferrying them from ships in the Bay of Doganbey. The landing site is only 25 miles southwest of the Aegean port city of Izmir, which Greek troops occupied in 1919 as part of a disastrous campaign to seize Asia Minor from the Ottoman Empire. (AP)
 
ITALY: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS STRANDED
About 500 illegal immigrants, mostly Kurds fleeing Iraq, were left stranded on a ship off Italy when the crew abandoned their passengers to avoid arrest. The coast guard guided the vessel, which left Izmir, Turkey, a week ago, to safety in the southern town of Otranto. The interior minister, Enzo Bianco, said Europe should organize a joint police force to safeguard its borders. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: SOLDIERS SLAIN
Officials said Chechen rebels had killed four Russian soldiers and wounded eight others in attacks on Tuesday in the regional capital, Grozny, and in two other areas. Three died in Grozny when guerrillas attacked an armored personnel carrier with grenades. But a rebel commander told The Associated Press that 20 Russians had died in an ambush of a three-vehicle convoy in southeast Chechnya. Both sides have regularly exaggerated the other's losses, and it was not possible to determine which, if either, was correct. Michael Wines (NYT)

HEADLINE: Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
At least 50 million children in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union live in poverty and are exposed to tuberculosis levels usually associated with the third world, says a report released today.
The report, by the European Children's Trust, a group active in 10 Eastern European countries, urged the West to help by easing debt burdens. The report, "The Silent Crisis," found that poverty in the region had increased more than tenfold over the decade since the fall of Communism because of reduced spending on health, education and other social programs. 
 "Since the breakup of the Communist system," the study says, "conditions have become much worse -- in some cases catastrophically so.
"For all its many faults, the old system provided most people with a reasonable standard of living and a certain security."
At least 50 million children were found to live in "genuine poverty," with 40 million of them in the former Soviet Union. Over all, more than 160 million people, 40 percent of the population, are thought to live in poverty.
The report measured infant mortality, the proportion of the population not expected to live to 60 and the number of tuberculosis cases. It said infant mortality, at 26 per 1,000 births in 1998, approached rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, where it is 32 per 1,000. In the United States, infant mortality is 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Tuberculosis rates have risen in Eastern Europe, with an average 67.6 cases per 1,000 people in 1997. That compared with 49.6 percent in Arab states, 47.6 percent in Latin America and 35.1 percent in eastern Asia.
Tuberculosis rates ranged from 20 per 1,000 in the Czech Republic to 80 per 1,000 in Lithuania, Turkmenistan, Latvia and Russia, and 150 per 1,000 in Georgia.
In Kyrgyzstan, 88 percent of people live below the poverty line, the report found.
"Time is running out," the trust said. "That there has not been a total collapse of social structures in these countries so far is a testament to the resilience of the people there. But they cannot continue living this way indefinitely."

HEADLINE: A Safe Rescue for Social Security

BYLINE: By Donald B. Marron; Donald B. Marron is chairman of Paine Webber Group.

 BODY:
Perhaps no proposal has raised more eyebrows and hackles this election year than the notion that America should invest part of Social Security proceeds in the financial markets. Yet there is ample precedent for this kind of investment: the Thrift Savings Plan, a government-run retirement income program for federal workers, including members of Congress and federal judges.
Created by Congress in 1986, the plan had assets of $95 billion at the end of 1999. It offers a choice of stock or bond funds or Treasury securities to workers who contribute through payroll deductions. The stock fund's return of 13.19 percent for the year that ended Sept. 30 could make Uncle Sam blush over the 3 percent the Social Security trust fund earned in the same period. 
 The Thrift Savings Plan is not set up to cover all Americans. But it is a powerful example of the federal government's running a successful retirement plan that permits investment in stock and bond markets.
Social Security will plunge into the red early in the century if something is not done to change it. And something must be done. Most Americans today rely on Social Security for the majority of their retirement income. And Americans show little appetite for saving on their own: in July the country reported a negative savings rate for the first time.
In 1998 and 1999, I served with members of Congress and other appointees from the private sector on the bipartisan National Commission on Retirement Policy, a panel sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. We made several suggestions for improving America's present retirement system without changing its basic structure or raising taxes: setting a minimum guaranteed Social Security retirement payment; making it easier to carry private pension benefits from job to job; expanding individual retirement accounts; continuing to raise the age of eligibility for collecting full Social Security payments (now increasing on a fixed schedule for people who today are 62 and younger) until it reaches age 70 for those now 33 and younger; and giving economic incentives to workers who wish to stay in the work force beyond the retirement age. Our plan would not reduce the benefits already promised to those over 50 or the poor.
But we also recommended something wholly new: returning two percentage points of the 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax to Americans for individual investment. Workers could put those dollars into stock index funds, bond funds, Treasury securities or a mix of those, making individual investment choices as they would in 401(k) plans. The government's role would include reporting total dollars flowing to the private markets, monitoring fund performance and making sure fund operation is consistent with all laws and regulations.
The risks of the kind of individual retirement savings accounts we propose are often overstated. Critics assume everyone would invest his or her newly liberated Social Security dollars in stocks, perhaps sinking the lot into the latest high-flier. That's wrong. Choosing a single stock is not an investment option for these dollars. Our plan called for a choice among stock index funds, lower-risk bond funds or Treasury securities. Even those who chose stock funds alone would not be taking an unacceptable risk over the long haul, if history is any guide. The American stock market has appreciated in every 20-year period in its history.
Contrary to another common assumption, Wall Street would not be getting a windfall under a plan like ours. The new investments would be about $60 billion a year, a minute fraction of the $25 trillion now invested in financial markets.
If Social Security as it is structured now is intended to be a savings plan, it is a bad one, for even savings accounts pay higher returns. If it is meant as a payment program funded by a tax, the tax we are using is regressive. The low-income earners hardest hit by this tax are especially in need of a chance to make some true headway into retirement security.

HEADLINE: Aspen Journal;
Ski Resorts Struggle to Lure Workers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo., Oct. 10

 BODY:
Here in the crown jewel of Colorado's ski resorts, no one really asks who wants to be a millionaire. Many residents and visitors already are. Far more important questions around town include: Who wants to be a housekeeper? Who wants to be a waiter? And who wants to be a retail clerk?
Few places in the country reflect an unintended dark side of the nation's prosperity more than Colorado resort areas like Aspen, where labor shortages are sending employers as far as Europe, Africa and Australia to recruit workers essential to the viability of the area. Here, for example, a vacationer is just as likely to be greeted at a restaurant with "G'day, mate" as "Good morning, sir." 
 "Given the robust nature of the economy, there is a general shortage of people in the resort counties, here as well as nationwide," said Jim Westkott, Colorado's state demographer, who attributes the labor problems to a rapid growth in tourism, the increasing number of second and third homes built in ski resort areas and the soaring real estate market. In many of Colorado's ski towns, a modest single-family house with three or four bedrooms sells for $1 million or more.
As a result, working people who earn hourly wages selling clothes, waiting on tables and operating ski lifts can no longer afford to live near their jobs. In the last few years, many of them have been forced to find more affordable housing 30 to 60 miles away, creating monstrous rush-hour traffic jams, polluting the air and undermining the quality of life of workers, especially those who long to spend more time with their children.
But now, state and resort-area officials say, workers fed up with long commutes and traffic are beginning to abandon their resort jobs to find work closer to home, leaving huge vacuums at the resorts, some of which are seeking to hire hundreds of new workers this season.
It has become an especially burdensome task, even as some resort towns, like Aspen, are now requiring developers to build affordable housing for workers as a condition of building expensive single-family houses.
While the nation's unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in August, matching a 30-year record, the rate fell even lower in some of Colorado's prime ski counties: to 1.9 percent in Summit, where Copper Mountain is; 1.5 percent in Pitkin, where Aspen is; and 1.4 percent in Eagle, where Vail is. (August is the last month for which statistics have been compiled.)
It is no longer enough to post "Now Hiring" signs in storefronts or to list job offerings in the local newspapers, as many employers still do. More and more of them, including those at Crested Butte, Copper Mountain and Vail, have sent representatives to job fairs in other states and in foreign countries, offering recruits subsidized housing, hourly wages well above the minimum wage, comprehensive health care packages and free season passes to the slopes.
David Barry, chief operating officer for Copper Mountain, said his resort had worked with employment agencies that had brought in new workers from the Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. Among their benefits is a program for subsidized meals that cost $3 each.
Les Marsh, director of human resources for Vail Resorts, which owns the Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge and Beaver Creek ski areas, said his company had used offers of subsidized housing at recent job fairs in Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas, Oregon and Washington. The company has also dropped its program of drug-testing for all new employees.
Employers at Winter Park get an end-of-season bonus, $1 for every hour they worked.
For many of the new workers, the chance to work in a glittery ski resort is more than a dream job; many say it also enhances their resumes for a future higher-paying job at home or in the United States.
"It's more expensive to live here, but the pay and benefits are twice as good as for the same job back home," said Jac O'Sullivan, a 32-year-old native of Manchester, England, who has worked in the banquet department of the Little Nell Hotel in Aspen for 16 months. She is one of about 30 of the hotel employees who are from other countries.
Sam Reid, 26, who moved to Aspen from London last year, is training in the hotel's food and beverage department. "If it wasn't Aspen, it could be another state," she said. "The working conditions here are really good. You are treated better, and they do look after you better."
For ski towns in Colorado as well as in other Rocky Mountain states, providing a full range of quality service has taken on a new urgency after unusually warm autumns have contributed to a two-year decline in skiing and snowboarding.
"Colorado is anxious to regain some growth and momentum after the past two years," said David Perry, president and chief executive of Colorado Ski Country, a trade organization that represents 25 resorts. "But with the strong economy, it has become very difficult to find people for service and entry-level type jobs, and everybody is competing for those people. We'd like to get more of them and get them faster."

HEADLINE: 2 Americans Win the Nobel For Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Two Americans won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for work that has helped to explain complex behavior, like why some working mothers make more than those with fewer children and why one route is favored for a new highway over another.
The award of 9 million Swedish kronor -- $910,000 -- will be split by James J. Heckman, 56, at the University of Chicago, and Daniel L. McFadden, 63, at the University of California at Berkeley. Nine professors from the University of Chicago have won the prize, more than any other university, since 1969, when the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm first gave a prize in economics, adding it to the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded for outstanding work in other fields. 
 Mr. Heckman, whose techniques are now standard practice in studies of the links between, say, job training and wages or a woman's wages and her family situation, had often been mentioned as a potential Nobel winner. Mr. McFadden, whose contribution has been less publicized, was on no one's list, although like Mr. Heckman he had won a prestigious Clarke Medal, which is awarded each year to an outstanding economist younger than 40.
Before yesterday's announcement, the favorites for the Nobel this year included Joseph E. Stiglitz at Stanford and George A. Akerlof at Berkeley, known for their path-breaking economic theory. But the Royal Academy swings between contributions to theory and methodology, and this turned out to be a year for methodology.
"Each of the laureates," the academy said of Mr. Heckman and Mr. McFadden, had developed methods "that are widely used in the statistical analysis of individual and household behavior." The formal award is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.
Mr. Heckman was in Rio de Janeiro to speak at a conference when his wife, Lynne, received the call in Chicago at 4 a.m. yesterday. "It was a Swedish voice, but he would not say why he was calling; he asked for Jim's phone number," she said. Soon after, Mr. Heckman called home with the news.
"I feel relieved to get a Nobel," Mr. Heckman said, speaking by telephone to reporters gathered for a news conference in Chicago. "I remember some reporter called me and asked, 'How does it feel to be at Chicago without a Nobel Prize?' After a while it starts to hurt."
Mr. McFadden in Berkeley got the call from Sweden even earlier. "I was dead asleep," he said. "My wife grasped what was happening before I did, and she was jumping up and down while I was still trying to figure out what was going on." Later, he told a television interviewer that he thought his chances of winning were "one in a million."
Mr. Heckman, in effect, has forced the economics profession to doubt findings once taken for granted. A survey, for instance, might find that two people from the same neighborhood, with the same high school education and similar backgrounds were offered job training. One took it and one did not, and the one who took the training then went on to earn a higher wage. The survey concluded that job training lifted wages.
Not necessarily so, said Mr. Heckman, who began to raise this sort of challenge soon after he joined the Chicago faculty in 1972, a year after earning a doctorate at Princeton. Motivation must also be factored in, he said. The one who went through job training and earned more might have been more ambitious and for that reason would have earned more without the job training.
Similarly, among women in the work force, a mother of three or four earned more than mothers with fewer children, studies found. That was puzzling. "Common sense said that employers did not care how many children an employee had," said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Heckman, however, added nonworking women to the database and found that women with three or four children insisted on good pay before they would take a job.
The statistical equations that Mr. Heckman developed to meld the workers and nonworkers -- thus correcting for "selection bias" and more accurately calculating the probability of going to work -- won him the Nobel. His findings are sometimes challenged, but not his insistence on all the variables that can arise. "He gets infinite credit," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist, "for pointing out how many inferences used by economists were flawed."
Mr. Heckman and Mr. McFadden are longtime friends who often exchange ideas but have never done joint research, although their findings and techniques are roughly related. "We are both in the business of inventing statistical tools that are appropriate to economic applications," Mr. McFadden said.
He was trained at the University of Minnesota in the 1950's and early 1960's, first in physics and then in economics, mainly because his interest in psychology drew him to professors in the economics department who emphasized psychology. In 1964, a year after arriving at Berkeley, a graduate student asked him for help in analyzing how the California Department of Transportation decided on routes for new highways.
"I worked out a model for her to use," he said. And that became a prototype of the statistical models that eventually won him the Nobel. The model quantified how public opinion polls and political pressure, for example, affected the choice of one route over other possible routes.
The model soon turned out to have other uses. Using the model, he has estimated, for example, what would prompt people to shift to cars powered by electric batteries rather than gasoline. "We found that substantial subsidies would be required," he said. "Nongasoline vehicles are fairly inconvenient and rather expensive, and that is rather discouraging for people."

HEADLINE: Fast Times at Global Crossing;
Enjoying the Spotlight While Building An Upstart in Telecommunications

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Oct. 11

 BODY:
"Please forgive me," Gary Winnick said, ushering a guest into his office last Thursday afternoon. "I'm a little distracted today."
Distracted indeed. Asia Global Crossing, a subsidiary of the telecommunications concern Global Crossing Holdings that Mr. Winnick co-founded more than three years ago, was expected to sell stock to the public that day. But that morning, as investors continued to bail out of technology stocks, several money managers had balked at the $9 to $11 a share that was being asked for Asia Global. 
 "I don't want to hear any whining from the bankers," Mr. Winnick snapped at a colleague who popped in to give him an update. Both Salomon Smith Barney and the Goldman Sachs Group had been asked to buy as many as 14 million shares of Asia Global to support the deal, an extraordinary request they could have refused, but did not. Mr. Winnick watched as the deal was done, although he had to settle for $7 a share.
Just four years ago, this relative newcomer to the billionaires' club -- his stake in Global Crossing is now worth about $2.5 billion, down from a peak of more than $6 billion -- could never have demanded such support from two of Wall Street's most respected firms. "But when you make several billion dollars the world's perception of you changes," said Nelson Peltz, a New York financier who has known Mr. Winnick since the early 1980's, when he was a young salesman at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the infamous investment firm, now defunct, that specialized in junk bonds. "You go from being an ordinary bloke to a guy who is infallible." Of course, Mr. Peltz added, neither image is true.
Mr. Winnick, 52, is a former furniture business manager from Roslyn, N.Y., who remade himself not once, but twice in his career. First he turned himself into a successful Wall Street sales executive at Drexel under the tutelage of Michael R. Milken before Mr. Milken's empire collapsed. Now he is known as the telecommunications financier behind Global Crossing, an undersea cable operator that is building a worldwide network to transmit information via the Internet.
And as far as Global Crossing investors are concerned, Mr. Winnick may need to remake himself all over again. Global Crossing's stock price -- down 65 percent from a high of $61.81 -- has taken a beating along with other telecommunications stocks as investors worry whether companies in the industry can deliver on the growth prospects they have promised. It closed today at $21.44, down $2.44.
One problem Global Crossing had early on, analysts said, was that it had plenty of deal makers, but not enough executives with real operating experience. The departure of Leo Hindery Jr. as chief executive after only seven months in the job -- the third to leave in Global Crossing's short history -- suggests that the company is still having difficulty putting together its operating team.
Mr. Winnick said that the company had pulled together the talent to address the problem and that Global Crossing had met every objective it had set for itself so far.
But he is all too aware that if Global Crossing slips up, he, too, may drop out of the spotlight. "I know I can go back to anonymity in a quick minute," he said. "It doesn't take much to fall off a rock."
And Mr. Winnick, for all his protestations, clearly enjoys the spotlight.
A fixture now on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, Mr. Winnick relishes the attention his wealth has brought him, dropping names of famous people he has met, including the Queen Mother of Britain, whose 100th-birthday party he attended. And he has taken on a more public persona as a philanthropist, most recently pledging $40 million to the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation to help build a Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem.
Not that he has forgotten where he came from. Mr. Winnick, for example, was married at the Swan Club, a catering hall near Roslyn, on Christmas Eve 1972, in part, he recalled, because he knew it would be decked out in tinsel and Christmas trees. Never mind that he is Jewish. "I saved money on the decorations," he said, a sly grin crossing his face. "That way I could serve the guests lobster or steak."
Today, what makes Mr. Winnick stand out, even in a city where success is often measured by how conspicuously you spend, is how quickly and fabulously wealthy he has become with Global Crossing. "Gary is extremely respected," said Alex Yemenidjian, chairman and chief executive of MGM Inc. "One, because he's rich. Two, because he got rich faster than others here."
Mr. Winnick moved to Los Angeles in 1978 to sell high-yield bonds for Drexel, after spending six years on Wall Street. At Drexel, he has told friends, he made as much as $2 million a month, but left the firm in 1985 to start his own investment fund. In 1991, he formed a merchant bank, Pacific Capital Group. For years he made a very comfortable but unglamorous living investing in real estate, industrial companies and entertainment.
Then along came the Internet. In December 1996, David Lee, an executive Mr. Winnick had hired in 1989, pitched an outlandish idea: build a fiber optic cable along the ocean floor to handle the burgeoning traffic over the Internet. It was not hard for Mr. Winnick to pull together the financing, including $15 million of his own money, throwing in an extra $5 million for his partners.
"Gary was never more than two degrees of separation from anyone we wanted to get to know," said Barry Porter, a co-founder of Global Crossing, who, along with Mr. Lee, recently left the company to set up a venture capital firm.
Indeed, Mr. Winnick is a master networker, amassing a Rolodex so fat he can call on just about anyone for help -- politicians, business executives, even socialites. To make sure Global's interests are on every legislators' agenda, for instance, Mr. Winnick and his associates are generous political donors -- well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- something they do not apologize for.
"As long as it's legal we're going to be a player," said Lodwrick Cook, who runs legislative affairs for Global Crossing.
But working for Mr. Winnick can be, in a word, tense. He is at times gruff, barking orders from his third-floor office with all the gusto of the Wall Street salesman he used to be. He holds late-night meetings while he works out on a treadmill. And he is not afraid to clash with employees if he believes it is necessary to force better decision making.
"It's always a complex relationship with Gary," said Abbott Brown, a friend since 1994 who recently left Global Crossing. "Love-hate? Maybe. Every transaction has some dark days." He recalled a meeting in 1997 when Mr. Winnick was pitching an idea Mr. Brown thought held little promise. "I made a comment to him like, 'That's a dumb idea,' " he said. Mr. Winnick shot back angrily. "I've listened to a lot of your dumb ideas," Mr. Brown said Mr. Winnick told him. "Now you have to listen to mine."
Mr. Winnick winced when reminded of the incident. "To understand that you had to grow up in my house," he said. Mr. Winnick, who was born in 1947, grew up the youngest of three children. His father, Arnold, struggled as the owner of a restaurant supply business, he said, before the business went bankrupt in the 1960's. His mother, Blanche, was a homemaker and interior decorator. He and his siblings worked out their differences both loudly and openly, he said, but always with respect.
Casey Cogut, a prominent Manhattan lawyer who was a childhood classmate, said Mr. Winnick "had this cute freckled face and you knew he could get away with murder." The two smoked cigarettes at Mr. Cogut's bar mitzvah, captured in a photograph that Mr. Winnick still keeps. And in Roslyn High School's 1965 yearbook, he was dubbed "1/4 Hawaii" because he and his three closest friends used to spend hours listening to the Beach Boys.
His father died when Mr. Winnick was 18 years old. "1966. March 3. 9:30 p.m.," Mr. Winnick said. "Two hours after dinner he had a heart attack. He went to his Thursday night card game. I got the call." Mr. Winnick then held up his right hand to show a diamond-and-ruby wedding band. "My mother handed me his ring that night and I've worn it ever since."
With it came a sense of responsibility for his mother and his future family. Instead of going away to college, he commuted to nearby C. W. Post, graduating in 1969 with a degree in economics. When his mother got ovarian cancer in 1987, he said he moved her to Los Angeles for treatment.
There are few things Mr. Winnick will not discuss. One of them is his experience at Drexel. He was long gone before Drexel filed for bankruptcy in 1990 and Mr. Milken, who masterminded the junk-bond unit, pleaded guilty to violating securities laws and served time in prison. But tensions were running high in the Los Angeles office then. And of particular concern to those there, said several people who worked at Drexel then, were whether or not exiles like Mr. Winnick were cooperating to regulators.
"People were circling the wagons," one former Drexel employee said. "It was us against them."
For his part, Mr. Winnick would not comment, except to say, "I think we come through those experiences, and we all have our scars."
Besides, he said, no one experience defines a lifetime. "I think it is too early to write the script," he said. "In terms of my legacy, I just hope I'm not judged to be a jerk."

The Federal Trade Commission announced plans today to subpoena records from 90 pharmaceutical companies to see whether drug industry strategies were keeping lower-cost generic drugs from patients or harming consumers.
The commission has already filed complaints against two brand companies and two generic companies, accusing them of making deals that effectively stopped or delayed the generic version of two brand-name drugs. Several other such agreements are under investigation. 
 "There are more of these agreements than we know about," one commission official said, "so our desire is to get our arms around the scope of the issue."
The economic stakes in the brand-generic drug wars are huge. In the next five years, drugs with $20 billion in annual sales in the United States will have come off patent, said Robert Pitofsky, the commission chairman. Without patent protection, drug manufacturers can lose significant profits. At the same time, the availability of generic competition can mean considerable savings for consumers.
Mr. Pitofsky said the study was meant to "ensure that the process of bringing new low-cost generic alternatives to the marketplace -- and into the hands of consumers -- is not impeded in ways that are anticompetitive."
Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the brand drug makers' trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said that any comment was premature.
"But," Ms. Cottrell said, "we are confident that any balanced study by the F.T.C. will find the brand-name industry's practices are beneficial to patients."
The trade commission's proposed study must undergo a period of public comment and then be approved by White House budget officials. This will delay any investigation until early next year, after the next president takes office.
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, is a critic of the pharmaceutical industry and has said brand-generic agreements unfairly deny consumers the benefits of competition. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has not addressed this specific issue, but the pharmaceutical industry has been generally supportive of his candidacy.
The trade commission's concerns trace to a 1984 law, now known as Hatch-Waxman, which was designed to ease greater competition between generic and brand-name drugs. But one of its co-authors, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said some incentives in the law had been used to delay competition, rather than foster it, costing consumers money and denying patients access to life-saving drugs.
Whatever the law's shortcomings, however, it has benefited consumers. A study last year, done for a generic company by Paul MacAvoy, a Yale University economist who advised Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, found that from 1985 to 1997, consumers saved $112.5 billion by buying generic drugs.
Despite the lost sales, the study also found, the brand-name drug companies actually increased their research and development outlays, to $18 billion from $4 billion.
Mr. Waxman wrote Mr. Pitofsky on Aug. 30 asking the commission to produce a study on the issue of deals between brands and generics. Last month, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona , and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced legislation to address the potential for manipulation in the 1984 law.

Share Prices Gyrate Before Ending With Steep Losses

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices gyrated in heavy trading yesterday but finished with sizable losses, deepening the slide that has prevailed with only brief interruption since early September.
The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology, fell at one stage beneath its low point of the year set May 23, then rallied to show gains for the day before sagging again to wind up with its 13th loss in the last 15 sessions. It closed at 3,168.49, down 72.05 points, or 2.22 percent. 
 Other major gauges also lost ground as Wall Street digested the latest round of warnings about third-quarter profit shortfalls and tried to assess the toll that the economic slowdown being engineered by the Federal Reserve will take on corporate performance next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 110.61 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at 10,413.79, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 22.43 points, or 1.62 percent, to 1,364.99.
"You've gone from total complacency to pretty high anxiety levels here," said Hersh Cohen, a portfolio manager at Salomon Smith Barney. "And when people see these big declines, they just sell more."
One depressant, analysts said, has been the seasonal sales of losers for tax purposes, typically to offset gains taken previously.
Brokerage stocks, at least, got a lift in midafternoon when Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the industry leader by market capitalization, disclosed losses of about $89.7 million from dealings in high-yield bonds, many of them telecommunications issues it had underwritten. This was far below the $500 million that had been rumored and that had contributed to a skid in the company's stock, which hit a high of $109.38 on Sept. 11. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose $3.25 yesterday, to $77.75.
And while the shares of Yahoo, Lucent and Motorola continued to be pounded after their late-Tuesday profit warnings, Fannie Mae announced a 13 percent rise in earnings and its shares advanced $3.13, to $71.13. General Electric, whose shares have the highest total value of any company, announced record profits, but its stock fell $1.44, to $56.63.
Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Dow's bull market; the average has not suffered any 20 percent declines since a rise that began Oct. 11, 1990.
Some analysts are finding grounds for optimism amid the recent gloom.
"We've had a pretty rough pre-announcement season but the carnage over the past couple of months has been so extraordinary and the sentiment has become so negative that I suspect we're near a bottom," said John Kattar, director of United States equities at Boston Company Asset Management.

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday as crumbling stock prices produced some buying of relatively low-risk government debt.
"The stock market is going down, and that's all guys are trading right now," said John Roberts, head of government trading at Barclays Capital.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to a price of 99 27/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 5.77 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 106. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.82 percent from 5.81 percent on Tuesday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 30-year inflation-indexed bonds:

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Chief Upset at Some of His Allies

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 11

 BODY:
President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia said today that he was having "almost as much trouble from my friends as from my enemies" in the transition from the rule of Slobodan Milosevic and that he was concerned that his own authority was being compromised.
But Mr. Kostunica expressed confidence that Mr. Milosevic's allies could not stage a comeback, even though they appear to be trying, and that difficulties in negotiating a transitional government for Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, would be resolved. 
 He said that he looked forward to his first meeting, on Thursday, with President Clinton's Balkan adviser, James C. O'Brien, and other senior American officials and that he was eager to begin a new, more balanced relationship with Washington, including a rapid re-establishment of diplomatic relations broken with the NATO bombing war last year.
"The United States has done too much meddling in our internal affairs," Mr. Kostunica said in an interview. "Now it's meddling less than usual, so this will have a positive influence." If re-establishing diplomatic relations is in his competence as federal president, he said, he will do it quickly.
Mr. Kostunica spoke in the offices of the federal president in the Palace of Federations as a small number of aides rushed in and out amid a cacophony of telephones, both land lines and cell phones.
In the interview, Mr. Kostunica said that some members of the 18-party coalition that supported his presidential candidacy were making policy statements that had not been cleared with him and were using extra-legal procedures to take control of certain ministries and companies that have been run by those close to Mr. Milosevic.
"I cannot justify all that's going on," he said. "On the surface there is a peaceful, democratic transition, but below the surface is a kind of volcano, not so controlled."
Mr. Kostunica spoke as a leading member of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party, Branislav Ivkovic, said that the current Serbian government would not resign and that the current prime minister had also taken the job of interior minister, which controls the police.
But Mr. Kostunica said he was confident that early elections for a new Serbian Parliament would take place, as agreed, on Dec. 17. While some parties in the Parliament "are fighting for seats" in a temporary government until those elections, "others are fighting to overturn the outcome" of the popular will, he said. But they would not succeed.
Another Kostunica ally with ties to the old regime, Dusan Mihajlovic, warned that Mr. Milosevic had begun to organize his allies to create difficulties and even chaos, including lifting some price controls, that could be blamed on Mr. Kostunica and his team. "We have information that Milosevic is pulling the strings," Mr. Mihajlovic said.
Mr. Kostunica has said that he does not recognize the legitimacy of the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague and would be against handing Mr. Milosevic over.
Some of Mr. Kostunica's allies, worried that Mr. Milosevic is creating difficulties for the new order, are speaking openly of putting him on trial in Serbia. In Washington, administration officials repeated today that the United States would not press for Mr. Milosevic's extradition right now. Some administration officials believe a trial within Serbia would be the next best thing.
Mr. Kostunica's allies are talking about a domestic trial of Mr. Milosevic, perhaps on charges of election fraud, to get him out of political life.
Mr. Kostunica expressed concern that some of his own allies in the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, or DOS as the coalition is known, were providing ammunition for the complaints of chaos and illegality made by the Socialists and Serbian Radicals. "Some members of DOS are not so much eating away at my authority -- that they cannot do," Mr. Kostunica said. "The problem is that they are compromising that authority."
In particular, he and his aides said, the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, who leads the strongest party by far in the coalition, is trying to consolidate the popular revolt against Mr. Milosevic, but in a way that has sometimes caused anger.
The best-known example was Mr. Djindjic's effort to put an ally, a well-known businessman, in charge of the Customs office after ousting the old minister. The appointment of Mr. Djindjic's ally caused an uproar among other political leaders and it was rescinded in a day.
In companies, banks, institutes and universities, Milosevic managers are being ousted, usually by workers tired of political bosses.
"Some of this is spontaneous, some of it is not," Mr. Kostunica said. "Some of it is comes from within, and some from the outside. And some of these actions are from people who are in connection with or appear on behalf of DOS or even myself, which is not true. But all together, it's something that worries me."
He said that the image of crime and chaos, part of any transition, was harmful. "But we'll settle all this among ourselves," he said. "But if it's an excuse for any foreign intervention, that would be the problem."
Mr. Djindjic has also made announcements that Mr. Kostunica has not approved. For example, Mr. Djindjic said that the Yugoslav Army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, would be fired. Mr. Kostunica, who met with the army command today, said he had no intention of firing General Pavkovic -- at least for now. The general became a popular hero for his efforts to defend Kosovo. Mr. Kostunica also has no interest now in stirring up a quiescent army while he and his allies try to ensure they control the Serbian police.
Mr. Kostunica and his allies obtained the resignation of the Serbian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, who ordered the police to attack protesters. But they have not succeeded yet in winning the job for themselves. Mr. Djindjic thinks it is crucial to protect the revolution, and tonight he offered joint control over four key ministries: Interior, Justice, Finance and Information.
But if the other parties do not agree to a new transitional government by the end of the week, Mr. Djindjic warned, the opposition will call thousands of people into the streets. Again, Mr. Kostunica seems less than enthusiastic over revolutionary tactics.
Mr. Ivkovic's statement to Radio B-92 was a form of challenge. "The Serbian government will go on ruling the republic since it was elected on a four-year mandate and it is the only body that can make legal decisions," he said. Another Serbian government statement, read on YU-Info, a television station close to Mr. Milosevic, accused the opposition of "fomenting violence and lawlessness" and taking over companies and ministries illegally. It urged the police to act and said control of television should be returned to its owners in the state and city.
But the police did not respond. And Mr. Djindjic said: "That government can declare itself not only legal but omnipotent but it's a fact of life they have no control over 80 percent of the processes in the country. We are tired of haggling and manipulations."
Mr. Kostunica and his staff also bridled at another Djindjic announcement that usurped federal presidential powers.
Mr. Djindjic said that Miroljub Labus, an economist, would become provisional prime minister of Yugoslavia. But Mr. Kostunica said today that he would choose a prime minister from Montenegro, as the Constitution required, who would be a member of the Socialist People's Party. The party won nearly all the seats in Montenegro because of an election boycott by the republic's president, Milo Djukanovic.
Mr. Kostunica will travel to Montenegro on Friday to meet the local party leaders and Mr. Djukanovic. They will discuss a new federal government and begin to talk about a new, more equal relationship between Serbia and tiny Montenegro within Yugoslavia.
Mr. Kostunica said today that he was not wedded to the name Yugoslavia, especially after all the wars of secession, and once favored "The Union of Serbia and Montenegro."
"The question is not the name but what sort of state we want," he said. "If the ties are too loose, we lose the sense of unity."

HEADLINE: G.E. Meets Forecast With 20% Rise in Net

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, apparently immune to the weak euro and the softening economy, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' estimates.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income rose to $3.18 billion, or 32 cents a share, compared with $2.65 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split. Revenue increased 18 percent, to $32 billion from $27.2 billion. 
 "To the extent there were surprises, they were good ones," said Martin A. Sankey, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs who follows G.E.
Investors, accustomed to G.E. meeting or beating expectations, reacted unenthusiastically. Shares of G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., slipped $1.63, to $56.63. But analysts reiterated their faith in the stock. "It would be hard not to have a 'buy' on a company with numbers like this," said Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
The news was not all good: locomotive sales were down at GE Transportation; two small GE Capital businesses took a total of $240 million in charges for reorganization; NBCi, the interactive TV company in which NBC owns a 40 percent stake, is losing money; and growth was sluggish in service revenue for several sectors.
Still, G.E. showed stellar results in industries that are riding a bumpy road. All chemical companies are suffering from price increases for petroleum products, but profits at GE Plastics rose 25 percent. Whirlpool and Maytag have issued earnings warnings, yet operating profits for GE Appliances rose 15 percent on a sales increase of 3 percent.
Even the Olympics, which drew fewer viewers than expected, were a miniboon for NBC, the G.E. broadcasting arm. NBC gave advertisers extra air time to make up for the shortfall in viewers, but it did so by cutting promotional spots and squeezing more commercials into breaks. Thus, it did not need to repay money or offer free commercials in the future.
"The Olympics may have been a ratings flop, but NBC probably performed better than it would have predicted," Mr. Sankey said.
Also, more cable networks have agreed to carry MSNBC and CNBC, NBC's cable channels.
Over all, G.E.'s success had several roots. Strong Japanese sales partly offset the euro's weakness. And sales of many of G.E.'s largest businesses, like Power Systems, are booked in dollars and are thus immune to currency fluctuations.
G.E.'s continued emphasis on Six Sigma, a quality control program, and on pushing sales, purchasing and order processing onto the Internet, all helped productivity. Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman, said savings from Six Sigma alone would hit $3 billion this year.
G.E. has been helping its chief customers add Six Sigma and electronic-commerce programs. Analysts say that this cements customer loyalty and may soon be a service that G.E. will sell.
"They are branding themselves as the best provider of information and productivity enhancement services," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
GE Appliances already has Web-based systems that let retailers ship items directly from G.E. factories to their customers. The setup has persuaded large retailers like Home Depot and, most recently, Wal-Mart Stores to offer G.E. refrigerators and the like.
"All retailers want to run with minimal inventory, and G.E. is facilitating that," Mr. Sprague said.
The quarter is unlikely to affect the race to succeed John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chairman, who will retire next year. The contenders remain Robert L. Nardelli, head of GE Power Systems; Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; and W. James McNerney Jr., head of GE Aircraft Engines.
Power Systems and Medical Systems had robust sales and earnings. Aircraft Engines posted a 15 percent rise in operating profits despite a 3 percent decline in sales, and was named exclusive provider of engines for newer versions of the Boeing 777 and for several regional aircraft.
Analysts have generally said that Mr. Immelt has the edge, and nothing about the quarter seems to have changed their minds. "Jeff was the guy, and he's still the guy," one said.

HEADLINE: Supporters of Transportation Bond Act Finally Have the Mayor On Board

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
After several weeks of indecision, the Giuliani administration offered a tepid endorsement yesterday of an Election Day ballot item that would authorize $3.8 billion in new borrowing to finance state highway, rail and other transportation projects.
The administration, while urging city voters to support the measure, echoed skepticism already expressed by several local officials who have questioned how much of what would be the largest bond act in state history would actually end up being spent in New York City. 
 "As the city's strong economy continues to attract new businesses, residents and visitors, our existing transportation infrastructure must be expanded to keep pace," said Robert Grotell, director of the mayor's Office of Transportation, during testimony before the City Council Transportation Committee yesterday. "Yet we are all too familiar with the difficulties of allocating a finite amount of funding across seemingly infinite project opportunities."
As planned, $1.8 billion of the total would be invested in highways and bridge projects statewide, while an additional $1.6 billion would go to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for upgrading the region's subway, rail and bus system. The remaining $400 million would be split among other state public transit systems, ports, airports and canals.
State officials say that over the next five years, the money would help buy 1,100 new subway cars, 1,200 new buses and renovate 64 subway stations and complete the design work for a Second Avenue subway line. The money would also pay for dozens of local highway projects, including the reconstruction of parts of the Grand Central Parkway and Henry Hudson Parkway.
But Giuliani administration officials said yesterday that they were concerned that the new bonds might just replace other sources of state financing already committed for city transportation projects. The skepticism, they noted, is justified given the state's failure to deliver the city money that was promised from previous bond acts, such as 1972 and 1996 measures supporting recycling and other environmental projects.
New York City's support for the measure is considered critical, not only because of its obviously large voting block, but the tendency, in some recent bond acts, for voters elsewhere in the state to oppose new debt spending. The most recent bond measure put before state voters -- a $2.4 billion school construction act in 1997 -- failed, as did two of the six bond acts related to transportation voted on since 1971.
As recently as yesterday morning, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was the target of criticism by some of the many local elected officials, business and labor leaders who had lined up to endorse the $3.8 billion transportation bond act.
"His voice is an important one to be heard," said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, minutes before Mr. Grotell testified to put the administration on record in favor of the measure.
But even some of the City Council members who support the measure said yesterday that they remained uncertain whether it would pass. There has been no organized statewide campaign to urge voter support, something considered critical in past successful bond act efforts.
"This helps a little bit, but not greatly," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens who is a member of the Transportation Committee. "They should have defined better for voters what this means. That is the fault of Albany."
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said yesterday that the governor welcomed the mayor's support. "We are confident the bond act will deliver substantial benefits for all regions of the state including New York City," Mr. Conway said.

HEADLINE: Changing Course, Giuliani Proposes Rent Subsidies for Homeless Families

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
In a striking departure from its previous policies, the Giuliani administration is proposing rent subsidies for homeless families in an effort to resolve bottlenecks in the city's emergency shelter system.
The proposed subsidies, which are part of a pilot project for more than 500 homeless families, were offered to comply with a court order. But they are also a sign that in a booming economy with sharply rising rents, the city is taking a fresh look at the problem of homeless families. And it acknowledges that the people crowding the city's shelters increasingly include the working poor. 
 Some rental supplements have been provided by the state since 1990, but those are limited to certain welfare households facing eviction. The new proposal, which would require state approval and is part of remedial plan the city submitted in court last week, would be aimed at homeless people who have jobs or are trying to move from welfare to work.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has opposed and even vetoed similar rental assistance programs in the past, contending that they encourage dependency on government and would make the city's emergency shelter system a magnet for families seeking subsidized apartments. Earlier this year, the mayor lost a bid to overturn the right to shelter established in the city through class-action lawsuits two decades ago.
But Mr. Giuliani has been trying to burnish and perhaps soften his mayoral legacy since he withdrew from the Senate race in May. And the administration was confronted with a crisis this summer when more than 500 families were left to sleep on the floors and benches of the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, the city's sole portal to shelters for families with children. That practice, which violates a longstanding court order, had been common until a year ago, when the City Council banned it and the Department of Homeless Services made new efforts to comply.
"When the people started sleeping on the floor, we went and tried to get additional relief," said Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel, who is handling the case. "This will make more permanent housing available."
At the same time, Mr. Koerner noted: "There is a fear that this is going to create an additional problem, because there are more families than housing. You have all these families out there doubled up."
He added, "I have no idea what the long-term solution is."
Debra Sproles, the spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration, said she did not expect the program to have a magnet effect, but added that because the program would begin as a six-month pilot project, "we have time to see what's going to happen."
Ms. Sproles stressed that the Human Resources Administration considered the program consistent with, not a departure from, its efforts to move people from welfare to self-sufficiency. Though details are still being worked out, she added, the pilot would include about 550 families now in the shelter system. Each family could get up to $600 a month in rental assistance in a combination of state, city and possibly federal money. The average subsidy, she said, is expected to be $300 to $400 and would last for two years.
Apart from the administration's new proposal, four nonprofit groups are also to begin offering rental assistance programs next month for about 200 households. Those programs would draw from $3 million in city money that was budgeted by the City Council. In previous years, the administration either vetoed or left unspent money appropriated by the Council for that purpose.
City officials have said that they do not track how many parents applying for shelter have jobs. But Barbara Cutler, the court-appointed special master who oversees the city's operation of the family shelter system under a longstanding court decree, said they were common. She added that the court was now focusing on problems in the application process that make it hard for working parents to keep their jobs and keep children in school.
"There are people that are real, live, hard-working citizens who still operate every day from the E.A.U.," Ms. Cutler said, referring to the Emergency Assistance Unit. "We have as a society to look at this again. We have to look at what the elements of being homeless really are."
Families who have waited night after night recently for temporary shelter in the Bronx unit office have included a nurse's aide employed for seven years on the midnight shift at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, and her two children; and a public schoolteacher who said she moved back here from Seattle with her 16-year-old son in response to the city's teacher shortage.
On a weeknight last month, the teacher called a reporter at 11:32 p.m. from the Bronx office and left a telephone message, describing her situation after 11 days of bouncing between overnight or short-lived shelter placements and the intake center, sometimes not getting a bed until after 3 a.m.
"I'm just letting you know how discouraged I am that at 5:30 I have to get up, and at 8:21 I have to be fresh for 61 New York City public schoolchildren," the teacher said. "It doesn't seem as though they anticipated the time when working people would be homeless."
Mr. Koerner told Justice Helen E. Freedman of New York State Supreme Court last month that the city planned an "aggressive program," including rent subsidies, to help move families more swiftly from temporary shelters to permanent housing.
Advocates for the homeless called the Giuliani administration's proposal a step in the right direction. They and the mayor's opponents on the City Council have long championed modest rent subsidies, combined with social services, as a more cost-effective way to help homeless people than the expansion of temporary shelter beds, which they say cost $3,000 a month for a family.
"I have been preaching the gospel of rental assistance for nearly 12 years now," said Mary Brosnahan, director of the Coalition for the Homeless, which pioneered a similar rental subsidy program with money from law firms and churches in the late 1980's. "It's a huge victory, practical and moral."
Steven Banks, counsel to the coalition and to the Homeless Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, whose contempt motions last month prompted the remedial plan, was more cautious.
"After seven years of resisting the notion that additional housing provided by the city is part of the solution to homelessness, it's a welcome first step," Mr. Banks said. "But it's not enough to make the current crisis, which has built up over years, go away."
In its legal papers, the city in part blamed unexpected demand for the recurrence of the old problem of families left in the Bronx office overnight, saying that the number of families seeking shelter was 9 percent higher between April 1 and Sept. 30 than during the same period last year.
But lawyers for the homeless dispute those figures, contending that the problem is not more demand, but an increase in "churning" -- multiple applications required of families who are wrongly found ineligible, shuttled between one-night placements and forced to reapply.
"The families that are caught up in these desperate circumstances now are including increasing numbers of working families and families fleeing from domestic violence," Mr. Banks said.
Both sides agree that since the court began examining the problem last month, crowding has eased, but Ms. Cutler said churning remained a concern.
In the last fiscal year, through June 30, there were 20,841 applications and reapplications made by families seeking shelter, according to the mayor's management report. The shelter system now houses 5,337 families, including 9,563 children.

HEADLINE: On Park Avenue, Another Trophy Changes Hands

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A pair of German developers has won the bidding war for the Seagram Building, the latest in a series of trophy properties changing hands in a frenzied Manhattan real estate marketplace.
The iconic bronze and topaz glass skyscraper on Park Avenue joins such other prime properties as Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building, the World Trade Center and CBS's Black Rock on what has become a crowded auction block. Some real estate brokers say that the rash of offerings is an indication that some landlords and investors are cashing out at what they believe is the peak of a four-year-old real estate boom. 
 The Seagram Building, a 38-story landmark at 52nd Street and Park Avenue, is being sold to Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs. The two agreed yesterday to buy the building from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association for more than $375 million, according to executives involved in the deal.
The new owners, the executives say, can make lots of money, but they are unlikely to reap the windfall profits of those who bought property cheap during the recession in the early and mid-1990's and then saw rents nearly double in recent years as the economy surged.
That did not prevent Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs from topping a rival bidder, Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, by more than $12 million, according to real estate executives.
"Many people think the market is either at the top or slightly past the top," said John D. Lyons, chief executive of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank. "So owners are asking for and obtaining premium prices."
Philip R. DiGennaro, managing director of T.I.A.A., said he was optimistic he would close the deal for the Seagram Building very soon, but he declined to name the buyer. The broker that handled the auction, Insignia/ESG, did not return calls requesting comment.
If the deal closes, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs, who head RFR Holding, would own the two great postwar glass skyscrapers on Park Avenue. Only 14 months ago, RFR Holding bought the landmark Lever House, the 21-story skyscraper that sits across the street from the Seagram Building at 390 Park Avenue. The building was the first glass-walled office tower built in Manhattan.
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs moved to New York in the late 1980's from Frankfurt and began buying real estate in 1991, as the market collapsed. In a relatively short time, they have accumulated a portfolio of 16 office buildings and a dozen apartment houses worth nearly $2 billion.
Built in 1958 at a cost of $41 million, the Seagram Building is the only skyscraper in New York designed by Mies van der Rohe, the prince of International Style architecture, and Philip Johnson, who was then his acolyte. The architect was given an unlimited budget for the project at the urging of Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of Samuel Bronfman, Seagram's chairman.
The Seagram Building was the most expensive office tower of its day. And it is still an expensive gem. The bronze exterior of the building is oiled once a year by hand and the terrazzo floors in the elevator lobbies are polished once a month.
But the Seagram Building is not the only trophy on the block. After Rockefeller Center was put up for sale earlier this year, a half-dozen other major office towers suddenly followed suit, each owner hoping to make a huge profit.
"There may be an unusual number of big buildings up for sale," said Darcy Stacom, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield, "but there are an awful lot of interested buyers."
Equitable Life Assurance Society and Nippon Life Insurance of Japan hired Cushman & Wakefield to sell the 42-story PaineWebber Building at the Avenue of the Americas and 52nd Street, and CBS is seeking offers for its 38-story black granite skyscraper at 51 West 52nd Street.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is examining seven bids ranging up to $3 billion for a 99-year lease of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.
Last month, Goldman Sachs & Company's Whitehall fund, the principal owner of Rockefeller Center, winnowed the list of bidders for the historic 12-building complex to the Fisher real estate family; Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties; Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust; and Sam Zell, chairman of Equity Office Properties. Goldman and its partners, which include Mr. Speyer, bought the seven million-square-foot complex for $1.2 billion and are hoping to sell it for more than $2 billion, although some analysts say the price may be too high.
Mr. Speyer and Travelers Group are also selling, or refinancing, the landmark Chrysler Building on 42nd Street. The partners bought the mortgage for the 1.9 million-square-foot Art Deco complex almost three years ago for $220 million, then spent $100 million on renovations. They now put the value of the property as high as $800 million.
According to Granite Partners, the average sale price for Midtown office buildings has risen to almost $300 a square foot, from about $150 a square foot in 1997. Buyers are willing to pay even more for landmark buildings whose cachet often translates into higher rents. At the Lever House, for instance, rents are close to $100 a square foot, $35 higher than the average asking rent in Midtown. And very little vacant office space is available today in Manhattan.
"The underlying market shows no signs of letting up," said Robert A. Sass, director of real estate investment at GVA Williams.
But with interest rates rising, technology stocks faltering and the economy starting to slow, many analysts expect rents to rise more slowly and profits to be more modest, said Mr. Lyons of Granite Partners.
Still, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs expect to take advantage of the fact that nearly three-quarters of the leases in the Seagram Building will expire in the next five years. With rents in the building at about half the average in Midtown today, the new owners expect to raise rents quickly.
"If the market continues at this rate, it's an absolute home run," said one person involved in the negotiations. "If it doesn't, there's tremendous risk."

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO SCRAP BELGRADE EMBARGO ON OIL AND TRAVEL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton is to announce on Thursday that he is lifting many of the trade and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia that were intended to speed the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, immediately ending the ban on American flights and an embargo on oil to the country, senior administration officials said.
Mr. Clinton will make a commitment to join with the European Union in sweeping away a variety of additional sanctions over the next several weeks, except for those specifically intended to keep Mr. Milosevic, his family and their political allies from sending millions of dollars in assets overseas. 
 But administration officials said they would retain, at least for the time being, the so-called "outer wall" of sanctions that prevent Yugoslavia from receiving aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
That last sanction -- a critical one, because foreign investors are unlikely to return to the country without guarantees from those international institutions -- will remain in place until the United States has discussed Mr. Milosevic's legal fate with the new government of President Vojislav Kostunica. Page A10.
"What we needed to do immediately is open the psychological and the economic spigots, get the oil flowing, get the airplanes in," a senior Clinton aide said this evening. Some of the lifting of the sanctions will be more symbolic than substantive -- the embargo on oil was notably toothless. However, the ability to trade with the United States is widely considered a prerequisite for economic recovery.
The official said that delivering Mr. Milosevic to the international criminal tribunal at The Hague, where he has been indicted on charges of war crimes, may not be a prerequisite for the removal of the rest of the sanctions. He said that the Clinton administration may be satisfied if Mr. Milosevic stands trial in Yugoslavia.
"Obviously Milosevic is an issue," the official said. "But it may be an issue that takes care of itself, either because they change their minds, and turn him over, or they try him themselves."
So far Mr. Kostunica, who has challenged the legitimacy of the the Hague tribunal as a tool of American policy, has said he would not turn over his predecessor. And even if he decides that removing Mr. Milosevic from the scene will serve his interests, it is far from clear that his tenuous hold on the levers of state power, many of which are still in the hands of Milosevic allies, would give him the power to determine Mr. Milosevic's fate.
All these questions will be raised, officials say, as the first American diplomats arrive in Belgrade over the next day to begin discussions with Mr. Kostunica's new government, being formed after last week's popular revolution. Two senior officials are already on their way: William Montgomery, the coordinator of the office of Yugoslav affairs, which is based in Budapest, and James C. O'Brien, the special adviser to the president for democracy in the Balkans.
While the first sanctions will be lifted this week, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces embargoes, is working to track financial flows out of Yugoslavia.
Already, officials say, there is evidence that Mr. Milosevic's cronies are using the almost nonexistent controls over banks, resulting from the upheaval of recent weeks, to funnel millions of dollars out of the country.
One American official said the movement of funds was "reminiscent of Ferdinand Marcos's last days" in the Philippines. It took years to track the former Philippine president's holdings, and even then only a fraction were recovered.
Even before Mr. Kostunica has consolidated his power, there is considerable debate in Washington over the extent to which the economic sanctions contributed to Mr. Milosevic's downfall.
Not surprisingly, White House officials believe that they played a significant role. Even aides to Mr. Clinton who have previously expressed great skepticism about the usefulness of economic sanctions -- especially the sanctions on Cuba -- insist that because so many nations worked together in cutting off Yugoslavia's access to goods and financial markets, popular discontent with Mr. Milosevic rose to the surface rapidly.
"The reason that people finally rose up and said we are going to get rid of this guy is that their lives are hard," said one of Mr. Clinton's closest aides. "This was a case in which sanctions played a big, big role."
But Richard N. Haass, a Brookings Institution scholar who served on the National Security Council under President Bush and has published two lengthy studies of sanctions and their effectiveness, disagreed.
"Sanctions at most played a modest role, and those who are suggesting that they were critical in recent events are simply wrong," he said in an interview today. Referring to the peace talks in Ohio that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, he said: "Sanctions didn't get Milosevic to Dayton; that was the NATO bombing and the Croatian Army. And sanctions couldn't stop the massacres in Kosovo. They had a contributing effect, but not a decisive one."
Mr. Haass agreed with the administration, however, that turning over Mr. Milosevic should not be a prerequisite for breaching the "outer wall" of financial aid. "The goal is to make Yugoslavia a normal European country," he said. "I would not make coughing up Milosevic the No. 1 priority. After all, he was largely killing his own people, and he can be tried in his own country."

DATELINE: EAST FISHKILL, N.Y., Oct. 11

 BODY:
When I.B.M. announced on Tuesday that it would spend $2.5 billion and hire 1,000 new employees to create "the world's most technologically advanced" chip factory here, the conventional wisdom, perhaps, was that the news would elate the residents of this Hudson Valley town.
After all, the announcement came seven years after the company had stunned and demoralized the community with a severe downsizing that disproved the assumption that a job at Big Blue was a job forever. 
 But instead, as news of the expansion settled today, people here said that they were pleased, but added some asterisks. Sure, the 1,000 jobs would be nice and would complement the bevy of large and small businesses that have opened here in recent years. But would this mean more overcrowding in the local schools? Would it mean even more new housing developments in a booming real estate market?
"I can see where people are very tentative," said Marlene Stager, a substance-abuse counselor, who was taking two of her sons to the local library, which is in the midst of an expansion project. "I.B.M. is just not the same anymore, because people know that maybe they'll cut people loose in another 5 or 10 years."
If East Fishkill, which is 67 miles from Manhattan, was once the epitome of a one-company town, it is now the epitome of how the good times and astounding growth associated with the new economy can make the most painful of memories recede a little more easily, even after what was supposed to be the most crippling of events.
It is hard to overstate how devastating people thought I.B.M.'s downsizing was back in 1993. Everyone here, it seemed, either worked for the company or had a relative or neighbor who did. So when the company announced the cutbacks, people could hardly believe the news, and resented the company bitterly for destroying the area's equivalent of a tenured job, a resentment that still lingers in some quarters.
But the Hudson Valley of 2000 is much different from the Hudson Valley of 1993. Now, new developments with half-million dollar homes are sprouting everywhere. Home-based businesses run by former I.B.M. employees abound. Rentals are snapped up in hours. The unemployment rate is among the lowest in the region.
So while I.B.M. is still a major force in the area, people now regard the company as just one of many businesses, and not the only game in town.
"It's not the real bread and butter in the community," said Rich Robbins, the senior public health sanitarian for the Dutchess County Department of Health, who was inspecting wells at a new housing development not far the I.B.M. site.
I.B.M. plans to build its new factory, which will produce some of the thinnest computer chips in the world, within a building where it had closed a major chip-production operation in 1993, at the coda of a series of moves paring its work force in the region to 14,000 from 30,700 in 1985.
So naturally, the people most excited by the news, other than the local and state officials who had avidly courted the company and granted it a generous package of tax breaks and incentives, were businesses located near the site. Across the street from the old factory, Rania Nsheiwat, whose brother, Omar, owns Robbie's Y2K Deli, said that her family's business would probably extend its hours to cater to the new I.B.M. employees.
But in areas beyond the immediate vicinity of the plant, the reaction, while supportive, was also much more guarded and muted.
In recent years, the town has attracted a wave of people from Westchester, Putnam and the Bronx. These new residents -- sometimes called the "city folk" by longtime residents -- typically work either in Manhattan or in Westchester, but have decided that the long time spent commuting is a fair price to pay for bigger and cheaper houses than they could find in their former communities.
Theresa Belluzzi is typical of the new crowd. She and her family moved from Yonkers eight years ago, buying a house from a family that had been downsized by I.B.M. Her husband is a union representative in Manhattan, and she runs a business out of her home teaching people how to organize and preserve their family photos.
The I.B.M.-ers, she said, were bitter then, making snide remarks about the company. But these days, hardly anyone talks about the company's fortunes or misfortunes. In fact, the job market is so tight these days, service at low-wage employers like Wal-Mart is paltry. So the addition of 1,000 jobs will most likely make the job market even tighter.
"I really think they're going to overcrowd the area," she said.
As for the former I.B.M.-ers, some said that they thought the new factory was great news, particularly as a psychological boost. But some said that the original layoffs from the mid-1990's, while devastating at first, had not been a permanent blow because many employees had started their own businesses or returned to do some consulting work, albeit at lower salaries, for I.B.M.
"Actually, with I.B.M. downsizing, in retrospect, it was a big nothing," said Chris McClernon, a senior loan officer at Warwick Savings Bank, whose husband received a severance package from I.B .M. in 1993. "It's always nice to have people come in, but it's like 'where are we going to put them?' "

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton, in Ad, Faults Lazio for Missed Votes

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
If it was good enough for Alfonse M. D'Amato when he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1998, then it is good enough for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she runs for the Senate in 2000.
Or so it would seem from a new advertisement released by Mrs. Clinton yesterday. The ad attacks Representative Rick A. Lazio for precisely the thing that Mr. D'Amato attacked Charles E. Schumer for when Mr. Schumer challenged Mr. D'Amato: sneaking out of Washington so he could campaign. 
 "Recently, Rick Lazio skipped 59 of 60 votes in Congress," the announcer declares at the start of the ad. Then, in the space of 15 brisk seconds, it lists, in stark white type against a black background, the votes Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, missed in Congress this month. In much the same way, almost exactly two years ago this month, Mr. D'Amato ticked off votes that Mr. Schumer missed for almost three straight weeks during the 1998 campaign.
News of the new Clinton ad produced a topsy-turvy day in the New York Senate race. As it turns out, many of the players from 1998 are still on the scene today -- either as campaign advisers or commentators -- and both Democrats and Republicans, apparently unabashed, raced to the opposite side of the ideological field and marshaled the same arguments that had been used against them the last time.
Two years ago, for example, Howard Wolfson, then the press secretary for Mr. Schumer, characterized the attack on Mr. Schumer's missed votes as "fraudulent." Yesterday, that word was not used by Mr. Wolfson, who as communications director for Ms. Clinton, excoriated Mr. Lazio for his absences from Washington.
"Congressman Lazio is trying to tell New Yorkers that he is an effective legislator for New York, and he has stopped doing his job," Mr. Wolfson said. "He has put his own career and ambitions ahead of New York."
Asked how this differed from Mr. Schumer in 1998, he responded: "If you look at 1998, then-Congressman Schumer was trying to make his votes. The difference is that Congressman Lazio has essentially stopped doing his job completely."
Over at Republican headquarters, Mr. Lazio's aides sounded, well, the same way Mr. Wolfson sounded two years ago: they complained that Mrs. Clinton was referring to absences for ceremonial votes, or votes on which Mr. Lazio's presence would not have made a difference, for the sake of some political points. "Either Mrs. Clinton has no understanding of the legislative process, or she is blatantly trying to deceive New Yorkers," said Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager.
Among the votes that Mr. Lazio missed, and that were listed in Mrs. Clinton's ad, were financing for 100,000 new teachers and the Violence against Women Act. The ad said Mr. Lazio was present for a vote on a 3 percent congressional payroll increase, but the measure that was cited was in fact part of a larger Treasury bill that raised salaries for a wide range of federal employees, including members of Congress.
Even Kieran P. Mahoney, the D'Amato consultant who helped direct the attack against Mr. Schumer in 1998, said it was unfair of Mrs. Clinton to use the attack against Mr. Lazio. The difference, Mr. Mahoney said, was that Mr. Lazio had a nearly perfect voting record until Labor Day, when he accelerated his campaigning, whereas Mr. Schumer had missed votes for nearly a year before his election. Unlike Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lazio did not have to face a primary for his party's nomination; he entered the race in June.
All of which begs the question: Does this kind of political attack work? Mr. Schumer's aides long insisted that the attacks by Mr. D'Amato had no effect on Mr. Schumer, who went on to defeat Mr. D'Amato's bid for a third term. That said, the fact that Mrs. Clinton is now embracing the same line would appear to be a belated affirmation of the effectiveness of the tactic.
Mr. Schumer's chief strategist, Hank Morris, declined to comment yesterday. But Mr. Schumer allowed that he believed attacks on a legislator's attendance record could be very potent. "It is an effective line of attack," he said.
Mr. Schumer said that he believed it had taken a toll on his campaign, until it was revealed that Mr. D'Amato had missed dozens of votes on the Suffolk County Board of Supervisors when he first ran for Senate. "Then it just evaporated," Mr. Schumer said.
But there is one practical effect to attacking voting records, as Mr. Schumer learned: It is harder to skip votes in Washington when public attention is suddenly turned on your attendance.
Yesterday, Mr. Lazio cut short a day of campaigning in Buffalo to return to Washington for votes on appropriation bills, among them an agricultural bill that included provisions for upstate farmers and apple growers. Although Mrs. Clinton's aides seized on this as evidence that he was scurrying in response to the ads, Mr. Lazio's aides had, for several days, said he intended to go to Washington for the spending bills.
His advisers expressed incredulity at learning that Mrs. Clinton had borrowed a page from Mr. D'Amato's book. "This is pure Clinton-think: They will say and do anything to win," said Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's spokesman. "And do it with a straight face. It's amazing."
While he was upstate yesterday, Mr. Lazio weighed in on a dispute between the Seneca Indian tribe and New York State over 18,000 acres of land. Mr. Lazio argued that a solution to the land claims dispute did not require federal intervention, but should be resolved locally. Mr. Lazio also toured Niagara Falls High School, where every student has been given a laptop computer, and met for about half an hour with Bishop Henry J. Mansell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo.
In a series of speeches over the past two days, Mr. Lazio has moved away from asserting that the upstate economy had "turned a corner," after critics, including some upstate Republicans, said he appeared insensitive to lingering economic distress. Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Lazio for not having an economic plan to benefit the upstate region.
Meanwhile, the New York State United Teachers group disclosed that it had bought more than $500,000 worth of time on radio stations for advertisements that might be used, the group acknowledged, to help bolster Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. Such advertisements are barred under an agreement between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton on campaign spending, though that deal has appeared increasingly shaky. The union said it would not place such ads if the deal remained in place, and would use the time for get-out-the-vote ads.

HEADLINE: Albright Says She Will Visit North Korea Soon

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said tonight that she planned to visit North Korea soon. She will be the highest-level American official to visit the Communist nation since the end of the Korean War nearly 50 years ago.
Dr. Albright revealed her plans in a brief comment during a speech at a dinner here in her honor given by one of North Korea's top military leaders, Gen. Jo Myong Rok. 
 She said she would have more to say about the visit on Thursday.
A South Korean newspaper reported that the visit will be in December.
Dr. Albright's planned trip is another sign of the slow thaw in relations between the United States and North Korea, which is one of the few remaining Communist dictatorships. On Tuesday, President Clinton met with General Jo, the first time that a president has met with a North Korean official.
In remarks at a dinner that she gave for General Jo on Tuesday evening, Dr. Albright said that what has been contested ground can, over time, become common ground.
"Hostility between our two nations is not inevitable, nor desired by our citizens, nor in the interests of our countries," she said. "This is why we must seize the opportunity to take the concrete steps required to open a new and more hopeful chapter in our relations."
American troops have been stationed in South Korea since the end of the war in 1953.
In addition to objections about North Korea's Stalinist ideology, successive administrations have been alarmed by the country's development of nuclear weapons. The Clinton administration has mixed a lifting of some economic sanctions with threats of military force to persuade North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. North Korea is on the State Department's list of states that support terrorism.
The last year has also seen a thaw in the relations between North and South Korea.
Families divided for nearly half a century have held reunions, and in June, the leaders of North and South Korea met.
In a bit of diplomacy, the International Olympic Committee persuaded the two countries to march together at the recent summer games in Sydney.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Democratic New Spending vs. Republican Tax Reductions

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
The Republican National Committee released two new commercials this week attacking Vice President Al Gore for proposing a budget that it asserted would turn projected surpluses into deficits and endanger the nation's prosperity.
The advertising is part of an effort by the Republicans to put Mr. Gore on the defensive over his proposals for new spending and to neutralize any advantage that the strong economy might give Mr. Gore. It also tries to blunt Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's tax plan, which Democrats say disproportionately favors the wealthy. 
 One of the commercials focuses exclusively on the scale of Mr. Gore's spending plans. The other contrasts Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan with Mr. Gore's spending proposals.
The commercials are scheduled to run in 17 states, including Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 
PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with a white screen and the words "Whose economic plan is best for you?" Then flashes to a screen with a chart labeled "Bush: Tax Cut Plan," showing how people at various income levels would do under Mr. Bush's proposal. Next comes a chart comparing the spending proposals made by President Clinton with those made by Mr. Gore. Concludes with text on a white screen saying that Mr. Gore's plan would undermine the economy.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Whose economic plan is best for you? Under George Bush's plan, a family earning under $35,000 a year pays no federal income taxes, a 100 percent tax cut. Earn $35-50,000? A 55 percent tax cut. And Al Gore's plan? Three times the new spending President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire surplus and creates a deficit again. Al Gore's deficit spending plan threatens America's prosperity."
 
ACCURACY -- The chart describing the effects of the Bush tax plan is somewhat misleading. Many families making less than $35,000 a year already pay no federal income taxes. Mr. Bush's plan would remove more of them from the income tax rolls, mainly by doubling the child credit. But the claims in the commercial are based on a family with two children; single people and families with fewer than two children would not fare as well.
The assertion that Mr. Gore is proposing three times the spending sought by Mr. Clinton is based on a comparison of the 1992 Clinton campaign's agenda with Mr. Gore's proposals this year. Mr. Clinton made his proposals at a time when the government was running a record budget deficit and was constrained from expanding or adding programs. Mr. Gore is proposing ways to allocate a large and growing surplus. The comparison is based on a study by the National Taxpayer's Union, a conservative research group, which says Mr. Gore's spending plans total $2.9 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore puts the number at between $870 billion and $1 trillion.
 
SCORE CARD -- Mr. Bush has sought to frame the debate as one about who would best take advantage of the nation's prosperity, rather than about who gets the credit for it. The new advertising is intended to suggest that Mr. Gore is an old-style tax-and-spend liberal who will squander the surplus, while emphasizing that Mr. Bush is giving a tax break to lower and middle income families. But the more that Mr. Bush pushes economic issues, the more he risks reminding voters that the country has rarely, if ever, had it this good. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: Lazio Tax Cut Is Better for State, Conservative Group Says

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A new study asserts that Hillary Rodham Clinton's tax cut plan would be less beneficial for New Yorkers than the one proposed by Representative Rick A. Lazio, because hers relies more on giving reductions to people who make certain expenditures and have incomes below specific ceilings.
The study, by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, notes that salaries and the cost of living are higher in New York than in most states. As a result, plans that provide tax cuts to anyone in the country making less than a threshold -- often referred to as "targeted tax cuts" -- would exclude more people in New York than in some other states. 
 The report notes that the median income for a family of four is $50,200 nationally, $56,100 in New York State, $56,200 in New York City, and $83,100 in Westchester County. So tax cuts that are supposedly directed at an average family by imposing an income ceiling of say, $52,000, might exclude many of those in New York.
That conclusion is also true for the tax cut plan proposed by Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, has presented a more sweeping package that would benefit far more New Yorkers by reducing taxes for people with all levels of income.
Democrats have generally favored targeted tax cuts whose benefits go more toward the poor and middle class, arguing that some of the federal surplus should be used to pay down the national debt and shore up Social Security. The Republicans argue that those objectives can be achieved even with more broadly based tax cuts, and argue that the government should not reward people for making certain expenditures, and should give benefits to all taxpayers.
Middle-class families will "fare better under Lazio's plan than under Clinton's, although most will receive less tax relief than under Governor Bush's plan," writes the author of the report, Edmund J. McMahon Jr. "Lazio's plan is particularly beneficial to families earning the median income or above in New York City's suburbs."
Mrs. Clinton has proposed a tax cut package for items like college payments, child care and retirement savings. Mr. Lazio has called for easing the so-called marriage penalty, repealing some taxes on Social Security benefits and allowing the payroll tax to be deducted.
Neera Tanden, the deputy campaign manager for the Clinton campaign, questioned the thesis and methodology of the report. She said the Clinton plan would in fact have more benefits for New York, relative to its overall cost. "Hillary supports targeted tax cuts that meet the needs of working families," she said. "Rick Lazio's trillion-dollar tax cut plan is fiscally irresponsible and threatens our current economic prosperity."
Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lazio has proposed initiatives that include income ceilings for their cuts, although Mr. Lazio's are more broadly based than Mrs. Clinton's. The Lazio plan's biggest reduction, allowing the payroll tax to be deductible, is limited to those in the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets (that is, up to $105,950 in taxable income for couples, the report says).
The report concludes that the Lazio plan would provide New Yorkers with $4.2 billion in tax cuts.
Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, said, "We are pleased that the Manhattan Institute has joined the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union in clearly showing that Congressman Lazio's economic plan is far superior for New York's families."
The Clinton plan would cut taxes by $1.2 billion for New Yorkers, according to the report. But the Clinton campaign said the report left out a $1.8 billion cut for retirement plans. Mr. McMahon, the author, said that he had understood from campaign officials that the cut was intended to benefit businesses, not individuals, but that if there was a misunderstanding, the amount should be included and the total benefits should be $3 billion.
Both packages are dwarfed by the Bush proposal, which would give New Yorkers $11.1 billion in reductions. The Gore plan would save taxpayers in the state $3.5 billion, according to the report.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: FOREIGN POLICY;
A Delicate Dance of the Interventionist and the Reluctant Internationalist

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
For the better part of a year now, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have gingerly stepped around much detailed discussion of how America should exercise its unchallenged economic, diplomatic and military power around the world.
When they were finally forced to face off on that question in their presidential debate tonight, it seemed as if each had calculated that there was little electoral advantage in fighting over foreign policy. Indeed, rather than talk about how to exert American might -- the subtext of the famous Nixon-Kennedy debates in 1960 and so many of the cold-war-era debates that followed -- they spent much of the time politely warning of the foreign entanglements they might avoid. 
 And yet there were some significant distinctions -- often buried in quick asides meant to hint, but never exactly state, how each man might run the country differently from the other.
Mr. Gore portrayed himself as the interventionist Democrat, the man who would be driven largely by "a question of values" and who would consider an act of genocide enough of a challenge to American interests to consider sending troops abroad. He stopped short, however, of saying the Clinton administration should have done so to stop the genocide in Rwanda six years ago.
Mr. Bush was the reluctant internationalist, the man who allowed that "we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade" and then insisted that America should keeps its troops out of Africa and Haiti, or anyplace else where the mission sniffed of "nation-building." He never defined that phrase, but he made clear that he thought the purpose of the American military was to fight wars, not rebuild countries.
And in Mr. Bush's world view, America's traditional allies mattered far more than remote, poor or strategically inconsequential nations. "There's got to be priorities," he said, ticking off the Middle East, Europe, the Far East and "our own hemisphere," a list that conspicuously omitted Africa and many of the world's poorest nations.
"I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say, 'This is the way it's got to be,' " Mr. Bush said, sounding much like the Democrats sounded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Later he added, "I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country, say, ' We do it this way; so should you.' "
That left Mr. Gore free to sound more like the Republicans of two decades ago -- certain that America's role is to make others in the world exercise their long-suppressed desire to "be like us more." He described himself, as he did in an interview last week, as a nation-builder and proud of it.
Once again, he invoked President Harry S. Truman's use of the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, seeming to suggest that it was the kind of role Mr. Bush would have opposed.
"We were nation-building," Mr. Gore said. "And it was economic, but it was also military."
This all seemed like an academic argument, more suited for International Relations 101. But it got interesting as soon as it got specific.
Pressed by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, about when they would have committed troops and when they would have backed off, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush politely quibbled. But these were quibbles with a deeper message that suggested significantly different standards of when American intervention makes sense.
Lebanon, where American marines died in a huge car-bomb blast? "I thought that was a mistake," Mr. Gore said.
Grenada, where President Ronald Reagan, in the name of saving American medical students, made a clumsy but successful stand against a tiny government that seemed to be defying American wishes and influence? "I supported that," he said, along with the Bush administration's ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's dictator. But he had second thoughts about Somalia, a decision of "the Bush-Quayle administration," he said, unable to avoid reference to one of the Republican Party's less admired vice presidents.
Mr. Bush, treading carefully, had problems with Somalia, too, not the mission his father began but the one President Clinton finished.
"Started off as a humanitarian mission and then changed into a nation-building mission," he insisted, "and that's where the mission went wrong."
But he supported almost every other intervention -- "Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on," he said, to laughter, in a reference to his father's decisions -- raising the question of when he in fact would decide to keep his forces at home.
Later, pressed about where he might pull back American forces, which he said were overcommitted, Mr. Bush had a hard time. He would keep them in Korea, he said, and in Europe. But he also said he would hand off peacekeeping to other, regional players; he cited Australia's role last year in East Timor as a superb example of where someone else provided the troops while the Pentagon gave advice and a bit of logistical help. He said he would like to withdraw American troops from the Balkans, but not immediately. The only place he named from which he would withdraw troops at once was Haiti, where there are only a handful.
Governor Bush may have left viewers with the incorrect impression that the United States is alone in maintaining ground troops to keep the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo.
"I'd very much like to get our troops out of there," he said. "I recognize we can't do it now; nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground."
But many other nations -- and not just the NATO allies -- have ground troops currently committed to the Balkans. Of the 20,000 troops now assigned to the Bosnia peacekeeping mission, 4,600 are American. In Kosovo, the total mission of 40,000 troops has 6,000 Americans.
The dynamic of the interventionist Mr. Gore and the more reluctant Mr. Bush also played out beyond the military realm.
As on other foreign policy issues, the two men gingerly approached the question of when America should put up its own money, or the International Monetary Fund's, to stop financial crises. Here, Mr. Bush was more specific.
"I think the I.M.F. has got a role in the world," the governor said, "but I don't want to see the I.M.F. out there as a way to say to world bankers, 'If you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.' "
Yet that is exactly what the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury did in Mexico, an intervention that was supported by Mr. Bush, whose home state, Texas, would have borne the brunt of a more severe Mexican economic collapse.
Without noting that Mr. Gore had been the architect of much of the Clinton administration's Russia policy, Mr. Bush charged that the administration had blindly lent to corrupt regimes. "We went into Russia," he said. "We said, 'Here's some I.M.F. money,' and it ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket."
He referred to the former Russian prime minister, who was Mr. Gore's counterpart in long negotiations over Russian reforms.
Numerous studies of the I.M.F. bailouts of Russia have failed to prove that Mr. Chernomyrdin benefited directly, though the enterprises that he made a fortune running were certainly helped.
Mr. Gore was clearly on the defensive, and said he was uncomfortable with the I.M.F. "I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable," he said, without giving specifics.
And then he went on to decry corruption -- hardly a controversial position -- before insisting that providing aid was also a way of extending American influence.
"We have a fundamental choice to make," he said. "Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II?"
Mr. Bush chose not to answer, at least directly.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW;
This Time, More Accord Than Discord

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore agreed more than they disagreed last night in an event that was often closer to a cordial conversation than a debate as they exchanged views on tense foreign conflicts and domestic matters like racial profiling, gun control and same-sex marriage.
The forum in Winston-Salem, N.C., was a striking departure from the first debate a week ago in Boston, when they energetically took deeply different stands on issues like taxes and prescription drugs that have been at the heart of the presidential race. 
 But last night, breaking with their campaigns' scathing commercials and their own oratory, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were respectful, and at times even complimentary. The civility prompted Mr. Bush to volunteer at one point that it seemed "like we're having a great love-fest tonight." Transcript, Page A22.
The subdued tenor was largely deliberate. Advisers in both camps said their candidates were determined not to put off voters by coming across as strident. Yet many of the questions by the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, were on issues over which the nominees had few differences.
Not until the last 15 minutes of the evening did the candidates grow slightly combative, with Mr. Gore questioning Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas, and Mr. Bush asserting that the vice president's tendency to embellish raised questions about his credibility. That prompted the vice president to take the unusual step of apologizing for his previous misstatements.
Even when they did clash, the jabs were cloaked in decorous tones. At one point, Mr. Gore, who was hardly bashful at deriding his rival in the first debate, seemed to almost apologize when he turned to Mr. Bush and said of health care proposals in Texas: "I'm sorry to tell you, there is a record here."
The first half of the 90-minute forum at Wake Forest University was devoted to foreign policy, with the candidates' largely agreeing on the nation's policies in the Mideast and the Balkans. They both, for example, went farther than President Clinton in calling on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to restrain the violence in Israel.
But their exchanges showed Mr. Gore to be more willing to use American force to intervene in regional conflicts.
The vice president said that a case of genocide almost automatically engaged American interests and that it was appropriate for troops to stay on to help ensure a democratic transition -- a use of American power that Mr. Bush derided as "nation-building." For example, Mr. Gore supported American intervention in Haiti, which Mr. Bush characterized as a mistake.
Mr. Bush sought to present himself as a statesman by repeatedly saying he agreed with many of the administration's decisions. He also tried to demonstrate that he was as conversant on such matters as Mr. Gore, who has been at the center of many of the nation's most crucial decisions about international affairs. Mr. Bush made clear that he was strongly against sending troops and resources into failed states.
In a nod to the nearly two weeks of bloodshed in Israel, Mr. Bush said, "I think during the campaign, particularly during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice. And I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions."
Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore, often spoke in generalities about his foreign policy philosophy. "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us," Mr. Bush said of people outside this country. "If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us."
Mr. Gore emphasized his involvement in foreign policy and described a much more activist and broader moral mission for the United States in the plight of other countries.
Explaining his approach to foreign affairs, he said: "We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about. That means not only military strength and our values. It also means keep our economy strong."
Just as they did when they took the stage in Boston last week, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore confronted a frustrating and even tormenting reality when last night's debate began: while Mr. Bush has edged up slightly, he and the vice president are mired in a race that is a statistical dead heat. If for no other reason, the stakes in this debate were even greater than in last week's because Election Day is only 26 days away. The third and final debate is next Tuesday in St. Louis.
In many ways, the candidates sought to dispel the same critiques and stereotypes that have plagued them in the campaign. Mr. Bush sought to show that he was no bumbler and that he could comfortably navigate the ins and outs of policy, particularly foreign affairs.
Mr. Gore, who is well known as a policy maven, tried to demonstrate that he was a likable politician and not an unappealing brawler. He succeeded in halting the audible sighs that marked his performance last week; in a contrast to last week, he at times nodded affirmatively when Mr. Bush was speaking.
At times, there was a marked contrast between Mr. Gore's seeming efforts to restrain himself from appearing belligerent and Mr. Bush's relaxed, even expansive, demeanor near the end of the encounter.
Over all, the feel and the format of last night's debate seemed decidedly more casual than the first one. For one thing, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush had already endured the drill once before. But the setting was somewhat more intimate. Rather than stand at lecterns, the candidates sat at a table with Mr. Lehrer.
The Bush campaign had pressed for the format in the debate negotiations. Mr. Bush's aides said he was far more comfortable in a more conversational format. It was the first time participants in a presidential debate sat at a table in that format.
It was not until the waning moments, under questioning by Mr. Lehrer, that the sparring began in earnest.
Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush had blocked hate crimes legislation, and he asserted that the governor presided over a state that ranked last in health insurance for families.
"Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in children with health care," Mr. Gore said, "49th for women with health care and 50th for families with health care."
For his part, Mr. Bush said the vice president had fought for a government-run health care system in the first two years of the Clinton administration. "That was fortunately stopped in its tracks," Mr. Bush said.
Governor Bush said Mr. Gore was "absolutely wrong" if he was trying to suggest that Mr. Bush was a hard-hearted person who did not care about children.
Mr. Bush acknowledged that a health insurance program for children "got a late start" in Texas. But, he insisted, "we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population" in Texas, while the comparable figure is increasing nationally.
Mr. Gore said he was not questioning the purity of Mr. Bush's heart, but challenging his priorities and values. In Texas, Mr. Gore said, Mr. Bush "opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the Legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered, and instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests."
On the question of Mr. Gore's embellishments, Mr. Lehrer asked Mr. Bush if he thought the vice president did indeed "stretch the facts," and whether that was something the voters ought to consider.
"We all make mistakes," Mr. Bush responded. "I have been known to mangle a syl-ABBLE or two myself." The deliberate mispronunciation was, of course, an allusion to several word gaucheries Mr. Bush has committed of late, and it brought a flurry of laughter.
Turning suddenly serious, Mr. Bush said a president's credibility is important, both at home and abroad, and is something the voters should consider. "This isn't something new," he said of Mr. Gore, bringing up a memorandum from the latter's short 1988 presidential campaign in which a staff aide warned him to stick to the facts.
Looking back to their first debate, Mr. Gore admitted that he had tripped himself up on some facts. "I got some details wrong, and some examples," he said. "I'm sorry about that, and I'm going to try to do better."
In one area where both candidates seemed to agree, Mr. Gore said he would support legislation to ban racial profiling. And he repeated a pledge that his first act as president would be to issue an executive order banning the practice.
"It will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century," he said.
Mr. Bush agreed but added that he did not want to "federalize" the local police. "It's very important that we not overstep our bounds," he said.
But in a sharp moment reminding viewers of his firm enforcement of the death penalty, Mr. Bush pointed to the racially motivated murder of James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in East Texas in June 1998.
"The three men who murdered James Byrd," he said, "guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death."
Mr. Gore then politely suggested that Mr. Bush was blurring his stance on hate-crimes legislation, saying that the governor had barred such legislation in Texas.
Both candidates said they opposed marriages for gays and lesbians. "I'm not for gay marriage," Mr. Bush said. "I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man ad a woman."
Mr. Gore agreed, but then added, "I think we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions."
He invoked Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who in the vice-presidential debate last week joined Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, in sounding tolerant of such unions.
"I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, and I think the three of us have one view and the governor has another view."
Mr. Bush said he was not sure what kind of view Mr. Gore was describing, and added, "I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people."
The vice president also expressed his support for legislation to prevent gays and lesbians from being fired from their jobs because of their sexual orientation and asked the governor to lend his support. Mr. Bush replied, "I don't know the particulars of this law."
On gun control, Mr. Gore said he would "not do anything that would affect the rights" of hunters or sportsmen or homeowners seeking to protect their families.
Still, he said, "there are too many guns getting into the hands of children and criminals."
Mr. Gore said assault weapons were a particular problem. He said he favored closing the gun show loophole, for which he cast a deciding vote in the Senate. The Congress has failed to complete action on the bill, he said.
Mr. Gore said the government should strengthen enforcement of gun laws, keep schools gun free and issue child safety trigger locks on mandatory basis.
Mr. Bush echoed the importance of enforcing gun laws, saying criminals must know with "certainty" that they will be punished for using a weapon illegally.
He said he supported instant background checks at gun shows. Texas has been an innovator, Mr. Bush said, in distributing free trigger locks.
On the environment, an issue that has fascinated Mr. Gore for years, the vice president was asked whether he stood by his earlier statements that environmental protection should be the central priority in the new century. He said he did, explaining, "I think that in this 21st century, we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming. What's happening is the level of pollution is increasing, significantly."
He said that an accusation, often made by his Republicans critics, that environmental concerns were in conflict with economic growth was "really outdated."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
2nd Presidential Debate Between Gov. Bush and Vice President Gore

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the presidential debate last night in Winston-Salem, N.C., between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as recorded by The New York Times. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS.
MR. LEHRER -- Good evening from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. I'm Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour on PBS.
Welcome to this second Election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is, as always, absolute quiet, please.
Good evening Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. At the end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close.
Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?
MR. BUSH -- I have. The first question is what's in the best interests of the United States. What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy, that'll be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interests.
I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self. And so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney, who I thought did a great job the other night. He's a vice-presidential nominee who represents, who, I think people got to see why I picked him. He's a man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.
One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. I've been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. That's what a chief executive officer does. So I've thought long and hard about the honor and -- of being the president of the United States.
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
MR. GORE -- Yes, Jim, I've thought a lot about that particular question and I see our greatest natural -- national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans; it's really true. Even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us, as soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more: freedom, free markets, political freedom.
So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to -- in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity along lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws. We've got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military. And I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values.
MR. LEHRER -- Should the people of the world look at the United States, governor, and say should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How do you -- how would you project us around the world as president?
MR. BUSH -- Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom, where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from that you can succeed. I don't think they ought to look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power. And that's why we've got to be humble and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. We're a freedom-loving nation. And if we're an arrogant nation, they'll view us that way, but if we're humble nation, they'll respect us.
MR. LEHRER -- A humble nation?
MR. GORE -- I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about anyway, that there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. And we have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about. That means not only military strength and our values. It also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last -- two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say, 'You guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world.' And we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough -- we need to do more. But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.
MR. LEHRER -- Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?
MR. BUSH -- Yes it does. Take for example, third world debt. I think we ought to be forgiving third world debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if we're convinced that a third world country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few, but would go to help people, then I think it'd make sense for us to use our wealth in that way. Or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes eminent sense. Yes, we do have an obligation in the world, but we can't be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions, but we can't put our troops all around the world. We can lend money, but we've got to do it wisely. We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials. So we've got to be guarded in our generosity.
MR. LEHRER -- Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question, Vice President Gore. The governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?
MR. GORE -- The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he's taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing with us, if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.
The use of diplomacy in this situation has already -- well, it goes hour by hour and day by day now. It's a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours, there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day to day right now.
But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned. Israel should, should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor?
MR. BUSH -- Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice. And I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know, should I be the president, Israel's going to be our friend. I'm going to stand by Israel.
Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particular important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. There's -- we don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there's going to be a consequence, should I be the president.
But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. It's one of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an antiballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East, if need be, to keep the peace. To be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.
It's also important to keep a strong ties in the Middle East with credible ties because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, all the energy is produced from the Middle East. And so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of, should I be fortunate enough to be the president, how my administration will react to the Middle East.
MR. LEHRER -- So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides in this and resolve this right now? A lot of people are pushing -- hey, we, the United States, should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.
MR. GORE -- Well, we stand with Israel. But we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.
MR. LEHRER -- Do you agree with that, governor?
MR. BUSH -- I do. I do think this, though: I think that when it comes to timetables, it can't be a United States timetable as to how the discussions take place. It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, other -- you know, like the Palestinians or the Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. And therefore the term honest broker makes sense. Whether -- This current administration has worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it won't be on my timetable. It'll be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.
MR. LEHRER -- People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy. And they're so interested that they want to make a -- they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you -- as president, how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference?
MR. GORE -- I haven't heard a big difference right, in the last few exchanges.
MR. BUSH -- Well I think, it's hard to tell. I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better. I mean --
MR. LEHRER -- Saddam Hussein, you mean?
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- You could get him out of there?
MR. BUSH -- I'd like to, of course. And I presume this administration would as well. But we don't know, there's no inspectors now in Iraq. The coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.
MR. LEHRER -- You feel that is a failure of the Clinton Administration?
MR. BUSH -- I do.
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Vice President?
MR. GORE -- Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration it was right after I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf war resolution. And at the end of that war, for whatever reasons, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein. And I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it. But that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia. And you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week. And it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the Communist bloc, it seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that, but you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three, where they notified. And they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.
MR. LEHRER -- Did he state your position correctly? You're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you?
MR. BUSH -- No, of course not. Absolutely not. I want them to be tougher.
MR. LEHRER -- Let's go onto Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?
MR. BUSH -- I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO in bombing Serbia. I supported him when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration and, in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't in necessarily our best interests, or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy. I think it worked. And I'm pleased I made the decision I made, and I'm pleased the president made the decision he made, because freedom took hold in that part of the world, and, there's a lot of work left to be done, however.
MR. LEHRER -- But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?
MR. BUSH -- Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I don't think he would have fallen had we not usen force. And I know there's some in my party that disagreed with that sentiment. But I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively. But nevertheless it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It's important for NATO to have to work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO. And NATO's going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.
Now, there's more work to do. It remains to be seen how whether or not there's going to be a political settlement to Kosovo. And I certainly hope there is one.
I've -- also on record as saying, at some point in time, I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.
MR. LEHRER -- Mr. Vice President.
MR. GORE -- Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the Senate, before I became vice president, I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the deaths of so many people. He was the last Communist Party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a Communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already, just today, the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia and that they questioned his legitimacy. And he's still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable.
Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier. And maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, governor. In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to, to get involved with, with troops. Now, there have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that, to me, can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?
MR. LEHRER -- Governor?
MR. BUSH -- O.K., yeah. I'm trying to figure out who the questioner was.
MR. GORE -- I'm --
MR. BUSH -- If I think it's in our nation's strategic interests, I'll commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took. I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like an unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.
MR. LEHRER -- Well, let's stay on the subject for a moment. New question related to this. There have been -- I figured this out -- in the last 20 years, there have been eight major actions involving the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces. Let me name them: Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been president, would any of those interventions not have happened?
MR. GORE -- Can you run through the list again?
MR. LEHRER -- Sure. Lebanon?
MR. GORE -- I thought that was a mistake.
MR. LEHRER -- Grenada?
MR. GORE -- I supported that.
MR. LEHRER -- Panama?
MR. GORE -- I supported that one.
MR. LEHRER -- Persian Gulf?
MR. GORE -- Yes, I voted for it, supported it.
MR. LEHRER -- Somalia?
MR. GORE -- Well, of course, in that, again -- no, I think that that was ill considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we, that we should take, take very, very seriously.
MR. LEHRER -- Bosnia.
MR. GORE -- Oh, yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Haiti?
MR. GORE -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- And then Kosovo, we talked about that.
MR. GORE -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Want me to do it with you?
MR. BUSH -- . . .
MR. LEHRER -- You want to -- Lebanon?
MR. BUSH -- No, I'm fine, I'll maybe make a couple comments.
MR. LEHRER -- Sure, absolutely.
MR. BUSH -- Somalia. It started off as a humanitarian mission then changed into a nation-building mission and that's where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price, and so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow a dictator when it's in our best interests. But in this case, it was a nation-building exercise. And same with Haiti. I wouldn't have supported either.
MR. LEHRER -- What about Lebanon?
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Grenada?
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Panama?
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Obviously, the Persian --
MR. BUSH -- With some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.
MR. LEHRER -- I do, I do. You're -- the Persian Gulf, obviously.
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- And Bosnia and you've already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, for instance, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, there was no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?
MR. BUSH -- I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation. No one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we've got a, kind of an early warning system in place in places where there could be a ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And that's a case were we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, it seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda. And so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.
MR. LEHRER -- Do you have any second thoughts on that based on what you said a moment ago about genocide and --
MR. GORE -- I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address this question directly first.
MR. LEHRER -- We'll do that --
MR. GORE -- Fine. We did actually send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife, Tipper, who's here, actually went on a military plane with General Shalikasvili on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect, we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.
But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not -- if our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military force, if we've tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we had allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.
In Africa we did not. Now we have tried -- our country's tried to create an Africa crisis response team there and we've met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria but in Sierra Leone. And that, now that Nigeria's become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish by putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was. But I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.
MR. LEHRER -- So what would you say, governor, to somebody who would say, "Hey, wait a minute. Why not Africa? I mean, why the Middle East? Why the Balkans but not Africa when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?"
MR. BUSH -- Well, I understand. And Africa's important. And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade. And there are some -- the vice president mentioned Nigeria. It's a fledgling democracy. We've got to work with Nigeria. It's an important continent. But there's got to be priorities. And Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons as is Europe and the Far East, and our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president.
It's not to say we won't be engaged. Nor trying -- nor should we -- work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle a situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians; support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. I am worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti. I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation-building mission. And it was not very successful. It cost us billions -- a couple of billions of dollars and I'm not so sure democracy's any better off in Haiti than it was before.
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore, do you agree with -- with the governor's views on nation-building, the use of military, our military to -- for nation-building as he described it then defined it?
MR. GORE -- I don't think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that.
But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world's getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now, the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere and shouldn't be doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.
Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation-building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.
During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson, in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did; we got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe.
And what did we do in the late 40's and 50's and 60's? We were nation-building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there, we had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.
MR. LEHRER -- But you said in the Boston debate, governor, on this issue of nation-building that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended?
MR. BUSH -- Well --
MR. LEHRER -- Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?
MR. BUSH -- Well, first let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we can't do that, we've got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world and I mentioned one and that's the Balkans. I'd very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that, but I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think, you know I supported the administration in Colombia. I think it's important for us to be training Colombians in that part of the world, our hemisphere is in our interests to have a peaceful Colombia. But --
MR. LEHRER -- I was just going to -- the use of the military. Some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen?
MR. BUSH -- I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean we're going to have kind of a nation-building corps from America. Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do and when it gets overextended, morale drops. Well, listen, I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula not only to keep the peace in the peninsula but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO. But I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest. The mission needs to be clear and the exit strategy obvious.
MR. GORE -- Well, I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And the Haitians have their problems but we gave them a chance to restore democracy, and that's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our back yard, with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water and all kinds of violence there right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.
And as for this idea of nation-building. The phrase sounds grandiose. And you know, we can't be, we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that, and that's why I've supported building, building up our capacity. I've devoted, in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty and that's not what the Joint Chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.
MR. LEHRER -- In the nonmilitary area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic area, World Bank president Wolfensohn said recently, governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now, almost than it has ever been. Is that a problem for you? Do you think -- what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are? I'm talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing, to other countries, to poor countries.
MR. BUSH -- Well I mentioned third-world debt.
MR. LEHRER -- Sure.
MR. BUSH -- That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way -- influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid. But I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way. And there are some pretty egregious examples recently, one being Russia where we had I.M.F. loans that end up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation. I think the I.M.F. has got a role in the world. But I don't want to see the I.M.F. out there as a way to say to world bankers, 'If you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.' It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the president did the right thing on -- with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I don't think I.M.F. and our -- ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risk themselves. So I look at every place where we're investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good.
MR. LEHRER -- Do you think we're meeting our obligations properly?
MR. GORE -- No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the I.M.F. I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the I.M.F. The World Bank, I think, is generally doing a better job.
But I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I've worked on this issue. It's an enormous problem. And corruption in official agencies like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials. That's one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to, again, lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.
I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world's coming together, as I said. They're looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make: Are we going to step up the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said, O.K., the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefited tremendously from the courage that they showed in those postwar years.
I think that in the aftermath of the cold war, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.
MR. BUSH -- Let me comment on that.
MR. LEHRER -- Sure.
MR. BUSH -- Yeah. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help. And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. I mean, I want to empower people, I don't -- you know, I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. And I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.
But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here's some I.M.F. money. It ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket, and others. And yet we played like there was reform. The only people who are going to reform Russia are Russians -- they're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and-or entities invest capital there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president's coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you.
Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But, maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.
MR. LEHRER -- Let's move on. No, let's move on.
MR. GORE -- Far be it for me to suggest otherwise.
MR. LEHRER -- First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. Vice President Gore, would you support or sign as president a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government?
MR. GORE -- Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law-enforcement agencies. But I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just, I think the racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that's been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think we've now got so many examples around the country, that we really have to find ways to end this.
Imagine what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And it's not an easy problem to solve, but if I am entrusted with the presidency it will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century.
MR. BUSH -- I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. That's just flat wrong. And that's not what America's all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces. I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law. But we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments. And obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds. And I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk, who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced. I don't think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done and if you can't, there'll be a federal consequence.
MR. LEHRER -- And that could be a federal law?
MR. BUSH -- Yeah.
MR. LEHRER -- And you would agree?
MR. GORE -- I would agree. And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Mass., not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. And not only the training in police procedures but human -- human relations. And, and I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas. And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. And that's why I think that we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.
MR. LEHRER -- You have a different view of that.
MR. BUSH -- No, I don't, really.
MR. LEHRER -- On hate crimes laws?
MR. BUSH -- No. We've got one in Texas and guess what. The three men who murdered James Byrd. Guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty and -- it's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And it's the right cause so it's the right decision.
Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab Americans are racially profiled on what's called secret evidence. People are stopped. And we got to do something about that. My friend Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan is pushing a law to make sure that, you know, Arab Americans are treated with respect.
So racial profiling isn't just an issue with local police forces. It's an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.
I just -- I believe, though -- I believe, sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care, they're tolerant people, they're good, tolerant people. It's the very few that create most of the crises. And we just have to find them and deal with them.
MR. LEHRER -- What, if you become president, governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination --
MR. BUSH -- Sure.
MR. LEHRER -- -- again, you said Arab Americans. But also Hispanics, Asians, as well as blacks in this country.
MR. BUSH -- Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes: in public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend Phyllis Hunter's here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, "Reading is the new civil right." And she's right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated, I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read, K-through-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency, curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum, intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.
We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim, one of the cornerstones of reform and good reform is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine; and if they're not, there has to be a consequence.
And so to make sure we end up getting rid of the basic structural prejudice is education. There's nothing more prejudiced that not educating a child.
MR. LEHRER -- Would you support a national hate crimes law?
MR. BUSH -- I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. That bill -- there was another bill that did die in committee, but I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law, like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime, and we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime. And in this case, we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death, and that's what's going to happen in the state of Texas.
MR. LEHRER -- New subject, new question, another vice-presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same-sex relationships. What's your position on that?
MR. BUSH -- I'm not for gay marriage. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman and I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. I presume the vice president supported it when the president signed that bill and supports it now. But I think marriage is a sacred institution. I'm going to be respectful, for people who may disagree with me. I've had a record of doing so in the state of Texas. I've been a person that would have been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accepted some, I accept other people's points of view, but I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
MR. GORE -- I agree with that, and I did support that law. But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions. And I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, and I think the three of us have one view and the governor has another view.
MR. LEHRER -- Is that right?
MR. BUSH -- I'm not sure what kind of view he's ascribing to me. I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people. I respect their -- one day he says he agrees with me, then he says he doesn't, I'm not sure where he's coming from. But I will be a tolerant person. I've been a tolerant person all my life. I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.
MR. LEHRER -- Do you believe, in general terms, that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans?
MR. BUSH -- Yes. I don't think they ought to have special rights. But I think they ought to have the same rights.
MR. GORE -- Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. I strongly support it. What is says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian. And it would be a federal law preventing that. Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress. I wonder if the governor would lend his support to that law.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor.
MR. BUSH -- . . . question . . .
MR. LEHRER -- Well, but it's a logical --
MR. BUSH -- Well, I have no idea. I mean, he can throw out all kinds of -- I don't know the particulars of this law. I will tell you, I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. As a matter of fact I'd like to take the issue a little further. I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concern what, how you conduct your sex life. And I think that's a private matter. And I think that's the way it ought to be. But I'm going to be respectful for people. I'll tolerate people. And I support equal rights but not special rights for people.
MR. LEHRER -- And special rights -- how does that affect gays and lesbians?
MR. BUSH -- Well, it'd be if they're given special protective status. And that doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.
MR. LEHRER -- New subject in question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns?
MR. GORE -- Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say, that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected in their right to have a gun if they wish to.
The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children and criminals and people who for whatever reason, some kind of history of -- of stalking or domestic abuse, really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem.
So I favor closing the gun-show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That's still pending. If we could get agreement on that and maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.
I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years, in the last few years, I think have been unfortunate.
I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis and others.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor.
MR. BUSH -- Well, it starts with enforcing the law. We need to say loud and clear to somebody, if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you, if you're going to sell a gun illegally you need to be arrested, and if you commit a crime with a gun there needs to be absolutely certainty in the law. And that needs to -- the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Need programs like Project Exile, where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I'm going to make it a priority.
Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas, I tried to do something innovatively, which is that, you know, there's a lot of talk about, you know, trigger locks being on guns sold in the future, I support that. But I said, let's -- if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come to, come and get one for free. And so we're distributing in our state of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. I don't -- he's for registration of guns. I think the only people who are going to show up to register or get a license, I guess licensing, like a driver's license of a gun, the only people who are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal's not going to show up and say, hey, give me my I.D. card, it's the law-abiding citizens who'll do that, and I just, I don't think that's going to be an effective tool to make the, keep our society safe.
MR. LEHRER -- All right, so, on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences?
MR. GORE -- Well, I'm not for registration. I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases --
MR. LEHRER -- What exactly, what's that mean?
MR. GORE -- A photo license I.D. like a driver's license for new handguns. And you know, the Los Angeles --
MR. LEHRER -- Excuse me, you would have to get the license, a photo I.D. to go in and before you could buy the gun?
MR. GORE -- Correct. At the time --
MR. LEHRER -- All right. And who would issue the --
MR. GORE -- The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records and the Los Angeles Times spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.
I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is in the aftermath of Columbine and Paducah and all of the places around our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing in Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.
MR. LEHRER -- Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, governor, from your point of view, between you and the vice president?
MR. BUSH -- Well, I'm not for photo licensing. But let me say something about Columbine. And listen, we've got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. I'm sure every state in the union's got them. You can't carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue and it's really a matter of culture, it's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. Where, for a child can walk in and have their heart turn dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life.
And so gun laws are important, no question about it. But so is loving children and character education classes and faith-based programs being a part of afterschool programs. Somebody, some desperate child that needs to have somebody put their arm around him and say we love you and so there's a, this is a society of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law, but there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on, not necessarily in this debate, but just in general in law, but there's a larger law: Love your neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself. And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.
MR. GORE -- I also believe in the golden rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence and entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.
But I think that we have to start with better parenting. But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get a hold of them.
And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.
MR. BUSH -- Yeah, no question about that. But there's -- also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like they can -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from. It could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there's not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughened up the juvenile justice laws, we added beds, we're tough. We believe in tough love. We say if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. And we've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.
MR. LEHRER -- New question.
MR. BUSH -- O.K.
MR. LEHRER -- New question.
MR. BUSH -- As I was saying.
MR. LEHRER -- Both of you, governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? What would you do about that.
MR. BUSH -- Well, I've got a plan to do something about that. It's to make health care affordable and available this way: First, there are some who should be buying health care who choose not to. There --
MR. LEHRER -- Some of the 40 million.
MR. BUSH -- Some of the healthy folks, you know the young kids say I'll never get sick; therefore I'm not going to have -- don't need health care right now. And for those, what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for, for them to invest. Like medical savings accounts with roll-over capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, It'll be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness. But for the working folks that do want to have health care, that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do: One, we need more community health centers. I've put out money in my budget to, to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly -- and they're good. They're very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as it gets higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It's -- it'll be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system if you allow -- also allow -- convince states to allow -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, to pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federation of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity of national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think that's the very best way to go. It empowers people. It trusts people. It makes it -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore?
MR. GORE -- It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.
I'd like to see, eventually, in this country, some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system. In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years and the budget plan that I've put out, according to The Los Angeles Times, again, the way these things are typically measured, as a percentage of the G.D.P., will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think that we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance, or CHIP program, to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So it's one of my top priorities.
Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this and I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here, and Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care, in children with health care, 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me, I guarantee you. I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor, did the vice president -- are the vice president's figures correct about Texas?
MR. BUSH -- Well, first of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system -- I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993, was a government-run health care system that was fortunately stopped in its tracks.
Secondly, we spent $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the state of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. May come for a shock for somebody who's been in Washington for so long, but actually limited government can work, in the second-largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed the enabling legislation in '99, we've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, we're signing them up fast as any other state. And I -- you can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you, we care about our people in Texas. We spend a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the state of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.
MR. LEHRER -- Is he right?
MR. GORE -- Well, I don't know about the, all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right, about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered, and instead, directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. There's a -- you don't have to take my word for this, there is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- and you should read that judge's language about this. There are one-point -- I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance, 600,000 of whom -- and maybe some of those have since gotten it -- but as of a year ago, 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they -- they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had to surmount.
MR. LEHRER -- Let's let the governor respond to that.
MR. BUSH -- I -- I -- I --
MR. LEHRER -- Are those numbers direct? Are his charges correct?
MR. BUSH -- If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong. We spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people and they get health care. Now, that's not the most efficient way to get people health care, but I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased and so he can make any excuse he wants but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population. And as a percentage of the population that's increasing nationally.
But somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. And -- and I -- let me just say who the jury is: the people of Texas. There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms and that was me. And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, about 27 percent of the African-American vote because people know that I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. So we can throw all the kinds of numbers around, I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what's right. We come together both Republicans and Democrats.
MR. LEHRER -- Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up is that, are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?
MR. GORE -- Yes, yes. But it's not a statement about his heart. I don't claim to know his heart. I think he's a good person. I make no allegations about that. I believe him when he says that, that he has a good heart. I, I know enough about your story to, to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person. But I think it's about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean if, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? I would. Now, but here's why it's directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. According to his own numbers. So it's not a question of his heart. It's -- as far as I know -- it's a, it's a question of priorities and values. See, you know --
MR. BUSH -- Let me --
MR. LEHRER -- Let me ask --
MR. BUSH -- Well, first of all, that's simply not true, what he just said, of course. And secondly I repeat --
MR. LEHRER -- What is not true, governor?
MR. BUSH -- That we spent -- the top 1 percent received 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- and let's talk about my tax plan. The top 1 percent pay, will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return get one-fifth of the benefits because -- benefits because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who's going to leave 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. It's a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I can't emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPs in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the '99 session. We're working hard to sign up children. We're doing it faster than any other -- than any other state our size -- comparable state. We're making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare and they have not got it done.
And my case to the American people is if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up there now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody who knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.
MR. LEHRER -- New question. New subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment, in your 1992 book you said "We must make the rescue of our environment the simple organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet. Do you still feel that way?
MR. GORE -- I do. I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming. There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old-timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes. And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now here's the good news Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know, the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. And some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else. And their people want higher hire standards of living. And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding on to the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold, we have to provide leadership. Now it's true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people. He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston's just become the smoggiest city in the country and Texas is No. 1 in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook and I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor?
MR. BUSH -- Well, let me start with Texas. We are a big industrial state but we're, reduced our industrial waste by 11 percent. We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them. Our water is cleaner now --
MR. LEHRER -- Explain what a brownfield is for those who don't follow this.
MR. BUSH -- A brownfield is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people that are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of law suit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. Book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing, big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.
I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies, I proposed $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there's a national petroleum reserve right next to Prudhoe Bay that your administration had opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And that was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we de-control our plants, that there's mandatory, that the plants are, must conform to clean air standards. The grandfather plants, that's what we did in Texas, no excuses, I mean, you must conform.
In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in collaborative effort with states and local folks. You know, if you own the land, every day is Earth Day. And people care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.
MR. LEHRER -- Where do you see the basic difference, in very simple terms in two or three sentences, between you and the governor on the environment? If the voter wants to make a choice, what is it?
MR. GORE -- I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. I -- he's right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes. I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new -- new kinds of technologies and -- and let me say again, Detroit is raring to go on that.
We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way. We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.
MR. LEHRER -- But you say it's a fundamental difference.
MR. GORE -- I think it's a fundamental difference and let me give you an example. He --
MR. LEHRER -- Hold on one second.
MR. GORE -- O.K., sure.
MR. LEHRER -- We've talked about -- I just want to know, for somebody -- because we're running -- we're getting close to the end -- end of our time here. I -- if somebody wanted to make -- wanted to vote on the environment, how would you draw the differences, governor?
MR. BUSH -- Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C. I believe Washington ought to set standards, but I don't -- again, I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels. And I think we ought to work with people at the local levels. And by the way, I just want to make sure we -- I can't let him just say something --
MR. LEHRER -- All right.
MR. BUSH -- -- and not correct it. The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President. That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grant for other plants, for utilities. But there's --
MR. LEHRER -- Do you think --
MR. BUSH -- I think there's a difference. I think, for example, take when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials I thought that was --
MR. LEHRER -- That's out in the west?
MR. BUSH -- Out in the west, yes. On the logging issue, that's not the way I would have done it. Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside. But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.
MR. LEHRER -- Would you believe the federal government still has some new rules and new regulations and new laws to pass in the environmental area, or do you think --
MR. BUSH -- Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable, so long as people have input.
MR. LEHRER -- What about global warming?
MR. BUSH -- I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously. But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet and I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions. I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air, like the Kyoto treaty would have done. China and India were exempted from that treaty. I think we need to be more even-handed as, evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators -- supported that position.
MR. LEHRER -- Global warming, global warming. The Senate did turn it down.
MR. BUSH -- Ninety-nine to nothing.
MR. GORE -- I think that, well that vote wasn't exactly, a lot of supporters of the Kyoto treaty actually ended up voting for that because of the way it was worded, but there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. I'm not for command and control techniques either. I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizens groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. It's pollution, carbon dioxide and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities that cause this.
Look, the world's temperatures going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. And what are we going to tell our children? And I'm a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it's written in the Book of Matthew, where your heart is, there is your treasure also. And I believe that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.
MR. BUSH -- Yeah, I agree. I just, I think there's been some, some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming? A profound scientist recently made a different --
MR. LEHRER -- Both of you now --
MR. BUSH -- But the point is --
MR. LEHRER -- Excuse me. Both of you have now violated your own rules. Hold that thought.
MR. GORE -- I've been trying so hard not to.
MR. LEHRER -- I know, I know, but about -- under you all's rules you are not allowed to ask each other a question. I let you do it a moment ago --
MR. BUSH -- Twice.
MR. LEHRER -- Twice, sorry. O.K.
MR. GORE -- That's an interruption, by the way.
MR. LEHRER -- That's an interruption. O.K. But anyhow, you just did it, so now we're --
MR. BUSH -- I'm sorry.
MR. LEHRER -- That's all right. It's O.K.
MR. BUSH -- I apologize, Mr. Vice President.
MR. LEHRER -- No, you're not allowed to do that either, you see. No, no. I'm sorry, go ahead. Finish your thought. People care about these things, I've found out.
MR. BUSH -- Course they care about -- oh, you mean the rules.
MR. LEHRER -- Right, exactly right. Go ahead, sir.
MR. BUSH -- What the heck. I -- of course there's a lot of -- I mean, look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously. But science -- there's a lot of -- there's differing opinions and before we react I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place. And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches. We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks. I mean, I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input. And I remember you gave a very good answer in New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place. I feel very strongly the same place -- it certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.
MR. LEHRER -- New question.
MR. BUSH -- Yes.
MR. LEHRER -- Last question for you, governor, and this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etc. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues, this is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on Nov. 7?
MR. BUSH -- Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know. But you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It's going to be important to be -- for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And, yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This -- this isn't something new. I read a report or a memo from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then-Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. And, you know, I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley, saying he altered the E.I.T.C. when it didn't happen. I mentioned the last --
MR. LEHRER -- E.I.T.C.?
MR. BUSH -- Earned Income Tax Credit
MR. LEHRER -- All right.
MR. BUSH -- Sorry.
MR. LEHRER -- That's all right.
MR. BUSH -- A lot of initials for a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? Anyway, I -- he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold. And yet he didn't. And so I think this is an issue. I think -- I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there were some exaggerations about the numbers. But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue. And I -- I'm going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. Exaggerations like, for example, only 5 percent of the seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. That's what he said the other day. And that's simply not the case. And I have every right in the world to defend my record and my positions. That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.
MR. LEHRER -- Vice President Gore.
MR. GORE -- I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm -- I'm sorry about that. And I'm going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that it, getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.
There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets sometimes, more sometimes than people in -- in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that, not with a measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is -- is -- is over, but right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program.
I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can -- I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this, with all the confidence in --in -- in my heart and in the world that I will do my best, if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.
MR. LEHRER -- Does that resolve the issue, governor?
MR. BUSH -- That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?
MR. LEHRER -- Does it resolve it for you?
MR. BUSH -- It depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.
MR. LEHRER -- But your folks are saying some awful things and you're --
MR. BUSH -- Well, I hope they're not awful things. They're using the man's own words.
MR. LEHRER -- No, no what I mean is you're calling him a serial exaggerator.
MR. BUSH -- I don't believe I've used those words.
MR. LEHRER -- No, but your campaign has.
MR. BUSH -- Maybe they have.
MR. LEHRER -- Your campaign officials have. And your campaign officials, Mr. Vice President, are now calling, now calling the governor a bungler, a --
MR. BUSH -- Wait a minute.
MR. LEHRER -- My point is, should this, is this --
MR. GORE -- I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should. I think that --
MR. LEHRER -- It's in your commercials.
MR. GORE -- I understand. I haven't seen that. In my commercial?
MR. LEHRER -- Yeah.
MR. BUSH -- You haven't seen the commercial?
MR. GORE -- I think that what, I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that's so large that would put us into such big deficits that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy, I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.
MR. BUSH -- That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.
MR. GORE -- Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining.
MR. LEHRER -- Gentlemen, it's time to go to the closing statements and Vice President Gore, you have two minutes.
MR. GORE -- Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people. And education is my No. 1 priority because I think that it's the most important big, major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.
The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there, because I want to give new choices to parents to send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition, per child, per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country, for one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and preschool.
Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 priority, you can't do education. You can't do both, you have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.
MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
MR. BUSH -- Jim, thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest. I want to thank you all for listening. I'm running to get some things done for America. There's too many issues left unresolved, there's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C. I'd like to unite this country, to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.
I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America.
I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today's military. The warning signs are clear, it's time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more and make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.
Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. The issue's been too long on the table because it's been a political issue. It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.
I want to do something about Social Security. It's a important priority because now's the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors our promises we've made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in -- in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.$

HEADLINE: Dublin: Now Fair And Worldly

BYLINE: By FLORENCE WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
ALEX WILLIAMS put down his mop and apologized for the mess. "I had a raging party in here last night," he said. Even so, the apartment looked good. A sleek blue sofa and expensive stereo accented the living room. Oak shutters framed wide windows.
Mr. Williams, 30, an unmarried software designer, moved into Dublin's new Wooden Building two months ago. It is the latest -- and most expensive -- addition to an ambitious state-sponsored redevelopment of Temple Bar, a previously down-and-out neighborhood on the south bank of the River Liffey. The area was full of obsolete four- or five-story brick warehouses and empty lots. About half the warehouses have been completely renovated, half knocked down. 
 "I'm in the center of town, but it's quiet, I can walk to work," Mr. Williams said of his one-bedroom home that he rents for around $1,100 a month. "It's like no other building in Ireland, with all the wood and the big canopy at the top, and inside, it's really well finished."
Mr. Williams represents a vanguard demographic in a vanguard type of architecture. In Ireland, a country with Europe's highest rate of home ownership, he is in the first wave of successful young professionals to rent an apartment in the central city. Both the luxury building and Mr. Williams's capacity to live in it would have been unthinkable just a decade ago. Since then, Ireland has become Europe's hottest, fastest-growing economy, drawing a huge influx of high-tech and financial-services companies.
After a century of exporting its young professionals, the country is enticing them back in droves as well as attracting emigrants. Mr. Williams, who is Irish, lived in Japan, Belgium and the United States before returning to work for an Internet start-up, WorldofFruit.com.
In the mid-1990's, Ireland became the grateful recipient of substantial urban renewal and tourism grants from the European Union, including $25 million to transform Temple Bar into a new cultural quarter for the city. Still, the Irish, known for their fierce, sentimental love of tradition and for their stubborn independence, view the Europeanization of Dublin with a mixture of pride and alarm.
Planners were determined not to turn the neighborhood into a EuroDisney of faux-Georgian architecture, but to encourage innovative design. In 1991, Temple Bar Properties, a state-run agency, hired a young team of Dublin architects to draw up guidelines for the 36-square-block area, previously slated to become a city transportation depot. Now, Temple Bar has restaurants, bars, shops, 10 cultural centers and 1,000 new residential apartment units. Of the units, about half were developed privately and the others were commissioned from a variety of architectural firms. The Wooden Building, designed by the Dublin firm Blacam & Meagher, was part of the neighborhood's final development phase.
The nine-story building, named for its exterior and actually comprising two free-standing halves separated by a narrow air shaft, has 17 one- and two-bedroom units. Part of the building is fully wrapped in untreated iroko wood, part in stucco accented by large iroko-framed windows, and part in thick mortared brickwork. References abound to medieval and contemporary Northern European design. The architects insisted on hiring artisans for much of the custom features, like six-panel oak doors and copper window casements.
"Temple Bar Properties essentially said, 'Go for it,' " said Shane de Blacam, a principal architect at Blacam & Meagher and a Dubliner with sparse but unruly reddish-gray hair. "A lot of the buildings there had been pretty boring. We think our building lives with what the modern notion of a tower is." Mr. de Blacam, who worked with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia in the early 1970's, is known for his innovative use of timber in such buildings as the Beckett Theater at nearby Trinity College, and in another multistory Temple Bar building that received an award last year from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.
Mr. de Blacam said of the Wooden: "It's appropriate to this climate and culture, and we want it to be about Dublin. I'm delighted people are making a fuss about it."
Last spring, its apartments were sold at auction -- a first for the city -- and fetched prices rivaling those in Paris and New York. Mr. Williams's landlord bought his one-bedroom for $287,000. Martin Keane, a bar and nightclub owner, says he bought his two-bedroom (with a small roof garden) for $641,000, not including the parking space. "The price was higher than I expected," Mr. Keane, a married empty nester, said, "but if you want something bad enough you go the extra mile." Some are already calling it Dublin's most beautiful apartment building.
"The city is being reinvented before our very eyes," said Frank McDonald, an architecture and environment reporter for The Irish Times who lives in a converted fifth-floor warehouse in Temple Bar. "In the mid-1980's, Dublin was a backwater, so incredibly bleak it looked like a different city. There were 150 acres of derelict land. Now, there's hardly any. To a large extent, the inner city has been saved."
Today, down the street from the Wooden Building, jazz musicians give free concerts in Meeting House Square under an aluminum awning by Santiago Calatrava, the Spanish architect and engineer. Internet cafes vie with bars for attention from Dublin's young digirati. Half of Dublin's population is under 30. "I feel like a vanishing breed," Mr. McDonald, well over 30, said. "There's a real sense that the city has been taken over by this changeling species with no memory of thrift, poverty, no folk memory of famine. They're interested in money and having a good time. It's not dissimilar to the U.S."
Unemployment is at a record low, 3.8 percent, and jobs have grown 39 percent since 1994. In that time, greater Dublin's population grew 10 percent. With such heady growth comes headaches, especially for planners, environmentalists and those hurt by staggering traffic congestion, currency inflation and escalating housing costs. Dublin, with 1.3 million people -- a much higher figure than planners anticipated a decade ago -- has no subway system. The city will need 200,000 more homes for its workers in the next 10 years, Mr. McDonald said. At the same time, working-class families -- "true Dubs," as they are known -- are being priced out of the city. In short, sprawl has begun.
"We're at a crossroads," Mr. McDonald added. "Our planning is already infected by an Anglo-American, car-dependent thesis. The question is, how much can you control the spread of the edge city? We haven't yet reconciled ourselves to real urban living and higher density housing. Do we want to be a European city or an American city built around motorways and detached housing?"
The Irish have always considered apartments as either the unfortunate fate of those on the dole (like Chicago and New York, Dublin is scarred by disastrous public-housing high-rises) or the temporary domain of students. There is still no attempt to institute rent control or fair-eviction laws. The sentiment against renting springs from the oppressive legacy of English landlords. But changing demographics, a dire shortage of affordable housing and longer commutes are making apartment life more desirable.
The Irish are also catching up to Americans and other Europeans in marrying later, having fewer children and, since it was legalized in 1997, being divorced. As recently as 1972, women were forced to leave civic jobs upon marrying. That has all changed. "We're a post-Catholic country now," Mr. McDonald said.
The number of single-person households increased 17 percent from 1992 to 1997, and the number of couples without children increased 22 percent in the same period, vividly changing housing needs. Though people are waiting longer to start families, as in other industrialized nations, the change here seems swift and striking. "Dublin has acres of mindless, cheap flats," Mr. de Blacam said. "Apartments weren't considered proper. Now, that idea is being completely transformed."
In the wake of Temple Bar, other quarters of the city are planned for high-density redevelopment, notably the Docklands, an industrial warehouse and shipping district. Throughout central downtown, planners would like to replace the existing low-rise skyline with a more European seven- or eight-story skyline. For the most part, Dubliners still thumb their noses at anything higher.
Like so many other cities before it, Dublin is struggling to retain its small-city identity, and the gentrification of Temple Bar has its critics. Artists, once a catalyst for preserving the area, can no longer compete with dot-comers for rents. The city's oldest Catholic Church, around the corner from the Wooden Building, was converted to what many consider a cheesy tourist operation called Dublin's Viking Adventure.
"I found it began to show the same trend as SoHo," Dr. Mary Corcoran, a sociologist at the National University of Ireland, said. "An area with a bohemian ambience and low rents for alternative-arts people very quickly became a developers' paradise, with swanky new apartment buildings. The bohemian element feels pushed out -- it's not really an indigenous vernacular community anymore." In the last four years, 2,000 to 3,000 luxury apartments have been built in central Dublin, changing the once comfortably dowdy feel of the streets.
Michael Smith, the National Heritage Trust president, bemoans the loss of the vernacular pub. Only one Temple Bar pub out of every two dozen has retained its character, he said, adding that a lot "have been plasticated." "It's a drinking mile rather than a cultural quarter," he said.
Like New Orleans's French Quarter and London's Covent Garden, Temple Bar became a magnet for college rowdies, young European weekenders and those attending stag parties. Two years ago, pub owners agreed to ban the latter. But what had once been intimate, etched-glass and oak establishments have been transformed into mega-theme bars, like the All Sports Cafe, Thunder Road Cafe and House of Rock. Initially wanting to attract tourists, the city provided tax incentives to encourage pubs to build or expand in the neighborhood. With the theme bars comes a further dent in Irish identity, even as, ironically, Irish pubs are being replicated elsewhere. Even the Guinness Brewing Company is now owned by a British food and beverage company.
"In the old pub," Mr. Smith said, "typically the barman would be a true Dub with lots of character and wisdom to share. Now, foreigners have those jobs. Conversation was a major facet of national character, typically veering between politics and quasi philosophy. Now, the standard topic is the price of property."
Mr. de Blacam also regrets the change. He said: "I feel it was wrong to persist with commercial development in Temple Bar, because apartments went for astronomical prices in the end. The wisdom was that shops on the ground floor maximize investment, but if we want children and families to live in the city, that has to change. It may be a long time before we build a city quarter that feels truly residential."
Deyan Sudjic, architecture critic of The London Observer and editor of Domus, the Italian design magazine, said that Ireland is not alone in its increasing urban sophistication. "Housing throughout Britain is finally emerging from the stone ages," when only large, crude houses dominated the outer city, he said. The difference is that tasteful single-family houses are affordable in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh, but not in Dublin, he said, adding, "Dublin is on an entirely different planet economically."
For its part, the Wooden Building also sparked a contentious neighborhood debate over building heights. Originally designed to be four stories higher, the building was reduced when protests forced the architects to compromise. "We took a strong stance, because Dublin is under enormous, vicious pressure to produce high-rises," said Mr. Smith of the National Heritage Trust. "Now, I'm somewhat embarrassed after what has turned into one of the most exciting and highest quality new schemes, but we needed to stop a dangerous precedent."
Mr. Williams, preparing for the next party, doesn't think he'll live in Temple Bar forever. "I'll do it for a year and then see," he said. "I do think the old city is a really nice area, and I might think of buying here. If I have kids, though, I'd probably move back out to the suburbs."
Does he think apartment-dwelling will become a commonplace? "Well," he said, "renting has not been that popular. But we're an adaptive people."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

 * "ART AND THE EMPIRE CITY: NEW YORK, 1825-1861," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). The point is that during the antebellum years New York began to become, well, New York, America's megalopolis and an international crossroads. The great metaphor was the plan to grid Manhattan: unsentimental, open-ended, utilitarian and democratic, it created the blank sheet on which the city could draw its future. Amusing, gigantic, only marginally an art exhibition, the show is really an ostentatious illustrated history lesson via hundreds of pieces of old crockery, etchings, paintings, rosewood firescreens, daguerreotypes and mother-of-pearl folding fans. Custom-made for today's acquisitive age, the exhibition is probably the only occasion on which a 19th-century brown ceramic water cooler and a six-sided pitcher with pictures of the presidential candidate William Henry Harrison have been presented in the style of the treasures of the pharaoh's palace in "The Ten Commandments." Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 "A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Nov. 12). Most of the artists in this show -- English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries -- are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein air approach, used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. These canvases today are sought-after prizes. The 68 on view here were assembled by a pioneering scholar and collector in the field, John Gere (1921-1995), former keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, and his wife, Charlotte. Mostly painted in Rome and the surrounding countryside, they capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).
 
 "HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE," Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).
 
 "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000," the year-and-a-half-long, millenium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest, though, is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The fourth-floor galleries will open on Thursday and the third-floor galleries on Nov. 5.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 "THE OPULENT EYE OF ALEXANDER GIRARD," Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through March 18). The first comprehensive look at the multifaceted work of the architect and designer. Girard's contribution to contemporary design was a free approach that incorporated all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology, making exuberant use of color, pattern, texture and ornament. In photographs, models and objects, the exhibition displays his fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else. A whole room is devoted to the more than 300 fabric and wallpaper designs he created for the Herman Miller Furniture Company from the 1950's to the early 1970's with fresh patterns and colors that pushed the limits of middle-class taste. While Girard may not have been a heavyweight in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays until 9 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $3 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 "PIERRE ET GILLES," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but this beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "RUSKIN'S ITALY, RUSKIN'S ENGLAND, "Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Jan. 7). This show commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of John Ruskin (1819-1900), artist, art and architectural critic, social reformer, educator and the first official professor of art in England. From its own collections, the Morgan has mined a biographical medley of letters, manuscripts, photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts relating to the life of this Victorian giant, whose published writings run to 39 volumes. Although not really an art show, it includes paintings and drawings by Ruskin and artists he admired, among them J. M. W. Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It touches on his widely influential books of criticism, his beautifully finished sketches of architectural structures, his teaching and his monographs on proposed social reforms. Not omitted are his 1877 attack on James McNeill Whistler, his failed marriage and attraction to young girls and his sad end after a long siege of mental illness. But there is much to celebrate in his life, and this show doesn't stint. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and the elderly; free for children under 13 with an adult (Glueck).
 
 * EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Feb. 4. A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 "THE YEAR ONE: ART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD EAST AND WEST," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500, through Jan. 14. The Met puts the millennial-marking art exhibition in a new perspective with a show that only an institution of its stature and girth could pull off. Drawn from seven departments, it revisits the beginning of the "modern era" around the time of the birth of Jesus with 150 sometimes tiny artworks that sample the nearly two dozen cultures flourishing at the beginning of the first millennium. The array stretches from imperial Rome to Han dynasty China, with many stops in between. High points include bronzes from Thailand and Indonesia, a Chinese mortuary pillar and a stunning recreation of the frescoed bedroom of a Roman villa. The display is supposed to reflect the beginning of a new world consciousness brought on by expanding empires and trade, a thesis more complex than the actual objects can sustain. But, no matter, most of them are considered masterpieces, all are beautifully installed and the opportunities for cross-cultural visual comparisons are rich. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
"IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER," Kaikodo, 164 East 64th Street, (212) 223-0121 (through Oct. 21). Kaikodo's sales exhibitions are always a treat, and the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings in this one is a major lure. These days New Yorkers rarely get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums. Highlights include an album painting of a flower attributed to the 13th-century artist Qian Xuan (it's very fragile, so you have to ask to see it); a 17th-century calligraphic scroll by the fractious Fu Shan; and a witty four-panel portrait of a family of gibbons, gold-medal acrobats all. Devotees of ceramics and textiles will also find much to admire (Cotter).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
MARK DI SUVERO, Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through Oct. 21). This small retrospective presents pedestal-scale sculptures from three decades by an artist best known for his monumental industrial-strength abstractions. Each rough, heavy metal piece has a Cubist assemblage balanced Calder-like on one point of another assemblage. There is a clunky sameness to most of the works; Mr. di Suvero has always been most inventive when he works big (Johnson).
 
 * RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 28). This Dutch artist's solo debut in the United States includes a video (much seen elsewhere) of dancing teenagers in European clubs and a series of photographs she has been taking since 1997 of children in parks. In the video the kids preen touchingly. The photographs, color pictures along the lines of Thomas Struth's but more casual and less chilly, are heroic portraits, acutely sympathetic (Kimmelman).
 
 GERHARD RICHTER, Barbara Mathes, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-5135 (through Oct. 21). This exhibition of small works by the enigmatic and hugely influential German painter features a group of canvases from the 80's and 90's bearing his familiar brand of beautifully scraped, dragged and squeegeed Abstract Expressionism and an intriguing six-part photographic self-portrait in which blurry shirtless men -- the artist himself multiply exposed -- do mysterious things in dim, empty rooms (Johnson).
 
 BRIDGET RILEY, "Paintings 1982-2000 and Early Works on Paper," PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through Oct. 21). This show picks up where the small survey of Bridget Riley's paintings at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea leaves off, following her continued involvement with color through nine recent canvases, while a group of gouache studies from the 1960's documents the transition from black-and-white to color, through subtlely vivid tones of gray (Smith).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
 MONICA KULICKA, John Gibson, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1192 (through Oct. 30). As a protest against modern civilization's mechanization of the world, this young Polish artist who now lives in New York has slathered real, mossy green chlorophyll over five pieces of old wood furniture in a quixotic attempt to restore the dead wood to life. The absurdity of the gesture is amusing and yet somehow a little sad (Johnson).
 
 "LIFE, AFTER THE SQUIRREL," Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through Oct. 28). This nutty fun house of a show begins with Filipe Miguel's rustic shed, supposedly inhabited by post-apocalyptic squirrels. The main exhibition space has a squishy plastic floor and a ceiling of inflated pine trees. Works include Tony Tasset's stuffed "Dead Bluejay"; Aernout Mik's video of old men horsing around; a hypnotic video by Pipilotti Rist; John Neff's deadpan video recital of Hal the computer's last speech; and Vincent Pruden's provocative makeup table for applying blackface (Johnson).
 
 MANUEL NERI, Charles Cowles, 74 Grand Street, (212) 925-3500 (through Oct. 21). This veteran Bay Area Figurative School artist continues to produce his signature female figure sculptures in bronze or marble, in which the combination of smooth, finished parts and rough, unfinished parts (accented in the bronzes by expressionistic painting) produces tension between raw physicality and classical illusionism (Johnson).
 
 "PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION," Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7748 (through Oct. 28). "We are at a threshold," declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that most of the art isn't great, because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction (Kimmelman).
 
 GENEVIEVE SEILLE, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through Oct. 21). This English-educated French artist is not a real outsider, but she does a good imitation. Her large, distressed, patched-together pages supporting dense, crazy-quilt accumulations of patterns, numbers and illegible writing suggest a collaboration between Jean Dubuffet and Adolf Wolfli (Johnson).
 
 * NEIL WINOKUR, Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166 (through Oct. 28). For this delightful portrait of his hometown, Mr. Winokur has produced a series of 32 still-life photographs, each a crystal-clear, deadpan picture of an ordinary but richly iconic object against a bright colored backdrop. A Greek-style paper coffee cup, a Chinese food container, a Giants pennant, an old Broadway playbill, a Con Edison orange cone, a hot dog, a rat, a toy-size Empire State Building: these images produce a resonantly evocative cross-section of New York experience (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
 SUZANNE ANKER, Universal Concepts Unlimited, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through Oct. 21). One of those Leonardo types who like to combine art and science, Ms. Anker presents silkscreened paintings and sculptures addressing the representation of genetics. Silkscreen panels display silvery, gridded fields of chromosome symbols with little human images mixed in. The 500 silver-painted, three-dimensional letters A, C, T and G piled on a glass panel refer to DNA. It is all rather more decorative than conceptually illuminating (Johnson).
 
 LOUISE FISHMAN, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through Oct. 21). Ms. Fishman's Abstract Expressionist painting is still tough and gritty in its bluntly gestural, grid-based physicality, but now it has a lusciousness of color that verges on the hedonistic. "A Stranger," with its web of impulsively made, wide slate-gray lines over a salmon pink field, is a voluptuous yet still excitingly raw picture (Johnson).
 
 DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 ALBERT RENGER-PATZSCH, Tatintsian, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 633-0110 (through Oct. 28). If the German photographer Renger-Patzsch (1897-1966) were working today, he would probably make his formally perfect, subtly poetic pictures of industrialized landscapes, medieval church interiors and close-up plant studies into glossy, sofa-size Cibachromes. These small black-and-white vintage prints from the 1920's and 30's offer a welcome, intimately evocative respite from today's overly-showy photoaesthetics (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
TORBEN GIEHLER, Leo Koenig, 359 Broadway, at Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-9255 (through Oct. 21). In bright acrylic colors, this young painter produces eye-grabbing gridded fields extending into deep space. The images suggest microscopic visions of computer circuitry or aerial views of futuristic cities. Mr. Giehler is indebted to Al Held for his hard-edged abstract illusionism and sci-fi fantasy, but he has his own promising vision (Johnson).
 
 "PASTORAL POP!," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's "Grande Jatte," Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).
 
 "RE-DRAWING THE LINE," Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473 (through Oct. 28). This unfocused show of works in which line figures, literally or conceptually, includes an invigorating giant doodle by Diana Cooper; whited out ledger pages by Peter Wegner; the image of a scribble cut from brown felt by Arturo Herrera; a dripped line from a performance by Francis Alys; a string sculpture by Pae White; and tangled plastic zip ties by Mungo Thomson. The importance of line in obliquely conceptual works by Alessandro Balteo and Sophie Tottie is harder to see (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
 WILL BARNET, "Works on Paper," Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 262-5050 (through tomorrow). Mr. Barnet is known today for his illustrative, poetically classicizing figurative paintings. This survey of drawings over seven decades shows that the artist, who was born in 1911, has tried his always adept if rarely original hand at most of the major 20th-century styles, from Social Realism to Cubism to flattened and simplified 50's-style abstraction. Some drawings of children, penciled with exacting, curvy lines in the 1940's, are particularly affecting (Ken Johnson).
 
 STEPHANIE BROOKS, Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 604-9660 (through tomorrow). In her funny and inventively designed works, this young Chicagoan conflates ordinarily unrelated systems of verbal or visual signification (Johnson).
 
 NICOLE EISENMAN, Jack Tilton, 49 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 941-1775 (through tomorrow). Since making her mark as a wickedly provocative, often hilarious cartoonist, Ms. Eisenman has mutated into a would-be fine painter. Her first New York exhibition in four years features carefully made, Renaissance-inspired paintings that depict extremes of lesbian sisterhood, including a neo-classical mural in which Amazon cannibals dine on stew made from butchered men. She is still at her best with her more spontaneous and darkly idiosyncratic drawings (Johnson).
 
 APRIL GORNIK, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565 (through tomorrow). Ms. Gornik continues to combine 19th-century Transcendentalism and 20th-century Modernism in the production of expansive dreamlike landscapes. At best, optical intensity goes hand in hand with divine immanence, as in "Mirror Forest," in which greenish sunlight pours meltingly through a grove of young trees (Johnson).
 
 ALICE NEEL, "The Last Years," Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774 (through tomorrow). Late portrait paintings and a fine small drawing retrospective complement the Whitney's recent Neel retrospective. Some of the most arresting paintings are of children. The ghoulish-looking Jonathan in the arms of his father, Don Perlis, radiates demonic energy. The 15 drawings on paper, from the smoothly penciled "Sam" to the densely hatched "Phil" to the almost Minimalist "Andy Warhol," argue persuasively for a more extensive show of drawings (Johnson).
 
 "SELECTIONS FALL 2000," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through tomorrow). The center's latest show of emerging artists focuses on schematic drawing. It includes Mary Lum's cutout and layered painted line images of buildings; Lucas Monaco's crystalline transparent street maps; Oona Stern's cartoon wood floor; a mural by Geraldine Lau that resembles an air-traffic map; architectural and topographical fragments finely inked and layered by Julie Mehretu; Miranda Maher's semitransparent stacks of utilitarian illustrations; Glenn Grafelman's smudgy fenestration drawings; and photographs of Grady Gerbracht that trace passing scenes on a bus window (Johnson).
 
 BETTINA VON ZWEHL, Lombard-Freid Gallery, 531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 967-8040 (through tomorrow). Ms. von Zwehl, a young German artist living in London, is one of several young photographers who fit a strict Conceptual framework around traditional portraiture. For her first solo show she invited young children into her studio, dressed them in identical (black) clothes and let them take their own pictures. She then juxtaposed the images in pairs, matching or contrasting poses, expressions and appearances. The disarming results rely too completely on the emotional transparency of children while also resembling Gap ads (Smith).

HEADLINE: Credibility Is Job No. 1 at MG

BYLINE: By RICHARD FEAST 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England

 BODY:
IT takes perhaps 10 minutes to walk from the National Exhibition Center here to the headquarters of what is now known as the MG Rover Group. And yet, when a biennial motor show opens to the public at the center next Thursday, there will be no display of MG Rover's cars.
This startling absence by the region's biggest automaker -- akin to General Motors not participating in the Detroit auto show -- is a sign of the huge challenges that confront MG Rover, the former Rover Group. After suffering huge losses, BMW sold the Rover operations to British investors this year for a nominal $14. 
 MG Rover has limited cash that it must spend wisely -- not even on a display at the local auto show. It must also re-establish its credibility among car buyers. A central part of its new strategy, reflected in the name change, is to put greater emphasis on the long-moribund MG brand. But American car enthusiasts with recollections of all those MG B, A, TC, TF and TD roadsters of yesteryear should not reach for their checkbooks yet. None of the current MG Rover models have had the expensive crash and emissions tests that might allow them to be sold in the United States.
Despite the tumultuous history of MG Rover -- known over the decades as British Leyland, BL and BMC, among others -- there is still value in the MG name, said Steve Saxty of FutureBrand, a brand-consulting firm in London. "The real issue, though, is how much it appeals to today's customers," he said. "A lot of the value is tied up in America, but it has no delivery mechanism in the U.S." He said the company was selling MG F's to customers in Europe "in their 50's, not the twenty- and thirtysomethings it expected to."
The emphasis is different, and much friendlier to the American market, at the other marques that were once MG's stablemates. BMW, which sold Land Rover to Ford for a more impressive $2.7 billion, retained the Mini brand and will bring out an all-new model in Europe next fall, with American sales to follow.
MG Rover will do most of its business in Europe, and in Britain in particular. Over the coming months, it will introduce sporty versions of Rover's 25, 45 and 75 sedans that will wear MG badges. The company will also endow the MG F, a midengine roadster, with much higher performance. That was a move that BMW seemed reluctant to take, perhaps to keep the car from stealing thunder from its own Z3 roadster.
MG Rover's greatest challenge concerns economies of scale. It is committed to selling four lines of cars, which it makes in a single old factory in Birmingham, for a total of 200,000 cars a year. Global consolidation means big automakers now consider a million units as a starting point for mainstream models.
MG Rover says it will sign a technology transfer agreement with an unspecified high-volume carmaker that will allow it to make its own cars using chassis, suspension and steering components designed by another company. Real independence would then disappear, but a partner with a global perspective could provide the long-term security that MG lacks.

HEADLINE: WORLD BUSINESS;
An Oasis for Programmers in Bali

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: PACUNG, Indonesia

 BODY:
Every start-up company has its tales of sacrifice. But few can equal the sacrifices accompanying the birth of Indonesia's latest bid to join the new economy.
A pig, a goat and a duck were among the animals laid out beneath a bamboo altar as ritual offerings at the official opening on Oct. 7 of BaliCamp, a software development enterprise in the center of Indonesia's legendary island, Bali. While musicians hammered out a hypnotic cadence on chimes, gongs and cymbals, a local priest recited prayers to bless the undertaking. 
 It was not your typical business start, certainly. But this is Indonesia's deeply religious Hindu holiday playground, and the gods sit on the board of any venture.
"We're trying to integrate very tightly with the local community," said Otto Sugiri, chairman of BaliCamp's owner, Sigma Citra Harmoni, who was dressed for the occasion in a sarong and headdress.
Mystical, laid-back Bali may seem like an unlikely location for anything high-technology. But Mr. Sugiri thinks Bali's magic can gather Indonesia's creative talent and help the country grab a slice of what Balicamp executives say is a $32.6 billion market for farming out programming to other companies.
BaliCamp, he hopes, will serve as a programming colony, where computing talent from Indonesia and abroad can write software for companies worldwide.
The enterprise is part of a well-worn path in developing countries, one made increasingly cost-effective by the Internet. With bits and bytes now cheaper to transport than bodies, companies in the West are farming out more of the spadework of building networks and sending them to programmers in Asia.
India, Malaysia and the Philippines are known for offering well-educated, English-speaking computing talent at a fraction of what it costs to pay programmers at home.
"They're cheap, and they have the skills," said Dane Anderson, vice president for Internet research at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. Indonesia's programmers may be less numerous and their English skills may be poorer, but BaliCamp is counting on the advantage of location. Set on a lush hillside garlanded with rice paddies, the compound is within a two-hour drive of Bali's most popular surfing beaches, golf courses and tourist districts.
From the outside, BaliCamp resembles some of the island's many luxury resorts. A string of bungalows surround an airy central office complex of hardwood and whitewash, complete with swimming pool and koi ponds. Inside, however, are banks of personal computers networked to a satellite link that gives BaliCamp superfast connections to the Internet via Hawaii.
Each bungalow is an office for a team of programmers working on their project. One team, for instance, is developing an online trading system for a Singapore securities firm, while another is writing software for a credit union in Utah.
BaliCamp has already won the support of Sigma's big-name suppliers: Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and International Business Machines. The Microsoft Corporation, which lent software to the venture, has also hired BaliCamp to develop an Indonesian-language spell-checker for use in its operating system, said Richard Kartawijaya, general manager of Microsoft Indonesia.
Mr. Sugiri, 47, was born south of Jakarta in Bandung. He studied programming in Germany. He returned to Indonesia in 1983 to work for an oil company and then worked for a bank.
In 1989, he left the buttoned-down banking world behind and joined the founders of a hardware distribution start-up company called Sigma. Today, Sigma is a $21-million-a-year holding company with seven subsidiaries involved in areas that include World Wide Web sites, corporate networks and software design.
Mr. Sugiri came up with the idea for BaliCamp in 1998, during the Asian financial crisis. Many programmers were taking jobs abroad to avoid the rioting and religious strife, he said. But Bali has remained an oasis of calm, offering refuge to both Jakarta-based expatriates and persecuted ethnic Chinese.
Years of tourist inroads have made Bali one of Indonesia's wealthiest and most-developed islands. It has an international airport with direct links to much of Asia and Australia. Bali is also home to a thriving arts scene that Mr. Sugiri says complements the kind of creative Web programming in demand today.
All these things, together with BaliCamp's communal atmosphere, Sigma executives say, will lure not only Indonesian programmers but also foreign software developers eager for the chance to visit. BaliCamp also plans to hire several foreigners to work as project managers and marketing executives, said Marina Budiman, the company's president director.
Foreigners seem to take to Bali's lifestyle. Jason Swanson, 30, a Canadian working in Singapore for DataOn, a software start-up company, spent two weeks at BaliCamp while it was under construction. "It was great," he recalled. "Here's a commute where you're driving through these terraced rice fields." After a week of 10-hour days, he said, he was able to unwind by playing volleyball on the beach.
BaliCamp executives say the new company is already on track to pull in up to $10 million in sales in 2001.
"I think $10 million is quite low for them, to be frank," said Mr. Kartawijaya of Microsoft.
BaliCamp, however, may have some difficulty expanding without sacrificing quality. It already has more than 80 full-time programmers and plans to more than double that number this year. With an average annual programmer salary of $8,000, roughly eight times the national average, there is no shortage of applicants. But of the 150 programmers who have taken the company's entrance exam in the last three months, only 10 have passed, said BaliCamp's general manager, Gunawan Tenggarahardja.
Most of Indonesia's programming talent comes from technical universities on neighboring Java. Mr. Sugiri foresees having to build BaliCamp branches near Java's college towns to be closer to his source.
Life at BaliCamp already resembles a campus more than the colony Mr. Sugiri envisions. Many programmers, like Yusuf Riza, 24, who is from eastern Java, walk to work each day from nearby villages. Others take a bus from Bali's main city, Denpasar. But many nights are spent sleeping in the bungalows in front of their terminals. "My home sweet home," Mr. Riza said, laughing. And there are no 24-hour pizza or coffee joints in Pacung, only a staff cafeteria and restaurant, in BaliCamp.
Mr. Sugiri and other Sigma executives say the isolation is intentional. They settled on Pacung not only for its beauty, but also for its distance from the heat and the distractions of the coast.
"You can't work at the beach," said a Sigma executive, Djarot Suiantoro. "You'll be tempted to go surfing."

HEADLINE: Import Prices Other Than Oil Fell Sharply in September

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Prices of imports other than oil showed the largest decline in one and a half years last month, government figures showed today, suggesting the nation's appetite for foreign-made goods is helping contain inflation.
The import price index minus oil fell 0.3 percent in September as costs fell for food, business equipment, autos and consumer goods, Labor Department figures showed. The index minus petroleum rose 0.2 percent in August. Including petroleum, overall import prices rose 1.5 percent last month -- the fifth consecutive monthly increase -- after rising 0.2 percent in August. 
 Offsetting the rise in oil prices has been the strength of the dollar, which makes other imports cheaper. That is good news for Federal Reserve policy makers, who are intent on keeping the economy's record expansion intact by preventing a pickup in inflation.
"Excluding petroleum, it doesn't look like we're seeing any acceleration" in price increases, said Scott Brown, senior economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. "There's very little feed-through to prices of consumer goods" from rising energy costs.
The September drop in import prices excluding petroleum was the first since May and the largest since a 0.5 percent drop in March 1999. Nonoil import prices have increased just 1.1 percent over the last 12 months, well below the 3.5 percent annualized inflation rate measured by the Consumer Price Index for the first eight months of the year. Import prices excluding oil declined 0.4 percent for the 12 months ended in September 1999.
A separate report today showed that the number of Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 last week, to 306,000. The less-volatile four-week average for new claims fell to 301,500 -- the lowest since mid-August -- from 306,500 a week earlier, suggesting that the demand for workers is showing not signs of weakening. Job creation and near-record consumer confidence are underpinning spending.

HEADLINE: Washington Bets That a Bear Market Will Never Come

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IT was supposed to be the day that Wall Street stabilized. Overnight the professionals who trade stock index futures bid up the prices. They were confident that the stock market would rally yesterday morning.
But it did not. Instead, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been relatively calm as Nasdaq slumped, had its worst day since the spring meltdown. It ended just above 10,000 after losing 379 points, or 3.6 percent. Less than a quarter of that came from the latest disaster story, at Home Depot. There was selling almost everywhere, although some money went into companies like Procter & Gamble, whose business is less sensitive to the economy. 
 Home Depot's woes may be instructive. The big disappointments heretofore have been in technology stocks, whose high valuations left them vulnerable to slower growth. Home Depot is not a technology company, however, and its weaker growth reflects widespread problems: competition has intensified as the economy's growth has slowed while higher energy costs cut profit margins.
Those higher energy costs are not limited to retailers, of course. As winter heating bills soar this year, Americans will face choices. Do they pay for heat by cutting back on Christmas gifts or by cutting back on investments? Neither option looks very attractive for stock prices.
Perhaps the slide will end soon. Maybe the mutual funds have almost finished their year-end tax selling, before they close their books at the end of October. Maybe stocks will rebound today, on Friday the 13th. (This great bull market began on Friday, Aug. 13, 1982, so that day does not have to be unlucky.) Maybe, as so often before, investors will see the decline as a buying opportunity. The belief that stocks always rise, at least in the long run, is still widely held. And anyway, the Dow has gone down for six consecutive sessions, and it has been more than a decade since it had a string of seven straight losses.
But just as investors are unprepared for the notion that stocks can go down and stay down, so are the folks in Washington. The great budget debate being conducted by Al Gore and George W. Bush assumes there will be trillions in surpluses over the next decade that they can divvy up in tax cuts and spending. There is no discussion of just how closely those surpluses have been tied to the bull market.
Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, points out in a report entitled "The Bubble Budgets" that what took budget forecasters by surprise was the surge in individual income tax payments, reflecting capital gains and taxes on profits from stock options.
The official budget forecasts assume that those high tax payments will keep on coming. Which is to say, they assume that bear markets have been repealed. If that assumption proves wrong, the budget surpluses will shrink drastically, even if the economy keeps growing.
As Congress rushes to end this session, there is one sidelight that investors should watch. Some big accounting firms are seeking to push through legislation that would bar the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking steps to assure that auditors are really independent from the companies whose books they certify. It could pass.
Congressional muzzling of the S.E.C. would send a clear message to investors: You're on your own.
That may not be the ideal message for a nervous market. But Washington takes rising share prices for granted.
Wall Street agrees. Stock index futures rose as last night's trading began, just as they did Wednesday night.

HEADLINE: Chinese Official Reassures U.S. Envoy on Firm Plans to Open Trade

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has given "absolutely emphatic" assurances that China will not back away from the market-opening commitments that it made to gain entry into the World Trade Organization, the American trade negotiator said here today.
After more than five hours of discussions with Mr. Zhu and senior trade officials, the American negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, sought to dispel reports that the application to join the trade body might be unraveling or that China was having second thoughts about the sweeping concessions that it had made in talks with the United States and Europe. 
 "The issue of China's accession is no longer whether" it joins the trade group, Ms. Barshefsky told reporters. "It's when."
She said American and European officials still believed that it might be possible for China to achieve membership by the end of the year, but only if it hastens to complete the complex final negotiations under way in Geneva to set the detailed conditions of membership.
Ms. Barshefsky flew here in a hastily arranged trip, hoping to give a jolt to stalled final negotiations at the W.T.O. headquarters in Geneva over the precise terms of China's membership. Those talks have to mesh together the previous agreements that China has signed with scores of countries on thousands of trade and investment issues and translate principles into precise rules and schedules.
China has agreed, in talks with the United States, the European Community and others, to cut tariffs significantly on agricultural and industrial products and to open major industries like banking and telecommunications to foreign investment.
Some Western officials contended that China was backsliding on some issues in Geneva, including the timetables to reduce tariffs. Some experts have speculated that China's desire to enter the group has flagged because of fears that a rapid opening of markets would cause a surge in unemployment and social turmoil.
Although there is great apprehension in China about the social effects of lower tariffs and investment barriers, top leaders have repeatedly stated their firm desire to join the trade group. Mr. Zhu and many economists here say they believe that China has to endure the painful shock of global competition to speed its transformation to an efficient market economy.
In the meeting this morning just before he left for a visit to Japan, Mr. Zhu provided the Americans with just the assurances that they sought, Ms. Barshefsky reported.
"I stressed the absolute importance of full compliance," she said. "Mr. Zhu was emphatic, absolutely emphatic, that China will not back away from the bilateral commitments it made to the United States and other trading partners."
Ms. Barshefsky said the main problems in Geneva arose from the incredible complexity and variety of issues on the table, as well as China's need to deal with an oversight group of 40 countries. Conflict and confusion in the final stages of joining the W.T.O., she said, are normal, adding, "We see this all the time, and I'm not overly concerned."
But, hinting at more substantive disagreements, she also said: "Every country that accedes would like to get in doing less rather than more, and the less specific the better. China is no exception."
She said the talks had become mired over a host of "dry, not sexy issues" like agricultural quotas and product standards, which differ for imported and domestic goods.

HEADLINE: Colombian Rebels Said to Seize 10 Foreign Oil Workers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Members of the largest guerrilla group in Colombia kidnapped five American and five other foreign oil workers today in the Amazon region of Ecuador and hijacked a helicopter to take them across the Colombian border into territory they control, the Ecuadorean government said.
The group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has increasingly operated across Colombia's borders in recent months. The kidnapping today was the most brazen effort in what appears to be a campaign to instill fear in Colombia's neighbors that a planned offensive in southern Colombia in the coming months, backed by the United States, will spread the conflict. 
 The kidnapping occurred hours before President Andres Pastrana of Colombia arrived in Argentina as part of a South American tour intended to increase regional support for his efforts to use greater military power to force two guerrilla groups to make concessions in peace talks. The seizure also seemed to bolster rebel assertions that United States military officials who arrive to train Colombian troops could be expected to be targets.
"The FARC has claimed responsibility for the hostage taking in retaliation for Plan Colombia," Vice President Pedro Pinto of Ecuador told reporters, referring to a $7.5 billion Colombian anti-drug plan that includes 60 United States military helicopters and American training for a new Colombian army brigade to help eradicate coca fields in two southern Colombian provinces that the FARC occupies. The plan is also financed by European governments and international agencies.
"The FARC dress like civilians and cross the border and do things like this," Mr. Pinto said.
He told a radio station that the guerrillas captured the 11 hostages -- including two French workers, an Argentine, a Chilean, a New Zealander and one Ecuadorean -- at 4 a.m. local time at an oil workers' camp near Pompeya and whisked them away in a Super Puma helicopter owned by an Ecuadorean service company. The hostages work for two service companies contracted by Repsol-YPF, a Spanish-Argentine oil company, to perform geological surveys.
A State Department official said the Ecuadorean had been kidnapped but quickly released. "We don't know much," the official said. "They were put in a helicopter -- one of the captives is a pilot -- and flown away. And we don't know where. But it is likely they took them to Colombia. We have to find out where they took them before we can do anything."
The official declined to identify the hostages.
A senior Clinton administration official said: "There have been incidents like this in northern Ecuador before where people have been kidnapped. It does bring up the issue of security for workers down there. It is a real concern."
The kidnapping occurred 47 miles south of the border, suggesting that the rebels have the capacity to operate deep inside Ecuador.
Spokesmen at Repsol-YPF in Buenos Aires said they were trying to confirm the reports.
United States military officials recently warned that the FARC has made contact with and has influenced an Indian movement in Ecuador that helped overthrow a democratically elected president in Quito this year.
The attack on foreign oil operations was carried out at a time the oil-based Ecuadorean economy is stumbling despite high oil prices. Recently the government asked Washington for increased aid to help feed and shelter an increasing number of Colombian refugees who are crossing the border to escape the fighting.
Ecuador borders areas of Colombia with some of the highest concentrations of coca fields anywhere in South America, including the Putumayo Province, where American and Colombian military officials plan to focus an extensive eradication effort. The officials hope that eradicating the coca in Putumayo and adjacent Caqueta Province will deny the FARC valuable resources to finance their war.
The FARC, the strongest, oldest and richest guerrilla group in Latin America, also makes a habit of kidnapping foreigners as well as Colombians to extract exorbitant payoffs. It has stepped up its activities, attacking one police station after another in the countryside since the United States Congress passed a $1.3 billion aid package four months ago.
The FARC does not hold other American hostages, although three American missionaries seized three years ago are missing and widely believed to be dead.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
As Prices Climb, Terminology Is Also Stretched

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
In what might be called terminology inflation, penthouses are descending and town houses are levitating as architects, developers and marketers of new luxury buildings stretch definitions in seeking to sell their seven-figure wares.
In a similar stretch, a building on Broadway that combines a residential component atop a commercial base is being billed as 70 stories high when there are actually only 49 floors, while the controversial Trump World Tower near the United Nations is advertised as 90 stories when it really bears only 72 floors. 
 And, as variable as the vocabulary, reaction to the practice ranges from outright criticism to mild bemusement.
"The issue is appropriation of quasi-architectural terms," said Reinhold Martin, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "Each reinvention reveals something. If somebody wants to buy an apartment and it's on the sixth floor of a 12-story building and it's advertised as a penthouse, what's being sold is the fantasy of the penthouse. If the person buys into it, that's their fantasy. I'm all for it."
But Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian, was not so sanguine. "Talk about twisting language and reality," Mr. Alpern said. "I write for a living, and I'm very aware of the need for precision in language. Words have customary meanings understood by ordinary people. Any unexpected use is deceptive unless completely explained."
The focus of the professionals' comments is the Beekman Regent, a 20-story condominium under construction at First Avenue and 51st Street. The first four floors incorporate the hollowed-out 1893 Romanesque Revival facades of what was once Public School 35.
The terraced apartments on the fifth floor, just above the old school's facade, are being marketed as town houses -- a term commonly applied to row houses at street level. The top nine floors, each with wedding-cake style setbacks, are being called penthouses.
Across town, at Broadway and 56th Street, a 630-foot-high building is rising -- its 26-story base to be headquarters for Random House, the publishing company, topped by a 23-story residential component called the Park Imperial.
But the building is being marketed as 70 stories -- with the first residential floor labeled the 48th -- based on what the developer, the Related Companies, calculates as the number of floors it would have if it were entirely residential. (Generally, new office spaces have floor-to-floor heights of about 12 feet, while residential space is about 9 feet.)
"They claim 'equivalent stories' is what counts," Mr. Alpern said. "By that logic, the high-ceiling buildings along Fifth and Park would be several floors taller than they actually are. Paraphrasing Gertrude Stein: a floor is a floor is a floor."
The original meaning of penthouse was a structure on the roof, set back from the parapet. "Thus, in the old days, when proper people wouldn't dream of living on a roof, penthouses were elevator superstructures, maid's rooms," Mr. Alpern said. Later, with Hollywood glamorizing the concept, the definition expanded to an apartment on the roof, "but still always a one-story structure."
In 1929, new building regulations allowed higher structures if they were behind the building line. "Those setbacks created terraced apartments, not penthouses," Mr. Alpern insisted. "So eight stories of so-called penthouses atop the former P.S. 35 are not penthouses but terraced apartments."
The Beekman Regent is being marketed by the Marketing Directors, whose president, Adrienne Albert, said, "They are unique homes with outdoor space enjoying the topmost levels of the building, as opposed to most high-rise buildings, which have a middle section with homes stacked one after another."
As to a town house being restricted to the ground floor, Ms. Albert said: "That's a narrow interpretation. An important component of a town house is outdoor space. Our homes are configured similar to Upper East Side conventional town houses. They have outdoor space larger than most backyards. So, instead of accessing them from an exterior street, you are accessing them from an interior street -- the corridor."
Mr. Alpern, the strict constructionist, conceded some wiggle room, "Whereas, the Beekman Regent is an apartment house effectively sitting on top of another building, it's not entirely unreasonable that that top serves like a street."
Other marketers took varying positions on variable definitions.
Saying she preferred precision, Joyce West, vice president of the Charles H. Greenthal Group, pointed out: "In the end, everyone sees the property they are going to buy. So, whether it's labeled town house or penthouse, loftlike or loft size, they're either going to like the space or not."
Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, particularly citing building-elevation reinterpretation, said: "The notion 'big' is incredibly dear to the developer's heart. It's absolutely done for marketing. But not only to the community, it's also marketing to the industry -- impressing them with the size of your ambition and ability to deliver the goods."
By far the biggest stretch, Mr. Alpern said, is the word luxury, "which developers use for anything beyond a public housing project and a 19th-century tenement that has not yet been gentrified."
Professor Martin at Columbia concurred: "It's not only about square footage, nuts and bolts. This terminology game is, on one hand, a sort of ruse, on the other, an expression of something like the psychopathology of real estate."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Yugoslavia Will Move to Renew Diplomatic Ties

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The United States and Yugoslavia signaled today that they would move quickly toward the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, which were severed as NATO began its 11-week bombing campaign here last year.
A first meeting between James O'Brien, the special adviser to President Clinton for the Balkans, and Vojislav Kostunica, the newly elected Yugoslav president, produced no precise timetable for restoring diplomatic ties but demonstrated that a willingness to resolve the matter existed on both sides. 
 Mr. Kostunica, who has criticized American "meddling" in Serbia before and since taking office, said there had been "a gap in communication" between Belgrade and Washington -- a tactful way of describing often bitter hostility. But he added, "We hope we will bridge that gap and our relations normalize."
The meeting came as Mr. Clinton lifted the oil embargo and the ban on American flights to Yugoslavia that had been imposed in 1998 after President Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Kosovo Albanians. Mr. Clinton said more significant sanctions, like the denial of much-needed lending from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would be reviewed as the democratic transition that began last week with a popular uprising against Mr. Milosevic proceeds.
In a statement in Washington, Mr. Clinton said: "We have a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society. The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia's isolation." Yugoslavia is made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
The United States is particularly eager to consolidate the fragile democratic change in Serbia because it is crucial to bolstering the chances of an enduring peace in the Balkans, where four wars in the last eight years have involved a sizable commitment of American resources to an unstable corner of Europe.
Mr. Kostunica said today that he respected the 1995 Dayton agreement that brought peace to Bosnia, in effect committing himself to respecting Yugoslavia's border with Bosnia and the arrangement that grants Bosnian Serbs considerable self-rule in 49 percent of a Bosnia with a weak central government.
He also committed himself to United Nations resolutions that provide for wide Albanian self-government in Kosovo.
Speaking after a 90-minute meeting, Mr. O'Brien said Mr. Kostunica had agreed to "work through some technical issues, with an aim to establishing diplomatic relations." Those issues include a need for him to consult with the Yugoslav Parliament over a decision that is delicate in the light of widespread anti-American feeling here.
Any over-eager embrace of the United States would tend to undermine Mr. Kostunica's political standing at this stage because a majority of Serbs might see it as a form of moral surrender. Although the new president has enormous good will on his side after the uprising that forced Mr. Milosevic to finally concede defeat in last month's election, his hold on the levers of power is as yet partial.
In the light of the delicate political situation and the enduring hostility over the NATO bombing, Mr. O'Brien said Mr. Kostunica did not want to appear to be "picking favorites" and favored a restoration of diplomatic ties with Washington that would be simultaneous with "normalizing" relations with Western European nations. This seems likely to occur within the next several weeks, officials said.
The remaining sanctions provide Washington with some leverage in discussions over whether Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicated by the International Tribunal in The Hague, should stand trial for war crimes. But it was clear that the United States, whose first priority is the consolidation of long-elusive democracy in Yugoslavia, would not push Mr. Kostunica to try the ousted leader or deliver him to The Hague in the near term.
The Serbian uprising ended not with the violent removal of Mr. Milosevic but with a handshake between him and Mr. Kostunica that sealed an accord on the passage of power. What guarantees, if any, were given to Mr. Milosevic, who remains under guard in Serbia, are unclear.
The former leader's domestic position appeared to weaken today as his Serbian Socialist Party said their hard-line secretary general, Gorica Gajevic, a woman intensely loyal to Mr. Milosevic, had been replaced by Zoran Andjelkovic, an official from Kosovo.
The party called a special congress for Nov. 25, and one of its deputies in the Serbian Parliament, Miloje Mihajlovic, said Mr. Milosevic should quit on that occasion because he had lost the support of the members.
It also appeared that a political rift had opened up between the Socialists and the Yugoslav Left Party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. The parties, allied in the election they lost to Mr. Kostunica, said they would run separately in Serbian parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year.
Mr. Kostunica appears quietly certain that his tempered political stance is steadily eroding Mr. Milosevic's support.
While insisting that Yugoslavia must become more democratic and open to the West, the new president has been sharply critical of the NATO bombing campaign and of the war crimes tribunal, which he has described as a pawn of American political interests.
Today, Mr. Kostunica renewed his criticism of the United States, but in far more muted terms, saying it had shown scant "understanding" of the political process in Serbia.

Role Reversal Over Tax Cuts And Spending

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
LONG ago, back when a husband might refer to his wife as the little woman, there was a joke about who wore the pants (another quaint phrase from that era) in the typical American household. A couple sitting on the front porch is asked who makes the family's decisions.
"I do," the husband proclaims. "I decide how we vote in every election. You name an issue -- local politics, national defense, the economy, foreign policy -- and I'll tell you where we stand." 
 The wife nods demurely. "Yes, he makes all the important decisions," she says. "The only thing I decide is how we spend our money."
Today the roles seem to be reversed, at least when it comes to spending the federal surplus. Men want to do it themselves, to judge from their support for tax-cutting Republicans, but women seem more interested in larger issues. They're supporting Democrats at the expense of the household budget.
The expense is striking in the New York area because so many middle-class families here do not qualify for the "middle-class tax cuts" proposed by Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Democrats focus on families making less than $60,000 per year, a sum that buys a reasonably comfortable middle-class lifestyle in the typical American community.
But that standard of living would cost about $85,000 in the New York suburbs, and $135,000 in the city. Middle-class New Yorkers earn relatively high salaries, which mean high tax brackets, so they would be prime beneficiaries of the broad tax cuts proposed by George W. Bush and Rick A. Lazio.
In all, New York State residents would get back $11.1 billion annually from the Bush tax cuts, versus $3.5 billion from the Gore tax plan, according to a report released Wednesday by Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group.
Mr. McMahon's report points to the case of a family of four making the median income in Westchester County, $83,100, and itemizing deductions. The family would get no automatic tax break from the Gore plan, although it could save $1,210 if it was paying at least $10,000 a year in college tuition. It could also, by setting aside $3,000 in a retirement account, qualify for a $1,000 tax credit that would be locked in that account.
Under the Bush tax plan, the Westchester family would save $2,628 per year, Mr. McMahon calculates. He also cites the example of a single person making $62,970 a year, the average wage in Manhattan. That person would save $1,180 under the Bush plan, but nothing under the Gore plan.
Why, then, isn't Mr. Bush making more headway among women? One answer may be in the packaging of tax cuts.
"Democrats have personalized the tax cuts," Mr. McMahon said. "They've targeted them at college students, children in day care, retired people. Maybe that appeals more to women than broad tax cuts. But in most cases Bush will give even bigger tax cuts to those people, and he'll give everyone else tax cuts, too."
Another answer is that tax cuts mean less to women than other issues, like abortion rights or education. Women are generally more liberal than men, and New Yorkers are generally more liberal than the rest of America.
THEY'VE been willing to pay high taxes for for the sake of the poor, even when the money ends up going to non-poor people in other states. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has been pointing out for years, New York State has one of the highest rates of poverty in America, yet it gets back less from Washington than it sends in taxes.
The export of tax dollars, Mr. Moynihan said recently, made sense when New York could spare the money. "During the New Deal, New York was comparatively rich, and other regions were in crisis. We were happy to help. But that is no longer the case. We have gradually been impoverished. The transfer of wealth keeps working against us. We should be in favor of lower taxes and be very wary of supporting any social programs at the national level."
Yesterday, Mr. Moynihan said he was not surprised to hear of the new calculations on New York's savings from the Bush tax cuts. But he was not, of course, endorsing the opposition's plan.
"At this point," he said, "I'd rather use the surplus to pay down the debt than throw it away in programs or give it away in tax cuts." That is a common view among Democratic politicians and policy-makers, and maybe it makes economic sense in the long term. Or maybe it's the kind of big-picture thinking favored by that husband on the front porch.

Oil Prices Rise On New Fears About Mideast

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil surged yesterday, as news of escalating violence on the West Bank and an apparent terrorist attack on a United States naval ship in Yemen stoked fears of a wider Middle East conflict that could disrupt the flow of oil from the region.
Experts on Middle East oil producers cautioned against market panic, however, saying that Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would face enormous diplomatic and economic repercussions if they chose to limit oil exports as a show of support for the Palestinians. 
 But the bloodshed in the Middle East has startled a United States market already jittery because of lagging stocks of heating oil and crude oil. The benchmark contract, for November crude, closed at $36.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, an increase of $2.81, or more than 8 percent, from Wednesday. Crude prices had jumped earlier in the day to $37 a barrel, somewhat shy of a 10-year high, after Israeli helicopters fired missiles at Palestinian sites in the West Bank and Gaza, in reprisal for the deaths of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob.
"There's three to four dollars' worth of worry priced into the market right now," said John Kilduff, senior vice president for risk management at Fimat, the commodities trading unit of Societe Generale. "The supply situation is so tight that any disturbance drives it up."
The price of crude oil appeared to be slipping to less than $30 a barrel just a week ago but edged up again after a cold snap in the Northeast a few days ago. At the same time, weekly statistics showed heating oil inventories at half of last year's levels, a shortfall that has stirred concern that any disruption in the supply of crude oil could lead to price spikes or even shortages this winter.
Concern over a supply disruption from the Middle East has been building all week, set off by a comment Monday from the Saudi crown prince, Abdullah, that Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, "has to think before taking any step and nobody should think that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab and Islamic nation would just watch with their hands tied."
About a third of United States imports, or about 2.53 million barrels a day, are from the Middle East. The country consumes about 19 million barrels of oil daily.
Fears that the conflict in the Middle East would overflow Israel's borders grew when word spread yesterday of an explosion on a United States Navy destroyer at a port in Yemen. The Defense Department also reported movements by elite military units outside Baghdad, and President Clinton put troops in the Persian Gulf on higher alert.
Adding to the anxiety about crude oil supplies, three small companies that won a third of the 30 million barrels of oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve appeared to be having trouble arranging the financing needed to receive the oil. The White House tapped the petroleum reserve to try to ease supplies and prices of heating oil, a move that seemed to be having some impact until the violence began in the Middle East.
One of the companies, Euell Energy of Aurora, Colo., failed to get a necessary letter of credit to receive the three million barrels of oil it won in a tender a week ago, thereby forfeiting the oil, which will be offered for auction again next Monday, the Energy Department said. Two other companies, Burhany Energy Enterprises of Tallahassee, Fla., and Lance Stroud Enterprises of New York, received extensions until midnight tonight to come up with the letters of credit.
Despite all the news that has put oil traders on edge, industry analysts warn that matters in the Middle East would have to become far worse before the notion of a 1970's-type embargo should be taken seriously. Saudi Arabia's bellicose talk, they say, is mainly for domestic consumption. The kingdom, which is OPEC's de facto leader, sees the United States as its closest ally and certainly its largest client for crude oil.
"It would be very bad for relations with the United States, what with the elections coming up and heating oil stocks so low," said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist for the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. "It's so dangerous a game."
But most analysts concede that while the OPEC countries do not really want to cut off exports because of the conflict in Israel, they might be pushed to drastic measures if the people in their own countries took to the streets over the issue. The hope is that over the weekend, diplomatic efforts will cool the tensions and the violence will subside somewhat. One New York trader said, "The oil markets now are in the hands of the politicians."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: INTERNATIONAL FINANCE;
I.M.F. and Ex-Russian Premier Deny Bush Charge of Aid Theft

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush's accusation that aid money from the International Monetary Fund lined the pockets of a former Russian prime minister was denied today by the monetary fund and the former Russian official, raising questions about Mr. Bush's pointed charge in Wednesday's otherwise cordial discussion of foreign policy issues.
The comments about misused aid reflect growing skepticism among many Congressional Republicans about the role of the I.M.F., which some critics have accused of wasting billions and supporting corrupt governments. 
 Vice President Al Gore's campaign cited the dispute over the accuracy of Mr. Bush's statement as proof that the Texas governor "does not meet presidential standards" in foreign policy. The Clinton administration has defended the I.M.F. as vital in financial emergencies.
Mr. Bush on Wednesday named Russia as an "egregious" example of misspent aid. He said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, had personally profited from I.M.F. lending. Some of the agency's money "ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket," Mr. Bush said.
The barb was clearly aimed at Mr. Gore, who has had a prominent role in managing relations with Russia and reached numerous agreements with the longtime prime minister.
The I.M.F., which acknowledges failing to stabilize Russia's economy and currency in the 1990's, has repeatedly denied that aid money -- at one point it had about $25 billion in outstanding loans to Russia -- was siphoned off.
The Russian central bank hired the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. last year to audit its I.M.F. loans. The auditors reported that the central bank had once lied about the size of its currency reserves and that it had stored some I.M.F. funds in offshore accounts. But it also asserted that all I.M.F. loans had been accounted for and that there was no evidence of theft.
Mr. Chernomyrdin issued a statement in Moscow today denying the accusations and threatening to sue Mr. Bush for slander.
"I think Mr. Bush Jr. should be getting ready for a court hearing on the issue," Mr. Chernomyrdin said.
The Bush campaign said today that Mr. Bush stood by his statement.
But Mr. Bush himself softened his tone today in an interview with Fox News. The governor said it was "general knowledge" that people in Russia had taken I.M.F. aid, but he raised the possibility that Mr. Chernomyrdin might have taken some other kind of aid money.
"It might not have been; it might have been another aid," Mr. Bush said when asked if he had evidence to support his earlier accusation.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman, said that the I.M.F. had subsidized Russia's oil and gas sector, where Mr. Chernomyrdin exercised influence, and that after leaving the post of prime minister, he had served as an executive at the state-owned natural gas company. Mr. Chernomyrdin has been accused of profiting handsomely from ties with the gas company.

HEADLINE: In Utility Power Play, East Meets West;
Buyers Circle Debt-Ridden German Pawn

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: LIPPENDORF, Germany

 BODY:
Until recently, the sparkling new power plant in eastern Germany looked like a Taj Mahal of good intentions gone wrong.
Built by VEAG, an eastern German power company owned by western German utilities, the coal-fired generators in Lippendorf hum almost silently inside spotless white buildings. Gone is the sulfurous black soot that the old Communist-era power plant here once rained down on the countryside. Today, the two giant white cooling towers emit little more than white clouds of water vapor. 
 But for all its virtues, VEAG is reeling. Steered by both the hubris of its western German owners as well as political correctness, the company has spent nearly $8 billion rebuilding the dilapidated power system in the east.
Now, thanks to abrupt deregulation of the electricity market here, it has been forced to reduce its prices by nearly half in the last year. With debt of more than $2 billion, VEAG lost nearly $800 million in 1999.
Would anybody want to buy a company like this? Surprisingly, yes.
In a battle that reflects the tumultuous change in Europe's power industry, at least a dozen potential bidders have emerged from Europe and the United States. One of the most determined suitors is the Southern Company, the Atlanta-based electricity conglomerate, which is already locked in a bitter legal battle for control of Berlin's electric utility.
Southern's biggest rival is Hamburg's electric utility, whose biggest shareholder is the Swedish power conglomerate Vattenfall. Others circling the prey include NRG Energy, a Minneapolis power company; Enel, the Italian power company; Endesa, the Spanish electric utility; and a German utility backed by Electricite de France.
The battle shows how little control easterners have over their economy. Until now, VEAG's fate has been dictated by the western German power companies that often had their own agendas. In the future, it may well be determined by companies in Atlanta, Stockholm, Paris or even Milan.
"It will not be VEAG tomorrow," said Jurgen Stotz, VEAG's chief executive, in a recent interview at the company's headquarters in Berlin. "It is clear we cannot do it alone. We are only one piece of the puzzle."
The pursuers of VEAG have been motivated by the rapid expansion of cross-border competition in Europe. As former national electric monopolies increasingly attack one another's territories, VEAG represents a rare opportunity for foreigners to enter Europe's biggest market.
Despite the company's high debt, its gleaming new plants have some of the lowest operating costs in Europe. They also control a big source of cheap energy in their own backyard -- soft brown lignite coal that should last far beyond the lifetime of the new plants.
There is an important strategic allure. VEAG owns the only power transmission network that links Germany with Poland and one of the very few that reaches Central Europe. As those nations prepare themselves for entry into the European Union, power executives are eagerly looking eastward.
"If you can get past all the tangles, VEAG's variable costs are very low," one industry executive said. "It can be a very competitive producer."
VEAG, which is an acronym for Vereinigte Energiewerke A.G., was a child of German reunification. Founded in 1990, its main shareholders were western Germany's biggest utilities: RWE, which dominates the western-most region of Germany; Veba, which dominates much of the north; and Viag, which serves Bavaria in the south.
But the eastern German company was never really allowed to become a full-service company. Its western German utilities limited it to producing and transmitting electricity, while they and their affiliates actually sold the power and cultivated customers.
They also locked the company into strange contracts, including a requirement that it sell the western German utilities electricity for about 6 pfennigs a kilowatt hour while ordering it to buy some of its electricity from the west for about twice that much.
Today, VEAG is a pawn in the machinations of Europe's much bigger electric conglomerates. Its biggest shareholders -- RWE and what is now called E.ON -- were ordered by antitrust regulators to sell their VEAG stakes as a condition for winning approval of their own mergers. E.ON was formed by the merger of Veba and Viag's power businesses, and RWE acquired one of western Germany's distributors called VEW. German antitrust regulators also ordered E.ON to sell its stake in Berlin's electric utility, which has sales of about $1.5 billion.
The upshot is that most of eastern Germany's power system is now the target of a nasty struggle, with the Southern Company right in the middle. Southern, which acquired a 26 percent stake in the Berlin utility Bewag in 1997, wants to buy majority control and then have Bewag acquire control of VEAG as well.
"We are looking at being a player in Europe," said Jason Harlan, Southern's director of German operations. "Germany is a key market. More than half of all electricity consumed in the European Union occurs here."
The two deals are closely linked, because German political leaders want to consolidate eastern Germany's power industry into a single company that can compete against the country's three other big producers.
Two months ago, E.ON shocked Southern by announcing that it would sell its controlling stake in the Berlin utility to Hamburg's main power company, which is partly controlled by Vattenfall.
Under the proposed deal, E.ON would receive Vattenfall's stake in a regional Swedish power company as well as the Hamburg utility's stake in a local distributor of natural gas.
Southern angrily protested, arguing that it has a pre-emptive contractual right to approve any change in control. Supported by the city of Berlin, Southern won a court injunction that blocked the Vattenfall deal. But the two companies have thus far been unable to hammer out a deal, leaving them in a stalemate since late August.
Both Southern and Vattenfall have made it clear that the battle over the Berlin utility is part and parcel of a bid to take over VEAG itself.
Mr. Harlan, an American Southerner who speaks fluent German, asserts that the German companies are simply trampling over their legal obligations.
"I would never have expected that in a branch of industry as big as this one, that anyone would behave in this fashion," he said in a recent interview. "It plays to the German stereotype, that it's either my way or the highway."
E.ON executives say Southern is wildly exaggerating the validity of its claims. "They absolutely do not have any sort of pre-emptive right," said Erwin Hayden, a spokesman for E.ON.
Here in Lippendorf, a pastoral village just south of Leipzig, workers appear passively resigned. The staff has been cut from several thousand at the time of German reunification to just 313 today. Most of those workers are on shortened workweeks, to avoid the need for laying off even more people.
Indeed, the plant seems almost devoid of people even in the middle of the week. Automated conveyer belts deliver brown coal in crumbly rocks, which are pulverized and then fed into burners that transform water into high-pressure steam around the clock. Though lignite is high in sulfur and generated tons of sooty dust in the old East German plants, the new plant has reduced those emissions to about 3 percent of what they were 10 years ago.
As a result of stripping out particulates from waste gases, the plant produces about one million tons of gypsum a year, with about half sold for industrial uses.
Company executives say they can produce electricity for less than 3 pfennigs, or a bit more than one penny, a kilowatt hour. That is well below the cost of most rivals, which analysts say are about 4.5 pfennigs a kilowatt-hour.
The problem is VEAG's debt, which totals about 5 billion marks, or about $2.3 billion. VEAG executives suggest that the company is worth as much as 3 billion marks, including the debt. But the aspiring buyers have yet to disclose their bids.
The stakes are bigger than just Germany. Southern has acquired power companies in several other European countries and it trades electricity across the Continent. Vattenfall has plants in many countries and it recently acquired a majority stake in the biggest electric company in Warsaw.
Vattenfall is also bidding for a stake in Poland's nationwide electricity distributor, a link that could prove valuable if it were also to acquire control of VEAG.
But as many as 10 other companies are interested. NRG Energy has said it wants to team up with a German partner on a joint bid.
NRG tried but failed to form an alliance with Vattenfall and the Hamburg utility. Then it put out feelers to Energie Baden-Wurttemburg, a power company based near Stuttgart that is partly owned by France's state-controlled electricity conglomerate. But German antitrust regulators shot down that idea last week, saying they did not want VEAG to fall in the hands of another big German electric company.
Under a bidding process supervised by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, all the bidders need to submit offers by Nov. 15 and government officials have ordered VEAG's main shareholders to sell their stakes by Dec. 13.
To be sure, there are risks for any acquirer. In addition to its debt burden, VEAG must also contend with extremely tough competition and very low electricity prices.
VEAG is also locked into a number of long-term contracts that even seasoned industry executives describe as baffling and potentially treacherous when it comes to projecting future costs and profits.
But at the right price, analysts say, VEAG could be a very good deal.
"These are the most modern lignite plants in central Europe, and they fulfill all the norms for environmental standards," said Lynn Reinhardt, a power industry analyst at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
"If the plants were fully depreciated, you would be making big money."

HEADLINE: Despite a Secret Pact by Gore in '95, Russian Arms Sales to Iran Go On

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
In June 1995, Vice President Al Gore signed a secret agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, calling for an end to all Russian sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999.
But the deadline passed with no sign of a halt to such sales, despite repeated complaints late last year and this year to senior Russian officials by Mr. Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. Moscow continues to be a significant supplier of conventional arms to Tehran despite the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in August. 
 The 1995 agreement allowed Moscow to fulfill existing sales contracts for specified weaponry, including a diesel submarine, torpedoes, anti-ship mines and hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers. But no other weapons were to be sold to Iran, and all shipments were to have been completed by last Dec. 31.
In exchange for the Russian promises, the United States pledged not to seek penalties against Russia under a 1992 law that requires sanctions against countries that sell advanced weaponry to countries the State Department classifies as state sponsors of terrorism. Iran is on that list.
Though Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin mentioned an arms agreement in general terms at a news conference the day it was signed, the details have never been disclosed to Congress or to the public.
The Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement appeared to undercut a 1992 law, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act, known as Gore-McCain after its principal sponsors, Mr. Gore, then a senator from Tennessee, and Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. The law was rooted in concerns about Russian sales to Iran of some of the same weapons that the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement expressly allowed.
Senator McCain said this month that he was unaware of the deal that Mr. Gore struck with Mr. Chernomyrdin, which was codified in a document stamped "Secret" and signed in Moscow on June 30, 1995. Mr. McCain said a "strong case can be made" that the Russian delivery of arms, especially the submarine, should have triggered sanctions against Moscow under the provisions of the Gore-McCain law.
"If the administration has acquiesced in the sale, then I believe they have violated both the intent and the letter of the law," he said.
Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth, said the deliveries were not subject to sanctions because they did not meet the 1992 act's definition of "advanced conventional weapons" and did not significantly change the balance of power in the Persian Gulf. But, he said, Mr. Gore brandished the threat as leverage to induce the Russians to sign the agreement, in part to learn more about what arms Moscow was sending to Tehran.
"We deliberately used the Gore-McCain law as a fulcrum to negotiate an understanding with Russia to put constraints on their exports to Iran," Mr. Fuerth said, by setting a cut-off date of Dec. 31, 1999.
Strengthening the lever was the submarine being supplied, the third of three Kilo-class subs that Russia sold to Iran. The sub was of particular concern to American policymakers because it can be hard to detect and could pose a threat to oil tankers or American warships in the gulf.
Mr. Gore and Mr. McCain specifically cited the submarine and its deadly long-range torpedoes as one reason the 1992 nonproliferation act was needed, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Mr. Fuerth acknowledged that Russia had failed to meet its promise to end deliveries by Dec. 31. "We have indicated we are not satisfied with a unilateral decision by the Russians to modify the terms of this understanding," he said.
Critics in Congress who have become aware of the 1995 deal, conceived in secrecy and at best only partly successful in achieving its goals, said it is symptomatic of flaws in Mr. Gore's approach to handling relations with Russia.
President Clinton entrusted his vice president with an extraordinary degree of authority to manage one of the most important accounts in American diplomacy. Mr. Gore used that authority to pursue a broad agenda on issues from arms control to the environment to cooperation in space.
Much of that work was carried out in a channel known as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which was established in 1993 and which met twice a year until Boris N. Yeltsin, the former president, dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin in March 1998. Mr. Gore has cited the work of the commission as among his signal achievements as vice president and an important part of his resume for the presidency.
Some critics in Congress, as well as Governor George W. Bush's foreign policy advisers, say that Mr. Gore placed too much faith in his close personal relationship with Mr. Chernomyrdin, and that this led Mr. Gore to turn a blind eye to strong evidence of corruption by Mr. Chernomyrdin and associates, who appear to have profited handsomely from the rapid privatization of Soviet state enterprises.
Mr. Bush himself touched on this criticism during his debate Wednesday night with Mr. Gore when he said in a discussion of Washington's world role:
"Take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here's some I.M.F. money. It ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket, and others'. And yet we played like there was reform." (Mr. Chernomyrdin had been out of office several months when the funds from the International Monetary Fund reached Moscow, and an I.M.F. investigation found no conclusive evidence that he personally profited from the loans.)
The vice president and his advisers respond that the Gore-Chernomyrdin channel produced scores of agreements on a wide range of topics in part because of the strong bond between the men. Mr. Gore was fully aware of the allegations of corruption against Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Fuerth said, but he also believed that the prime minister was dedicated to reform and had the clout to cut through the bureaucracy.
"How else do you talk to leaders about difficult issues unless you have developed a relationship with them?" Mr. Fuerth asked. "The bureaucratic approach can take you only so far."
The vice president's office has produced a catalog of Mr. Gore's achievements in Russia policy: the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, trade deals on steel and poultry, diversion of Russian weapons scientists to peaceful pursuits, increased cooperation on corruption and money-laundering, joint efforts on the international space station.
But critics respond that Mr. Gore's eagerness to pile up agreements led, in some cases, to bad deals.
For example, E. Wayne Merry, former director of the political section of the American Embassy in Moscow, said in Congressional hearings earlier this year that the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission had required hundreds of hours of busywork to pad its list of achievements, racking up piles of "taxpayer-supplied evidence of American good will regardless of Russian performance, honesty or even desires."
And the 1995 accord, which essentially exempted Russia from American sanctions on arms deliveries to Iran, emboldened Moscow to ignore other agreements, particularly on sales of missile and nuclear technology to Iran, according to Gordon C. Oehler, who directed the Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency until he retired in 1998.
"It was one more of these strange deals that Gore and Chernomyrdin had that were kept from people," said Mr. Oehler, now a vice president with the Science Applications International Corporation in La Jolla, Calif. "If this had been disclosed to Congress, the committees would have gone berserk, absolutely. But the larger problem is, if you have these under-the-table deals that give the Russians permission to do these things, it gives the signal that it's O.K. to do other things."
The 1995 arms agreement between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin was just one of more than a dozen during a three-day meeting in Moscow, the fifth session of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, but it was not included in a list of accords released by the White House.
Still, the men mentioned it in passing at a news conference at the end of their meeting. Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Iran accord was the product of "difficult and lengthy talks." Mr. Gore indicated that deliveries of conventional arms to Iran would end within a few years.
"This is significant, very significant," Mr. Gore said at the news conference. "I would say that this has been resolved in a specific, mutually agreed fashion that does not leave any uncertainty or open ends that would create problems."
But no specific reference was made to a 12-paragraph document the men had signed, where the final paragraph reads, "This aide-memoire, as well as the attached annexes, will remain strictly confidential."
Such undertakings between executive branch officials do not carry the force of law or treaty, which require legislative ratification; either party can unilaterally withdraw from executive agreements without notice or penalty, an aide to Mr. Gore said.
A copy of the aide-memoire and related classified documents were provided to The Times by a government official concerned about the proliferation of Russian arms to Iran.
Administration officials briefed Congress on the outlines of the aide-memoire in closed hearings in July 1995 but did not disclose its details, specifically the American promise not to seek sanctions as a result of the arms deliveries.
The Gore-McCain law provides for waivers of its penalties, but the administration did not seek a waiver from Congress because, in its view, the types and numbers of military hardware Russia planned to send did not cross the threshold of sanctionable items.
The older contracts for conventional weapons that Russia was allowed to fulfill dated to 1989 and were intended to help Iran rearm after the devastating Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88.
A classified annex specifies the weapons Russia was committed to supply to Iran: one Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine, 160 T-72 tanks, 600 armored personnel carriers, numerous anti-ship mines, cluster bombs and a variety of long-range guided torpedoes and other munitions for the submarine and the tanks. Russia had already provided Iran with fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles and other armored vehicles.
The weapons are not the top of the Russian lines, but they are among the best in the region and bolstered a military force in Iran that continues to grow in quality and quantity.
Russia was to sign no new arms contracts with Iran and was to deliver no weapons other than those specified.
The United States, for its part, would "take appropriate steps to avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law with respect to the completion of the transfers," the document states.
The United States also said it would help Russia join international arms-trading organizations and would take steps to remove Russia from the list of countries ineligible to receive American arms or technical assistance.
The United States would also help Russia's weapons industry find customers. And the United States would ensure that its own customers in the Middle East would not transfer American-made weapons to countries on the borders of Russia. Moscow was concerned that Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern buyers of American arms were sending some on to Islamic fundamentalists in the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union.
Members of Congress have repeatedly complained about Russian arms shipments to Iran and demanded that the administration seek sanctions against Moscow.
In June 1993 Senator McCain, alarmed at reports that Russia was delivering Kilo-class submarines to Iran without a forceful response from the administration, introduced amendments to Gore-McCain to stiffen sanctions against Russia for such sales. The amendments failed.
Because of frustration with the administration's apparent unwillingness to penalize Russia, Congress amended Gore-McCain in 1996. The new law required sanctions for any supplier of arms to nations that sponsor terrorism, not just weapons sales that upset regional stability, as specified in the 1992 law. But the new law has not been invoked, administration officials said, because sanctions laws cannot be applied retroactively.
From 1997 on, members of the House Armed Services Committee on several occasions questioned Pentagon and State Department officials about the submarine and why the administration was not taking stronger measures to stop delivery.
And just last week, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Near East and South Asia subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at a hearing that the administration had failed to inform Congress of confidential deals with Russia and had looked the other way as Russia sent significant quantities of arms to Iran and elsewhere.
He said Russia has blatantly violated the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement and other pacts and continues to be a major sponsor of Iran's arms buildup.
"You've seemed to conclude your own sidebar agreements and the development continues to take place with alarming speed and progress," Senator Brownback lectured Robert J. Einhorn, the State Department's top nonproliferation official. "The problem has grown decidedly worse, and the world is a far more dangerous place because of that."
Mr. Einhorn acknowledged that the United States has expressed its "frustration and disappointment" to Moscow over the continued sales to Tehran. But he said the extent of the sales was classified and could not be discussed in an open hearing.
In January Secretary Albright sent a classified message to Igor S. Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, complaining that Moscow was not abiding by terms of the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement. Russia has not provided a required accounting of the arms shipped to Iran and those still in the pipeline, she complained, and she referred to a statement by Mr. Ivanov that it would take a decade for Russia to complete its weapons contracts with Iran.
She said the administration had lived up to its end of the bargain, and she warned, "Continued transfers to Iran could be subject to sanctions under relevant U.S. laws."
"Russia's unilateral decision to continue delivering arms to Iran beyond the Dec. 31 deadline will unnecessarily complicate our relationship," Dr. Albright wrote.
The same week that Dr. Albright's message was sent to Mr. Ivanov, Russia delivered the first of five heavy military helicopters to Tehran, according to Itar-Tass, the official Russian news agency. The helicopters are not on the list of permitted military deliveries contained in the annex to the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal.
The day after Dr. Albright's message, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, the Russian defense minister, met with a top Iranian security official and pledged to maintain Russia's military ties to Tehran, according to the Russian Interfax news service.
"Russia intends to maintain the dynamics of its bilateral ties with Iran," Marshal Sergeyev said, "in the military, military-technical, scientific-technical and energy fields."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE INTERNAL DEBATE;
Some House Democrats Want Gore to Be Tougher on G.O.P.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Seeds of concern over Vice President Al Gore's campaign appear to be developing among House Democrats, some of whom said today that they were disappointed with his performance Wednesday night in the second presidential debate.
The vice president, they said, missed opportunities to strike back at the Republican-controlled Congress and to help the Democrats regain control of the House. 
 With an eye on independent voters, Mr. Gore has been speaking above the partisan fray. On the campaign trail, he tends to avoid direct references to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whom he calls "my opponent," or to the Republicans, whom he calls "the other side." He rarely blames them for foiling administration initiatives and he rarely tries to rally audiences to send local Democrats to Washington.
To some degree, Gore supporters see the vice president as tripped up either way. His performance in the first debate with Mr. Bush was faulted as too aggressive, a criticism he tried to respond to with Wednesday's lower-keyed approach. But now he is perceived as having overcompensated, raising concern among House Democrats that he is not doing enough to help the party, even as such concern detracts from a serious evaluation of Mr. Bush.
As Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat, put it: "Gore was told by the world not to be aggressive. But now, if he's not aggressive, that's the criticism. The other guy can do whatever he pleases."
Indeed, some Democrats on Capitol Hill said today that in Wednesday's debate, Mr. Gore seemed to take the notion of bipartisanship too far. They worried that if he does not paint differences more starkly, Democrats will stay in the minority.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said, "I think Al Gore should have been a little more aggressive."
Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, said, "I would have been tougher."
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said Mr. Gore's strengths were evident when he went into details on health care, education and economic policy issues. But, Mr. Kucinich said, "At the beginning, he was tentative, and he's not at his best when he's tentative."
Representative Carrie P. Meek, Democrat of Florida, said: "In terms of substance, Gore did very well. But I was a little disappointed in his assertiveness. I think he should have nailed Governor Bush more. But he was constrained and just didn't go for it."
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said Democrats were not abandoning Mr. Gore but wanted him to remember it was Democrats whose votes for a balanced budget in 1993 -- helping to bring about the economic boom -- cost the party the House in 1994.
"We don't want him to be defensive about the Congress, because we have taken the hits, paid the price and brought about the prosperity that's out there," Mr. McDermott said. "We want the credit. And we do better when he does better."
Surveys show that voters loathe the partisanship that has consumed Capitol Hill. And some voters are content with divided government, thinking that Washington could inflict as little damage as possible if it was gridlocked. On the Republican side, Governor Bush has severed himself from the Beltway battles.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said bipartisanship was important. "It is important to tell voters -- as he is, and as I am -- that if we win, we will try to operate in a much more bipartisan way than the present group," he said.
And he said Mr. Gore had done much to unify the party by promoting targeted tax cuts and paying down the debt that most Democrats were comfortable with, unlike Mr. Bush, whose tax-cut proposal has been spurned by House Republicans.
But, Mr. Gephardt said, feelings run deep among House Democrats that they had made political sacrifices and did not want to be forgotten. "There's real heartfelt agreement among all the members that we paid a price for this, this is our accomplishment, we were a part of this and we aren't going to give it up."
Still, he said he doubted in today's multimedia environment, where voters get information about candidates from a variety of sources, that political endorsements meant much.
"I don't think we can help him and he can't help us," Mr. Gephardt said. "In today's world, these kind of endorsements don't amount to a thing."

HEADLINE: After the Second Debate, a New Scorecard

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George W. Bush and Al Gore have been so enthusiastic about the strong economy that they have overlooked the weakening economic reality all around them (front page, Oct. 12).
Voters may be better off today than eight years ago, but not compared with the last 6 to 12 months. So far this year, there are clear signs that the economy is slowing. The stock market has had a sharp decline. Some interest rates are higher. Inflationary concerns in oil and gas are a reality. A powerful dollar is hurting domestic output and skewing the huge trade deficit. 
 One would hope that the presidential candidates in the third debate will finally get around to focusing on the current business and financial trends, which could be the main domestic issue for the next president's first year in office.

HEADLINE: THE WARSHIP EXPLOSION: YEMEN;
Navy's Visits to Risky Port Sought Better Ties to Yemen

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Despite the known risks of terrorism in Yemen, American ships like the destroyer Cole have made refueling stops there 12 times in recent months as part of an American strategy to improve ties with the Arab country.
After consultations with the White House and the State Department, the Pentagon decided last year that Navy ships would refuel in Yemen's deep sea port of Aden, at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Security precautions were taken on each occasion, Pentagon officials said today, adding that there had been no specific intelligence warning of a threat to the Cole when it visited the port. 
 Yemen, an impoverished nation of some 16 million people, refused to join the allies against Iraq during the gulf war and has been a haven to international terrorist groups, who operate and train in its hinterlands, according to the current State Department report on terrorism.
"We have been working to improve our relations with Yemen for some time," Adm. Vern Clark, chief of naval operations, said today. "And I'm sure that that was at the heart of the motivation" of commanders in the region when they established refueling operations at Aden, he said.
American officials said today that the budding relationship with Yemen had recently seemed to be bearing fruit. In April, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, visited Washington and met with President Clinton. And as allied forces in the region have intercepted ships accused of violating the sanctions against Iraq, Yemen has allowed them to bring the offending vessels to the port at Aden, another step that distanced Yemen from Iraq, and angered the Iraqis.
In recent days, however, Yemen's government had helped organize large demonstrations against Israel and the United States in Aden, in the capital, Sana, and other cities, residents said.
Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the recently retired Pentagon regional commander for the Middle East, pressed the decision to brave the mixed security situation in Yemen, Pentagon officials said.
"In the last couple of years, Yemen has been doing a better job trying to control terrorism," said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. "We obviously felt that it was safe to take our ships there." All ships in the area prepare and follow a detailed security plan against possible terrorist attack, Pentagon officials said.
"I don't think we missed any specific threats," Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said. "There are general threats in the region, and we understand that. And that's the reason why we have such precautionary measures we take."
The ship came into the port at the second-highest level of alert, Admiral Clark said, and the sailors had undergone security training before this mission. Admiral Clark refused to discuss details of the security measures involved.
Officials said that security training includes precautions against terrorist attacks from small boats, but that in this case the boat appeared to be part of the refueling operation itself and was not suspect.
The Cole was the 12th ship to visit Yemen, and the third since May, officials said.
Even though the State Department dropped Yemen from its list of terrorist nations 10 years ago when North Yemen merged with formerly Marxist South Yemen, diplomats say the Yemeni government is too weak to control radical groups from Palestine, Egypt, Libya and Algeria.
Mr. Saleh, the former army general who is Yemen's president, denied that terrorists were responsible for today's explosion. "Yemen does not have any terrorist elements, and there is no relationship between this and what is happening in the occupied territories," Mr. Saleh told CNN, referring to Gaza and the West Bank.
But Daniel Benjamin, an anti-terrorist expert who recently resigned from the National Security Council, said, "Yemen is a troubled spot because central authority is limited largely to control of a few major centers." He added, "There is no shortage of bad actors who would like nothing better than to attack the United States."
The groups stationed in and around Yemen include Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and sympathizers or members of other international groups like the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, al-Gama'at al-Islaymiyya and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group, according to the State Department terrorism report.
Other experts suggested that Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was behind the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, comes from an ethnically Yemeni family and has influence there, as does Iraq. The American ships refueling in Aden, which are part of the Fifth Fleet, largely help enforce the sanctions against Iraq.
"It's really too early to speculate, but you have to ask who is angry enough at us to attack an American target, and you may pick the Iraqis," said Jerry Bremer, a former State Department terrorist expert who this year chaired a national commission on terrorism.
A land of arid, rocky deserts and remote mountains, Yemen has existed in its present form only since 1990, when the two Yemens that emerged from Turkish and British colonial domination in the 19th and 20th centuries were united.
The union has been uneasy, and a civil war in 1994 that ended in victory for the new national government in Sana left deep schisms, with tribal fiefdoms in the hinterland that have served as strongholds for the Islamic terrorist groups. Armed groups have made targets of American, British and other foreign visitors and institutions, including tourists who began returning in the mid-1990's to explore the remains of ancient civilizations.
Without the oil resources of its richer neighbors, Yemen has sent many thousands of its people to work in richer and less populous Arab states, often manning their militaries. Many Yemenis also fought with the mujahedeen against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's.

HOME DEPOT DECLINES 28% ON WEAKER PROFIT

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The home improvement giant Home Depot said yesterday that it would miss its earnings targets in the third quarter and the full year, prompting the company's shares to fall more than 28 percent. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell $13.81, to $35.13. Analysts said Home Depot, like most retailers in the United States, had been hurt by an economic slowdown linked to rising interest rates. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, said it expected to earn 28 cents a share in the third quarter and $1.16 or $1.17 a share for the year. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected 31 cents in the quarter and $1.25 for the year.

Work Starting for Plant

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
Work is to start soon on an $8 million project to improve truck and rail access to a major industrial plant in Buffalo. The work is the final step in a two-year, state-aided effort to help the operation remain viable and increase its 860-employee work force, New York State officials say.
The plant, run by Outokumpu Copper Americas, which makes copper and brass products, has been involved in a $15 million program to upgrade its machinery and to add equipment to manufacture a new line of parts used in connectors for electrical wiring in products ranging from cars to computers. 
 The state's Department of Transportation has agreed to finance $2.4 million of the cost of the road and rail improvements, and the Empire State Development Corporation has provided $500,000 in grants to help finance the plant's upgrading and to train workers to use the new machinery, officials said.

Zap! Rat-a-Tat-Tat! Ping! Ah, 'Tis Art Aborning

 BODY:
Are computer games our era's new art form? And what is an art form, anyway? Henry Jenkins, the director of the comparative media studies program at M.I.T., raised these and other questions in his article "Art Form for the Digital Age," which appeared in the September/October 2000 issue of Technology Review. Here are excerpts.
Last year, Americans bought over 215 million computer and video games. That's more than two games per household. The video game industry made almost as much money from gross domestic income as Hollywood. 
 So are video games a massive drain on our income, time and energy? A new form of "cultural pollution," as one United States senator described them? The "nightmare before Christmas," in the words of another? Are games teaching our children to kill, as countless Op-Ed pieces have warned?
No. Computer games are art -- a popular art, an emerging art, a largely unrecognized art, but art nevertheless . . .
The time has come to take games seriously as an important new popular art shaping the aesthetic sensibility of the 21st century. I will admit that discussing the art of video games conjures up comic images: tuxedo-clad and jewel-bedecked patrons admiring the latest Streetfighter, middle-aged academics pontificating on the impact of Cubism on Tetris, bleeps and zaps disrupting our silent contemplation at the Guggenheim. Such images tell us more about our contemporary notion of art -- as arid and stuffy, as the property of an educated and economic elite, as cut off from everyday experience -- than they tell us about games. . . .
In 1925, the leading literary and arts critic Gilbert Seldes took a radical approach to the aesthetics of popular culture in a treatise titled "The Seven Lively Arts." Adopting what was then a controversial position, Seldes argued that America's primary contributions to artistic expression had come through emerging forms of popular culture such as jazz, the Broadway musical, the Hollywood cinema and the comic strip. While these arts have gained cultural respectability over the past 75 years, each was disreputable when Seldes staked out his position.
Readers then were skeptical of Seldes's claims about cinema in particular for many of the same reasons that contemporary critics dismiss games -- they were suspicious of cinema's commercial motivations and technological origins, concerned about Hollywood's appeals to violence and eroticism, and insistent that cinema had not yet produced works of lasting value. Seldes, on the other hand, argued that cinema's popularity demanded that we reassess its aesthetic qualities. . . .
Much of what Seldes told us about the silent cinema seems remarkably apt for thinking about games. Silent cinema, he argued, was an art of expressive movement. He valued the speed and dynamism of D. W. Griffith's last-minute races to the rescue, the physical grace of Chaplin's pratfalls and the ingenuity of Buster Keaton's engineering feats. Games also depend upon an art of expressive movement, with characters defined through their distinctive ways of propelling themselves through space, and successful products structured around a succession of spectacular stunts and predicaments. Will future generations look back on Lara Croft doing battle with a pack of snarling wolves as the 21st-century equivalent of Lillian Gish making her way across the ice floes in Way Down East? . . .
Seldes wrote at a moment when cinema was maturing as an expressive medium and filmmakers were striving to enhance the emotional experience of going to the movies -- making a move from mere spectacle towards character and consequence. It remains to be seen whether games can make a similar transition. Contemporary games can pump us full of adrenaline, they can make us laugh, but they have not yet provoked us to tears. And many have argued that, since games don't have characters of human complexity or stories that stress the consequences of our actions, they cannot achieve the status of true art.
Here, we must be careful not to confuse the current transitional state of an emerging medium with its full potential. As I visit game companies, I see some of the industry's best minds struggling with this question and see strong evidence that the games released over the next few years will bring us closer and closer to the quality of characterization we have come to expect from other forms of popular narrative. . . .
In the end, games may not take the same path as cinema. Game designers will almost certainly develop their own aesthetic principles as they confront the challenge of balancing our competing desires for storytelling and interactivity. It remains to be seen whether games can provide players the freedom they want and still provide an emotionally satisfying and thematically meaningful shape to the experience. Some of the best games -- Tetris comes to mind -- have nothing to do with storytelling. For all we know, the future art of games may look more like architecture or dance than cinema. . . .
Early film critics played vital functions in documenting innovations and speculating about their potential. Computer games are in a similar phase. We have not had time to codify what experienced game designers know, and we have certainly not yet established a canon of great works that might serve as exemplars. There have been real creative accomplishments in games, but we haven't really sorted out what they are and why they matter. . . .
The problem with most contemporary games isn't that they are violent but that they are banal, formulaic and predictable. . . . We should instead look at games as an emerging art form -- one that does not simply simulate violence but increasingly offers new ways to understand violence -- and talk about how to strike a balance between this form of expression and social responsibility.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Jumped 0.9% in September, Mostly Because of Oil

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
American manufacturers were able to charge surprisingly high prices for their goods in September, the government reported yesterday, but most analysts said the increases were probably not a harbinger of broader inflation. Investors seemed to agree, as major stock indexes rose.
The data on pricing and a report showing strong retail sales point to the resilience of the American economy, despite two years of rising oil prices and a six-week spell of declining stock prices, economists said. 
 The Producer Price Index of finished goods -- a measure of what American buyers, be they consumers or companies, pay for domestically made products -- rose 0.9 percent last month, its largest increase since February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
About two-thirds of the rise came from the energy sector, in which prices tend to be driven by a global market and do not generally reflect month-to-month shifts in American consumer demand. An increase in car and truck prices was the second most important cause for the unexpected jump in the index, and initial data for October suggest that vehicle prices are likely to decline.
As a result, the report, said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan, "is not as alarming as the headline number -- the general trends are still pretty tame."
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, added, "I think the bottom line is that inflation is going to stay close to zero."
Prices for food, alcoholic beverages and cleaning products also rose, when compared with August and adjusted for normal seasonal variations, according to the report. The cost of glassware, electronic equipment and women's clothing fell.
Economists pay particular attention to the so-called core index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices. It rose 0.3 percent last month -- also higher than expectations.
Analysts said, however, that the price index and the 0.9 percent increase in retail sales in September were unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's policy. At its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates at their current level but noted that the risk of inflation remained higher than the risk of a downturn. Since that meeting, import prices have dropped and some high-profile companies, have warned of earnings shortfalls.
Investors seemed to see little in the reports to suggest an impending rate increase, and many stocks finished higher for the first time since last week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after having fallen 7 percent since Oct. 6, regained about half of its losses yesterday, closing at 1,374.17, up 44.39 points.
In part, the lack of inflation fears stems from a belief that consumer spending will slow in the final months of the year, thanks to high oil prices and tepid stock market gains.
So far, though, there is little evidence that people are pulling back. Retail sales also rose at their fastest pace since February and roughly 50 percent more than analysts had expected. Nearly every sector saw an increase, according to the Department of Commerce.
Consumer surveys, like the University of Michigan's, have shown that many Americans expect gas prices to come down from their current level, which are the highest in a decade but still lower than they were in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when adjusted for inflation.
Last month gasoline prices rose 9 percent from their August level in the producer index. Most other energy costs continued to jump as well.
The biggest surprise in the report was the increase in the cost of passenger vehicles, even though many automakers have recently announced rebates. But analysts said the rise of about 1.5 percent appears be to a statistical blip.
For starters, prices had fallen in previous months despite growing sales, and this month's increase simply brings vehicle costs closer to the level of earlier this year, said Dean Baker, the co-director for the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington.
In addition, Ford Motor and General Motors, the world's two largest car companies, have offered many new rebates in the first half of October, according to Deutsche Banc. That suggests that vehicle costs will not rise again this month.
The Producer Price Index, which includes many goods bought by distributors, is often a leading indicator of the more closely watched Consumer Price Index. The comparison is imperfect, however, because the consumer index also covers services. It will be released next week.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEW MEXICO;
Taking Aid and a Message to a Swing State

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO PUEBLO, N.M., Oct. 13

 BODY:
Appropriately attired for the day in bolo ties, two cabinet secretaries came here today to announce a new program that is intended to make it easier for American Indians to secure mortgages.
The two, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, insisted their visit was purely routine and nonpolitical, and said they had been planning it for almost nine months. 
 But implicit in their message to two dozen Indian leaders and explicit in what several said they heard was a reminder that the Clinton administration has served them well and that a Gore administration would continue the same policies to help Indians share in the economic prosperity that has eluded them.
"None of us knows how this is going to come out," Mr. Summers said of the presidential election in 26 days. "But I can speak for Secretary Cuomo and myself that this administration has a commitment and each of us a responsibility to our departments, leaving an institution that is focused on these issues."
If clearly received and acted upon on Nov. 7, the message could play some role in determining which candidate -- Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- wins New Mexico's five electoral votes. Home to some 65,000 Indians, about two-thirds of whom are old enough to vote, New Mexico is one of the few swing states in the Rocky Mountain West, and polls show the presidential race up for grabs.
In that case, the Indian vote, which generally accounts for 3 to 4 percent of the turnout, could have a strong bearing on the outcome.
"It's very much a tossup in the state right now," said F. Chris Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico. "The Indian vote is quite small, but in a close election it could make a difference."
Some of the Indian leaders said they had grave concerns over who might win the White House. Raymond Gachupin, the tribal leader of the Jemez Pueblo, said Indian voters in New Mexico typically favor Democrats, but younger members of the tribe who may be more educated than their parents tend to vote on a candidate's position, rather than party.
"We're very concerned about continuity after the Clinton administration," Mr. Gachupin said. "Under President Clinton we have seen interest in Indian country, and we feel Vice President Gore has been very involved in this. So in a real sense, we're feeling that he would continue the momentum here.
"But Bush is a real concern for us," Mr. Gachupin added. "Some time ago he said Native American issues should be dealt with at the state level, rather than the federal level, and I know he changed his position now that he has more education. But for many of us, the first impression is the lasting impression."
Like Indians in other states, many of those living in New Mexico have suffered severe poverty, reflected in their crumbling houses and high unemployment rates.
The 4,500 members of the Santo Domingo Pueblo are typical. Living on 102 square miles of windblown scrub desert between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, they have a per capita annual income of $5,217, well below the poverty level, and an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent, compared with 3.9 for the nation as a whole. Their principle sources of income have remained the same for centuries, through ranching, farming and jewelry making.
One of their lingering problems has been adequate housing, with many houses too old to rehabilitate and many accommodating several families. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Summers today walked through one house in the village that Indian leaders said was built 600 years ago and was occupied as recently as 1997.
As part of a larger initiative to build homes and increase homeownership in poor areas, the Clinton administration has helped the tribes through a variety of housing and lending programs, and today's announcement was the latest, a way for Indians to cut through red tape to secure a mortgage and gain access to capital more easily. While a record 67 percent of all Americans now own their own homes, barely a third of Indians do.
In his remarks to the Indian leaders, Mr. Summers gave partial credit for the success of one program benefiting Indians to two leading Republicans, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma.
"And I can assure you," Mr. Summers said, "if this had been a political trip, I would not have mentioned them."

In His Own Words

 BODY:

GEORGE W. BUSH
 Remarks yesterday to auto workers in Pontiac, Mich.:
"Oil consumption is increasing; production is dropping; imports of foreign oil are rising. Yet Vice President Gore's administration has failed to act. As a result, America, more than ever, is at the mercy of foreign governments and cartels. 
 On the Clinton-Gore watch, the American government has lost credibility with OPEC nations, including our gulf war allies. We fought a war in defense of some of these countries; yet we are unable to convince them to maintain an adequate and stable supply of oil.
On the Clinton-Gore watch, Saddam Hussein's Iraq has become a major supplier of oil to America. This means that one of our worst enemies is gaining more and more control over our country's economic future. The current crisis in the Middle East underscores the danger of American reliance on Saddam Hussein's oil.
Several weeks ago, just weeks before the election, Vice President Gore called for releasing oil from America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I strongly disagreed, because the strategic reserve is meant for times of war or a major disruption in oil supplies. It is a petroleum reserve, not a political reserve.
Every barrel released today is one less barrel available to protect us against threats to our security, threats that are becoming more vivid with this week's turmoil and violence in the Middle East. Vice President Gore called for this release and he should take responsibility for what has occurred."

HEADLINE: First Lady Admits Error; Lazio Calls It Crime

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY with RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she took "full responsibility" for her campaign's improper solicitation of political contributions last month, but insisted that it was unintentional and isolated and would not be repeated.
Speaking to reporters here, and earlier in the day in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had provided her campaign with an official government list of 1,400 visitors to the White House that was used to solicit contributions for her Senate candidacy. Mrs. Clinton said five of the people on the list contributed a total of $225 to her campaign, and the money was being returned. 
 "This was a mix-up," Mrs. Clinton said after speaking to about 150 people at the Autumnwood Senior Center here. "I take full responsibility for it."
Mrs. Clinton said many of the names on the list were those of journalists who had attended functions at the White House. The issue came to light within her campaign, she said, when reporters called to inquire about solicitation letters they had received. If her intention had been to raise funds in an underhanded manner, she suggested, reporters would not have been tipped off in such an obvious way.
"No campaign would deliberately solicit the press with any hope of any kind of return, so we moved to remedy that," Mrs. Clinton said in Manhattan.
Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, said her use of government property for political purposes, no matter how tiny the return, was illegal. He said the activity fit a pattern of fund-raising improprieties, including the use of the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House by people who had contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. In 1997, Congressional Republicans conducted an inquiry into President Clinton's fund-raising for his re-election campaign, contending that a White House database of names had been used by the president and the Democratic National Committee to solicit contributions. The Democrats denied the charges.
"I think that they believe there are two laws -- one that applies to them and one that applies to the rest of us," Mr. Lazio said of the Clintons after visiting a high school near Syracuse. "In this particular case, this isn't just something that is improper, this is something that is illegal."
Mr. Lazio suggested that Mrs. Clinton should be prosecuted, "the same thing that happens when any of the rest of us commit a crime, if in fact that's what happened here."
His campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, issued an even harsher statement.
"New Yorkers are disgusted by this abuse of the public trust," Mr. Dal Col said, "and they will not elect a Senate candidate whose campaign has so brazenly broken the law in pursuit of campaign funds. What's next? Auctioning off the White House china or selling roses from the Rose Garden out on Pennsylvania Avenue?"
Federal law generally forbids the use of government resources for overtly political purposes, but the lines are vague, and legal sanctions against candidates in such cases are unusual.
Mrs. Clinton said she did not consider the solicitations illegal and instead used words like "error," "misstep," "mistake" and "mix-up" to describe how the government list ended up in the hands of her campaign staff members.
"The best I can tell you is that I have passed on names of people who have been involved in political activities," she said, "supporting various candidates, events I have attended, or the president has attended, and there was a misstep and that list of names was included in what I passed on to the campaign."
Mrs. Clinton said she did not regard the solicitations as an issue in the race, a position supported by some of the Buffalo residents who came to hear her speak today.
"You tell me who is so clean that they have done nothing wrong in raising money," said Loretta Hurney, 71, adding that she intended to vote for Mrs. Clinton because of her promises to revive the upstate economy and protect Social Security and Medicare. "They all take money from anybody."
During her news conference at the senior center, Mrs. Clinton said she was not put off by the rowdy reception she received Thursday during a rally in Manhattan in support of Israel. She was loudly booed by some in the crowd because of her previous statements of support for an independent Palestinian state. The rally was in response to the recent outbursts of violence in the Middle East.
Mrs. Clinton said she understood that "feelings are extremely high," and she defended the attention she and Mr. Lazio have devoted to the Middle East in recent weeks.
"This is a matter that has clear ramifications for the position of senator," Mrs. Clinton said. "I see the responsibilities for Israel's security and for America's relationship with Israel, and our support for Israel, as central to what has to happen in our foreign policy in years to come."
Mrs. Clinton said she was not worried that her comments as a Senate candidate might be misconstrued or manipulated in the Middle East because she is also first lady.
"For the first part of my campaign I was clearly wearing two hats," she said. "I had continuing responsibilities I carried out not only with respect to the Middle East but with other issues because of my position as first lady. Clearly, in my mind, over time I have moved much more positively to demonstrate what I would do as a senator. And where I have disagreed, I have made those disagreements known. I think that is appropriate. And I believe that most people understand that I am now speaking for myself."

THE RUNNING MATES
 
LIEBERMAN BOWS OUT OF SENATE DEBATE
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman is still running for re-election in Connecticut, but he will not be debating his opponent for United States Senate, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of Waterbury. Mr. Lieberman had agreed to participate in a debate before becoming Vice President Al Gore's running mate, but had put the event on hold since joining the big ticket.
Late last month, he said that voters who wanted to see him debate could watch him with Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate. Yesterday, an aide said that Mr. Lieberman would not participate in any debate in the Connecticut race. 
 Mr. Lieberman has two more weeks to decide whether to drop from the Senate race and allow another Democrat to run. Should he stay and win both, he would have to give up his Senate seat and a successor would be chosen by Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican.
At a news conference last night, Mr. Giordano said Mr. Lieberman should drop out. "If you don't have an hour and a half to spend with the constituents of Connecticut, then get out of the race," he said. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)

RULING ON PUERTO RICO VOTING IS OVERTURNED
A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that residents of Puerto Rico could not vote in presidential elections unless the island territory became a state or the Constitution was amended. The ruling overturns a lower court decision that said Puerto Rico's 2.4 million voters had the right to cast presidential ballots. (AP)
 
THE CANDIDATES
 
BUSH CRITICIZES GORE IN CAR COUNTRY
Gov. George W. Bush strongly criticized Vice President Al Gore in Pontiac, Mich., yesterday as an enemy of the automobile whose concern for the environment trumped the economic interests of many people in Michigan, a crucial swing state. Mr. Bush rummaged through Mr. Gore's voting record and his 1992 book on the environment, "Earth in the Balance," to make his points, and noted the vice president's tie-breaking vote in the Senate in 1993 to raise gasoline taxes.
"In speeches, he calls auto workers his friends," Mr. Bush said. "But in his book, he declares that the engines that power your cars are his enemy." Mr. Bush went on: "The internal combustion engine, Mr. Gore wrote, is, and I quote, 'a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we're ever likely to confront.' Unlike Al Gore, I don't consider the internal combustion engine a threat to the future of mankind. I consider it a remarkable testimony to American ingenuity."
Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said that accusation was wholly unfounded. Mr. Gore's campaign proposals included no new energy taxes, Ms. Spell said, and the incentives he had outlined for the manufacture of vehicles not powered solely by gasoline were meant to benefit, not punish, the auto industry.

Leslie Kish, an authority on scientific population sampling who predicted President Harry S. Truman's upset victory over Thomas E. Dewey in 1948, died on Oct. 7 in a hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 90 and lived in Ann Arbor.
Professor Kish and the influence of his teachings "fundamentally changed how the world collects information about itself," said Robert M. Groves, a professor of survey methodology at the Universities of Michigan and Maryland, and a former student of Professor Kish, who taught at the University of Michigan. 
 Professor Kish developed sampling methods that are employed now in censuses as well as in political surveys and polls. The basic task of sampling is to draw a representative sample from a universe of possible observations.
"He took a set of theoretical developments in statistics that occurred in the late 1930's and translated them to applications in hundreds of social science research projects throughout the world," Professor Groves said.
Another former student, Martin R. Frankel, a professor of statistics and computer information systems at Baruch College of the City University of New York, said Professor Kish had found applications for the new ideas in statistics "in fields where surveys were emerging as a way of looking at things." As examples he mentioned economic behavior surveys and a study of the use of health insurance.
In the 1930's most pollsters used quota sampling, in which interviewers are asked to find and question certain numbers of people who match various profiles. But a small group of American statisticians was beginning to use probability sampling, in which interviewees are chosen by a random process outside the interviewer's control. By the 1940's there was debate on which method should become the standard.
Professor Kish was instrumental in getting probability sampling recognized, at Michigan and elsewhere, as the type of sampling to be used in surveys involving human behavior.
The value of the probability sampling methods that Professor Kish worked out was shown in the 1948 presidential election.
He and colleagues at Michigan carried out a probability sample of fewer than 1,000 American households. At the time, news media and commercial polls were saying that Dewey would win easily. But the Michigan sample indicated that Truman was slightly ahead.
Truman won. Probability sampling is now the accepted method of scientific sampling.
Professor Kish was also an early advocate of rolling samples. That is, the repeated use of separate sample surveys -- a different sample each time -- at regular intervals, that cumulate into very large studies. That technique is is just beginning to be used in the United States.
In addition, Professor Kish wrote "Survey Sampling" (1965, Wiley), which is still in print and widely used.
He was on the Michigan faculty from 1951 until his formal retirement, as a professor of sociology, in 1981. He was a co-founder in 1947 of the Institute for Social Research at the university.
Professor Kish was born in Poprad in what is now Slovakia. He came to the United States with his family in 1926, settled in the Bronx and went on to receive a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York and a master's degree and his doctorate, both from Michigan.
In 1937 he joined the International Brigade to fight Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He saw action in a Hungarian battalion was wounded and returned to the United States in 1939.
He is survived by his wife, the former Rhea Kuleske; two daughters, Carla Kish of Silver Spring, Md., and Andrea Kish of St. Paul; and a sister, Magda Bondy of White Plains.

HEADLINE: Blaming Immigrants

 BODY:
Next time you are stuck in traffic, blame an immigrant. That seems to be the message of a deplorable advertising campaign by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an advocacy group that seeks to restrict immigration. FAIR's broadcast and print ads highlight the ills associated with suburban sprawl, then point to immigration as the underlying culprit. FAIR ran anti-sprawl commercials earlier this year in Iowa and South Carolina during the primary season, and is now concentrating on the Washington D.C. area.
The notion that foreign immigrants are primarily responsible for out-of-control sprawl in American cities is absurd. Cities experiencing no population growth also grapple with excessive sprawl, which suggests that faulty urban planning, demand for new housing and tax and transportation policies are the real culprits. Immigrants, in any case, congregate in city centers and older suburbs. 
 In May The Times reported that FAIR had run ads in Michigan suggesting that Senator Spencer Abraham's pro-immigration stance would make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to attack America. Such preposterous ads clearly spring from a sense of desperation among anti-immigration groups. Stoking anti-immigration rage is not an easy task when the nation's unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent, and when the job market is eagerly seeking not only cheap labor for menial tasks but also skilled foreigners to keep the high-tech revolution in gear. Indeed, last week Congress voted to nearly double the number of visas for foreign workers with high-tech skills.
In the early 1990's, groups like FAIR and politicians like Patrick Buchanan and Pete Wilson attacked immigration as a threat to the economic security of millions of Americans. Today such claims ring hollow, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas deserves credit for altering the tenor of his party's rhetoric on immigration.
Rather than await the next economic downturn to vilify immigration once again, FAIR is trying to piggyback onto a legitimate concern to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment. Do not be surprised if it next blames immigrants for air traffic congestion and high fuel prices.

HEADLINE: Clinton Orders A New Auction Of the Airwaves

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
With growing congestion of the airwaves threatening the development of a new generation of hand-held wireless devices, President Clinton ordered the federal government today to review and then auction wide swaths of the spectrum now controlled by government agencies, as well as by private companies.
The extraordinary review is expected to lead to a fundamental reshuffling of how the spectrum is used and culminate in a huge auction in 2002 to award new licenses for companies to sell services like wireless telephones offering high-speed Internet connections. 
 The auction promises to raise tens of billions of dollars for the United States Treasury. It may also require the government to make huge payments to companies and to agencies including the Defense Department, law enforcement authorities and public safety organizations to shift their existing radio, phone and communications systems to new frequencies on the spectrum that are now underused but not considered useful for the newer hand-held devices.
Mr. Clinton's announcement follows months of dire predictions by communications experts that the United States might have already fallen behind Asian and European countries that had managed their airwaves more efficiently and had already conducted multibillion-dollar licensing auctions that would enable them to move ahead in the development of a wide array of innovative hand-held devices, from high-speed Internet telephones to wireless electronic credit cards.
Compounding the concern, officials said, is the fact that over the last five years, the information technology sector has accounted for nearly a third of the nation's economic growth. They said any slowing in the development of new broadband technology could impede future economic growth and also keep prices for new wireless services higher here than abroad.
"Time is of the essence," Mr. Clinton said today in a statement released by the White House. "If the United States does not move quickly to allocate this spectrum, there is a danger that the U.S. could lose market share in the industries of the 21st century. If we do this right, it will help ensure continued economic growth, the creation of new high-tech jobs and the creation of exciting new Internet and telecommunications services."
A report published today by the White House Council of Economic Advisers used to justify Mr. Clinton's intervention concluded that the two main industries affected by the order -- wireless communications and the Internet -- have been the linchpins in productivity improvements of the United States economy and that it was vital that steps be taken to continue to foster their development.
The report examined the economic impact of so-called third generation, or 3G, wireless technology. (First generation generally refers to analog telephones, while second generation is digital wireless services like voice mail, paging and call-waiting.)
"It is urgent that the United States follow other advanced countries in making adequate spectrum available for 3G applications," the report said. "Greater delay in providing additional spectrum licenses for high-speed applications reduces the likelihood that U.S. industry will take the lead in developing wireless technology and applications."
While officials said today that they knew of no other instance in which a president had become involved in major decisions in managing the spectrum, Mr. Clinton's involvement on one level was unsurprising because of the rising importance of the airwaves to the economy.
Spectrum has become the most valuable asset of this new economy, as important as oil and coal were in the Industrial Revolution. But the proliferation of hand-held devices and expanding consumption of the airwaves by agencies, including the Defense Department, have begun to sharply limit its availability. The volume of Internet traffic is already doubling every 100 days, and officials expect that traffic will rapidly migrate from personal computers to wireless devices like cell phones and hand-held computers, quickly crowding the airwaves.
Moreover, other countries have been moving quickly to open their airwaves to wireless companies developing third-generation devices, and in the process, their governments are reaping enormous windfalls. Two months ago, Germany concluded a spectrum auction in which six companies agreed to pay more than $46 billion for licenses. A few months before that, five companies won bids in Britain for licenses that yielded the government $35.4 billion. And Italy and Sweden are planning to hold auctions next month.
While some experts have raised concern that other countries have moved faster than the United States in encouraging wireless technology, others have said that many of those countries have a greater need to develop the technology because their wired networks are of far lower quality and afford far less coverage than networks in the United States.
For years, the Defense Department and other major consumers of the airwaves have been resistant to giving up their licenses, and today's announcement is only the first step in what is likely to be protracted negotiations over how much of the spectrum can be shared or reassigned.
Mr. Clinton's decision to conduct an accelerated review is likely to be continued by the next administration, particularly as congestion worsens.
The White House decision follows the conclusion of a world conference earlier this year in Istanbul setting out how governments should allocate frequencies for wireless hand-held devices. At the conference, the countries rejected setting any particular standards, agreeing instead to leave it to governments to choose the best available spectrum for third-generation technology. Regulators around the world have been trying to set up rules that will enable businesses and consumers to have use of the new wireless devices anywhere to perform functions like browsing the Internet and sending and receiving e-mail.
Mr. Clinton ordered the agencies to complete an interim report later this year that would provide details of how best to manage the spectrum, describing in particular detail what frequencies were available to be shared and reassigned. The Federal Communications Commission would then complete by next summer new rules for an auction that would be held in September 2002.
Administration officials said the executive memorandum issued by Mr. Clinton aimed to balance the interests of both those agencies and companies that are controlling the spectrum licenses at issue, and the wireless telecommunications and Internet companies that want them. The officials emphasized today that agencies and companies with licenses that might be reshuffled would be treated fairly and compensated for any changes.
The executive memorandum also made clear that the Defense Department would not have to surrender any licenses considered essential to national security, law enforcement or public safety.
"It's a matter of law that if an incumbent is moved, there are provisions made to continue their services," said Greg Rohde, head of the Commerce Department's national Telecommunications and Information Administration, which manages the government's use of the spectrum. "We are not looking at what we can shut down."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: IMPRESSIONS;
A Former Republican Stronghold Has Divided Loyalties These Days

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Oct. 12

 BODY:
Like his neighbors in the Floral Park section of this old Orange County city, Pete Suica, a wholesale burglar-alarm salesman, worries about the little things: how to keep his well-tended street of 1920's and 30's bungalows safe and tidy for himself and his wife, Jennifer Proctor, a nurse. But he worries about the big things, too, like the economy.
"Before the first debate, I was saying, 'You know, Gore might not be a bad choice, the way the economy's going,' " said Mr. Suica, a 42-year-old Republican with two Bush-Cheney signs in his front yard. "You say, 'Maybe . . . ' " he added, his voice trailing off. "But then I saw the debate and Gore turned me off and Bush started to impress me again." 
 After the second debate, Ms. Proctor felt that way even more. "I thought Bush did much better," she said. "He seemed more in command, in control, and Gore is just so darn irritating. I thought, if I have to listen to that man for four years, I'll go crazy. You know, it's one thing for a politician to get caught in a smart lie. But in a stupid lie, that's another thing."
A few blocks away, Samuel Romero, owner of St. Teresa's Catholic Gift Shop on Fourth Street, in a stretch of shops and food stalls catering to the city's large Hispanic population, said he was leaning the opposite way.
"I'm one of those guys that flip-flops from one party to another," said Mr. Romero, 66, who backed Ronald Reagan but four years ago voted Democratic in frustration over the California Republican Party's campaigns against illegal immigration and affirmative action, a stance that deeply troubled Mr. Romero, a proud son of immigrants from Mexico. "I said, what am I doing voting Republican? I'm not wanted. And here I am, a former Marine, all for the flag, and I'm not welcome."
This year, Mr. Romero was open to suggestion. In the summer, Gov. George W. Bush's nephew George P. Bush, who is also Mexican-American, made a campaign stop at Mr. Romero's store full of prayer books and devotional objects, and Mr. Romero was impressed. He watched both debates closely, and in the second one, on Wednesday, had a flash.
"They kept agreeing with each other," he said. "I thought maybe what we ought to do is not make a change. I like Bush. I like his easy manner. But right now, after what I watched, it's like a friendly game of badminton, and the economy is great. So why make a change?"
Evenly divided is how the conversation went this week in interviews up and down the streets of Santa Ana, smack in the heart of a county that was once a Republican stronghold. Eight years ago, this Congressional district, long represented by the fiery conservative Robert K. Dornan, voted for George Bush. But its demographics have been steadily changing, and now nearly half its residents are of Hispanic origin.
In 1996, President Clinton not only beat Bob Dole here by eight percentage points, but Loretta Sanchez, a former financial analyst from nearby Anaheim, defeated Mr. Dornan by 984 votes.
Now, Democratic and Republican lawn signs seem to sprout in rough parity amid the white iceberg roses and spindly purple-flowering sage of the solid middle-class streets of Floral Park, and many voters expressed ambivalence about both candidates.
Even Gore supporters had some doubts about his demeanor. And even Bush supporters had some doubts about his experience and readiness for the presidency.
"Did either one of them really burst out of their shell?" asked Clarin Cheek, 30, speaking of the performances of Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in the debate. "No."
Still, Ms. Cheek, a paralegal, and her husband, Chris, 30, who works in his family's metal-stamping business in nearby Tustin, said they were "tending to lean towards Gore," as Mr. Cheek put it while they walked their yellow mutt, Zoe, at twilight.
"There are some things I like Bush better on," Mr. Cheek said. "I thought he'd be more judicious about intervening in situations around the world than Gore. We can't just go off everywhere."
But Ms. Cheek added, "Since these events in the Middle East, I feel a little bit more confident with Gore having international experience."
And, her husband chimed in, "I don't think we need a huge tax cut. I think it would just take away from other programs we need."
Just across the street, Thomas Hunsaker, 38, a tile contractor renovating a house, called himself "a moderate conservative" and confessed that after he watched part of this week's debate, "Gore scares me, where he'd take the country."
"I'm a wild one," said Mr. Hunsaker, a former commuter airline pilot and Army veteran who said he had sown his share of wild oats. "And yet I think this White House has been less than moral. The nontruths, the lying. And even now, every time there's a fund-raising controversy, they act like they don't know anything about it.
"Let me just say, I was brought up with conservative values, and there's things that you do when you know you're not going to get caught, and then there are things you just know you shouldn't do," he added. "The Clinton administration just disgusts me."
At the same time, Mr. Hunsaker said, "I do think Bush would do more to support the military, and I think he'd take a stronger foreign policy role without sticking his neck out everywhere. I don't think the economy's got any correlation with Clinton and Gore and their staff. A lot of it is from things that happened six, seven, eight years before."
Hector De La Torre, a 40-something elementary school teacher who usually votes Democratic, used exactly the same word as Mr. Hunsaker, except to describe Mr. Bush.
"Bush really scares me," Mr. De La Torre said as he stopped on Fourth Street to chat. "He doesn't know his facts in his own state. He didn't know and he could defend himself and his tax plan when Gore attacked him. He said, 'I care about the environment,' but he couldn't explain the smog in Houston."
A few blocks away, outside the Bowers art museum on Main Street, Dick Hartman, a retired safety director for a trucking company, and his wife, Mary, stopped to talk as they left a belated Columbus Day reception. Mr. Hartman is a Republican and his wife, the daughter of Italian immigrants who describes herself as "still a bleeding heart at heart," agreed that the second debate, and the whole presidential race, seemed very close.
"I thought that in this debate, Bush did edge Gore out," said Mr. Hartman, a Navy veteran of World War II. "He seemed more relaxed. But right now we're into this very bad situation in the Middle East, and how would he handle that if he doesn't have experience?" But moments later he added, "I think either way we're going to have a good president, but I think I'd feel better if it were Bush."
Mrs. Hartman said she voted for Mr. Clinton four years ago, and liked much of what Mr. Gore had to say in the debates.
"But then I think of these, what do they call them, exaggerations, and some of these faux pas," she said of Mr. Gore. "And I've heard people say that's not just an exaggeration, but part of his character, so how do you really know? I don't."
Greg Joslyn, 46, an executive with the Orange County Foundation for Medical Care, a nonprofit organization that administers health insurance plans for businesses, was heading into the museum for another reception, this one for St. Joseph Hospital. Asked what struck him about the second debate, he replied instantly: "Gore's complete character change. He seemed totally different from the first one. I think George is just who he says he is and what you see is what you get."
Mr. Joslyn is a Republican and a Bush supporter, but he said neither candidate was adequately addressing the burden that aging baby boomers would place on the Medicare and Social Security systems. "I don't think either candidate, quite frankly, is really honest about the impact of that demographic boom. Something has got to be done."
Mr. Joslyn also said he liked Mr. Bush's overall attitude, and thought he would be cooperative with Democrats to get things done.
"My sister lives in Texas, and she's a single-issue voter for whom a women's right to choose is really most important," he said. "But even she says that as governor, Bush really has reached out across the aisle."

Bush Cautiously Raises Mideast as Campaign Issue
Gov. George W. Bush continued to express support for the Clinton administration's approach to increased violence in the Middle East. But he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, also signaled that they were prepared to make events in the Middle East a part of the campaign debate, finding ways to frame recent events there as an argument for their election and a validation of their positions on oil imports, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the strength and use of the military.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq in Comeback, Surging Almost 8%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday after falling on Tuesday and Wednesday and plunging on Thursday. With investors jumping in to snap up bargains, as they have in the past, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite index, which had fallen the most, surged 7.9 percent, its second-biggest one-day gain ever.
But the rally does not mean that investors have shrugged off the concerns that helped drive prices lower. These include higher oil prices, smaller-than-expected earnings increases and turmoil in the Middle East. 
 None of those problems have gone away, although the price of crude oil fell yesterday and there were some positive earnings reports.
Even with the surge in the Nasdaq, which rose more than twice the amount it fell on Thursday, the index is still down 18.5 percent for the year and is not even back to where it closed on Monday. The Dow is off 11.4 percent for the year and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 6.5 percent.
PMC-Sierra, Gateway and Juniper Networks all reported earnings that topped forecasts and pointed to what might finally stabilize the stock market. The question for investors now is whether the actual earnings reports that begin being announced in earnest next week will be positive enough to turn recent sellers into buyers.
The flurry of negative earnings pre-announcements this quarter has been well above average and a surprise to many investors. But the current forecast for third-quarter earnings growth is for a rise of 15.9 percent, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. And if that prediction is backed up by actual numbers, then the negative tide of the last several weeks could turn.
A report that retail sales in September jumped 0.9 percent may have also helped to reassure some investors. While economists say that the pace of economic growth is slowing, the retail sales report indicates that the rate of growth is not plunging, a fear that had gripped some investors recently. Instead, the data indicates that consumer spending is resilient, despite the surge in oil and gasoline prices this year. And that should help, not hurt, earnings prospects.
"If earnings come through the way they should and if problems in the Mideast don't get worse, then maybe yesterday was the trough," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers.
He said the positive earnings reports yesterday could be a signal of the good news ahead. In addition, he says that the recent decline has made stock prices attractive again. Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, agreed, stating in a note to clients yesterday that the S.& P. 500 index was 15 percent undervalued as of the close of the market Thursday.
But Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, is not as sanguine. He says the earnings news ahead will be more disappointing than now expected. He also says high oil prices are going to have enough of an inflationary impact to push interest rates higher, another negative for stocks.
He said that yesterday's performance was "a very powerful relief rally and investors who had a lot of cash put it to work; but if that is right, there won't be much follow-through."
The stock market was led higher yesterday by many of the stocks that suffered earlier in the week. Even Home Depot, which helped set off Thursday's plunge with an earnings warning, managed to inch higher yesterday. Other stocks that rebounded were J. P. Morgan, Citigroup, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Oracle, Intel, and General Electric.
At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was up 242.09 points, to 3,316.77, while the S.& P. 500 climbed 44.39 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,374.17. The Dow jumped 157.60 points, to 10,192.18. The Dow was not even back to where it was on Wednesday and the S.& P. 500 was still below its Tuesday close.
In the bond market, investors were first buffeted by a stronger-than-expected rise in September producer prices for finished goods, which jumped 0.9 percent, and the sharp increase of 0.9 percent in retail sales. But the core rate of the P.P.I. climbed a less intimidating 0.3 percent and the turmoil in the Mideast, including the bombing at the British Embassy in Yemen, prompted other investors to buy Treasuries, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. A drop in the price of oil may also have helped curb losses.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note inched up to 5.72 percent from 5.71 percent Thursday as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped 3/32, to 100 7/32.
James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said he was not worried by either the jump in retail sales or the oil-induced surge in producer prices. He said that the rise in the core rate was probably distorted by a problem with shifting to the new model year for automobiles. As for retail sales, he said they were just a rebound from a sharp slowdown in July and August. He says that the economy is beginning to slow and that the recent sell-off in the stock market is re-enforcing that view among investors.
"I think investors have been skeptical of the slowdown view," he said. "But the damage that has been done in the stock market is making people believe that the slowdown is coming."
In the oil market, crude oil for November delivery dropped $1.07, or 3 percent, to $34.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of heating oil for November delivery fell 6.12 cents, to $1.0161 a gallon. Although prices fell yesterday, if the United States is not successful in calming the situation in Israel, prices are likely to rise again.

HEADLINE: The Big Federal Freeze

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller is a syndicated columnist and a senior fellow at the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.

 BODY:
To listen to Al Gore and George W. Bush, you'd think this election represents a clash between radically different visions of what the federal government will spend money on in the years ahead. Gore seems to want to throw new cash everywhere -- preschools, teacher salaries, personal savings accounts. Bush, by contrast, pledges a government that trusts "real people," not Washington bureaucrats, to do what's best with their money.
What both men know but won't discuss is that despite their avowed priorities, the vast bulk of today's $1.8 trillion federal budget is already spoken for -- and that before long, what little discretion a president has to leave his thumbprint on the federal beast will shrink toward zero. 
 Federal spending, in short, is already so big (and fixed) relative to either man's aspirations that even their boldest proposals merely tinker at the margins. Bush's "risky" tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, for example, comes to roughly 5 percent of projected revenues over that period. Al Gore says he'll mount a "revolution" in education with a 3 percent bump in national school spending.
Presidents are doomed to nibble at the edges because of a fiscal fact most campaigns ignore. For all the moans about "big government," just seven items make up 75 percent of what Uncle Sam does: Social Security ($403 billion a year), Medicare ($199 billion), Medicaid ($117 billion), military and civil-service pensions ($79 billion), defense ($294 billion) and interest on the debt ($220 billion). Toss in a few smaller entitlement programs and you've covered all but one-sixth of federal outlays.
And it's only going to get tighter. With the exception of Pentagon spending and the debt, all of these categories grow automatically, though "grow" may be the wrong word. Once 76 million baby boomers start hitting their rocking chairs a decade from now, the costs of their health and retirement programs will explode. The federal dollars not devoted to entitlements and defense will slip from a level that is already lower relative to the size of the economy than at any time since bean counters started tracking such things in 1962.
The paradox is that the leftover spending, the so-called domestic discretionary functions, is what most Americans tend to think of as "government": border cops, college loans, cancer research, air-traffic controllers, inspectors who make sure the food on the shelves won't poison us, the construction crews that expand highways gripped by gridlock.
The math is simple: unless Americans develop a taste for big new taxes, or politicians trim entitlements, there won't be money for government to do much it's not already doing.
It wasn't always thus. Back in the early 1960's, when Social Security was in its youth and Medicare didn't exist, the bulk of federal spending went for those items subject to yearly Congressional review. Today the ratios have reversed: 7 in 10 dollars go instead for mandatory spending, payments made automatically to citizens we've said are entitled to them. Meanwhile, the more optional National Park Service ($1.4 billion), F.B.I. ($3 billion), U.S. Border Patrol ($1 billion), Head Start ($5 billion) and aid for poor schoolchildren ($9 billion) together add up to a penny on the federal dollar.
The Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, likes to say the new economy is "lighter" than the old, weighing less per dollar of gross domestic product, as software has become more essential than steel. It's the same with new government: highways, dams and research laboratories have lost their primacy; cold cash -- for pensions, doctors and hospitals -has taken over. Call it government by A.T.M.: you walk up, hit the buttons and the cash to which you're entitled pops out. Ask not what you can do for your country, my friends, but what cash your country can dole out to you.
The transformation of government from road builder to check writer was not a historical accident. It was a deliberate effort, on the part of Congress and voters, too, to use the nation's postwar affluence to fashion a more secure safety net. The shift, necessitating a boost in federal domestic spending from 6 percent to 15 percent of gross domestic product (G.D.P.) between the end of the Korean War and the late 1970's, was the product of what Gene Steuerle of the Urban Institute calls "the era of easy finance."
Defense spending declined swiftly after Korea, leaving a peace dividend that could be deployed elsewhere. Social Security payroll taxes rose 3 percent each decade with little public complaint, mainly because early beneficiaries hadn't paid into the system for long and thus received far more in benefits than they contributed. Finally, the combination of inflation and tax brackets that weren't adjusted for it enabled government revenue to quietly grow faster than the economy. This was a dream world for politicians; they could expand benefits and cut taxes. The idea that this might eventually cause trouble for an aging society was a problem for another day.
Not that we should come down too hard on yesterday's politicians for lacking foresight; they accomplished a great deal. The results of government by A.T.M. have been impressive: Social Security has nearly eradicated elderly poverty; Medicare has brought security to old age. But as the hungry A.T.M. gobbles up the budget, the costs are becoming clear. Bill Clinton came to office eight years ago pledging big spending boosts for infrastructure, education and research and development. Yet such public investments, which dropped from 2.6 percent of G.D.P. two decades ago to 1.8 percent by 1992, have fallen to 1.6 percent on Clinton's watch.
These numbers translate into tangible losses citizens can see and feel. The national parks budget has declined by 10 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since the early 1980's, for example, at a time when park visits and the number of sites in the system are up 25 percent. At Yellowstone, families pay $20-a-car entry fees for the privilege of dodging potholes. Highways are so clogged that the average annual delay faced by big-city drivers has risen to 50 hours from 34 a decade ago. And has anyone seen a major airport or inner-city school lately that doesn't look run-down?
Before this decade is out, the A.T.M. juggernaut could well inspire the next great overhaul of American politics. "We don't want to have a government that is consumed only with passing out money," says John Kasich, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, "and where all the discretionary programs, whether it's the National Institutes of Health or higher education, basically get eliminated. That's not an acceptable proposition."
It is, however, the current plan.
There are a trillion things to know about government spending, but connoisseurs like to savor a few choice morsels. For starters, federal spending as a percentage of G.D.P., which economists say is the best measure of the size of government, is the lowest it has been in decades.
Spending hovered between 21 and 23 percent of G.D.P. under presidents Reagan and Bush. Thanks to economic growth and spending restraint, spending has more recently declined to 18.7 percent and is headed toward 16 percent. The least understood fiscal fact of our time is that Clinton was coaxed into balancing the budget downward. If we were still spending at Reagan-Bush levels, government would have roughly $300 billion a year more to play with -- enough for seven new departments of education, say, or a shiny new Pentagon. Instead, after two terms, a "liberal" president still can't lift Pell grants back to the value they had in the 1970's, or shake loose a few extra billion to fully fund Head Start.
This is due, in part, to the rhetorical power of big numbers. In a country as large as the United States, the tiniest federal program quickly adds up to billions of dollars. When politicians and newspaper editorialists start throwing around these figures, it's easy to scare voters and kill off even the most reasonable, budget-conscious proposals. The budget hawks' zeal tends to vary inversely with the size of the program under attack. Zeroing out the perennially suspect National Endowment for the Arts and its $98 million budget, for example, would finance the Pentagon for three hours. Foreign aid, at 1 percent of spending, comes to three weeks' interest on the debt. Before the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, think how many of the nation's problems were pinned on the 1 percent of federal spending that went to the 2 percent of Americans known as welfare mothers. With a little political grandstanding, the most insignificant federal outlay can be made to look like runaway government.
Then, of course, there's pork, scorned by most right-thinking people as all that's wrong with our political system. The amplest tallies of these dubious local projects are $10 billion a year -- a fortune to ordinary mortals, but half a penny on the dollar for the feds. A little pork goes a long way to grease the wheels in Congress. One congressman's waste, after all, is another's hometown jobs program. Suppose a few billion dollars in repaved roads or silly research grants help seal the deal that one day makes our pension costs sustainable. Will anyone object all that strenuously if the price of national solvency includes the Robert Byrd Judicial Center or the Orrin Hatch Memorial Exit Ramp?
Puny programs aside, few officials in either party ever propose cutting "big government" at all. Democrats, for example, have all but abandoned calls for defense cuts. Their timidity makes sense if you stress, as Republicans do, that Pentagon spending has come down from 6 percent of G.D.P. at the height of the Reagan buildup to 3 percent of G.D.P. today. But frame the same issue another way: should we still give the Pentagon 90 percent of its average cold war funding a decade after the end of the cold war? Thanks to steady economic growth, both of these facts are true. But as the current campaign reminds us, such analysis is beside the point, since Pentagon budgeting is mainly a political exercise. Democrats call for hikes to avoid being tagged soft on defense, while Republicans pretend their insistence on a few pennies more proves Democrats are unfit for world leadership.
Those "radical" Republican plans to scrap entire cabinet agencies back in Newt Gingrich's heyday were similarly hollow. Take the education department, where malignant bureaucrats "in sandals and beads" were said to be destroying the nation's schools. In reality, the handful of programs that make up the bulk of the Education Department's $38 billion budget have had broad bipartisan support for years. Loan subsidies and Pell grants, totaling about $12 billion a year, make college affordable for millions of young Americans. Subsidies of about $15 billion help local districts teach poor or disabled children. Salaries and expenses for the department's 5,000 employees come to a little over 1 percent of its budget. No doubt we should have fired these hippies years ago. But how would that change a single thing that ails our schools? Republicans could justifiably argue that a separate cabinet agency wasn't needed to administer the big education programs, which existed before the department was set up. But that means Republicans were really peddling a kind of neutron-bomb education reform -- blow up the agency, yes, but for heaven's sake, keep everything it does intact. Similar sleight of hand explains why Republican plans to kill the departments of commerce and energy would have left 80 percent of the spending untouched.
Meanwhile, even the fiercest Republican revolutionaries don't speak of cutting big social programs like Medicare, only of slowing their growth. Around election time, Democrats get red in the face and insist these measures are an abomination; in the intervening years, they endorse similar restraints themselves. Since most of these funds go to senior citizens, the feds now spend seven times more on every American over 65 ($17,688) than on each child under 18 ($2,491). That gap will only widen. The fact that state and local governments take the lead on school spending dilutes but doesn't alter the deep gray shade of American public finance. "Boomers of every political stripe once tended to be idealistic about what government should be doing," says Steuerle of the Urban Institute. "Now it turns out that the bequest we may leave our children is a federal government whose sole purpose is our own consumption in retirement."
Indeed, even before the boomers retire, the A.T.M. juggernaut chugs along with enormous power. This year, for example, without anyone debating or voting on it, spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, fueled by automatic hikes for inflation and rising medical costs, will soar by $45 billion; at the same time, President Clinton will be lucky to secure an extra $450 million to help schools reduce class size.
So far, we've covered only the government's official spending. Plenty of de facto spending gets done under the guise of tax subsidies, the back door to the A.T.M. Tax breaks for mortgage interest payments and employer-provided health care, for example, come to roughly $150 billion a year. Because tax deductions are worth more to people in higher tax brackets, such policies perversely shower bigger subsidies on citizens the richer they are. These subsidies will quietly rise by another $50 billion over the next five years. "Elect me," the subtitles under both a Bush and Gore stump speech could well read, "and I'll hike health and housing subsidies for millionaires, while renters and the uninsured fend for themselves." As Joe Lieberman might say, "Is this a great country, or what?"
It's important to be precise about the nature of the threat posed by government's A.T.M. Cries that the coming surge in health and pension costs will saddle workers with tax hikes and sink their standard of living became popular a few years ago, along with the inevitable backlash against such Gen-X "whining." The real risks are subtler. While few experts would deny that the boomers' golden years will place a burden on the young, most also say that steady economic growth will boost incomes substantially higher than they are today. The richest nation on earth can plainly afford the baby boom's retirement. The thornier question is whether Americans will agree to leave room for government to spend money on anything else. If not, the federal government will start looking like a family that pulls the kids out of college, lets the house fall apart and makes mom and dad wear rags, all so that Grandma can have more cash. Paint the picture with kids who are black and hispanic while Grandma is white, and the old homestead could get a little tense.
Few Americans would endorse this set of priorities if they were presented this way, but the A.T.M. state has bred a brand of citizen delusion that makes dealing with these challenges harder. People tell pollsters they trust government less than ever, while acting as if the social programs they cherish -- government's proudest achievement -- simply fell from the sky. "Tell the government to keep its hands off my Medicare" is the way one confused woman put it on TV.
If we are to escape these fiscal and psychic straitjackets, the coming decade is pivotal. Yet with budget surpluses having temporarily replaced big deficits, there's a complacency in the air about long-term woes. Liberals prefer to pray: the dire forecasts won't be borne out, they tell themselves, and if they are, we'll raise taxes (and deficits) high enough to finance the welfare state we need. Conservatives gloat: the A.T.M. is set to grind down activist government in ways that a thousand Ronald Reagan speeches never could.
For voters not happy with either of these postures, the trade-offs loom large -- what will we give up in the way of entitlements to afford a government that can actually do something new and innovative? Some officials, like the Democratic senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and the Republican budget guru Kasich of Ohio, believe it will necessitate a synthesis of liberal and conservative ideologies -- a kind of "New New Deal" that pairs restraint on outlays for the elderly with a redesigned safety net. The aim over time, both suggest, would be to help citizens build more private wealth and rely less on Social Security, while using government to wring out (and redeploy) every excess health-care dollar it can find. The A.T.M. juggernaut would thus be slowed.
For now, however, the federal government is stuck in a holding pattern. If Eliot Ness symbolized the fed in the 1930's and Neil Armstrong in the 1960's, the figures that embody the millennial American state are anonymous. They are the countless clerks in bland offices who this year will process 887 million Medicare claims and 542 million Social Security payments. Right this minute one of them is sitting at a computer tapping away at the keys, and if you close your eyes and use a little imagination, you can hear her clickety-clack blend with the echo from thousands of other federal claims processors across the land, until the mad rhythm of finger against keyboard surges in a crescendo worthy of George Orwell, or at least Rod Serling. This is the sound of your government at the dawn of the 21st century, and there's little that you -- or Al Gore and George W. Bush, for that matter -- are going to do about it.

HEADLINE: The War on Stink

BYLINE: By Austin Bunn; Austin Bunn is a contributing editor for Brill's Content. He also writes for the Village Voice.

 BODY:
Dr. George Preti first offers me armpit. Later, we'll get to "swine slurry" and halitosis, but we start with the odor that he claims is his favorite. Preti holds a small strip of clear material under my nose, saturated with 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, the principal ingredient in underarm odor. Smelling this strip is like savoring distilled gym locker, and not something you want to do often. Preti, who grins as I take it in, whiffs this stuff for a living.
I have come to Preti's lab -- in the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia -- in search of science on a shoestring. The myth of medical research is colossal grants and egos to match, but I went looking for a scientist working on the margins, toiling away with meager funds against a condition everyone would just as soon ignore. I wanted someone on the front lines of fringe. Preti is it. 
 He joined the Monell Center -- established in 1968 as one of the world's first research institutes on taste and smell -- in the early 70's, intent on exploring the chemical communication among mammals. Later trained by Dr. Joseph Tonzetich, a man he endearingly calls the "godfather of halitosis," Preti began to focus on mouth odor and human secretions. In the mid-80's, he made international news for his work on how male and female armpit odors influence women's menstrual cycles. But like most nonindustrial research scientists, Preti's reputation needs constant caretaking.
His research operation is but a draft compared with the gales of Big Science. Where other labs maintain huge server farms of coded genes, Preti has two fridges covered with cartoons and crammed with saliva, urine, swabs of exudates and other unmentionables. This year, the federal government will spend $3.8 billion to fight cancer and $528 million to fight diabetes. Preti will wage his war on stink with a total budget of $300,000.
What keeps him going is the promise of cures for stenches both public and private -- but getting there requires a complicated bit of financing. The National Institutes of Health gives him $150,000 a year to support his primary research, the study of underarm odors. Of that, $95,000 is earmarked for his salary and those of two lab technicians, and the rest goes to supplies and research subjects, plus an annual trip to a convention in Sarasota, Fla.
Beyond that, the State of Pennsylvania spends $80,000 a year on Preti, so that he might find a way to neutralize the stench of pig and mushroom farming. That money gets spent like this: $49,600 goes toward the salaries of Preti, a biopsychologist he works with and their two assistants; $20,800 goes to hiring two veterinarians, who consult on swine experiments; and $11,200 goes to supplies and, as Preti puts it, "Paying subjects to sniff the stuff." (He recruits students, at $10 to $20 an hour, to smell the slurry and ascertain the degree of intensity of the smell. They go for nave students, Preti says, who don't have "prejudicial attitudes toward slurry.")
On the side, with no official financing, Preti treats patients. His current fascination is an enzyme deficiency called trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish-odor syndrome. Those who suffer from it come to Preti for help, though there is no remedy to date. Others with breath problems make the pilgrimage from as far as Europe and Central America, failed by mints and mouthwash, obsessively covering their mouths and pleading for treatment. Though it costs him about $2,000 to see each patient, he charges them only $200, supporting the endeavor with a private honorarium stash.
When I ask him why his work is not better financed, Preti says, almost shyly, that in large part it's because of "the bizarre nature of my niche." Though the mouthwash industry is worth $850 million, he sees no part of it, because their research focuses on tooth plaque and gingivitis. Even in the world of dentistry, perhaps the one place where breath malodor might be a big deal, the condition is a sideshow. "If you want to become a name in academic dentistry, are you going to study bad breath or carcinoma of the mouth?" asks Preti.
But what Preti's research lacks in economic scale it makes up for in practical application. The majority of Americans suffer from halitosis, at least occasionally, so Preti is, quite literally, putting his money where our mouths are. And he knows where all of that money goes, even down to the 50 cents it cost him for a set of Xerox copies.
His biggest expenditures are on machinery that break down volatile gases -- a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. The chromatograph, which looks something like a boxy, oversize toaster oven, costs about $12,000. A syringe attached to it draws mouth air into a tightly wound, 36-foot-long, hair-thin coil made of Teflon called "the column" (which needs replacing, at a cost of $300 to $400, every 4 to 12 months). In the column, one's breath is broken down into its molecular compounds.
Once the materials have been separated by the gas chromatograph, the mass spectrometer bombards the individual components with electrons, creating a "fragmentation pattern" to help identify their structure. The mass spectrometer is the Sherman tank of smell research; though it doesn't seem to have any moving parts, the machine costs between $70,000 and $100,000 and sits in the basement of Monell. (Days after I spoke with him, Preti was ecstatic, having just received the new "desktop" model he'd bought for $80,000.)
But when I ask Preti what is the costliest thing in his lab, he points to the fellow standing next to him -- Henry Lawley, his technician. "A machine you only pay for once," Preti says. "A human being you have to keep paying for." Lawley smiles under the awning of his bushy gray mustache.
Despite all the high-tech equipment, the best instrument Preti has is the free one. "The nose," he says, "is a lot more sensitive than the gas chromatograph or the mass spectrometer." And he uses it on every patient.
Many of them have spent thousands of dollars just trying to get a diagnosis and often cry upon getting tested. "The vast majority of physicians don't know how to diagnose an odiferous disease," Preti says. "A lot of people think that bad breath is generated in the digestive tract, and that is utterly wrong."
As Preti describes it, the body has various chemistry departments, run by bacteria, and the bacteria make the odors. Depending on the amount of moisture, type of glands and amount of available oxygen, each body part smells different from every other part, and each person's bad smells are different from every other person's bad smells. The wet areas with lots of nooks and crannies, like the back of the mouth, are booming factories, teeming with volatile compounds like hydrogen sulfide (which smells like rotten eggs) and methyl mercaptan (which smells like sewer gas). "These are the main ingredients in bad breath," Preti says. They form a plaque on the back of the tongue that he likens to "cream cheese on a bagel, and just as hard to get off."
Preti evaluates each patient's breath, ranked on a scale of 1 to 10. He asks the patient to close his mouth for two minutes and then exhale into his face. This is the "organoleptic" method. "At seven or eight, I can detect their breath in conversation with them across the table," he says. "It's pretty strong."
I ask Preti to sample me. On my way to the center that morning, I sucked on a lone, lint-dappled cough suppressant I found buried in my bag, in preparation for just such an exam. But when Preti swabs my tongue with a long Q-tip, he can tell already that I'm near the top of the scale. He sniffs the secretion and mutters, "Seven." Henry Lawley rushes over to get a whiff of me. "I'd say four," he says, kindly. I, of course, can't smell a thing. (Even when we think we can smell ourselves, we are notoriously bad at estimating the strength of our foulness; women tend to exaggerate more than men, while men tend to have higher levels of odor than women.) "Was it the two cups of coffee?" I ask. Preti looks at me sternly. "Coffee breath is not bad breath."
One of Preti's peeves is the way that "food smells" are now confused with "bad smells," a distinction blurred by advertising and the mouthwash industry. "In these ads, bad breath is often linked to something you ate like garlic, onion," he says, "but I tell people, 'Eat all that you want -- those are good smells.' "
After a nose test, Preti gives the patient a piece of flavorless Wrigley's gum (a donation from the company) to generate saliva. The patient spits into a funnel that empties into a vial. Preti draws air off the top of the vial and sends it into the chromatograph, in what is called "head space" analysis. He also takes blood and urine samples. For those patients with body-odor problems, Preti uses absorbent pads in their armpits to sample their smell.
So what does Preti actually do for people who smell? For those with TMAU, he recommends not eating beans or boiled fish, two foods that contain the compound that those with TMAU can't break down. Patients afflicted with genuine halitosis get lectures in diligent tongue scraping, raking the plaque right back at the threshold of the gag reflex. "Nobody is taught from early age to clean the back of their tongue," he says. "It's the best long-term solution." Preti adds that some cultures, like India's, do teach tongue scraping, and they have relatively lower incidence of halitosis.
He also recommends a mouth rinse developed by Dr. Jon L. Richter, a practicing Philadelphia dentist who runs a breath clinic. Richter worked with Preti and spent more than $1 million to develop products that remove plaque on the tongue. To improve on Listerine, which Richter claims "basically just irritates the mouth" and doesn't get rid of tongue plaque, Richter created a chlorine-dioxide solution -- the same compound that sanitizes drinking water -- to kill bacteria and remove odors. The rinse is basically pool water, but it took "hundreds of thousands of dollars," Richter says, to come up with the right proportions. They also developed a plastic tongue cleaner for raking off plaque. "That first tongue scraper cost us about $20,000 just to get a mold," Richter says. "Now it costs about 8 cents to produce."
Nonhuman stink problems are more formidable. In America's hog-farming states, the smell of "swine slurry," which is a combination of feces, urine, food and mud, has become a genuine epidemic. Pollution from large hog farms, which dump the slurry into giant holding tanks euphemistically called waste lagoons, gained its greatest infamy last fall, when Hurricane Floyd caused tanks throughout eastern North Carolina to overflow. The waste -- and the stench -- traveled far and wide with the rising waters. But it's a serious day-to-day problem in any state where hogs are raised. To counteract the odor, Preti (who gets his slop free from a local swine farmer) has been experimenting with finely powdered charcoal (which he also gets free, from a local charcoal company) mixed into the slurry. It reduces odors by 90 percent, he says, but "you still have enough to offend people." His latest idea is to possibly start with the other end of the pig -- the mouth -- and feed it a smell-annihilating charcoal tablet.
Before I go, Preti wants me to understand what he's up against, to experience the real potency of swine slurry. He seems almost to delight in unscrewing the lid of a small container of it, a pea-green soup with little bits of bad news floating in the mix. He offers it to me as a farewell perfume. I bend in close, open my nostrils and breathe. The smell is awesome.

HEADLINE: The Way We Spend Now

BYLINE: By David Brooks; David Brooks, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There."

 BODY:
Everyone knows the conventional story about American spending habits. It begins with the Great Depression, which instilled a permanent thrift mentality. Scarred by deprivation, sobered by the scarcity of the war years, Americans in the middle of the 20th century were transformed en masse into tightfisted, financial neurotics, perpetually saving for the next rainy day.
But then along came a new generation, the spoiled baby boomers, for whom thrift became a dirty word. And now we are in the midst of a new Gilded Age of instant gratification, dominated by people who know nothing but limitless prosperity. (Never mind the dismal 70's.) A quick glance through the press reveals scads of stories claiming to capture the new ethos -- tales about parents buying Estee Lauder's Origins Natural Resources diaper "balm" at $10 for a 3.5-ounce bottle, East Hampton millionaires dropping $1.5 million on a pool, companies asking $3 million for a diamond-studded bra. In these stories you can hear the reporter sharpening the sword of justice in the background. The clear subtext is that the rich today don't deserve their bounty and that a terrible day of reckoning soon will be upon them. 
 But this morality tale doesn't hold up to scrutiny. In the first place, there's no pile of evidence to suggest that the Greatest Generation, as we now worshipfully call it, is reacting differently from anybody else to today's good times. In fact, the members of this supposedly thrifty cohort are setting new standards for post-retirement consumption. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, the post-65 set increased their spending levels faster than any other group between 1987 and 1997. A lot of this money is spent on entertainment. The average household headed by a person 65 to 74 years old now spends more on entertainment than the average household headed by someone under 25.
Claritas, a market-research company, breaks down the population into different market niches, based on their buying patterns. One is a group Claritas calls Gray Power, which consists of college graduates over the age of 65. They live in part off their savings, have annual incomes around $36,300 and make up about 2 percent of all households. Their six favorite cars are the Cadillac DeVille, Lincoln Continental, Infiniti Q45, Mercury Grand Marquis, Lexus LS400 and Mercedes Benzes of all varieties -- not exactly budgetmobiles.
These gray-haired hedonists are disproportionate consumers of saltwater fishing tours. Their favorite magazines include House Beautiful and Travel and Leisure. Their quintessential bumper sticker, according to Claritas? "We're spending our children's inheritance."
Moreover, when you go back and wade through the books and magazines that were popular when the Greatest Generation was in its peak years, you find yourself in a world as consumption-obsessed as our own. In 1954, Russell Lynes chronicled America's passion for conspicuous display in a book called "The Tastemakers," with chapter headings like "Suburbia in Excelsis."
In 1959, Vance Packard wrote a book called "The Status Seekers," in which he described how prosperous Americans were spending their luxury dollars. Some were buying big air-conditioning units and installing them in the front windows of their houses. Inside, they mimicked Old World gentry. They put hunting prints and faux ancestor portraits on the walls, period furniture in the "study" (as the den came to be known), silver candlesticks on the mahogany dining-room table. The prototypical luxury item of the day was the gold faucet. Packard noticed that his status seekers put gold faucets in the guest bathroom first. You know you had made it as a company man if you got to use the executive washroom with the gold faucets.
In retrospect, the big difference between their spending patterns and ours is that they took their materialism straight, while subsequent generations have been conflicted about it. When members of the World War II generation got rich, they wanted to look rich. They made their homes more formal, their jewelry more elegant and the furniture more upper crust. Now when people get rich, they make their homes more casual, their appliances more rugged and their furniture more primitive. The richer they get, the more they want to look like Shakers.
Yankelovich Partners is one marketing group that studies generational spending patterns. Their reports tend to be a bit overwrought. But Yankelovich's president, J. Walker Smith, and his co-author, Ann Clurman, are probably onto something in their book, "Rocking the Ages," when they write that the members of the World War II generation desire "material goods for their own sake." Members of subsequent generations, they say, are more likely to have postmaterialist values, prizing experiences more than goods.
Today's spenders are desperate to show that though their stock portfolios may bulge, they themselves have not become pampered elitists or Gilded Age vulgarians. Today's consumption comes wrapped in morality. It's not only the thriving ice cream companies and toothpaste firms whose branding strategies revolve around their environmental policies, nor even the hyperspiritual advertising campaigns that assure you, "Don't worry, if Mahatma Gandhi had bought a luxury car, ours is the one he would have chosen."
More striking is the way consumers now shape their spending patterns to prove how antimaterialist they are. It won't do to be seen pampering yourself with Faberge eggs or caviar. But when you're spending money on something useful, the sky's the limit. A code of Extravagant Utility prevails. You can't have a mere winter coat to protect you from normal American winters. You've got to have a Himalayan-tested, Gore-Tex-Cordura-Polartec composite parka, with microfilament hood design, polyurethane coat-welded seams and universal radial hinges, durable enough to keep you warm on your next trip to Pluto yet collapsible enough to fit in your back pocket, in case you find yourself in one of those hell-on-earth ordeals that Jon Krakauer is always writing about. We don't want to look like languid aristocrats. We want to look like rugged, practical people whose down-to-earth (yet adventurous) lives just happen to require the most expensive gear.
There seems to be some sort of rough cycle to this: one generation is unabashed about money, the next rejects straightforward materialism. The antimaterialists don't necessarily spend less; they just dress their money in the robes of virtue. Three hundred years ago, the Puritans tied the worldly calling to strive and make money to the heavenly calling to serve God. So the early Americans forced themselves into dark clothing and resorted to incredible subterfuge to display their status markers. (For instance, a rich merchant would purchase the finest imported cupboards and then paint them black, and so congratulate himself both for his possessions and his modesty.)
In the 19th century, transcendentalism inspired wealthy burghers to forsake lavish consumerism and instead to live simply in the woods (or at least adopt the patina of simple, organic living in their country "cottages"). And today we have adopted another characteristically American ethic that celebrates high thinking and plain living.
Today's consumers have created a sumptuary code to help them moralize their money, weaving together the various strands of contemporary high-mindedness. This code owes much to environmentalism, borrowing the notions of scarce resources and the virtuousness of living close to nature. It also draws from the ethos of the "cultivati," which holds that it is vulgar to display wealth nakedly, the way those vulgar yuppies used to do in the ghastly 80's. The imperative now is to prove your cultivation by displaying a preference for folk crafts over garish luxuries, simple and nutritious foods over rich and expensive dishes. There is more than a dash of plain old American egalitarianism in this, the idea that you should try to be rich without insulting the ideal of equality.
This sumptuary code, while not restraining spending, does seem to have changed it. According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Americans in 1997 spent 13 percent less -- in constant dollars -- on food away from home than they did in 1987, and 24 percent less on alcoholic beverages, 18 percent less on reading materials and 15 percent less on clothing.
And while there is a lot of consumption going on, there's also a lot of moneymaking as well. According to the Federal Reserve Board triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, the American balance sheet is in reasonably good shape. The assets of the average family are rising faster than its debt. So, overall, the average American household is in better shape now than it was three years ago. The nation's notoriously low savings rate doesn't include capital gains. If you count stock portfolios as savings, which normal families do, the American nest egg is healthy.
What about those spoiled Information Age zillionaires? Conventional wisdom holds that they're a bunch of free-spending dot-com crazies stockpiling Range Rovers and Aspen summer homes. But if you hang around them for any time, you discover that most high-tech zillionaires are staid middle-aged workaholics. Most are zealous about making money but haven't a clue about how to spend it. Many don't have the cultural capital to appreciate finery that doesn't come in the form of a really neat hard drive.
The United States Trust Company did a survey of the richest 1 percent of Americans and found that less than a third of them purchase furs, jewelry or other stereotypical luxury goods. Only 18 percent own or plan to own a vacation home; they're more likely to spend some money renovating the place they're in. What they like best is using their money to make more money. Nine in 10 of those surveyed have kept all or most of their recent stock market gains in the market. You get the impression of a group of business magazine readers who spend their leisure time sensuously staring at their quarterly mutual fund reports.
Nor is there much evidence that today's youngsters -- the Gen X'ers and younger -- are extraordinarily besotted with shopping and buying. The Gen X types are starting to save for retirement at even earlier ages than the boomers, and in greater amounts. Moreover, there's more than just anecdotal evidence to suggest that the 20-somethings are more antimaterialist than their boomer elders. It's not just that they go around in those dirty flannel shirts.
American Demographics magazine recently completed an analysis of future spending patterns by generation. They found that if current trends continue, householders ages 25 to 34 will spend a greater share of their income on reading, computers and software and less on cars, alcoholic beverages and household services. That's not exactly the Donald Trump mold.
So it's not that America is suffering a fall from grace: the thrifty World War II types giving way to the spoiled children of affluence. It's more complicated than that. If you are one of those 75-year-old retirees cruising around in the latest Cadillac, you have probably tasted scarcity at some time in your life. You can look money in the face.
But if you're a 35-year-old executive in a Lincoln Navigator, you probably never have. Somehow you feel that you have never really tasted reality (like people who theorize about war without ever having seen combat). You feel guilty that your whole life has been spent in a cocoon of prosperity. You sign up for pseudo-deprivation vacation packages, but you're not sure it helps. In this time of prosperity, it's not just that money dominates America. Ambivalence about money dominates America. People are working harder than ever to get it, but then they worry about getting corrupted by it. These are the anxieties of affluence.

HEADLINE: Why Living in a Rich Society Makes Us Feel Poor

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank is a professor at Cornell University and the author of "Luxury Fever."

 BODY:
Most of us are taught from an early age not to worry about how others' possessions compare with our own, and we seem to recognize the soundness of this advice. There will always be people with more, and becoming preoccupied with that is a recipe for misery. So if asked whether we fret about the size of our neighbors' house or about the cars they drive, most of us would insist we do not.
Put the question another way, however, and we seem a little less certain. Consider a choice between these two worlds: 
 World A: You earn $110,000 per year, others earn $200,000.
World B: You earn $100,000 per year, others earn $85,000.
The income figures represent real purchasing power. Your income in World A would command a house 10 percent larger than the one you could afford in World B, 10 percent more restaurant dinners and so on. By choosing World B, you'd give up a small amount of absolute income in return for a large increase in relative income.
So which would you pick? A majority of Americans, it turns out, choose World B.
Why would we accept the lower pay? One possibility, of course, is that we envy our neighbors' possessions more than we feel comfortable admitting. But there's an alternative explanation, one that works even if we're really not much concerned about keeping up with the Joneses.
This alternative account rests on the idea that to function effectively in complex social environments, we need ways to evaluate how we're doing and make judgments about how best to adapt to changing environments. Such judgments almost always depend heavily on how we're doing relative to others in the same local environment. Suppose your daughter just got a D on her first exam at Stanford. She could console herself with the notion that her performance would have earned a much higher grade had she gone to a junior college close to home, but she probably won't see it that way. She's likely to be upset. The low grade tells her something important. She needs to work harder, and being upset will prod her to do so.
Similar contextual forces mold our assessment of the things we own. For example, as Adam Smith observed in "The Wealth of Nations," local standards define how much people must spend on clothing if they are to appear in public "without shame." In 18th-century Scotland, he wrote, even the lowliest workers needed shirts made of linen, since the inability to afford a shirt of that quality generally signified indolence, incompetence or worse.
Linen has gone out of fashion since Smith's day, but his insight remains valid. And the stakes now are greater than ever. In the midst of the longest sustained economic boom in history, many American families are experiencing an unprecedented sense of impoverishment. They feel poorer not just because of the growing earnings gap between the rich and others, but also because of a newer phenomenon: in this media-dominated age, we're far more aware than we've ever been of the wealth that surrounds us. This new economic climate has profoundly changed how we live and how we spend our money.
I have a friend in California who could almost be mistaken for a typical American. She lives with her husband and young daughter, and she wants a bigger house, because their current one lacks a basement and they want more storage space. She worries about the quality of public schools and wouldn't mind paying higher taxes if something could be done to improve them. And like millions of others, she considers herself a frugal, environmentally sensitive person.
In other ways, my friend is less typical, and context has nearly everything to do with it. Context explains why she gets a weekly massage and a pedicure at least once a month, things she hardly ever did before. Context explains why she always flies first-class, after half a lifetime of coach. Context explains why she and her husband recently bought an $80,000 convertible, and why they buy tens of thousand of dollars worth of new electronic equipment each year. Most of all, context explains why they live in a house that cost them $2 million.
My friend, you see, lives in Los Altos, one of Silicon Valley's wealthiest suburbs, where the standards are vastly different from those in the Midwest, where she grew up. Many of her neighbors are rich on a scale that most of us still find difficult to comprehend. Although my friend and her husband can easily afford their current lifestyle, they're also a bit puzzled by it. "Ten years ago," she says, "there's no way I'd have imagined ourselves spending as much as we do today. But living here, things are different." In Los Altos, a $2 million, 3,500-square-foot house is unremarkable, and few neighbors would find it strange that my friend is considering a bigger one. "I always wanted to live in a big house with lots of space," she says. "I don't know how large. I guess maybe double what we have."
Her experience differs in degree, though not in kind, from those of millions of other American families during the current boom. In the abstract, many of these families continue to embrace simple, unostentatious modes of living. Yet they find their own sense of what they need pushed inexorably higher by the rapidly escalating consumption all around them.
In large measure, we spend more because we have more. There are now 590,000 American households worth $5 million or more -- and by 2004, according to the Spectrem Group, their ranks will swell to 3.9 million.
These numbers are so big they cover up a simple fact: the vast majority of us still aren't rich. And while much is made of how the wealthy have segregated themselves from mainstream society -- living in gated communities, sending their kids to private schools -- they are in fact all around us. Even my small university-dominated city, which sits squarely within the vast economic sinkhole that is upstate New York, now has its own booming stratum of biotech and dot-com multimillionaires. If we don't know these people directly, we know others who know them. Servicing the wealthy has become one of the fastest-growing employment sectors, bringing the rich into daily contact with millions of ordinary Americans. We clean their houses, mow their lawns, teach their kids French, do their taxes. More than ever, the rich have become part of our local context, nudging upward our sense of what is required to live comfortably and securely.
Add to that the longstanding media fixation on money. Television shows and magazines have always presented the rich as objects of fascination but usually portrayed their lives as exotic and fanciful -- as opposed to ones to which ordinary people should aspire. That has changed. One can scarcely get through a magazine these days, for example, without encountering a report that $45,000 Patek Philippe wristwatches and $25 million Feadship yachts are available only on back order. On Sunday football telecasts, ads for Heineken and BMW have displaced those for Miller Lite and Ford pickups, even though the same people, more or less, are watching.
No matter how much the media focus on the extraordinarily wealthy, however, the strongest contextual influences on how we spend remain the ones closest to home. H. L. Mencken once defined a wealthy man as one who earns $100 a year more than his wife's sister's husband. A recent study found striking support for Mencken's definition. The economists David Neumark and Andrew Postlewaite examined the behavior of a large sample of pairs of American sisters, each containing a sister who did not work outside the home. The authors' goal was to learn what factors might influence the other sister to seek paid employment. They rounded up all the things that are supposed to affect the decision to work -- the unemployment rate in the local labor market, the wage rate, education. All of these factors had some impact, but relative income was the most powerful: a woman in their sample was 16 to 25 times more likely to seek paid employment if her sister's husband earned more than her own.
The ever-widening wealth and income gap between the rich and everybody else has meant that a growing number of Americans now find themselves in the role of the impoverished in-law. Middle-income families, whose inflation-adjusted incomes are no higher now than in the 1970's, have been saving at much lower rates than before -- indeed, even at negative rates for much of last year. They're also carrying record levels of credit-card debt and other loans, going without health insurance and filing for bankruptcy at several times the rate of the early 1980's. In short, middle-income families are experiencing unprecedented levels of economic distress, largely because they are trying to keep up with a living standard they cannot afford.
Financial distress among the middle class is an important problem, and social critics have been vigilant in their search for villains to blame for it. Writers from the "personal responsibility" movement, for example, denounce those they consider too weak-willed to resist the influence of other people's spending. In their view, middle-class families should just spend less and stop complaining. Other critics, notably those of the "voluntary simplicity" school, express contempt for the buyers of the McMansions springing up all around us. What these judgments ignore is how context shapes our spending decisions at all different levels of the economy, and at all different standards of taste.
As a young man, I served for two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal. The one-room house I lived in had no plumbing or electricity, and its thatched roof leaked during heavy rains. At no time, however, did I feel it was unsatisfactory in any way. Yet I could not live in that same house in the U.S., even in the poorest neighborhood, without experiencing a profound sense of humiliation. If I had to go into debt to escape that experience, I'm certain I would.
As it happens, I live in a perfectly comfortable American middle-class house. But social critics might do well to reflect on how such a house would strike the median earner on planet Earth. If a friend from my village in Nepal saw our house, he'd think I'd taken leave of my senses. Why, he'd wonder, would a family of four possibly need a house with three and a half bathrooms?
The plain fact is that the kind of house people feel they need depends on the kind of house that others around them have. Living in a house priced well below average often means living in a relatively dangerous neighborhood, or sending your child to a below-average school. Wanting to avoid these penalties is totally normal.
The new economic climate has led us to spend more, borrow more and save less. These are symptoms of a social problem, no question about it. But the feelings that give rise to this problem are no more blameworthy than those of a student who's upset about getting a D on an exam.

HEADLINE: The Great Hand-Me-Down Heap

BYLINE: By Helen Thorpe; Helen Thorpe is a freelance writer who lives in Austin, Tex.

 BODY:
Johnson's Ropa Usada, a concrete-and-cinder-block warehouse in the Texas border town McAllen, is the final resting place for some of the detritus of American consumer culture. The massive building is cooled by a giant, cacophonous fan. White light pours down from skylights. And strewn across the floor in huge, heaping mounds, like a brilliantly striated mountain range, are piles upon piles of used clothes. On Saturdays, the clothes go on sale for 30 cents a pound.
As America's primary economy has boomed, so has its secondhand economy; in 1997, Americans spent about $12 billion on used goods, 30 percent more than they did in 1992. And it's estimated that Americans give away as much as 2.5 billion pounds of clothes each year, much of which eventually arrives in a place like this. Increasingly, used goods from the United States are also sold in vast quantities to the third world. "We now export between $500 million and $1 billion worth of used clothing per year," says Daniel Rothenberg, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan. Johnson's represents the frontier in this expanding secondhand economy -- the last point at which used clothes are sold to Americans, and the first point at which they are sold to foreigners. 
 Inside Johnson's, customers scale and pick their way across the fabric heights. Francisco Villarreal chugs around on a forklift, moving bales throughout the warehouse. When I ask him where the clothes come from, he says: "New Jersey. Todas para New Jersey." A company there buys leftover clothing from Goodwill and the Salvation Army, then sells the used goods to Johnson's.
Small kids play tag on a mountain of clothes, and a bigger boy does back flips onto them. He stops when he finds a pair of black snow pants that he seems to love. From the bottom of a crater, Minerva Villegas picks up an item, glances at it and tosses it over her shoulder. "If you have problems," she says as she digs in deeper, "well, this helps. It opens your mind, like church." Her husband is a roofer in McAllen who works for minimum wage. "All my clothes are from here," she says. "My bras, my panties -- everything."
A few piles away, a dapper old man works furiously. Salvador Acuna Aparicios bends to pick up an item, tosses it away, picks up another, tosses it away, picks up a T-shirt and slings it over his shoulder. He lives in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side of the border. "I've had my local crossing card since 1957," he tells me. "I'm 72 years old, but I exercise a lot. I box. I take good care of myself. And I don't like to be idle. I am a widower, and I don't like to spend my time sitting down, because I get nostalgic." As he speaks, Aparicios keeps sorting the clothing at a furious pace, salvaging T-shirts. "I take them to a lady in Nuevo Laredo, for resale," he explains. "I don't charge her anything for them."
Nearby, Rebecca Vasquez is looking for school clothes for her children. "If you can't afford new things, this is where you go," she says. She works for $150 a week putting stickers that say Off and On onto television remote controls. "All my clothes are from here," she says. "I don't buy new clothes. For my kids, I do, once in a while, but everything else comes from here." Vasquez pulls out a pink skirt with a gray felt cat on it. "My daughters will wear this," she announces. "Fix it up, little shoes -- the 50's!" Her 9-year-old son, the same kid who was doing back flips, parades by in an army jumpsuit. "Come here," she orders. "Turn around. No holes? O.K., good." Then she spots what he's hiding -- the snow pants. "No!" she tells him. "I told you! It never gets cold here!"
In another part of the warehouse, shy Mexican women pick through clothing as a transistor radio plays. They work for a man who sells American castoffs in Mexico. What they find will be shipped south by truck to Guanajuato to be sold at an outdoor market. Most of the people who shop here don't give much thought to those who are forever buying ropa nueva. If they think of them at all, it is with a kind of puzzled curiosity. "I don't know why they get rid of these things," says Aparicios. "Maybe it is related to the fact that there was a sickness in the family."
Minerva Villegas adds: "If they want to waste their money that way, it's their business. It's none of my business, what people do with their money." From her pillowcase, now lumpy with clothes, Villegas pulls out a plaid work shirt for her husband. "If he doesn't like it, I'll give it to my brother," she says. "And if nobody in my family wants it, then I'll put it in the back of Kmart, for those guys who sleep in the middle of the highway."

HEADLINE: Bookend;
The Gentle Realist

BYLINE: By Daniel Menaker; Daniel Menaker is senior literary editor at Random House and the author of "The Treatment," a novel.

 BODY:
In his novel "So Long, See You Tomorrow," based on a true story about passion and murder on a farm in the Midwest, William Maxwell invented -- for the purpose of witnessing some crucial events -- a thinking dog. As in: "The dog took note of the fact that he didn't do any of these things." And: "The dog couldn't imagine what had gotten into them." This thinking dog caused a stir in the fiction department at The New Yorker when the novel was about to be serialized there in 1979. Maxwell's editor, Roger Angell, and others of us in the department thought that the dog was a mistake. On several occasions Roger urged Maxwell to put the thinking dog to sleep. Maxwell is reported to have responded, in Bartlebyesque fashion, "I'd like to keep it." Roger Angell is not and never has been an easy editor to face down, but this was no contest. If you look back at The New Yorker issues of Oct. 1 and Oct. 8, 1979, you will find the thinking dog there thinking away, to say nothing of taking note and imagining. He probably suspects that some time ago someone wanted to rub him out, and he may even pause to wonder why you're there checking on him.
Maxwell, who died last month at the age of 91, was widely regarded as a sweet and gentle man. And he was -- sometimes, in his writing and editorial sensibility and in his personal and social lives, almost to the point of preciousness. If you told him that you had just taken your son to camp or that your wife had burned a roast the night before, his eyes might fill with tears. A few wiseacres at The New Yorker sometimes referred to him as "Waterworks." The atmosphere at the dinner table in his apartment on East 86th Street could be so literary and artistic that it seemed to depart the hardscrabble world entirely. (Maxwell's wife, Emily, who died the week before he did, was a painter.) A lot about Tolstoy and two Elizabeths -- Bowen and Bishop. The voices so quiet and modest that they could hardly be heard. And his taste in literature could be very special. For example, he loved the elf stories of Sylvia Townsend Warner and insisted that one after another be published in The New Yorker. They were antic and -- to the mind of many of us -- limited creations, and they ceased their New Yorker materializations the minute Maxwell retired from the magazine's staff in 1976. But he stuck by them until the end. In a letter in November 1999, responding to my teasing him about those pieces, he wrote, "Your inability to get any pleasure in Sylvia's Elfin stories has driven me back to the book. I read the first story last night and was beside myself with pleasure." 
 So within Maxwell's delicacy there lurked a terse kind of assurance. In his writing, some of his sweet sentences and many of his neutral ones pull up short -- end abruptly, even curtly, as if he were requiring his language and his own voice to return to plain speech and unsweetened reality. From "Over by the River": "A child got into an orange minibus and started on the long devious ride to nursery school and social adjustment." "He smiled pleasantly at George and watched Puppy out of the corner of his eyes, so as to be ready when she leapt at his throat."
More often than one might at first realize, the gentility of his style falls away altogether, and when it does, it reveals the frank and sometimes grim man who was always standing behind it and was perhaps using civility of expression in part to make more emphatic the awful shocks that -- since his own mother's death when he was a child -- he knew lie in wait for almost all of us. From "So Long, See You Tomorrow": "Boys are, from time to time, found hanging from a rafter or killed by a shotgun believed to have gone off accidentally. The wonder is it happens so seldom." From "Over by the River": "If people knew how little he cared whether they lived or died, they wouldn't want to have anything to do with him."
In his conversation and his actions, Maxwell embodied this tension between civilization and its discontents, between the longing for a rational and cultured life and the bad luck and regrets and emotional anarchy that sabotage it. During those high-toned dinner discussions, when something difficult or bitter came up, as it sometimes did, you could feel both Maxwell and his wife not only accepting its arrival but almost welcoming it. In a letter to me he wrote: "Bad behavior one never really regrets in any serious way."
In 1975, when I was training to be a fiction editor -- working in Maxwell's office every day -- I handed him some poems of mine, hoping that he would see the genius that resided in them but that others had always been blind to. Maxwell handed the poems back to me the next day and said, "Stick to prose." As an editor, Maxwell was similarly concise and efficient. In the later part of his career he was in the office only three days a week but got six days' worth of work done. (And he took an hour's nap every day.) He read, edited and responded to stories with remarkable promptness and unfailing courtesy and professionalism. Despite his sometimes rarefied literary inclinations, he was always open to strange and tough writing. And his editorial hand was the subtlest, least cavalier I've ever seen. "Don't touch a hair on its head," he would say when I began to scout around for ways to show off at the expense of perfectly good writing. Unlike many editors today, he felt that his first responsibility was to the text, not to himself or to the company that paid him. In that way, in the way of the artist, he was subversive. And although he enjoyed praise and gratitude, they never seemed to go to his head; he never usurped the primary role of the author or congratulated himself or became puffed up about his sharp eye for talent or his eminent position. If he wanted an editorial change and the writer refused to go along, Maxwell never got angry. He would give way but seldom change his mind. Once, when I was frustrated about an author's resistance to fixing an obvious problem, Maxwell said to me, "It's all right -- apparently, it's a mistake she needs to make." Often, when the writer saw that Maxwell would give way, with grace, he himself would give way. It was an editorial version of kung fu -- of winning by seeming to yield. But of course it was not combat; it was help.
I went to see Maxwell a few days before his death. He was lying in a hospital bed in his apartment. His family and friends were hovering in the living room and dining room, signing remembrance books, discussing the calligraphy and the exquisite paper. There was some discussion about whom Maxwell wanted to see and whom he didn't. He was impossibly thin and frail-looking, but he smiled and his eyes were warm. I went to sit in a chair, but he motioned me over to sit on the side of his bed. "It's so lovely to see you," he said. "I've decided there's not much reason to stick around, now that Emmy's gone, and I'm doing my best never to take another bite of food." I said, "I hope you'll change your mind about that," and then I couldn't say any more. Maxwell gripped my arm with surprising firmness, as if to say, hold on. "When my mother died and I was 10," he said, "a man came to the door ostensibly to pay his respects to my father. But my father suspected that the man came in triumph or glee about my mother's death. It may have had something to do with a sexual secret. In any case, my father opened the door, saw who it was, and slammed the door in the man's face so hard that the house shook. I had never seen him do anything like that before, and I never knew until that moment that anyone could be so direct and angry in polite circles. And I haven't forgotten it since."
As Maxwell told me this story, all I understood about it was that it seemed at once disturbing and obliquely flattering. And that the elegant economy of its telling somehow kept me from falling apart altogether. The more I've thought about it since, the stronger it has grown in my mind as a distillation of Maxwell's character, at least as I saw it: the perduring influence of his parents; his spare, sure sense of narrative; his concern about decorum and its chronic destruction by love and hate; his capacity for blunt honesty; and the openness and trust of his friendship, which lasted through his final days.

 The Twilight of American Culture
 By Morris Berman.
 205 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $23.95. 
 Morris Berman is best known as the author of a trilogy on human consciousness. He has now devoted a book to a society -- our own -- that he believes is lacking in both humanity and consciousness. Indeed, "The Twilight of American Culture" is an impassioned indictment of contemporary life: the "toxicity" of corporate capitalism, the "nakedly sick" enterprise of deconstruction, the poor spelling of public signs and the "incomprehensible" conversation overheard on a Greyhound bus. If you'd like to combine the anti-multinational rage of a black-clad Seattle protester with the mordant cultural despair of a Hilton Kramer or Jacques Barzun, here is your man.
Relying on the writings of the great pessimist Oswald Spengler as well as on a drawerful of articles from Harper's and other magazines, Berman compares the predicament of contemporary America with that of the Roman Empire in its final days. Just like Rome, the United States suffers from an increasing gap between rich and poor, a teeming bazaar of eccentric faiths and a general dumbing-down of the collective intelligence. Today, democracy means "the right to shop, or to choose between Wendy's and Burger King," while the "corporate takeover of intellectual property" has resulted in "the replacement of intelligent citizens by mindless consumers." Despite all of America's entrepreneurial "dynamism," a new dark age is falling. "For those seduced by noise, toys and technology, the current transformation to a global economy is nothing less than cultural efflorescence. For those who place their values elsewhere . . . the very transformation . . . is ultimately every bit as dark as the early Middle Ages." Since he believes that during the Dark Ages "most people forgot how to read or think," this is bad news indeed.
While Berman asserts that it is futile to battle the corporate oligarchy, he does recommend an alternative way of life that he labels "the monastic option." Like the medieval monks who preserved brittle classical manuscripts on their wind-swept Atlantic retreats, certain new monastic individuals (N.M.I.'s for short) are preparing civilization's eventual revival. In the most interesting portions of his book, Berman cites a number of men and women who "resist" the "global corporate world order" by boycotting Starbucks and recognizing the difference between "hype" and "reality." He admires the Vancouver-based Adbusters magazine and the filmmaker Michael Moore for "exposing the emptiness of the corporate/commercial way of life"; he admires Earl Shorris's Clemente course for teaching the Great Books to the poor, and The Concord Review for encouraging high school students to produce rigorously researched history papers.
But does Berman really wish these endeavors success? After all, he champions new monastic individuals for knowing that they "need to stay out of the public eye," and that they are "likely to be more significant for being marginal." Therefore, he questions Shorris's decision to accept federal funding for the Clemente course, and worries that Moore may become merely "a commodity of an 'alternative' sort." Then again, Berman's advocacy of renunciation only goes so far. He sees nothing wrong with his favorite (federally funded) National Public Radio program or with Moore's expose of Nike's C.E.O., Phil Knight: "From a 'monastic' point of view, it is important for American audiences to see such people close up." Visibility is to be avoided, except when it isn't.
In general, Berman's broad-brush approach to social criticism makes Spengler look like Seurat. Writing about the Dark Ages, he tells us that "the intellectual disciplines of distinction, definition and dialectic" were lost. Perhaps Berman should try to find them. It's hard to credit a complaint about the decline of literacy from a writer who speaks of "a parade of mental theme parks," or whose idea of qualifying an argument is to maintain that "a descent into real barbarism" is "certainly possible, and may even occur to some degree toward the end of the 21st century, perhaps for a short period of time." With tongue partly in cheek, Berman likes to pronounce impressive-sounding numbers: "In terms of what's made available via the world of commercial publishing, 96 percent of it is pretty much the same stuff"; "millions of Americans already don't know the difference between fiction and nonfiction." Apparently, the author is among those Americans who see little reason to provide any evidence for their most sweeping statements of fact.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
All the Basics Of a Mexico Trip

BYLINE: By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON; MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON lives in San Diego.

 BODY:
AS temperatures drop in much of the United States, travelers' daydreams may turn to Mexico. Its warm climate, relaxed pace, miles of beaches and value continue to attract visitors from the north; the Mexico-United States border is one of the busiest in the world.
Yet despite friendly relations and ease of access, travelers to Mexico need to remember that they are entering a foreign country. Visitors require proof of citizenship: a valid passport or birth certificate (or certified copy) is best, although pedestrian day-trippers crossing at the San Ysidro border near San Diego can get by with a California driver's license. 
 When in Mexico, you should carry a copy of your birth certificate or passport identification page. Naturalized United States citizens should carry their naturalization certificate numbers. Minors (under 18) traveling without their parents must show proof of citizenship and a notarized, signed letter of consent from both parents; a minor accompanied by one parent must have a notarized, signed letter of consent from the other parent, or divorce, death certificate or guardianship papers.
Since July 1, 1999, Mexico has required an entry fee (about $18, at 9.45 pesos to the dollar) for those who wish to travel farther than 16 miles from the border (in Baja, as far as Ensenada or San Felipe, and in Sonora, as far as Puerto Penasco), or stay more than three days. This fee is included in the air fare of flights into Mexico.
For those driving or walking into Mexico, a tourist card must be obtained at a Mexican immigration office at the border. The entry fee (for the card) must be paid at a bank, usually nearby, where the card is stamped "paid." The card must then be taken back to the immigration office for validation. If no nearby bank is open, the immigration office can stamp it pending payment and final validation, which must be within a day or two. It allows travelers to stay up to 180 days; it's useful to make a copy of the permit.
 
Auto Insurance
Anyone wishing to take a car across the border must have a valid driver's license from his country as well as insurance with a Mexican company. Many insurance offices along the United States side of the border sell this. AAA members can buy Mexican auto insurance in border states. You can also shop online, where a range of agencies provide quotes and rates and will fax or mail a policy to you. One company, Bajabound (www.bajabound.com), lets you print out the policy.
Besides simple liability coverage (usually about $10 a day, with a deductible of $500 to $1,000), you can buy additional coverage for legal and/or medical services, theft and personal liability. A useful Web site, www.mexonline.com, lets you search for online insurance companies and law firms.
Some car rental companies (Hertz, Dollar and Avis among them) allow their cars into Mexico, though you must buy Mexican insurance at the counter. There may be limits on which models you can rent and how far you can go. Within Mexico, the same companies have offices in larger cities and at major airports, and fewer restrictions.
Using travelocity.com, I found these prices to be surprisingly competitive. For instance, at the Tijuana or Acapulco airports, an economy two-door manual model from Avis, without air-conditioning but with unlimited mileage, and including the mandatory Mexican liability insurance, was quoted at $149 a week plus 10 percent tax. Some companies require collision-damage-waiver insurance as well, covering the rental car, although this is included when you use many major credit cards.
To take your own vehicle into Mexico and go outside the 16-mile border area or beyond the Baja peninsula or Sonora free trade zone, you must go to Mexican customs at the border and present an original, plus one copy, of the following: proof of citizenship, your tourist permit, a valid vehicle registration or title in the driver's name (or a leasing contract in the name of the person driving the car), a valid driver's license and an international credit card in the driver's name. (An effort last year to require a hefty deposit, of up to $800, for vehicles driven into Mexico was suspended in January.)
Your credit card will be charged the equivalent of $10 and you'll be issued a temporary (180 days) importation permit. (Those without a credit card must post a sizable bond.) Do not leave the permit in the glove compartment, and on leaving Mexico have it canceled at customs. A separate permit and ownership is necessary for each vehicle; for instance, in the case of an RV carrying a motorcycle, each vehicle must be registered to a different owner, and each must be present and provide documentation.
 
The Tangle of Accidents
Try to avoid, at all costs, having a road accident in Mexico. As in the United States, they can be treated as criminal cases if there is injury, death, significant property damage, or evidence of drugs or alcohol. The drivers involved are likely to be detained until the charges and damages have been sorted out. Charges that may be applied include imprudence, a kind of criminal negligence.
A representative of the public prosecutor's office will come to the scene and ask the drivers for statements. Although not required, it is considered useful to do so; you have the right to have a person you trust -- a friend, relative, lawyer, or even someone from the American Consulate, should you request it -- present while you are questioned. If there is only property damage, the police may ask the parties to negotiate a settlement, in which case they all sign an agreement (be sure to contact your insurance company first; the larger agencies have 24-hour hot lines with adjusters who speak English) and the vehicles are released.
Even if no agreement is reached, arrests are rare in property damage cases unless it appears that alcohol, drugs or reckless driving are involved. The penal code provides that a valid Mexican insurance policy will guarantee bail in cases where the charge is negligence or imprudence; however, additional charges of excessive speeding or driving under the influence may not allow for release. Bail is paid to a court official, never to a police officer.
If no agreement is reached, or if there are injuries, your vehicle may be impounded for as long as the investigation lasts, even if you feel the accident was not your fault. But sometimes you can post a bond, which may be covered by your Mexican insurance. In any case, you must report any accident to your insurance company's claims office before leaving Mexico.
To avoid these problems, drive defensively, at or below the speed limit, in daytime, sober and where possible, on Mexico's expensive but high-quality toll roads and away from city traffic. Watch for extreme speed bumps, called topes, at the entry to towns, and keep an eye out for potholes. At stop signs, be generous with the right of way. To make a left turn on a busy two-lane highway with no left-turn lane, pull onto the right shoulder and wait for an opening.
If you're lost in a larger town or city, the AAA advises hiring a taxi driver to lead you to your destination, settling the cost in advance. A red circle with a diagonal line across a large "E" means no parking. The word cuota designates a toll road.
If the police issue you a ticket that you think you did not deserve, take the officer's name and number and ask to speak to the police chief or supervisor at the nearest police station. If this doesn't work, pay the ticket, on the spot if necessary, but if possible at a bank, getting a receipt; then register a complaint with the Secretariat of Tourism at (01-800) 903-9200 toll free, or, within Mexico City, (5) 250-0123 or (5) 250-0151. The secretariat also has a Web site, www.safeMexico.com, that provides safety tips and advice for specific cities and regions.
Motorists in Mexico are fortunate to have the Green Angels, road patrols that help stranded vehicles. Their free services include emergency fuel, towing to a nearby garage, primary first aid, protection, mechanical repairs and tire changes; motorists pay for parts, gas and oil (tips are accepted). They can be enlisted by calling a toll-free number, (01-800) 903-9200; in case of a breakdown on a major highway, park completely on a shoulder, lift the hood and await a patrol; they cruise the highways frequently in marked green-and white trucks and in green uniforms.
Those who would like to forgo responsibility for a vehicle might consider the Mexican bus system, which can be quite pleasant, though smoking is permitted. First- or deluxe-class buses usually have air-conditioning, reclining seats and footrests, restrooms, free snacks and beverages. Travelers going to out-of-the-way places may require second- or third-class buses, but there are very few villages not on some bus route.
Ferries ply the Gulf of California between Baja and the mainland: from Santa Rosalia to Guaymas, and from La Paz to Topolobampo, and Mazatlan. Schedules and rates change frequently; call (01-800) 696-9600 within Mexico for information.
The Secretariat of Tourism has travel hot lines: (800) 446-3942 for the United States; (800) 482-9832 to the Mexico City office from the United States; and within Mexico, (01-800) 903-9200.

Investing Is the New Spending

BYLINE: By Jeff Turrentine; Jeff Turrentine, a senior editor at Architectural Digest, has written about finance for Forbes FYI, Spin and The Los Angeles Times Book Review.

 BODY:
In May, as he bickered with Gov. George W. Bush over the wisdom of allowing individuals to invest portions of their Social Security withholding taxes, Vice President Al Gore made a startling admission: he hadn't made a single dollar from the bull market. In fact, Gore explained, to avoid any conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, he didn't even own stock, and hadn't since 1976, when he first joined Congress. The man fighting for ultimate stewardship of American fiscal policy had taken a pass on the greatest investment opportunity of our time in favor of an interest-bearing checking account.
The vice president clearly expected that the news would inspire confidence; instead, it inspired Fortune magazine to suggest he could be "a financial dolt." In this era of skyrocketing returns, what inspires confidence is the knowledge that an enormous chunk of your personal wealth derives from securities, especially those in the risky but potentially lucrative technology sector. Stock-market savvy has saturated every corner of society. (Liberty Financial now markets a special mutual fund to clients as young as 11.) By opting out, Gore lost serious street cred -- or at least Wall Street cred. 
 In a telling update of the mores established during the 80's, conspicuous equity seems to have supplanted conspicuous consumption as the most effective means of broadcasting your wealth and status. Back in the day when greed was good and barbarians were at the gate, visible symbols of wealth like Rolexes and BMW's were the rage -- but it was still considered slightly gauche to ask someone about his private investments. Almost a decade into the current bull market, for a small but significant group of young and successful individuals, investing has become the new spending. They are deferring the purchase of cars, houses, trips, home furnishings and the like, deciding instead to keep their dollars in the market, where they can generate even more purchasing power in the future. Call it the front-loading of the American dream. Expensive gadgets that help facilitate their investments are legitimate purchases, even status symbols. But mere luxury items, like Marc Jacobs suits and Land Rovers, seem more and more like indulgences, better saved for later. Much later, when you are ready to retire. You know, like at 40.
But why? I ask Bruce Gibney, a 24-year-old law student who majored in engineering at Stanford. "The chance that you'll make money now is so good, so obvious, that people just seem profligate if they're not putting it in the market," he explains. As a result, the pressure among his peers to announce their latest market triumphs can be huge. "Your investment in the market reflects your status. One, it reflects your intelligence, and two, it reflects how connected you are. It's not about being invited to one of Mr. and Mrs. Astor's parties anymore; it's how many people you know in really good start-ups. Or you mention 'Series A' -- that's a great way to get somebody's attention: 'I was in Series A, I was in the seed round, I got in for pennies a share.' "
Erich Fritz, a 31-year-old manager at an international consulting firm, moved to Seattle last spring and rented a loft. The cavernous space cries out for high-end, high-modern accouterments, but Erich has furnished the place like a room at Motel 6. "Just last Friday I got a sofa, a coffee table and a desk," he says. "Before Friday I had a bed, and that was it. I was actually sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor for the first two weeks. If you're single and really focusing on your career and investing in your future, it's really not so hard at the end of the day to come home and just shrug and say, 'What the hell, I'll sleep on the floor.' "
And when you get right down to it, does any rich adult really need his own apartment? Earlier this year, Dan Lurie, 34, left Los Angeles and moved in with his sister, brother-in-law and their new baby in a small town near Charlotte, N.C. He barters for his room and board, helping out with household chores and assisting them in their business. He drives a Mazda he bought used. But Dan is hardly a slacker. He is an investor. In January he set a goal of making a certain amount (he's shy about the number, but it's in the low six figures) by the end of the year. Through his success in buying and trading "leaps," or options that are realizable nine months or more in the future, he reached his goal in July. He has now set a new goal for December, nearly twice as high as the first. For now he's allowing himself only one consumer fantasy. "I've talked to some friends about investing in a farm. We could get a hundred acres for $200,000 and put three houses on it. We could have a big organic vegetable garden and trade stocks all day." And as for the long term? "I've always wanted to be semiretired by 40," he tells me. "I want to travel around the world."
That's the dream: stocks now, the world at 40. Retirement at 40. Dinner parties and families and novels at 40. I heard it again and again as I talked to these prudent 20- and 30-somethings. But I worry for them about how possible it will be to achieve.
Not just because there is no telling where the market will land. (Though when everything you've got can fit in an Ameritrade account, the difference between guessing right and losing the farm can come down to perilously little.) The market is risky, but these guys know that. They've all lost money at one point or another. And if they think they can stay one step ahead of the Dow -- well, they might very well be right.
The more relevant question is not where the market will land, but where these eager workaholics will land. It's one thing to work hard during the week to make sure your weekend is free; these guys are signing over at least two solid decades of their lives -- to the willful exclusion of a comfortable home life, time to spend with friends, small indulgences and who knows what else. They think that if they hold on just a little longer, let things ride through one more uptick, they'll reach a plateau at which they can trade in their 80-hour-a-week grind for an eternity of leisurely, unstructured fun. But what are the odds that, having spent their entire lives in the glow of a computer screen, they will be able to reinvent themselves in middle age as carefree bons vivants? Of all the speculations they've made, the most sanguine by far is the gamble that they'll be able to enjoy the life they've worked so hard to buy.

Chart: "My Happy Birthday Portfolio"
"I am 10 years old and already own several stocks. When I was in the fourth grade, my classmates and I entered our local newspaper's stock contest. We chose five stocks. . . . After one year of recording, the best was Home Depot.
After my 10th birthday, my dad suggested that instead of using my birthday money to buy toys, I should buy stock. . . . What was it that led me to Home Depot? To tell you the truth, I hated the trips to Home Depot with my parents. They bought so much and spent hours in that store. But the aisles are fully stocked, the checkout lines packed and the parking lot filled with cars.
I also chose Home Depot for a second reason: HGTV (Home and Garden Television), one of several home-improvement shows on television. To do those projects, you need supplies. Where do you go? Home Depot.
Here's the third reason: customer service. . . . Since I have purchased Home Depot stock, it has split and its value has increased." -- Bethany Murphy, quoted in The Stein Roe Young Investor Fund Quarterly Newsletter.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 10-15-00: Economics Of An Underdog Campaign;
The Price of Admission

BYLINE: By Kerry Lauerman

 BODY:

The First Half-Million Is the Hardest
In the summer of 1999, David Johnson -- an Indianapolis attorney active in Indiana's Democratic Party -- decided to challenge Senator Richard Lugar, a four-term senator and onetime Republican presidential nominee. He immediately retained the services of Fred Yang, a pollster, and Frank Greer, a media consultant, who offered this advice: raise money. It makes you look like a serious candidate, he explained, thereby allowing you to raise still more money. Johnson, a political insider, knew whom to call. He took a leave of absence from his law firm and hit the phones; by the end of the year, he had amassed close to $500,000.
 
Hire a Penny Pincher
In February, Johnson hired a campaign manager: Tim Shock, a Democratic political consultant with a reputation for upsets. Because he'd have to commute from Kentucky, his salary was relatively high -- about $10,000 a month. But he kept a close eye on incidental spending. "Nobody can authorize an expense, any expense, except me," Shock said. He guided Johnson to hire a press secretary and two field managers, who joined a finance manager and three fund-raisers already on staff. Total monthly salaries: about $20,000. He ordered "Johnson for Senate" signs and bumper stickers that were low gloss, chose adhesive lapel stickers (25,000 for $400) rather than pins (as much as 70 cents apiece) and had Johnson driven around, rather than flown, even on 10-hour round trips. Meanwhile Johnson kept raising money, and by late June he was up to $1.3 million, far more than Lugar's previous opponent raised but less than half of what Lugar had. 

Make the First Ads Free
In April, The Indianapolis Star gave Lugar a 45-point lead over Johnson. Shock initiated "work days," on which Johnson performed blue-collar jobs around the state in order to meet voters and generate footage for the nightly news. On a typical trip, Johnson and his press secretary traveled an hour and a half to Lafayette (population: 115,624) to give a civics lesson at an after-school class for "at risk" children. Total cost: just over $20, including gasoline ($6.40), sandwiches to eat in the car ($5) and M&M's for the kids ($9.63). It paid off with full media coverage, including a front-page story with photos, in The Lafayette Journal & Courier and a segment on Lafayette's TV station, WLFI.
 
Get Lucky
Then, in July, Lugar's son was arrested for possessing marijuana. The possible upside was not lost on the Johnson campaign. Pinned to the wall of Shock's cubicle are newspaper clippings of the event, along with what looks like a fake joint and a note that reads "Vote for Dick Lugar." But Shock insisted that any attempt to make an issue of it would backfire. "That all stays in here," he said. "Both sides here are playing clean."
 
Make Your Pitch
In August, at the Democratic National Convention, Johnson learned that the party would spend $250,000 on a TV "issue ad" that would "raise questions about Lugar's record," Johnson said, adding, "this is the big time." As party spending goes, it's not much, but it would set off a key series of events. First, the campaign would commission a poll by Yang (from $15,000 to $30,000) to show where voters stood after the ad ran. The campaign would then follow up with a pro-Johnson ad by Greer (between $10,000 to $12,000) -- one that's purely positive, with no mention of Lugar at all," Shock said -- and buy air time (an additional $250,000). The week after the convention, Johnson's campaign had vetted the ad, and air time had been purchased on eight TV stations.
 
The Loneliest Number
But then two weeks after the ad was shown, the terrain shifted dramatically. Lugar, along with former Senator Sam Nunn, was nominated to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. "There's nothing you can do about that," Shock says. Now Johnson is on his own. The Democratic Party has not promised to spend any more money on the race, and the campaign is dipping into its cash reserves. In mid-September (after an Indiana University poll showed Lugar leading Johnson by 43 points), his campaign launched its first ad, for roughly $400,000. In August, Shock had said that if the campaign didn't get a major ad blitz going by the end of that month, the campaign would be facing "major problems." Now he says, "We're doing what we can."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
In St. Louis, Accord Despite a Fiscal Sour Note

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON; Lawrence B. Johnson is the music critic of The Detroit News.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
THE St. Louis Symphony Orchestra arrives at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday and Thursday evenings bearing not only double basses and French horns packed with pride but also other baggage: the same burden of harsh fiscal reality that even in these flush economic times chafes many other American orchestras.
On its tally sheet, the orchestra counts substantial artistic dividends from the music directorship of Hans Vonk, the 58-year-old Dutch conductor now in his fifth season at the helm. There is a palpable spirit of camaraderie inside Powell Symphony Hall, the orchestra's elegantly appointed home. Also in the credit column is a reinvigorated community outreach program, which sends orchestra players into the city and suburbs alike to put a friendly, personal face on classical music. Partnerships with 30 black churches have helped the orchestra become a better citizen of its neighborhood, and the churches have responded by helping put listeners in the audience. The theme of the new classical subscription season is, pointedly, "music for everyone." 
 But all these good things, like a 1998 European tour, which brought glowing reviews, and annual visits to Carnegie Hall, seem to come at a price that isn't quite being met. Over the last 17 or 18 years, the orchestra has accumulated a potentially crippling deficit of $7 million. (Its annual budget is now $26 million for the orchestra itself with an additional $3 million for its music school.)
"The biggest problem will come if we don't look the beast in the eye," said Don Roth, the orchestra's president. The issue is not so much overspending as underfinancing, and Mr. Roth is determined to see the orchestra's endowment increased to $100 million from the current $30 million, and to make sure that all future touring is fully sponsored.
"This orchestra has been built to greatness without the financial underpinning of a great orchestra," Mr. Roth said. "There has been a series of interim, short fixes. But this is where the Band-Aids fall off and you get the cure. Probably for the first time in the history of this organization, we have laid it out plainly to the community and said it's going to take a hundred million to get it done. People haven't backed away from that.
"We're not New York or London. St. Louis doesn't automatically have the best of everything. This is a great city with significant social and economic challenges, and the St. Louis Symphony has the opportunity to provide some of the glue that holds the city together."
To spend a couple of days at Powell Symphony Hall is to see a certain poetic aptness in Mr. Roth's choice of the word "glue." Within its own organization, the St. Louis Symphony is nothing if not cohesive, in a singular spiritual sense. In conversations with the president, the concertmaster and the music director, a visitor could only be impressed by the aura of accord.
Mr. Roth, who has worked as an administrator at five other orchestras, said that since coming here three years ago, he has been surprised by "the tremendous caring and the willingness of the musicians to work with other members of the organization."
"It's even O.K. to be friendly," he said, "and you don't find that in a lot of orchestras."
But at least one cooperative venture between musicians and management has not panned out. Frustrated like many other orchestras by the recording industry's lack of interest in classical projects, the St. Louis Symphony created its own label, Arch Media, last year. The company was run by a board made up of musicians and members of the orchestra's board and staff. The first release, a Beethoven disc, sold 4,200 copies: strong sales for a classical release. But then came the bad news that not even such healthy sales were enough to break even.
Although Arch Media's long-term plans called for complete cycles of the Beethoven, Mahler and Bruckner symphonies conducted by Mr. Vonk, just four CD's were released before costs overwhelmed revenues. Now, only some chamber-music recordings remain in the works. But Mr. Vonk refuses to grouse about the lost opportunity to record Bruckner end to end, parrying a reminder of the abortive venture with a philosophical shrug. It's a dark age for orchestral recording, he allows, and for now there is nothing to be done.
Mr. Roth, less resigned, said the orchestra would continue to record all of its concerts digitally and wait for technology to catch up. He sees a near future when record collectors will be able to log on to the orchestra's Web site, select the works they want to buy and download them on recordable CD's.
AFTER the adventurous and artistically prosperous 17-year stewardship of Leonard Slatkin, who left in 1996 and now directs the National Symphony in Washington and the BBC Symphony in London, the St. Louis Symphony has apparently found a satisfying successor in the old-school Mr. Vonk, despite his radically different approach to music-making. Subscriptions are said to have held steady, neither breaking records nor slumping.
"Leonard Slatkin and Hans Vonk are extremely dissimilar personalities," said David Halen, the orchestra's concertmaster. "The orchestra didn't want a Leonard Slatkin imitator. That would have been an exercise in failure. Leonard made this a virtuoso orchestra. He wanted a certain brilliance in the sound, and he liked to give us extremely difficult music. He always had us on the edge. We would always be sweating bullets at the first concert. But that also made the orchestra really good readers.
"Hans wants a mellower sound, not quite as flashy, with softer edges. But just as important is the change of emphasis in repertoire. Hans comes from the great Dutch tradition of Van Beinum and Mengelberg, and his focus is on the core repertoire: Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler. But he's also wonderful with Stravinsky and French music, and his Tchaikovsky has a Mozartean purity." (The Carnegie programs this week are all Stravinsky.)
Significant changes have also occurred in the makeup of the orchestra itself. Since Mr. Vonk's arrival, the group has experienced a turnover of 20 players, including the principal flutist, the principal trombonist, the principal second violinist, the second trumpeter and the associate principal cellist. The new hires represent another way in which Mr. Vonk is making the orchestra his own.
The music at hand on a recent weekend was Brahms's Second Symphony and Berg's Violin Concerto, with Cho-Liang Lin as soloist. The sound that resonated through Powell Symphony Hall, a restored vaudeville theater and movie house, which has served as the orchestra's home since 1968, offered a veritable checklist of the qualities Van Beinum and Mengelberg shared: precision, clarity, subtlety. Mr. Vonk, who prefers good style and expressive playing to virtuoso display, elicited a Brahms Second that was as much chamber music as grand symphony. His tempos were expansive, his musical gestures elegant. Even in the finale's last rousing burst of trumpets, his restraining hand was evident.
In time, he hopes, the Dutch tradition will also carry Mahler to the hearts of St. Louis audiences. "I really don't understand it, but our subscribers have no real enthusiasm for Mahler," he said. "I grew up at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, where Bruckner and Mahler were revered like Beethoven."
Mr. Vonk seems to harbor no doubt that he can bring authentic Mahler to the Midwest. He dismisses any notion that European orchestras come to the core masterworks with an inherent cultural advantage. "It's nonsense," he said. "The standard of American orchestras, even in the second and third category, is incredibly high."
Mr. Vonk offers that assessment in the light of a long, far-ranging and sometimes tumultuous career. His first directorship was at the Netherlands Ballet, where in 1962 he met his wife, Jessie, then a teenage prima ballerina. He later directed the Netherlands Opera, the Hague Residentie Orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle and Dresden State Opera and, most recently, the Cologne Radio Symphony. His Dresden sojourn, from 1985 to 1990, in the twilight of the East German Communist regime, proved a trial by fire. He describes a constant run of political bickering, inadequate staff support and forbidden socializing between conductor and musicians, all capped by a bureaucratic cabal to oust him.
By comparison, Mr. Vonk's only real difficulty in St. Louis is that albatross of a deficit, not cause enough for him to rethink his commitment. He recently signed a contract extension that will keep him in St. Louis through the 2004-05 season. Indeed, in the easygoing atmosphere of Powell Symphony Hall, surrounded by musicians and administrators who value his Dutch heritage, Mr. Vonk appears to be settled in for the long haul. He has shown that he is not a quitter, and he knows that cultivating a tradition takes time.
"You have your ups and downs in life," he said, recalling old hopes of becoming music director of the great Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, a post that instead went for the first time to a non-Dutchman, the Italian Riccardo Chailly, in 1988. "For a long time I was in the picture to succeed Bernard Haitink. That didn't work out for me. Now I am here, and I truly believe I'm in the best position I could possibly be in."
Or he will be, if Mr. Roth and the St. Louis Symphony can shed those fiscal Band-Aids and find their $100 million cure.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
It's Great to Be a Playwright, but Oh, the Pain

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN; Mervyn Rothstein, an editor in the Real Estate section of The New York Times, frequently writes about theater.

 BODY:
THEATER is stressful," says Neil Simon. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards is back in New York for his 31st play, "The Dinner Party." But getting to the city wasn't easy. He had planned to arrive from his home on the West Coast on Sept. 15 for the start of rehearsals, but found himself laid up with a stomach ailment that refused to go away.
"So many times when I do a play I wind up having a physical problem," said Mr. Simon, 73, sitting in the living room of his Park Avenue apartment recently and looking somewhat thin. "I made a list the other day, and I thought of 11 of them -- all over my body, in so many different places. But I know there are others I haven't remembered." 
 When he was doing "Broadway Bound" in Washington in 1986, he said, he thought he was having a heart attack on opening night -- "I wasn't, but it felt like it" -- and he had to be taken to a hospital. "When 'Jake's Women' was first done in San Diego," he said, "I bent down and my back went out and I had to go the hospital. When 'The Dinner Party' was in Los Angeles, I had a 10-day headache. The mind does this for you."
His friends ask him why he still feels such stress, since he has written so many hit plays and the success or failure of the latest one is not going to change his life. "But it has nothing to do with that," he said. "It has to do with the work, and wanting the work to be good, wanting to make it the best I can make it."
The symptoms of physical distress don't occur during the actual writing and rewriting, he said, they happen before or after. And they don't show up when he is working on a movie. "The difference," he noted, "is that a movie isn't opening in one city, in one theater, with a handful of critics, and it's not being judged the night the critics come."
"The Dinner Party" opens on Thursday at the Music Box Theater, after an earlier run in Los Angeles and a critically praised sold-out month in Washington. Its subject is marriage and divorce. The cast -- Len Cariou, Veanne Cox, Penny Fuller, Jan Maxwell, John Ritter and Henry Winkler -- is directed by John Rando.
Set in an exclusive Paris restaurant, the play is little more than an hour and a half long and is performed without an intermission. Three French men, recipients of a mysterious invitation, arrive at the restaurant, not knowing for sure why they are there. Gradually, the three other guests -- their former wives -- also arrive, and what has started out as a seemingly classic French farce is transformed into an often serious look, with a leavening of humor, at the sadnesses and despairs of marital bliss turned cold. It is Mr. Simon's take on why couples break up, on why even loving and caring mates can sometimes be heartlessly cruel to each other.
Speaking of the audiences that saw the play in Los Angeles and Washington, Mr. Simon said: "There's a vicarious thing that happens to them. They're viewing something that may have gone on in their own lives and are very happy to let other people be the spokesmen for what their feelings are."
The three couples have been divorced four times -- one couple married twice and divorced twice. Mr. Simon himself has been married five times to four women. His first wife, Joan Baim, died of cancer in 1973. He subsequently wed three actresses: Marsha Mason, then Diane Lander (twice), and ultimately Elaine Joyce, his current wife.
But Mr. Simon takes great pains to distance himself personally from his play. "It's very important for me to delineate that the play is not about me," he said, "nor are there references to any of the marriages."
"The Dinner Party," he explained, was conceived two years ago, at a house he had rented in East Hampton on Long Island: "I was out there alone, and the theme of divorce came to me, because it has been so prevalent in my own life, and in the lives of my friends. But I truthfully never thought about any of my own marriages, or my own feelings about them. I tried to deal with these characters purely as characters I was writing about."
That was one reason he set the play in Paris -- "to make it far away from the problems we have here."
"Maybe I was also influenced by French films," he added, "because the French are very much more open about personal things than we are. But what I tried to do was to make it universal."
In attempting to create a "bonfire, a clash between these people, of why they got divorced, and how they feel about each other," he was also trying to write a play very different from anything he had done before.
"There's something for me that's a little abstract about the play," he said, "certainly compared to my other plays. I had the concept of creating a farce up to a certain point, and then instead of continuing the farce, to make a turn to where it becomes quite serious. I wanted to break the concept that farces can never get real, even for a minute."
The play is also unusual for Mr. Simon because of its short length and lack of intermission. "I couldn't find a place to break it," he said. "And I didn't see it as a long play. I also think that today's audiences are not as patient as they used to be. Most of my plays have run two and a half hours or so. But when we did the revival of 'The Sunshine Boys' with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, we cut about 20 or 25 minutes, and it was much better. So I found that one can be more concise with things, rather than go on and on."
Does the bleakness in the play reflect his feelings about marriage? "In any marriage that breaks up, there's bleakness," Mr. Simon said. Even in the best of marriages, people can be cruel to each other. "But you can't leave out the other half, the wonderful things people say to each other. I try to cover both.
"At times all of us who are married say, 'Why am I in this thing? Why did I do this?' Who's to say that because you get married, every day is a wonderful day? It's not."
Not many people are lucky enough to get the partners they would like to have, he said, "and so they settle."
"If you marry the right person, a person you can work things out with, who's loving and giving and sharing, you're very lucky," he said. "I only expected to be married once in my life. Joan died, and I was thrust into a whole other life."
Even his first marriage wasn't perfect, he said, though he may have idealized it in his autobiographies, "Rewrites" and "The Play Goes On." "We had our ups and downs," he recalled. "But it was a true marriage in that we married for the right reasons. We fell in love. I was not Neil Simon then; just a kid scraping to make a few dollars. We married because we loved each other. That's not to say that that didn't happen in the other marriages."
But, he said, he does not want to talk about the other marriages -- it's too personal. "I'm married now," he said. "I'm very happy. I don't like the idea of being married four or five times. But that's what happened. I guess I could have gone the other way and said, after the last divorce, 'That's it, I'm not going to do it any more.' But I'm kind of an optimist."
It would seem the case in his professional life as well. Mr. Simon has been writing for the Broadway theater for almost 40 years now, since "Come Blow Your Horn" in 1961, and so far, despite the stress, he has shown no signs of letting up. "It's what I do," he said.
Over the last four decades, Mr. Simon has had many successes, among them "Barefoot in the Park" and "The Odd Couple" in the 60's, "The Sunshine Boys" and "Chapter Two" in the 70's, and "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound" in the 80's. In 1991, he won the Pulitzer Prize for "Lost in Yonkers."
But he has also had his share of flops. And he has not had a major hit in the last nine years. In 1995, after the failures on Broadway of the musical "The Goodbye Girl" and "Laughter on the 23rd Floor" -- that play wound up losing about $800,000 -- Mr. Simon and Emanuel Azenberg, his producer, announced with some fanfare that the next play, "London Suite," would be presented Off Broadway. Because of the high costs, it was not economically viable to go to Broadway anymore, the two men said, pointing out at the time that the play would cost $1.6 million to produce on Broadway compared with $660,000 Off Broadway.
BUT "London Suite" failed -- Mr. Simon said that in retrospect the reason they didn't take it to Broadway was that deep inside they knew it wasn't good enough -- and Mr. Azenberg and Mr. Simon were Broadway bound again in 1997 with Mr. Simon's 30th play, "Proposals," even though they said the economics had in fact become worse. But "Proposals" was also a flop. And now, three years later, they are back again.
"We were very careful with 'The Dinner Party,' " said Mr. Azenberg, who has been producing Mr. Simon's plays since 1972. "When it opened at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, we didn't think it was right for Broadway. But we've got to give the Mark Taper people credit. They brought it into the Kennedy Center in Washington. There were cast changes that suddenly caused a change in the play and a change in the reviews." The economics are "still crazy," he said, "but this is where Neil is comfortable. And there was a time when Neil Simon and Broadway were synonymous."
Because the set already existed, the play is capitalized at $1.2 million instead of the expected $1.7 million or $1.8 million, Mr. Azenberg said. Part of it, he said -- "not a minor amount" -- is Mr. Simon's own money. "He always backs his own stuff, win or lose," Mr. Azenberg said.
Mr. Simon said the recent spate of failures does not concern him. "I love the sitting down and the writing," he said. "I read this in a book about Edward Albee, and it amazed me because it's so much the way I think. He said, 'Oh, I've got an idea for a play -- I'm set for the year.' I have those feelings, too."
And besides, he said: "I've had more hits than I ever thought I would have. I don't expect to win five Pulitzer Prizes. One is enough."

HEADLINE: Answering a Calling To Make You Believe

 BODY:
LAST Sunday in these pages, two Americans, the actress Mary-Louise Parker and the director and former actor Joe Mantello, who went to theater school together, talked about the proper education of actors and audiences.
In the dialogue below, Eileen Atkins and Alan Bates, two British actors of an earlier generation (they are both 66), discuss how actors develop from the moment they realize there is no other suitable profession. 
 Mr. Bates and Ms. Atkins are starring in "The Unexpected Man" by Yasmina Reza, the author of "Art." Now in previews at the Promenade Theater, the play opens on Oct. 24 and, like "Art," has been translated from the French by Christopher Hampton and directed by Matthew Warchus.
Ms. Atkins won an Olivier Award for her performance in the original 1998 London production of "The Unexpected Man," opposite Michael Gambon. Mr. Bates has not appeared on a New York stage since Simon Gray's "Butley" in 1973, for which he won a Tony Award.
Unlike "Art," "The Unexpected Man," which is set on a train, does not allow its two characters to speak directly to each other until the final moments. With that in mind, The New York Times invited the two stars to talk, over lunch in London late last month, about their lives as actors. They were joined by Matt Wolf, the London theater critic for Variety. Following are excerpts from the taped conversation:
ALAN BATES -- We've never worked together, although we've always wanted to, from the days when it was just remotely possible for us to play Romeo and Juliet. We talked about it for years, and then we began to laugh because we realized we weren't going to get the offer. Now we're actually doing it.
EILEEN ATKINS -- And we don't have to worry about Mercutio.
BATES -- Laughs No.
MATT WOLF -- But why be an actor? And what is it about Britain that breeds so many?
BATES -- It has nothing to do with being in this country. You want to be an actor because you want to be an actor. You suddenly realize that's what you want to do. In my case, when I was 11.
ATKINS -- You have to be an actor -- in my case, when I was 12 -- there's no choice.
BATES -- People say, "What made you want to be an actor?" and you don't know, there isn't an answer. But you can guess at a few things. I never expressed myself. I was quite shy, though I was also quite happy; I wasn't miserable. I think through acting you find you can say things through other people's words and other characters.
ATKINS -- As for actually choosing to be an actor -- we both get this now -- we get young people wanting advice. But if anybody comes to me and says, "Should I become an actor?" I say: "Well, no. If you've got to ask me, no."
WOLF -- Because?
ATKINS -- It's very, very rigorous.
BATES -- You can't just say, "It's something to do because I can't think of anything else." There used to be people at RADA the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London like that who would say, "I couldn't think of what to do, so I'm here."
ATKINS Half my year at drama school was like that; they didn't last very long.
BATES -- They're out in a term. They either can't do it or perhaps they realize they don't want to, which is fair dues. But the profession, too, has changed. When we started, once you were lucky with something, or hit a nerve in audiences, more or less from then on you were in demand. People wanted us the minute we had made a mark. Now, for the most part, there isn't the same hunger. You can do something and then have six months out of work, whereas we got offers and got work and kept going and got used to the fact that we were always working. This generation can't rely on that at all -- with very few exceptions.
I've always felt a huge need to do the theater, and it's never left me. People say "Well, it's where your heart is." And it is there: it is in the doing of it at the same time with the audience present and being in charge of it, unless you've been thrown off course by a director, which can happen, and then you have a miserable time because you can't get back to your own instinct. With television and film, there are other things that are intriguing: acting in the actual location somewhere, acting sometimes very intimately and sometimes with the camera miles away. But there's nothing as big or as complete or as satisfying as the theater.
ATKINS -- I would hate to give the impression, and it's not true, that you don't have to be a very very good actor on screen as well. It is just that there is more freedom for you as an actor in the theater. But you have to be careful not to give in to the theater audience too much. It's very easy to do because you're seducing them, basically. I think there are actors who go out there just determined to seduce.
BATES -- I remember someone coming backstage to me one night after "Butley" in London and saying to me, "You have to be careful that you're leading the audience and that the audience isn't leading you, which of course was what was happening to you tonight." I didn't know how to interpret this, so I just said, "Good night and thank you very much." I realize that what he was saying might have even been true. You have to stay in charge; you've got to keep the lead.
WOLF -- Do American audiences differ from British ones?
ATKINS -- I much prefer Americans.
BATES -- This is rather awful about the rest of the audiences, but the first audiences you get in New York -- and it can last for the better part of six months -- are the best you ever get. They have an enthusiasm, an observation, a concentration. It has been a long time since I've been on the stage there, but I'm told this hasn't changed: you feel the audience participation. They don't feel they're at all above it. They're letting it be what it is, and they like it or they don't.
ATKINS -- It's that enthusiasm, which is that thing about America. They are naturally on the whole -- because we're only speaking in generalizations -- a more enthusiastic race and they show it. They also show it when they don't like it. I quite like the definiteness of that.
BATES -- I don't mind being sent back on the boat. You know where you are, and you can get on with the next job. You don't go dribbling on.
WOLF -- What about different kinds of acting? In films, audiences frequently pay to see a star play versions of himself or herself; it's performance as personality.
BATES -- If you believe what you see, then it's good acting.
ATKINS -- Believability is the whole thing.
BATES -- If the acting is true, if an understanding of character is within you, whether you have to go outside your own shape or vocal range to achieve what you want, it doesn't matter, as long as you understand it and believe it yourself.
ATKINS -- I don't think there are any rules, Alan, do you? It's like Beryl Beryl Reid, Ms. Atkins's co-star in "The Killing of Sister George" 34 years ago used to say, "I've got the shoes; now I've got the part."
BATES -- I love those stories. I don't disbelieve them at all. When I did the film "An Englishman Abroad," I watched a run of it with a friend, and he said, "Where did you get that funny little walk?" -- a kind of drunken shuffle, really. And I didn't know I was doing it. You don't think, "I'll do a funny walk," or whatever.
ATKINS -- They're the best things: when you don't know you're doing them. I had a tiny part in the film of "The Dresser," and an American said, "The way you marched across the bridge at the railway station -- it was so funny: go on, do that walk," and I said, like you, Alan, "I was just walking." But the point is that it is coming from how you're feeling, so I had found this terribly sort of bustly-brisk walk with a much bigger length of stride. And this man said I had busy legs.
WOLF -- Have you changed over time as performers?
BATES -- You're bound to have, but you don't always know how. Life just happens to you, and it's bound to influence you. You probably have more insight as you grow older, though that's not to say that you always see that you're any different. You just hope you're a bit more economical.
I think you change because you must. You must develop -- become more philosophical, more wise, more witty, less witty, more showoffy, whatever. But you can't really talk about it because as an actor you're not supposed to be watching yourself. You're supposed to have a sense of yourself, but not actually stand outside and analyze yourself. I think you would lose an awful lot of your mystery or your spontaneity or your natural instincts if you did. In some ways, you don't change a lot and the reason is because acting is instinctive, and your instincts, hopefully, were always there. You understand more. Maybe that's what changes.
ATKINS -- If you think of yourself as an instrument that you use, the instrument is the same but maybe -- you hope -- it has all got a bit more finely tuned. But if you began thinking about it, you'd be a dead duck. The famous one is when you think, "I really do know how to time things now."
BATES -- Laughs That's hell. And that's when you go out and fall flat on your face because you meet a different audience; you don't meet the audience that you have planned to meet.
ATKINS -- Laughs I love that, Alan. That should be the title of your autobiography: "I didn't meet the audience I planned to meet."
WOLF -- Do you get braver?
BATES -- Yes. You think, "I can do it."
ATKINS -- The older you get, I find, the more you think, "I can't do it at all" and that everybody else is much cleverer. I got into a habit about 20 years ago of suggesting another actress for every part. I remember once, before I did John Schlesinger's production of "Heartbreak House," with Colin Blakely and Kate Nelligan, telling John I couldn't do it. And then I heard he had asked another actress who was even more neurotic and thin and nonmaternal for Hesione Hushabye than I am, so I played it. But mostly, I do tend to think, "Now I wonder if I can play it." It's got worse as I've got older, although I won't say the nerves have got worse because I've always had horrifying nerves.
BATES -- In mock alarm Oh, thank you very much.
ATKINS -- But it is always frightening, isn't it?
BATES -- It's always frightening, yes. And the thing is, the opposite to what you've described also happens. Sometimes you think: "I could do that role. Why have they asked him?" And then you think to yourself, "Oh, perhaps I am 20 years older or too old for the part." You always stay about 40.
ATKINS -- Laughs What do you mean, 40? Twenty-three! You certainly say you're at least 20 years younger than you actually are.
BATES -- The point is, acting is mysterious in the sense that you can't really talk about it. You end up down a blind alley: a dead-end script.
ATKINS -- And you can't learn it. You can learn to be better and improve your technique, but you can't learn the basic talent.
BATES -- No, I don't think you can. Sometimes, when you see a film with nonactors, they can do it once but they don't know what they're doing and they couldn't do it twice; they couldn't do the run of a play. It's there once because they happen to be right for it. It is a craft, but it's a craft that's no good if you're not absolutely born to it in the first place. It can't stand alone as a craft. If you haven't got an actor's own instincts, you've got nothing.

Mixed-Use Development Plan for a Bleak Waterfront

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: PERTH AMBOY, N.J.

 BODY:
IT is not much to look at:a 50-acre slice of Perth Amboy's waterfront dotted with empty factories and polluted, rubble-strewn lots. They are the remnants of industry's exodus in the 1970's from this once-bustling port city across the Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill from Staten Island.
But that is about to change. Last month local officials completed an agreement with a developer to transform this piece of the city's past into a $600 million development, called the Landings at Harborside. It is to mix 2,000 condominium apartments and town houses with a 300-room hotel and some 170,000 square feet of retail space, including restaurants, stores and a movie theater. There will also be parks, a cultural center, a public waterfront promenade and parking for 4,200 cars. 
 The development is the first of several projects expected to get under way in the next 12 to 18 months as part of this city's redevelopment plan to reclaim large swaths of its former industrial land. It is also consistent with the plan's focus on a mix of uses, from housing to retailing and entertainment.
Harborside is to take shape in four phases on the property, parts of which must be cleaned of contaminants, with construction to start next summer. Some 42 families and 15 businesses must be relocated from the site, which is bordered mainly by High Street, Smith Street and Buckingham Avenue. The entire project will take up to eight years to complete, according to the developer, Westminster Communities, an affiliate of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, N.J.
"We're basically building a new city at the water's edge," said Jeffrey Freireich, a principal at both Kushner and Westminster, "and believe the rewards outweigh the risks."
This month local officials also designated an operator to run a high-speed ferry service to Manhattan as well as to build a landing barge and terminal, which along with parking, will rise on nine acres adjacent to Harborside. The operator, Lighthouse Fast Ferry of West Caldwell, N.J., runs two such ferries between the Highlands in Monmouth County and Manhattan and expects to have the Perth Amboy ferry running by next summer.
While many residents feel the redevelopment plan in general and the Harborside project in particular could rejuvenate the city, they are worried about coping with increased traffic and blending the old city with the new. Some people who must relocate are also concerned about moving and finding comparable housing elsewhere in the city.
AMONG them is Bernie Parkhurst, who with her husband, Mark, both in their 30's, lives in the house she grew up in on Commerce Street, near the water. "Yes, the area needs to be improved," Ms. Parkhurst said. "But in the meantime what do we do?" Not everyone can afford the new housing, she said. And one commercial property owner is suing the city, contending its redevelopment plan is improper.
Mayor Joseph Vas said the project's benefits outnumbered the perceived negatives, which will be addressed. He said the development would not only increase the stock of middle-income housing in Perth Amboy, a city of 55,000, and bring in tax revenue and jobs but would also serve "as the engine that will drive investment in the rest of the city."
Besides the waterfront, the other areas in the city's Focus 2000 redevelopment plan are in the northeastern and southwestern sectors of Perth Amboy. In all, the plan calls for reusing 700 former industrial acres, and in the last month the city has selected developers to rebuild parcels in the other areas as well.
By early next year, for instance, Matrix Development Group of Cranbury, N.J., known for building big box warehouses, plans to begin to transform 26 acres in the city's northeast quadrant into up to a half million square feet of light industrial and manufacturing space in one to two buildings. The site, formerly occupied by Chevron, has sat dormant for many years.
Plans also call for about 68 more acres in that section to be used for an arena with 9,000 to 12,000 seats and a minor league baseball stadium with 5,000. The site, occupied by an industrial complex once used by a smelting and refinery operation, is to be redeveloped by a partnership of R.B.I. of Newark and OENJ Cherokee of Bayonne. Construction is expected to start in the next 18 to 24 months.
The mix of uses "will assure the economic vitality of the city," Mayor Vas said, adding that the projects announced so far are expected to produce 7,000 permanent jobs and more than $24 million a year in tax revenue, starting within five years. That revenue compares with about $18 million a year lost in 1970 to 1990, when industry moved out and shifted the tax burden to homeowners, he said, adding that developers are not being given tax abatements.
Perth Amboy's redevelopment effort follows those of Hudson River cities like Jersey City and Hoboken. Such efforts are bolstered by the economy, renewed interest in urban living and the state's development and redevelopment plan. The plan encourages growth in areas where highways, sewers and mass transit are available and discourages it where they are lacking.
Though the city adopted its redevelopment plan in 1997, it has been setting the stage for it over the last decade. In that time it attracted public money to revive its faltering downtown and begin to rebuild its waterfront. The latter included building a new marina and restoring a historic ferry slip.
HARBORSIDE "is the natural next step for the waterfront," Mayor Vas said.
Mr. Freireich said Westminster is involved with the project because "we believe the future trend is in urban living." Along with the state's efforts to push growth to cities, he said, Perth Amboy's pursuit of redevelopment was another factor.
Westminster will finance construction of the project privately and has already "pumped over $2 million into it," Mr. Freireich said. But his company, he added, will seek state and federal assistance to clean contaminated areas, a process he called "doable." It is also under contract to buy some parcels and is negotiating to buy others.
The Tri-State Ship Repair and Dry Dock Company, which owns 12 acres that have been used for a dry dock operation for more than a century, has contested the city's redevelopment plan. William D. Grand, the lawyer for Tri-State, said the company is one of only a few such operations in the Port of New York and therefore is an "important business to the port and region."
The company, he said, challenged the city's right to include the site in a redevelopment plan meant to improve blighted, unproductive properties.
Mr. Grand said the city had recently filed "essentially the same petition to dismiss the complaint" as one denied in March by the Superior Court of Middlesex County. He said pending the outcome of the recent petition, which is to be decided soon, his client would continue to fight.
Mayor Vas would not comment about the litigation. Mr. Freireich said he was confident a resolution can be reached because "the site is important to the redevelopment." Meanwhile, he said, his company will, if necessary, initially build around the 12 acres, even though they are part of the first phase.
Depending on whether the 12-acre parcel is out or in, that phase is to have 400 residences and 25,000 square feet of stores or 600 residences and 70,000 square feet of stores. In either case, there will also be two restaurants. Though prices for the units have not been set, Mr. Freireich said they were expected to start at $225,000 for the condominiums, averaging 1,100 square feet, and $400,000 for the town houses, averaging 2,000 square feet. He said the housing would be marketed to young professional couples and empty nesters.
To address concerns about traffic, city officials say they are pursuing plans for an extension from High Street to Route 440, which connects to the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island, and they are seeking $4.5 million in public money. The hope is that much of the traffic from Harborside and future projects will be directed to the new road and not clog city streets.
And to put together a relocation plan, the city has hired Abeles Phillips Preiss & Shapiro, a planning and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan. State law requires the property owners be paid a fair market price for their property as well as relocation expenses and dislocation benefits. No specific timetable has been set for the plan.
"Perth Amboy should utilize its waterfront as other waterside communities have done," said Donald E. Zupko, 53, who lives in a 100-year-old Victorian near the waterfront on Lewis Street. "It could be better for this city. Things must go on; things change."

HEADLINE: Grumman Site Getting High-Tech Incubator

BYLINE: By JOY ALTER HUBEL

DATELINE: CALVERTON

 BODY:
SINCE 1994, when the Northrop-Grumman plant assembled its last F-14 and E-2 aircraft here, the 2,900-acre naval weapons facility has been in a holding pattern. Amid a host of development proposals, ranging from a golf course to a cargo airport, Riverhead's political and business leaders have been unable to decide on a course that would best replace the jobs and tax revenue that took flight when Northrop-Grumman abandoned its aircraft facility.
But last week's announcement of a new technology incubator, along with the near-final sale of 493 acres to Burman Properties for $17 million, signals that Calverton is moving toward a new economic frontier. 
 An incubator is designed to promote business growth by offering services to new businesses that ordinarily would not be able to afford them. The Calverton project would offer below-market rent for the three to five years that companies would stay there. The businesses would have access to laboratories, conference rooms and classrooms. The State University of New York at Stony Brook would operate the incubator, and its Small Business Development Center would consult. Companies could also get academic and research support.
The 50-acre business incubator is scheduled to open by the end of next year. A town hearing will take place Nov. 8 before Stony Brook receives the final go-ahead from the town planning board to proceed with a subdivision plan. Sources, including the senator who has lobbied for the project and the executive director of a local development agency, believe the hearing is largely a formality because of wide support for the project across business, political and environmental lines.
Tentatively, the incubator is to be placed along Route 25, just east of the 25A intersection. Yet several members of the town board, who feel that a site along Route 25 is too commercially valuable to give to Stony Brook, are still lobbying for an alternative location on the property. This last-minute tussle is one example of why it has taken six years for the town of Riverhead to develop any economic momentum with the site, the largest single lot of commercial property now being sold in New York State. It had been declared surplus by the United States Navy and was turned over to the town of Riverhead in 1998 for commercial development.
"The word out there in the business community has been that there have been too many false starts," Senator Ken LaValle said. "I think now the Riverhead government and community are recognizing that the state is making an enormous investment that will jump-start development in Riverhead. It will be the first project that will come to fruition rather than 'talk talk talk.' "
The business incubator will center around aquaculture, agriculture and environmental technologies. Since 1994, Mr. LaValle, who helped secure $3 million for the incubator from New York State's Science, Technology and Academic Research program, has been lobbying for its creation as a more environmentally friendly alternative to a cargo airport that had once been proposed.
"We wanted to have industries that were compatible with the East End of Long Island, and that would add to our economy and to the resolution of some of the problems that we are facing," Mr. LaValle said.
Beach preservation technologies, fish farming, underwater development of drugs and cosmetics, crop production and distribution, and renewable energy are some industries the incubator would promote.
The $3 million in state financing would be spent on the construction of a 17,000-square-foot building for 12 to 15 tenants, according to Monique Gablenz, the executive director of the Riverhead Industrial Development Agency. Companies are qualified if they are concluding their research and development phase, and are trying to move into commercialization of their product in any of the three areas of focus.
"Very often these research companies are in an expansive phase and are trying so hard to activate research and development that they don't have the time and staffing to concentrate on business aspects," Ms. Gablenz said.
For example, a company that has been developing alternative pesticides would seek a place at the incubator once it was ready to adapt its findings for commercial use.
The incubator, Ms. Gablenz said, would provide companies with the business and research support they need to graduate into economically viable companies -- companies that would take root in Riverhead.
"The odds are they will not want to move away from support services they've developed," said Ms. Gablenz.
"These companies will also be better able to identify funding sources for the continuation of the work," Ms. Gablenz said.
There are many small business incubators on Long Island, but not all are successful. The ones that thrive have the ability to create lasting relationships among academic, financial and governmental lines of support, said Michelle Stark, a business consultant at the SUNY Stony Brook Small Business Development Center and co-author of the incubator feasibility study.
"The biggest problem that emerging technology companies face on Long Island," Ms. Stark said, "is where to go after they graduate from the incubators. After spending so much effort creating relationships in the research community, they don't want to cut the umbilical cord completely. They will want to continue to use graduate students and other support programs offered throughout the university to commercialize technology.
"And from a logistical point of view, the supplier networks and telecommunications infrastructure that has been already been built up in that geographic core should continue to be accessible," Ms. Stark said.
Government and business officials in Riverhead believe the incubator is a harbinger of great economic promise. It is hoped that successful graduates will find a home next door in the industrial park planned by Jay Burman. There, they can provide manufacturing and executive jobs that the town's retail sector cannot offer.
Ms. Gablenz is also confident that the incubator will benefit from the expertise that Stony Brook has developed in the management of its biotechnology incubator.
"The university has been extremely successful, and has enjoyed full occupancy since its doors have opened. It continues to graduate companies that have stayed in the area," Ms. Gablenz said.
SUNY Stony Brook will market the Calverton project, which will begin construction this spring, in the hope that it will be fully occupied by the time its doors open in late 2001.
By November, Mr. Burman's subdivision plan for the industrial park should be approved, according to Bob Kozakiewicz, the town supervisor of Riverhead.
The industrial park includes an 850,000-square-foot-facility, two-thirds of which can be filled immediately, given the level of interest expressed by prospective companies, said Jack O'Connor, the executive managing director for Grubb & Ellis, the commercial broker for Riverhead and the 2,900-acre parcel. The park will also include two million square feet of industrial space to be developed mostly for use by manufacturing firms, as specified in Riverhead's 1996 Land Reuse Plan.
The fate of the remaining 2,400 acres, including two airstrips, is still undecided, although most of the parcel has been rezoned for family recreation uses. Offers are pending for a golf course, a motorcycle racing venue, and a hotel conference and golf center with a private residential community attached. Nothing has been decided, Mr. O'Connor said.
"Many years ago industries thought Riverhead was the end of the world, but now that western land is saturated, Riverhead is looking like a place to be," he said.

Where the Elite Meet and Really Mean Business

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
ONE evening last month, Jim McCann, chairman of 1-800-Flowers, stood near the cold seafood appetizers in a private room in Hofstra University's library, reachable only by private elevator. He greeted about 100 invited guests who nibbled on shrimp and two types of caviar before heading into the adjacent dining room.
Mr. McCann, it turns out, is more of a bon vivant than is evident from his many television appearances as spokesman for his Westbury-based company. At once oracular and avuncular, he visibly enjoyed his role as host of what he described more than once as an intimate gathering. Without notes, he chatted about the digitalization of commerce, part of a trend he called the Next Economy. He theorized about its still unknown effects on retailing. Then he introduced a series of academics from Hofstra, where he serves on the Board of Trustees, before welcoming several partners from Ernst & Young, his longtime advisers. 
 As guests prepared to tuck into dinner, Mr. McCann sang the praises of a young wine merchant from Manhattan, before introducing the young retailer to the podium. Mr. McCann beamed as the young man, Josh Weston, delivered a slightly edgy tribute to wine and the good life.
The occasion was a rehearsal for four similar gatherings to be held at locations throughout the country; the first will be in Carlsbad, Calif., next week. Another will be held on Long Island next fall. While the topics remain undetermined, the format -- genial gatherings of people Mr. McCann describes as "thought leaders and marketing geniuses" -- will be retained.
However, the programs will be limited to about 20 people, and will be restricted to executives, he said.
"The list is confidential, but I can tell you they include the chairmen and C.E.O.'s and presidents of major companies," Mr. McCann said.
To get confirmation from such a high-powered list, he said, required assuring them that the meetings would be intellectually productive.
"These are all people who have serious constraints on their time," he said. "To get them all together, you have to be able to give them access to truly innovative thinking from across the business spectrum."
In recent years, such gatherings of so-called "thought leaders" have become a feature of the business landscape, often expanded to include A-list politicians. Perhaps the granddaddy of them is the Renaissance Weekend event held every year in Hilton Head, S.C. In addition to attracting business leaders and academic innovators, the gathering also brought in an ambitious young governor, Bill Clinton, who expanded his contacts enormously -- and used those contacts as he prepared to run for President.
Held in upscale hotels, resorts, and fine restaurants temporarily closed to the public, such elite gatherings characteristically address ambitious topics in luxurious settings. For business leaders the meetings offer the opportunity to learn first-hand how their peers are handling similar problems not only in their own industry, but in others.
Long Island has lagged behind this trend. While there is no shortage of business gatherings here, few attract participants from outside the region. Few of them attract even the senior executives of local companies. Executives beg off most conferences with complaints that they are variations of Pay to Play: if you're willing to pay the lunch tab, the group will be happy to listen to you as the expert on your choice of topics. Many meetings are little more than marketing opportunities, with little discussion of trends or new technology, or anything not involved in selling a product or service.
There are signs that's changing.
This summer, an invitation-only series of business dinners was launched by the Garden City Hotel in partnership with the Long Island Business News, the Ronkonkoma-based weekly. Called the Executive Roundtable, the forum meets monthly in the masculine confines of the hotel's Grill Room, where the publisher and editor, John L. Kominicki, keeps discussion candid and focused. Each month the Roundtable takes on a new industry, and with it a new guest list.
Part of the appeal of these invitation-only forums is that they bring together people who know each other by reputation, but have never met face to face.
"These are all senior people, each a leader in their industry, yet remarkably in many cases they have never met," said the Garden City Hotel's executive vice president and general manager, Patrick Smalley, who helps plan the meetings and also participates. Mr. Smalley said the meetings attract executives who are turned off by what he called the "insular" nature of many Long Island business functions -- the same people offering familiar ideas.
"One of our purposes is to allow people to be more candid," he said. "We make it a point to let them know the meetings are confidential."
Mr. Kominicki has found that the forums allow him to meet influential executives and establish relationships with them. "I'm still a relative newcomer here," said the publisher, who arrived from a similar post in Oklahoma City in June 1998. "The meetings are a great opportunity for me to meet the players and the issues facing the Long Island market."
Executives make time for the programs, he said, in part because it's "a big treat to be there as our guests and explore the trends and issues in depth, detail and historical perspective. The debates have been very lively, especially about the future of high tech and commercial development. I find myself scribbling notes on cocktail napkins until the wee hours."
While reporters are not allowed to listen in, they do have access to the guest list, and may follow up afterward, Mr. Kominicki said. "It has been a decided plus for our editorial coverage, and we may have sold an ad or two, although that's not really what it's about."
The dinners are scheduled to end at 9 p.m. Usually about half the group stays on and continues chatting, he said. Although a bar is open, "everyone drinks tea," Mr. Smalley explained with a smile.
David Levitan, senior director for Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate company with a regional office in Jericho, attended last month's real estate program expecting little in the way of intellectual stimulation, and found himself pleasantly surprised.
"I usually don't get involved in such forums, because I find very little is accomplished," he said. "But I'll come if I feel ideas will be raised and discussed."
Mr. Kominicki kept the discussion spirited and informative, Mr. Levitan said. "I was impressed. It was a wonderful evening. It was like a group of people who got together for dinner at someone's house and just started talking about the issues they care about."

Saxophone Quartet
An answer to the call of the saxophile will be heard today at 5 p.m. in Chester, when the Amherst Saxophone Quartet opens the Robbie Collomore Music Series at the Meeting House.
Together since 1978 this Buffalo-based ensemble has done yeoman service in the cause of not only popularizing an already established jazz instrument, but broadening its appeal as an exemplar of traditional and contemporary chamber music. In 1993 the group won first prize for Adventuresome Programming from Chamber Music America of Ascap.
The Meeting House, with just under 200 seats, is at the junction of Goose Hill Road and Liberty Street. Tickets are $16 for adults, $5 for students. Call (860) 526-4029 for reservations or more information.
 
Lectures About Democracy
"A Democratic Critique of the American Constitution" is the title of a a series of four lectures to be delivered by Yale's Professor Emeritus of Political Science Robert Dahl on the university campus in New Haven. Professor Dahl is the author of 21 books and over 100 articles on politics, economics, welfare, democratic theory, polygarchy and other related issues.
His talks answer questions conveyed in the titles. The first, scheduled tomorrow, asks "Why Does the American Constitution Fail to Meet Democratic Standards?" It will take place in Room 102 of the Linsly-Chittenden Building, 302 High Street. The second lecture on Thursday in Room 119 of the William L.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Kew Gardens, Queens;
Small-Town Feeling at a Busy Crossroads

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
KEW GARDENS, Queens, is the kind of place where many pedestrians will not cross the street until the sign says "Walk" and will not feel sheepish about waiting to cross, even when there is no traffic.
Maybe this behavior reflects the fact that many of the people who live in the neighborhood do so because they want to live in a place that is decidedly not cut from the same frenetic cloth as much of the city, or maybe it is just because many of the streets are curved and hilly and a pedestrian can never seem to see far enough down the road to find out if cars are coming. 
 The neighborhood started out as a genteel garden suburb, and despite intense development pressure because of its location at the confluence of a number of highways and subway lines, a number of vigorous community associations have worked hard to keep it as close to that ideal as possible.
The area, which had been a recreation area for the residents of Richmond Hill, was first developed at the turn of the century by Albon Man, a lawyer who turned his attention to real estate development, and his son Alrick. "They believed, like the builders of Central Park did -- Olmsted and Vaux -- that if you were surrounded by green, you would be renewed," said Barry Lewis, a 30-year resident of Kew Gardens, an architectural historian and author of "Kew Gardens: Urban Village in the Big City." "Your mind, psychologically, could relax; it could kind of heal up from all the assaults of the modern day commercial existence."
The neighborhood is served by the E and the F subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and the Grand Central, Van Wyck and Jackie Robinson (formerly the Interborough) Parkways. It is roughly halfway between John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports -- and is sometimes called "Crew Gardens" because it is host to many pilots and flight attendants, who can often be found at night at the neighborhood's bars.
With such an accessible location, development pressures on the area have been high ever since the railroad came through in 1910. The Kew Gardens Civic Association, which includes owners of single-family and two-family homes, was formed in 1914. "We try to maintain the quality of life in Kew Gardens that brought us here," said Murray H. Berger, the chairman of the board of the civic association. "The private homes and a sprinkling of larger buildings have provided a good mix."
The early single-family homes, often Tudor or colonial style, still predominate in many of the neighborhood's residential lanes, where the cicadas and leaf blowers drown out the sounds of distant traffic on Metropolitan Avenue. On some of the most desirable streets, which are a short walk to the Kew Gardens L.I.R.R. station, like Grosvenor Lane, Audley Street, Abingdon Road and Park Lane South, single-family homes usually cost between $425,000 and $975,000.
In the more developed parts of the neighborhood, generally areas closer to Queens Boulevard and along Lefferts Boulevard and Metropolitan Avenue, there are a number of midrise apartment buildings. Among the most prestigious are the Shellball, Hampton Court, the Beverly House, the Curzon House and the Georgian House -- all built before World War II. The vast majority of the apartments in Kew Gardens are co-ops, real estate agents said; most rental apartment buildings in the neighborhood converted in the early 1980's to co-ops.
WITH their arched entrances between rooms, large windows, eat-in kitchens and inviting foyers, apartments in these older buildings, which contain about 70 percent of the apartments in the area, are typically about 25 percent taller than the area's postwar apartment towers.
"The problem with the postwar buildings is that they're boxier and their ceilings are lower," said Varnua Singh, the owner of Crossings Realty on Lefferts Boulevard. "Space became a premium after the 50's."
One-bedroom apartments in the Shellball, a 10-story co-op on Talbot Street, just off Lefferts Boulevard, sell for $70,000 to $79,000, Mr. Singh said, while two-bedroom apartments sell for $130,000 to $160,000.
By contrast, one-bedroom apartments in the Texas, a seven-story co-op on Austin Street built in 1956 by Sam LeFrak, have recently sold for $65,000 to $68,500, said Ken Oppenheimer of Delkap Management, the building's managing agent.
One frequent favorable comment from people looking to buy homes in the area is the neighborhood's feeling of community, said Mr. Singh, who remembers coming to the neighborhood for the first time in 1969, when Kew Gardens Road was unpaved. "Even though you're in the city, it feels like a small town," he said.
Helping to create the small-town feeling in the neighborhood around the train station is the Bliss Gourmet Cafe on Austin Street just steps from the New York-bound platform, where the owner, Wendy Brendel, serves coffee and McBliss egg sandwiches to customers, many of whom she knows by name. Her shop is busiest in the morning rush as commuters bound for Pennsylvania Station line up for coffee and doughnuts, but in the afternoon it quiets down, and Ms. Brendel manages the place by herself.
Ms. Brendel said people often ask her, why not avoid the work and sell the shop to Starbucks. "I would never do that, just on principle," she said. "I can't really imagine a Starbucks here."
Indeed, there seem to be remarkably few national chains in the neighborhood, in part reflecting its great diversity. Kew Gardens has long served as a place where new groups of immigrants come to get a foothold in the United States.
. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, there was an influx of Iranian Jews into the neighborhood. Their numbers have declined as many have moved to Nassau County and other suburban areas, realtors said.
After the 1990 collapse of the Soviet Union, people from former Soviet republics, particularly Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, arrived, and there are many people from India and Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, including Yemen and Egypt, and from Central and South America.
On a strip of Lefferts Boulevard, which is the heart of the neighborhood, one can find Regents Row, which is a new Irish restaurant and bar; the Romashka Russian grocery store, which has Russian newspapers, Russian caviar and Russian yogurt; the Uzbekistan Cultural Center; and Coconuts, a Caribbean nightclub under construction.
Balancing these cosmopolitan influences at its center, the neighborhood also retains its rustic qualities with the help of Forest Park, which borders Kew Gardens on the southwest. "There are no cars allowed -- it's just continuous green," said Dennis Pahl, a professor of English at Long Island University, who has lived in Kew Gardens for six years and said he walks or rides his bicycle through the park to relax. "It's nice to know you can find this incredible tranquility by walking to the park or just walking down the side streets."
The biggest problem facing Kew Gardens, according to the chairwoman of the local community board, Sylvia Hack, is the construction of what she termed "architecturally insignificant houses." She mentioned a new cluster of townhouses being built on Talbot Street that are set back from the street far enough to give each townhouse a parking spot in front of the buildings. "We're getting the kind of development that turns a someplace into a no place," she said.
The neighborhood has one public elementary school, P.S. 99, a magnet school for students interested in law. It is undergoing a $4.2 million exterior renovation that should be completed in the spring of 2001, said the principal, Judith Ibrahimi. A few years ago the school, which now holds 615 children in kindergarten through sixth grade, was so crowded that kindergarteners had to be bused to P.S. 144 in Forest Hills. But after the 1993-94 school year, the Kew Gardens Improvement Association, the board of education, the school and parents worked together to build the P.S. 99 Annex just down the street from the main building. The annex now houses slightly more than 400 students in the kindergarten, first grade and second grade.
Sixty-five percent of the children at the school read at or above grade level, well above the citywide average. "We don't want anybody to be anonymous," Ms. Ibrahimi said. "We're working very hard, and we're doing that with an immigrant population."
MOST public school students from Kew Gardens go on Russell Sage Junior High School, in Forest Hills, which has an enrollment of about 1,425 students in the seventh, eighth and ninth grades. The school is one of the few in the city to offer Latin, and it is usually among the top performing 25 percent of junior high or middle schools in the city.
The designated high school for Kew Gardens is Hillcrest High School in Jamaica.
There are also four Jewish schools in Kew Gardens. Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah-Grodno, founded in 1977 and named for a yeshiva in Poland that was destroyed in World War II, serves young men of high school and college age from around the world. Yeshivat Ohr Haiim serves boys and girls from kindergarten to eighth grade. The Bais Yaakov Academy, which has an enrollment of about 800, serves girls in kindergarten to eighth grade. Tifereth Moshe, an Orthodox school on Abingdon Road, is for boys in kindergarten to eighth grade.
Though there are no Catholic schools in Kew Gardens, residents send their children to two nearby schools: Our Lady of the Cenacle School in Richmond Hill and Our Lady Queen of Martyrs School in Forest Hills. The schools serve students in prekindergarten to eighth grade and have about 325 students each.
The future of Kew Gardens depends on different things for different people. Mr. Pahl said he hoped that the New York economy would continue to thrive, encouraging more Manhattanites to move to the area, and that the Kew Gardens Cinema would flourish, encouraging more community and small business development. "I think it's a 50-50 shot that this place is going to continue to reinvigorate," he said, noting that it had already come a long way from six years ago, when many now-successful storefronts were vacant.
Though he may worry about too much development, Mr. Berger, who spent 20 years as president of the Kew Gardens Civic Association, said the neighborhood is still special to him. "It's always been a tree-blessed area -- it looks like an oasis in an otherwise tenementlike city," he said. "We're a mixed community in religion and in ethnicity, and pretty much everybody's free to do his own thing without peer pressure in the background."

CHANGING TIMES: At the corner of Lefferts Boulevard and Austin Street is the recently reopened Kew Gardens Cinema, a five-screen theater that shows mostly independent and foreign films. The theater, which charges $5 for all movies, opened in April 1999 after two years of vacancy and many more as an art theater and then a pornographic theater called the Austin. The reopening "was a dream come true," said Richard Oppenheimer, 53, a film buff who lives a five-minute walk from the theater and who recently took in a matinee showing of "The Tao of Steve." "I just couldn't believe that that was really going to happen," he said. Mr. Oppenheimer, a native of Forest Hills who runs a day-care center in Williamsburg, reminisced about watching foreign films at theaters in Manhattan. "It's a theater like the old-style theaters that really don't exist anymore," he said. "It reminds me of the Thalia, the old Bleecker Street Theater, the New Yorker."

A Charity Becomes a Real Estate Giant in Maine

BYLINE: By SCOTT SUTHERLAND

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me.

 BODY:
THE big question bouncing around Portland real estate circles these days is, "What building will Owen buy next?"
Owen is Owen Wells, president of the Libra Foundation, a Maine-based philanthropic organization with assets estimated between $300 million and $400 million. In the last two years, Libra has purchased four prominent buildings in downtown Portland, all of them Class A office space -- the kind found in the newest, most modern buildings. 
 Libra's latest purchase, completed on Sept. 11, is 1 Canal Plaza, a 10-story, 130,000-square-foot office building it bought from KeyCorp for $16.5 million. The deal completes Libra's acquisition of the three-building Canal Plaza complex and means the foundation now controls roughly a third of the available Class A office space in downtown Portland.
The deal is another reminder of the depths of Libra's pockets and the scope of its buying power, the likes of which Maine has never seen. "I was born here and have lived here most of my life, and I don't remember anything of this magnitude," said Jim Harnden, president of Ram Harnden Commercial Real Estate in Portland. "We've had people come through and be players in smaller ways, but something like Libra is brand new for Portland and for Maine."
Libra concentrates its considerable resources solely on Maine, which means it can have a sizable impact on the state and its 1.2 million inhabitants. In Portland, a city of 65,000 that is showing new signs of economic vigor after a long dry spell starting in the early 1990's, the foundation has already left a lasting mark. Libra has given millions of dollars to cultural institutions and social organizations in the city, and in 1998 it built a $9 million public market in a marginal neighborhood on the edge of downtown in an effort to jump-start Portland's sputtering economy.
Despite the good will created by its far-flung generosity, Libra's real estate deals have generated criticism from Portlanders who view the foundation as a financial King Kong, capable of dominating the market and reshaping the landscape of what remains essentially a small New England port town.
Even though many of Libra's projects have received heavy publicity around the state, most of it favorable, the real estate transactions in Portland have prompted some to question both its motives and long-term strategy. "Because Libra was set up for economic philanthropy, people expect it to be a little more public about what it's doing," said Mr. Harnden, who has represented other parties in deals with Libra. "At the same time, they don't owe anybody an explanation about what they're doing. It's their own money, and Portland has benefited enormously from their investment."
Libra's strategy, according to Mr. Wells, is simple. "The plan is to have sufficient income from real estate to generate about a third of the revenues we want to give away each year," he said. "We need to give away at least 5 percent of our gross assets each year, or about $15 million. Our income from real estate is about $5 million, so we're where we want to be. We don't plan on buying any more real estate in downtown Portland." Libra was founded in 1989 by the Elizabeth Noyce, former wife of Robert N. Noyce, a co-inventor of the computer chip and a founder of the Intel Corporation. After the couple's divorce in the 1970's, Mrs. Noyce relocated -- with the fortune she received in the divorce settlement, including about two million shares of Intel stock -- to the 50-acre estate in Bremen, Me., where she and her husband had summered.
She began giving away money, mostly to Maine charities, almost as soon as she settled into the house on Muscongus Bay. Mr. Wells became her lawyer, and together they brainstormed worthy causes around the state. "He is the engine," Mrs. Noyce once said of Mr. Wells. "I'm just the fuel."
Mrs. Noyce purchased four downtown buildings of her own -- which Libra inherited when she died in 1996 -- including the building that now houses Maine Bank and Trust, a bank she started in 1991. By the time of her death, at age 65, she had given away roughly $75 million.
Since its inception, Libra has given more than $19 million to a vast array of charitable and nonprofit organizations throughout Maine. Last year Libra awarded 113 grants totaling more than $6 million, with beneficiaries including a program to provide summer camp scholarships for Maine children; the local chapter of the Nature Conservancy, for the acquisition of land along the upper St. John River; and the Maine Winter Sports Center, for the creation of world-class cross country skiing and biathlon facilities in two northern Maine towns.
This summer, Libra began its most ambitious project to date: the transformation of the Pineland Center, a derelict former state mental hospital 30 minutes north of Portland, into a gleaming multi-use campus that would include office space, a conference center, social service programs, working farms, a therapeutic riding facility, networks of fitness trails and more.
REHABBING the site -- which includes renovating 22 aging buildings, constructing new buildings, installing new systems and generally sprucing up the property's overgrown grounds -- will cost at least $40 million. The list of prospective tenants is growing, said Mr. Wells, who hopes to begin leasing the site's commercial space next summer.
Mr. Wells is not afraid to use terms like "social engineering" to describe his plans for Pineland or his vision for what Libra can accomplish in Maine. Sometimes, though, that vision meets resistance. Last year, a Libra proposal to buy land and provide money toward building a new civic center in Portland backfired, in part because some local residents thought Libra was trying to impose its agenda on a neighborhood that had not asked for its help.
In other instances, the foundation's vision can be difficult to put into practice. Such is the case with the award-winning 37,000-square-foot public market, which has been criticized by city advocates as being more of an upscale destination for suburbanites than a neighborhood market and by former tenants for its steep rents and inflexibility in meeting the needs of struggling businesses.
The market, which opened two years ago, recently cut its rents, however, and it is currently at full occupancy, with tenants that include an assortment of vendors selling produce, meat, seafood, flowers, wine and baked goods. Despite these developments, Mr. Wells said Libra continued to provide heavy subsidies for the market, which is probably years from supporting itself.
Discussing the foundation's real estate investments, Mr. Wells said income from the office buildings provides a revenue cushion during dips in the value of Intel stock, Libra's primary asset. The foundation periodically sells Intel stock but tries to avoid being forced to sell during market downturns, such as occurred in September, when the stock fell from above $70 a share to about $40. "We're not going to sell the stock, because we know it's going to perform over the long term," he said. But, acknowledging the recent sharp decline, he added, "It's not for the faint of heart."
Mr. Wells stressed that Libra maintains and improves its properties and that rents are at or below market rate, about $19 per square foot a year for Class A space. Additionally, he said, Libra pays taxes on all of its properties, which will amount to nearly $1 million in 2001.
Some of the grumbling over Libra's purchases is doubtless the result of a strong local market and low vacancy rates -- 3 percent currently for Class A and 6 percent over all, down from 23 percent in the early 1990's -- which mean few buildings come up for sale. Some of it also stems from Libra's dominance in the market; Libra owns close to 500,000 square feet out of a total of roughly 1.4 million square feet of downtown's Class A commercial space.
Mr. Wells says he is sometimes mystified by Libra's critics. "The Libra Foundation represents an unprecedented opportunity for Maine," Mr. Wells said. "The fact that we can send 5,000 kids to summer camp is phenomenal. We can try new things, experiment, see if they work. I think we actually do a very good job of getting our mission out there.
"Other foundations might not get criticized the way we do, but they're just giving money away. We're activists, after all."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS;
A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS

BYLINE: By PETER BELLER

 BODY:
RECORD low unemployment and the booming high-tech industry are causing a labor shortage in Westchester, posing problems for employers and spurring growth in reverse-commuting from New York City.
The unemployment rate for the county was 3 percent for August, the lowest it has been since 1990, and down from 3.6 percent in August of last year. 
 In contrast, the seasonally adjusted national rate was 4.1 percent in August, while New York State's was 4.5 percent and New York City's was 5.8 percent.
"The data suggest that employers are hard pressed to attract and retain workers," said John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "You've had a pretty good economy in Westchester, and employment expansion has been pretty steady."
Rae Rosen, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan, agreed, saying, "It's certainly tight right now."
In 1998, she said, the county had an average per capita income of $47,000, the eighth highest in the nation, adding, "Obviously, this is a highly skilled labor market." The unemployment rate, while "not an exact measurement, is indicative of a very tight labor market," she said.
Harold E. Vogt, president of the county's Chamber of Commerce, said the labor shortage "goes across the board," from highly technical jobs to entry-level and blue-collar positions. He attributed the shortage of high-tech workers to the rapid expansion of that industry and the shortage of low-wage workers on a historical lack of affordable housing in the county.
Most companies have responded to the shortage by trying to lure workers from farther afield.
Westchester employers have been recruiting from northern New Jersey, Dutchess, Orange and Rockland Counties and from Connecticut.
"The ring is expanding," Mr. Vogt said. "All you have to do is look at the Tappan Zee bridge in the morning."
Between 1980 and 1998 the number of people commuting into Westchester every day rose to 134,246 from 85,110, according to a study by the County Planning Department in March. During the same period the median price of a house rose to $363,900 from $83,700, making it harder for blue-collar workers to afford to live in the county.
Commuters currently represent one-third of the county's work force, and the study predicted an increase to 40 percent over the next two decades.
The only area from which commuting decreased was Manhattan. The most striking increase was from Queens and Brooklyn, which went from around 6,000 to just over 15,000 commuters.
Ms. Rosen of the Federal Reserve said that recent immigrants were picking up the slack in some blue-collar fields like masonry.
It has been getting harder, however, to find minimum-wage workers in the county because of the costs of housing and commuting.
"If you have a car you can make it from Queens," Ms. Rosen said. "But it's hard to make it from the inner city."
The increase in reverse commuting has been a boon for the Metro-North Railroad, which has seen the number of riders going to Westchester during the morning rush increase by 240 percent, to more than 8,000, between 1986 and 1999. While that number pales in comparison with the 72,500 who commute into the city, it represents a surge in reverse commuting, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for the railroad.
"All over our system our ridership has been growing tremendously," Mr. Brucker said. "But the growth rate of reverse and intermediate customers has outstripped all the other growth segments."
Lawrence C. Salley, the county's transportation commissioner, said that in the Bronx, Co-Op city, in particular, was sending more people to places like Yonkers.
Like other county officials and business leaders, he said that companies were not leaving the county because of the labor shortage, and in fact many were moving in.
"The businesses are here," he said. "More businesses are coming in, and the housing is being developed as we speak."
Schools are having trouble finding staff members as well. While math and science teachers are in short supply, said Ernest J. Piermarini, an assistant superintendent for the Lakeland Central School District, "We even have a hard time getting classroom monitors, teacher aide applicants, even basic clerical workers."
He said that, while the school system has increased pay in many areas, it could not compete with the private sector. "You'll get people who come out here, and then after a couple of months they'll go to Wal-Mart and Home Depot."
The scarcity of high-tech workers is being felt across the country as companies scramble to expand.
"It's really a national issue," said Russ Izzo, president of Nextech Training Solutions, which trains computer programmers, systems engineers, and the like. "The demand in Westchester is pretty much in line" with the rest of the country.
His company recently opened an office in White Plains. He said that graduates were being grabbed by companies and entry-level salaries were more than $30,000, compared with $20,000 a year ago.
Many big retailers said they were having similar problems finding workers.
"It's been tougher this year than it's ever been," said the manager of the Wal-Mart in Mohegan Lake, who asked that his name not be used.
He said that while the store, which employs 300 people, wasn't understaffed, he would hire an extra 20 workers if he had qualified applicants.
While the K-mart in Mahopac reported having similar problems finding enough workers, McDonald's says it has not had a problem.
"We have a lot of long-term people," said Peter Samaha, who owns and operates 12 McDonald's, 10 of them in Westchester. He cited a flexible work schedule and fair pay "so when a labor crunch comes, we're usually ahead of the curve."

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING;
When Bribery Is Lost in Translation

BYLINE: By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Good, the Bad, and Your Business" (John Wiley & Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BRIBES are tricky. Well, not the bribes themselves. Deciding what constitutes a bribe and then whether you should pay one to do business in a foreign country -- knowing full well that if you don't, a less ethical competitor might -- can be the real quandary.
Washington hasn't made it any easier. Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977, making it illegal for American companies to pay bribes to secure contracts in foreign countries. But the law leaves just enough ambiguity to allow for continued payments to grease the skids. In permitting "facilitating payments," the law recognizes that a small amount of cash might sometimes be needed to expedite what it calls "routine governmental action." 
 So, according to advice that the Justice and Commerce Departments offer on the Internet, the American government is as likely as not to look the other way if a foreign government official is slipped a few dollars to process visas or work orders; provide police protection; ensure smooth mail, phone or power service; protect perishable products; or schedule inspections.
On the other hand, the government says "routine governmental action does not include any decision by a foreign official to award new business or to continue business with a particular party." (The full text of the government's advisory on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be found at http://www.usdoj.gov/ criminal/fraud/fcpa/dojdocb.htm.)
To some experts, that guidance seems perfectly clear. "You don't need a law to know when you step over the mark between a facilitating payment and a real bribe," said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, an organization that publishes an annual index that ranks countries from least to most corrupt, with the goal of increasing accountability.
But to others, the law merely disguises a bribe by calling it something else. "What's silent here is that facilitating payments are still illegal in that country because they're bribes," said Patrick J. Gnazzo, vice president for business practices at United Technologies in Hartford. "And there isn't a country in the world that doesn't have a law on its books that says 'you may not bribe my government officials.' "
So if the law does not provide clear guidance, how can anyone decide how to behave? In particular, what do you do if you're an executive from a country that is regularly ranked among the least corrupt (say, Finland) and you want to do business in a country that is regularly near the bottom of the list (say, Nigeria)?
The argument could be made that in notoriously corrupt countries, the best thing to do is to adopt the local cultural norms. After all, don't you owe it to your shareholders to do what needs doing and pay what needs paying to land a lucrative contract? And if you reject that idea, what victory is won for ethics if the host country simply decides instead to do business with your more evil competitor?
"I've seen successful businesses who follow the policy 'if in Rome do as the Romans do' 100 percent, and I've seen businesses who strictly adhere to their home country policies everywhere they operate," said Walter Kuemmerle, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. "Both of these types of businesses have been successful."
But Professor Kuemmerle warned that "it's generally better to stay out of corruption processes for good than to go into them just tentatively."
"If the business decides to give in once" -- assuming that it can rise above the morass later -- "that strategy is definitely not going to work," he added. "It's like a drug addiction. Once you signal that you're willing to play the game according to the local rules, it's very hard to reverse that policy."
Mr. Gnazzo counsels taking a realistic view of doing business in a corrupt nation. "Decide you're going to be patient," he said. "That means that your stuff may stay on the dock for a period of time. And you might not be able to get the product out as fast as you would like to."
Even in the countries perceived to be the most corrupt, "not everybody in that environment is corrupt," Mr. Gnazzo added. "That's a starting point."
In the 1990's, United Technologies itself came under Justice Department investigation, though the department ultimately found no violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and dropped the matter. The action was spurred by a civil suit in which a former employee accused a United Technologies subsidiary of dismissing him for publicizing what he said were bribes to two Saudi princes to secure a contract; that case was settled out of court in 1993.
Then, as now, the company had a strict rule against making illegal payments to obtain business.
THE author of an article in The Economist earlier this year described with satisfaction that while in the early 1990's it took bags of cash to get through customs in Nigeria, on his most recent trip he only needed to hand over a ballpoint pen.
But in the realm of corruption, such deflationary forces are rarely seen. The ante to play the bribery game is always rising. "It goes up the next time and the next time and the next time," Mr. Gnazzo said.
Or, as Professor Kuemmerle put it, "Corruption is a never-ending story."

Fund-Raising for a Museum Is Too Slow for Comfort

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
Once a cause for celebration on Staten Island, the National Lighthouse Center and Museum may now be a cause for concern.
Since 1998, when a national steering committee selected a 10-acre former Coast Guard base next to the Staten Island Ferry terminal as the project site, the museum's board has had trouble raising money. As a result, the museum's opening has been postponed from 2001 to 2003. 
 The museum's board has raised $500,000 for operating expenses and to hire a design firm. But it has only about $100,000 toward the $5 million needed to meet the new opening date.
The site was chosen two years ago because of the "visitor potential" of the 1.5 million tourists who arrive at the nearby terminal each year and because of $5 million the city and state pledged to the project.
The city's Economic Development Corporation has been spending that money to shore up, replace two roofs and remove asbestos from several of the site's seven brick and limestone buildings. But the board is still far from the matching $5 million.
"They have until July 2002 to raise the money," said Janel Patterson of the Economic Development Corporation, "and we're confident that they'll reach their goal." Ms. Patterson did not say what might happen if the goal were not reached.
Henry Stephenson, the museum's executive director, said the corporation met with the board last spring and told it to pick up the fund-raising pace. Since then, the museum has dismissed a fund-raiser and a director of development and replaced them with new people.
Lack of money has also hampered the museum's plans to add attractions. For example, the owners of a lightship -- a vessel that carries an electric beacon as a kind of portable lighthouse -- have wanted to sell it to the museum for some time. Mr. Stephenson said he had hoped to open the lightship to the public at the site's pier during Operation Sail on this July 4. But the museum has raised only $35,000 of the $100,000 needed to acquire the ship.
Liz Aubert, a spokeswoman for Seaeye, the Massachusetts company that owns the ship, said that if there was not "significant progress" toward meeting that goal by next July, the company might offer the ship to another organization.
But there may be financial hope. Mr. Stephenson, who recently announced he would soon step down as director, said he had learned "our property seems to qualify for federal historic preservation tax credits." He said those credits might be parlayed into several million dollars, through a process that entailed setting up a partnership with private investors. "I'm very optimistic," he said. "Maybe I don't have good reason to be." JIM O'GRADY

A New Fight for a Rich Slice of the Insurance Pie

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
LONG ago, the Chubb Corporation figured out that wealthy people would pay a little more to insure their mansions and yachts if, when it came time to collect on a claim, they were treated royally.
So instead of following the usual practice of paying as little as possible on claims, Chubb habitually erred on the side of the customer. It did not quibble over costs for the finest workmanship when paying repair claims. Often, it paid borderline claims that it might legally have rejected. 
 Neighbors talked to neighbors, and Chubb, which is based in Warren, N.J., came to dominate coverage in this rarefied world where a family might own three or four multimillion-dollar homes, a stable of expensive cars, a yacht and maybe a helicopter or small jet, and pay annual premiums of $50,000 or more to insure it all.
The niche has proved so lucrative that it has attracted an aggressive new entrant, the American International Group, which is best known for providing high-level commercial coverage worldwide. The company, based in New York, has taken particular aim at customers with holdings of more than $5 million and has hired away more than a dozen Chubb executives. It seems bent on out-Chubbing Chubb.
However, analysts say that won't be easy. "I think A.I.G. has got a shot," said Weston Hicks of J. P. Morgan, "but Chubb has set the bar very high." Several companies have challenged Chubb, he said, and failed.
While Chubb previously offered a maximum of $10 million in liability coverage, for example, A.I.G. has upped the ante to $100 million. And while Chubb sometimes shied away from covering more exotic car models or all of a wealthy client's homes, especially those in hurricane or earthquake zones, A.I.G. plunges in. It wants all of a customer's business -- for homes, yachts, Lamborghinis, fine art and aircraft, and even coverage against kidnapping.
"We're trying to provide comprehensive insurance for wealthy families," said Ross J. Buchmueller, who left Chubb to start A.I.G.'s private-client group in July.
Chubb has responded with a number of service upgrades. It will now write liability coverage up to $50 million. And though, like most insurers, it may not want to add clients in parts of Florida and California, it is gritting its teeth and doing so rather than watch those customers take their business to A.I.G. Chubb has also begun offering aircraft and kidnapping insurance linked to homeowners' policies.
"We don't want to let the camel's head under our tent," said Richard Ort, who is in charge of Chubb's coverage on homes and other personal belongings.
Yet Mr. Ort said Chubb modified its coverage not because of new competition, but because of the growing number of personal megafortunes made during the economic boom. "All of a sudden, lots of people have homes in the Caribbean," he said.
Some brokers say Chubb was becoming a bit arrogant, rejecting some kinds of coverage on homes and cars and insisting on preventive measures that customers occasionally saw as unnecessary.
Now Chubb appears to be softening up. "Chubb seems much more responsive to our needs since A.I.G. has announced its plans," said Jim Brooks, the vice president in charge of marketing at the Amaden Gay Agencies, an insurance broker in the wealthy Hamptons area of Long Island.
CHUBB has managed to profit on its high-end coverage; the company, which is also doing well with its commercial business, is expected to earn $1.02 a share in the third quarter, versus 43 cents in the period a year earlier. It charges roughly 15 percent more than most other insurers for the same dollar amounts of home insurance -- and the difference may be even bigger on less expensive properties. It has comparatively few claims because the wealthy often take special precautions to protect belongings. Chubb also appraises property to ensure appropriate coverage.
But more important, Mr. Ort said, "when you're insuring a $5 million or $10 million property, a whole lot more money comes in the front door than if you're insuring a half-a-million-dollar property."
A.I.G. plans to capitalize on that idea, too. While Chubb insures $400,000 homes as the low end of its market, A.I.G. has aimed to start its coverage at $1 million. One incentive for A.I.G. to offer very wide coverage is that profits on insuring art collections, jewelry and liability run considerably higher than for coverage on homes alone.
So far, A.I.G. has received regulatory approval to sell coverage on homes in 17 states, including New York, but not New Jersey or Connecticut. It expects to be licensed in all states by early next year.
One of its first challenges is to persuade independent brokers -- the go-betweens with homeowners -- to take on a new company. Some brokers say they like the idea of having an alternative insurer in cases where -- for whatever reason -- Chubb may not want to provide coverage. But others say they are content with their relationship with Chubb and are not seeking a new one. And some say they are not sure how A.I.G., as a newcomer, will perform in this niche.
"I sleep well when I know my customers are going to be treated right," said Philip B. Weymouth Jr., the principal owner of Weymouth & Smith Insurance, in Wilmington, Del., which has been selling Chubb coverage for many years.
But to reach its target market of cream-of-the-crop clients, Mr. Buchmueller said, A.I.G. needs to sign up only about 250 of the thousands of independent agents.
Many brokers can provide examples of how Chubb has gone the extra mile on claims. One told of a Mercedes-Benz that was insured for $13,000; when it was totaled in an accident, Chubb adjustors calculated its value at $25,000 and paid the higher amount. Another broker recalled a client whose grounds were damaged after a heating oil tank was punctured. The insurance applied only to the house, but Chubb still paid $20,000 for the cleanup.
In Coral Gables, Fla., driving rains last year caused $75,000 in damage to a large condominium owned by Clayre and Jay Haft. "I just submitted the bills and they paid," said Mrs. Haft, a former stockbroker. "They were as cooperative as anyone could possibly hope."
But A.I.G. has a reputation in the industry as being tough on claims. "They're very good at defending liability suits," Mr. Weymouth said, meaning that the company fights hard to pay as little as possible in lawsuits against its customers.
A.I.G. contends that it pays precisely what it should on its claims. Robert M. Sandler, the senior claims executive who also oversees its homeowners coverage, said the company "is not tough on claims in the sense that we avoid paying claims we should pay."
But brokers said that following the letter of the law would not cut it if A.I.G. wanted to take business away from Chubb.
"A.I.G. is going to have to take on the same attitude in adjusting claims as exists at Chubb," said David Rubin, the owner of the Rubin Group in Manhattan, which provides commercial and personal coverage to clients across the country.
A.I.G. plans to do just that -- and more. "Our claims handling," Mr. Buchmueller said, "is going to make us stand out above and beyond anything that's been done to date."

Big Banks May Not Be Better Online

BYLINE: By PAUL SWEENEY

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED by the meager checking account deals offered by their local banks, consumers may turn to the Internet, thinking that they can do better. After all, that is where they have found competitive deals on cars, books and even, until lately, groceries.
But attractive offers are harder to find in the online banking world, especially when it comes to checking accounts offered by major banks. Many of those institutions offer customers the same rates and fees on their Web sites as they do at their neighborhood branches. Moreover, the most attractive rates and fees are sometimes determined by the customer's ZIP code, both for technical and competitive reasons. That was what Bankrate.com found in its semiannual survey of the 10 largest financial institutions in the country's 35 major markets. (The checking account pricing survey is at www.bankrate.com.) 
 "We noticed that accounts obtained on the Internet are the same ones you'd get walking into a brick-and-mortar bank," said Greg McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a company in West Palm Beach, Fla., that tracks the financial services industry.
Bankrate.com also said that many big banks with operations spread across several regions practiced "geographic discrimination," in which deals vary greatly by state. (Consumers who visit the banks' Web sites are often asked to disclose their ZIP codes before any information is dispensed.)
Mr. McBride said Wells Fargo's Stagecoach Interest Checking Account charges customers in Seattle, online or off line, a $13 monthly service fee, unless they keep a minimum balance of $100; the bounced-check fee is $28. In San Francisco, he said, the service fee is $10, the minimum balance is $2,000, and the bounced-check fee is $15.
Bank of America customers in California get a better deal on its interest-bearing checking account than those in Florida. In California, accounts below the minimum balance carry a $12 monthly fee and pay 0.4 percent interest; in Florida, Mr. McBride said, there is a $14 monthly fee and 0.25 percent rate.
STEPHEN BROBECK, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer group based in Washington, said banks should give customers better, more consistent deals.
"There is no question that Internet banking should be less costly for consumers," he said. "Internet banking should also be systemwide, not local, and therefore benefit from economies of scale and lower costs."
For their part, major banks acknowledge the disparities in their practices. Some bank officials blame the continuing mergers and acquisitions within the industry, which often result in fragmented operations.
Thomas A. Kelly, a spokesman for Bank One, which is based in Chicago and whose branches span Texas, Louisiana, Arizona and the Midwest, said the bank's regional computer systems were largely incompatible with one another. He said he expected to see the problem rectified -- and fee and rate schedules integrated -- over the next three years. Eloise Q. Hale, a Bank of America spokeswoman, said her bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., was doing the same. "Everything is being unified to increase consistency," she said.
Even so, that will not necessarily translate into lower costs. "The banks' fixed costs aren't going away," said Theodore J. Iacobuzio, a senior analyst at the TowerGroup, a research firm based in Needham, Mass.
Bankrate.com recommends that consumers looking for the best deals consider "pure" Internet banks. Many of those banks, including nBank, First Internet Bank of Indiana, and directbanking.com, offer free, interest-bearing checking accounts, electronic bill payment, and rebates of other banks' A.T.M. fees, according to Gomez Advisors, an Internet consulting firm that rates Web-based consumer services.
Christopher E. Musto, a vice president for research at Gomez, said consumers had another option. Many major banks waive fees for consumers willing to do business electronically, using the telephone, A.T.M. or Internet.
Of course, Internet banking is still not for everyone; some people prefer talking to real tellers, or they are reluctant to break old habits. "You may prefer to walk into a Wells Fargo branch because it's in the lobby of your office building," Mr. Musto said.

HEADLINE: CITY LORE;
Huddled Masses of City Statuary Face Eviction

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
THE doughboy gazes stoically through the mesh steel cage, unfazed by the clownish dent in his helmet or the bronze plaque leaning against his chest. He is surrounded by heads without pedestals, lampposts without lamps, eagles without perches.
This collection of ghostly fragments of New York's past resides in a storeroom under the Triborough Bridge on Randalls Island, one of the three main storage areas used by the New York City Parks Department for the flotsam of public art -- pieces of vandalized monuments, neglected sculptures, cast-off finials and fences. The other Randalls site lies in the bowels of Downing Stadium, and therein lies the reason for a sense of urgency among those at Parks who care about these artifacts. 
 The stadium faces demolition this fall under a plan to redevelop Randalls Island Park, and the objects must be out soon, perhaps as early as Nov. 1.
Finding space in overcrowded city property and in a booming real estate market is making the task seem "pretty desperate," said Jonathan Kuhn, director of art and antiquities for the Parks Department.
"It's low on the totem pole of budget requirements," Mr. Kuhn said. "It's not a sexy item. We're canvassing the borough commissioners. It's clear to me Manhattan doesn't have space."
The Downing Stadium demolition is a catalyst. The building that houses another of the storage areas, in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, faces reconstruction later this year. Work is due on the Triborough in 2003, meaning that the doughboy's 25-by-25-foot area also will have to be emptied. So Mr. Kuhn is scouring the city for one large area to house all the Parks artifacts together. He has only one candidate, a bathing pavilion in Orchard Beach with extra rooms, but the temporary solution may be a tarpaulin-covered pen outside the stadium.
The city did not even know what it had until officials took an inventory in 1997. Most of the items were cataloged and tagged by Mr. Kuhn and his antiquities department. But the Downing Stadium cache was never completely examined because of the area's debris and bad lighting, putting it somewhere near the realm of unknown treasure.
On a visit the other day, a few bare bulbs cast dim light in the dank area under the concrete stands. A water leak trickled loudly. A mass of material lay strewn about, looking somewhat less grandiose than the term antiquities implies. But they represent New York's monumental past, and testify to the idea that honoring the dead can nourish the living through public art. Given the city's relative youth, it's as close as New Yorkers get to the wealth of civic treasures from, say, a truly ancient place like Rome.
Inside several cages were granite benches; two obelisks marking the Drake family graveyard from Joseph Rodman Drake Park in Hunts Point, the Bronx; a pair of wrought-iron cannon carriages from the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights, Manhattan; original bricks from Bethesda Terrace in Central Park; iron gates, festooned with the initials E. W. B. from the E. W. Bliss estate in what is now Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; chunks of a fountain that briefly stood outside an Orchard Beach pavilion; and sections of wrought-iron bird cages from the Prospect Park Zoo.
The Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, defended the city's treatment of the items.
"You don't have the money," he said. "It's a miracle we saved these objects and kept them at all.
"The city is not the Vatican," he added. "It does not provide repositories. There are no catacombs. Years ago, these items would have gone into the landfill."
The goal now is to put as many items as possible on public view, preferably in their original sites. But sometimes those sites have disappeared, been altered or adorned with replicas. So some items will be recycled for parts. Some will stay in storage, as models for repairs for re-creations. Some will be loaned, and still others may be sold or even given away to the public.
Because not all the materials are intrinsically or aesthetically valuable, deciding what to do with them is not easy. Many variables must be weighed in deciding what to restore: an item's historical associations, the wishes of benefactors, the cost, the community's desires. Many of the restorations depend on private donations.
AS for the doughboy, a 1923 statue, he is destined to return to his station in Highbridge, at the corner of Ogden and University Avenues, once money is found to restore his right arm and rifle and carry out the installation. A dozen doughboy memorials were established in New York neighborhoods after the Great War to honor local men who died, just as towns around the country and Europe built memorials in their main squares.
The Highbridge doughboy was salvaged in the 1970's after suffering the damage and after plaques listing 21 local men who died were stolen.
"Once you have an amputee, that's an invitation to finish the job," said Mr. Kuhn, whose job at times seems like one big reminder of New York's capacity to chip away at its monuments, or spray paint them, or steal them whole.
Soaring metal prices in the 1970's and a municipal budget crisis led to much thieving, but Mr. Kuhn says monument vandalism has waned. He cites at least two dozen successful restorations in the last decade, thanks in part to the private donations that flow from better economic times and to more city financing.
Keeping the doughboy company is Arthur Cunningham, formerly of Cunningham Park in Fresh Meadows, Queens. More specifically, it is a bronze bust of Mr. Cunningham, his hair brushed straight back, a bristle mustache on his upper lip, a three-piece suit on his torso. Mr. Cunningham, born in 1894, was a rising star in New York City politics. He was elected city comptroller with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and died six months later, in 1934, after a heart attack while horseback riding.
The statue went up in 1941. Vandals cut off its right ear. The Parks Department's monuments crew restored the ear. (Mr. Cunningham's widow was so traumatized that she asked that the statue not be put back, Mr. Kuhn said.) And the statue has been in storage since. Mr. Kuhn said enough time had passed that Mr. Cunningham should be returned to its granite pedestal, which, miraculously, remains standing.
But there will be no going home for the man who wrote "Home Sweet Home," John Howard Payne, actor, playwright and poet. The song became so famous that a bronze bust of Payne was erected 21 years after his death, in 1873. Vandalism propelled it into storage. Mr. Kuhn said the statue would be better off in the Home Sweet Home Museum in East Hampton, on Long Island, rather than in its original setting, Long Meadow in Prospect Park.
One of New York's most beloved memorials is at Randalls Island. It is the 1897 marble copy of the original urn honoring the Amiable Child in Riverside Park near Grant's Tomb. The boy, St. Clair Pollock, fell to his death in 1797 from the heights over the Hudson River, according to one version, and his father (or perhaps uncle), George Pollock, buried him nearby. The deteriorating 1897 copy was replaced in 1967 by a granite version. A piece of the original headstone once listed as being in the Downing Stadium site has disappeared. The granite urn will stay in storage.
Perhaps the saddest relics sit in another room in the Triborough Bridge site.
They are hundreds of 4-by-8-inch bronze plaques marking trees planted to honor ordinary New Yorkers who died in World War I. The plaques are simple, all reading, "This tree is dedicated to the memory of . . ." followed by the name, rank, unit and the words "who died in the World War 1914-1918." They carry names like William J. Hodgkins and Everett C. Scamman and Moses Opotofsky. No records about who installed the plaques have come to light, and no decision has been made on their fate.
Planting trees to honor fallen heroes grew especially popular after World War I, and hundreds of such plaques still remain around the city. But almost immediately thieves began prying them up. Trees died, leaving a plaque with no object. So most of the plaques were salvaged and put in storage, Mr. Kuhn said, where they have lain for more 50 years, interred like the forgotten men they honor.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
Reviving Main Street, Or Living in the Past?

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to grassrts@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: MEDIA, Pa.

 BODY:
IN its marketing brochure, this picturesque county seat 18 miles from the center of Philadelphia likes to portray itself as "everybody's hometown." But to property owners like Al Anderson, this mostly white, middle-class burg of 6,000 seems anything but.
Mr. Anderson owns two properties along State Street, Media's traditional shopping boulevard. But he cannot rent them to the highest bidders -- banks, brokerage firms and the like -- because of a zoning ordinance passed by the borough council last December. The measure, which all but requires landlords to rent first-floor offices to retail businesses, is intended to reinvigorate downtown shopping. 
 "The demand is for office space for professionals, but they want me to rent to quaint small shops," complained Mr. Anderson, a retired DuPont executive. "They don't realize that State Street doesn't make it as a shopping experience any more."
The conflict along State Street may seem minor, but it symbolizes a growing tension in many American suburbs between the rights of private property owners and a New Urbanist-inspired vision of restored, retail-oriented Main Streets.
The perceived success of retail restoration efforts in places as varied as Pasadena, Calif., the Back Bay area of Boston and New Jersey towns like Red Bank, Morristown and Princeton has drawn many imitators. But by their nature, these efforts are likely to be highly divisive in small-town settings, said Larry Houstoun, a principal of the Atlantic Group, an urban development consulting firm in Cranbury, N.J.
"If you begin to work for change in a suburban context, you are at risk," said Mr. Houstoun, whose firm has done two reports for the Media borough council on downtown revitalization. "Many people remember when they had good stores and want the convenience, but there's always a vocal minority who's against change."
For their part, Mr. Anderson and other members of Mr. Houstoun's "vocal minority" feel that the council's initiatives -- not just the ban on first-floor offices, but also two town-backed retail projects and an ordinance strictly regulating signs -- stem from misplaced nostalgia. Business in Media, they say, depends on activity related to the Delaware County Courthouse and the town's growing role as a financial hub. Property owners point out that despite the booming economy, State Street now has vacancy rates of 15 to 20 percent.
But political leaders see the policies as a last-ditch effort to return the four-block-long stretch of the street, with its two- to four-story brick buildings built in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to its former role as the center of community life.
"We like to see ourselves as 'everybody's hometown,' with all the diversity and activity that suggests," said Frank Daly, who first as mayor and now as the borough's lawyer has been a leader in downtown renewal policies for more than a decade. "We don't want to end up as an office park. We did not want a street with nothing but law offices and banks."
THE vacancies on State Street, Mr. Daly contended, were caused not by the city's policies but rather by the decades-long transformation of small-town America. Perhaps the biggest blow came in the early 1970's, when two shopping malls opened, each less than a
10-minute drive from downtown Media.
Another factor has been the expansion of the local service economy. Media's office population has been bolstered by what Mr. Daly called "the litigation explosion" of the last quarter-century. Law firms, including branches of Philadelphia-based firms, want offices near the courthouse, one block off State Street.
The growth of government, which has tripled the number of county workers in Media to more than 3,000 over the last 30 years, also changed the character of the old downtown. The once-sleepy town became an important service industry hub, with a dozen bank and brokerage-firm offices and a daytime population that swells to over 25,000.
In the process, Mr. Daly said, State Street storefronts once occupied by small retail businesses were turned into professional offices. Restaurants, clothing stores and bookstores that once served local residents were rapidly replaced by fast-food outlets and print shops that catered to the office clientele. The last supermarket left in 1996, followed by the closing of the local Woolworth's and a women's clothing store.
These developments prompted the council's 1999 ordinance that essentially banned new first-floor professional offices along a four-block stretch of the street. To promote the kind of development it favors, the city restored the old Borough Hall on State Street and leased it to what has proved to be a successful restaurant. It lured another restaurant to space that Merrill Lynch had sought for an office.
In addition, the borough required that signs in the downtown district be small and unobtrusive. And it awarded a $2.8 million grant to improve the streetscape and lighting.
Council members, who have generally approved these measures by votes of 7 to 0 or 6 to 1, said their efforts were already luring shoppers back to State Street at night and on weekends.
"You can't get groceries downtown, and you can't get panty hose," Councilwoman Debbie Krull said. "Our constituents want more retail, and we want to meet their demand. We don't want a street that's only busy from 11 to 2. We want a nicer mix for our residents."
BUT what council members view as enlightened planning, landlords regard as an assault on property values. The measure met with polite but intense opposition this year from the Media Business and Professional Association, a new, 65-member group that wants to reverse the new policies and unseat the council.
Richard Swift Glassman, the group's spokesman, contended that the council's actions represented a "taking" of property rights, a violation of what he called "free trade" as well as poor public policy. The son of a State Street merchant, and himself a landlord on the street, Mr. Glassman argued that the city's strategy had turned State Street into "an empty shell." He said that as recently as 1983, long after the malls opened, the street had virtually no vacancies.
Another member of the group, Michael McCloskey, a real estate appraiser, said that he, too, missed the former ambience of the street. But he regards the council's actions as counterproductive, even silly, given that an estimated 60 percent of State Street's current consumer base is office workers, mostly commuters.
"Hey, I'd like to go back to the past, too -- in my dreams," said Mr. McCloskey, a longtime Media resident, over lunch at the Towne House, a landmark restaurant just off State Street. "But this is the year 2000 and we have malls and power centers. People don't want to drive to Media for their everyday needs. They come to work, maybe to eat lunch, and that's it."
Pat Callahan, president of the American Association of Small Property Owners, said she considered the Media conflict an example of a trend in small cities and towns -- including places like Leesburg, Va., and Asheville, N.C. -- to restrict property rights in the name of downtown revival. Media's restrictions on ground-floor usage, she said, may be setting a dangerous precedent.
"The Media situation has implications for lots of communities," said Ms. Callahan, whose group, based in Washington, monitors such policies. "Public officials tend to trade bad ideas around among each other."
In Media, even the most active members of the business group realize that reversing the borough's policies will be difficult; recent surveys show that many residents prefer to see State Street returned to something closer to its 1950's mode.
Council members "will do anything that the residents want," Mr. Glassman said.
"They don't have to do anything for the businesses, because most of us are not voters," he acknowledged, as most of the commercial property owners live elsewhere.
This kind of controversy too, is common in small towns that have been engulfed by suburban sprawl, as property owners' drive for profits comes increasingly into conflict with residents' preference for the Main Streets they remember so fondly, whether from an earlier day, or from Disneyland's ersatz version.
Of course, not all business owners -- in Media or other towns -- oppose renewal campaigns. Joyce Doubet, who with her husband, Joseph, runs a jewelry store on State Street, sees no alternative -- except for the street to become like too many modern downtowns, cold and dead after dark.
"This town is not only about business, but it's also about residents," Mrs. Doubet said. "There are a lot of people who like the intimacy of the town and want to maintain some of the old spirit. This place is still pretty unique, and if everything goes as planned, State Street will come back, better than ever."

HEADLINE: Venture Capitalists, Venturing Beyond Capital

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass.

 BODY:
LAST March, Charles River Ventures, a prominent venture capital firm in New England, offered spare office space in its headquarters here to a promising Internet company in which it had a stake. But the gesture was far more than just an informal helping hand to a fledgling business.
The aid, furnished to a digital security company called Guardent, is part of a multimillion-dollar program through which Charles River wants to give the high-tech start-ups it finances a leg up in the race for riches. Called CRVelocity, the five-month-old project offers these companies an ambitious set of business development services, from computers to consultants, to ease the rocky passage from idea to going concern. 
 Some people say the approach is risky, but Charles River is not the only venture capitalist to start dispensing much more than capital. To different degrees, a number of other firms -- Greylock of Boston, Battery Ventures of Wellesley, Mass., and Mohr, Davidow Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif., to name a few -- are also signing on to the strategy for their high-tech start-ups.
"We're definitely seeing a growth in services -- if not across the board, then very predominantly," said George Moriarty, chief editor of Venture Economics, a trade publication.
The services take many forms. Venture capital firms may provide furnished office space, hire recruiters and consultants in marketing and product development, hold job fairs and splashy corporate retreats to foster strategic alliances among new companies and sign up partners to serve as the start-ups' interim chief executives. The firms are also creating limited-access Web sites where young companies can soak up shop talk.
The new assistance reflects growing competition among venture capital firms and the plausible notion that sizable investments -- Charles River has $11.7 million riding on Guardent -- merit added support. For many dot-com start-ups and their financial backers, the help may be more valuable than ever, as the tumble of technology stocks this year has made life more perilous.
Of course, venture capitalists have always helped the high-risk companies they finance -- serving on their boards, recruiting their executives, offering advice. But the new aid goes much further.
It is also true that incubators, which are specialized venture capital shops, have long offered their start-ups a full range of business development services. But while the traditional venture capital firms usually do not dominate the companies they help, incubators often treat their start-ups as subsidiaries, expecting them to use the services and products of other entities in the fold. They may write the start-ups' strategies, even fire their founders. And start-ups entering an incubator's nest give up big equity in their companies, often 50 percent -- two or three times what a traditional venture shop might typically take.
Guardent, for one, seems to be growing nicely with the hands-off kind of help that Charles River is offering. The donated offices allowed the start-up to swell from 3 to 55 employees in just three months. That growth put new workers, some with pierced eyebrows, into cramped cubicles, cheek by jowl with boxes of such supplies as bowling-style company shirts that were given to employees. In June, Guardent decamped to an old bank building nearby.
But the company, now 120 strong, still receives plenty of guidance, including two recent reports produced by Charles River on Guardent's market. Daniel R. McCall, a co-founder of Guardent, said the studies saved him three weeks of work -- an eon in Internet time. And the venture firm's debt-financing consultant helped Guardent arrange a loan quickly.
Charles River, a 30-year-old firm in the top tier of the industry, may be taking the boldest strides in this new field. The firm has $675 million invested in 75 start-ups, mostly in data communications and e-commerce; 55 of those companies are using CRVelocity in some way.
One of them, Proficiency, is fashioning software that allows companies to work together online. It has used the program's free office space, legal counsel and executive recruiting services, among other help. Another start-up, Snowshore, makes hardware and software for Internet voice services; it has used CRVelocity for marketing and finance advice, middle-level staffing and free office space. There are the little things, too -- like the free lunches that employees of both Proficiency and Snowshore receive at the Waltham site.
The pool of possible beneficiaries will grow as Charles River continues to raise a new venture fund -- now near the $1 billion mark -- for financing new companies. CRVelocity, on which the firm plans to spend $10 million this year, will also keep growing; the size of its staff should double to 30 by December.
"It's going to be a huge payoff for us," predicted Ted R. Dintersmith, a general partner at the firm and the man behind CRVelocity. "These companies are going to be a lot stronger."
 Others seem less sure. For an industry traditionally composed of small clubs of deal makers with Rolodexes, not expedition-sized staffs with complex business development tools, the foray into services faces uncertain prospects. As they proceed, venture capitalists must ensure that they maintain the nimbleness they need in their fast-paced marketplace.
"In a competitive environment, it helps to have more to offer entrepreneurs," said Prof. Joshua Lerner of Harvard Business School, who calls the size of the Charles River plan "audacious." But, he warned, "scaling up makes it challenging to retain the lean organizational culture that made you successful in the first place."
Dr. Edward B. Roberts, chairman of the Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed. "I worry about having 15 people, let alone 30," he said about the Charles River program.
Some skeptics go further, asserting that venture capital is the art of finding rough diamonds, not the trade of trying to polish stones into gems.
Others point out that incubators, an important model for the strategy, have been floundering on Wall Street amid doubts about the "build a company fast" approach. With shares of public incubators like CMGI, Internet Capital Group and Softbank falling sharply this year, these skeptics say, mainstream venture capital firms should be wary of following in the incubators' footsteps.
Some venture capital firms -- and even some start-ups that are in line for the new aid -- buy these and other criticisms.
Benchmark Capital, of Menlo Park, refuses to hire an associate, let alone a staff recruiter or a product-development specialist, for its start-ups. (The firm, however, is starting a networking Web site for them.) Andy Rachleff, a general partner, said such services often appeared to be marketing ploys rather than strategies to give a real boost to new businesses.
David Callan, chief executive of a Charles River start-up called RiverDelta Networks, a broadband services provider, said he preferred his own group of bankers, headhunters and lawyers to the services of CRVelocity. "If you add help, it adds a layer of complexity that takes more time," said Mr. Callan, a veteran of three start-ups. "I'm interested in my relationship to my general partner at Charles River, not to his firm."
But others contend that a helping hand makes sense. For one thing, they say, a start-up bogged down in a hunt for office space wastes time that could be spent developing its business, outdistancing competitors and moving toward such lucrative events as an initial public offering or a sale to another company.
"Speed is critical" in the venture capital world, said Izhar Armony, a general partner at Charles River.
Mr. Dintersmith estimated that CRVelocity would shorten by two to four months the time needed to sell a start-up or to bring it public. Over all, said Joseph Tibbetts, who oversees CRVelocity, the project might make the difference between a start-up that raises, say, $800 million in an initial offering and a powerhouse that pulls in $2 billion. (No start-ups using CRVelocity have yet gone public or been sold -- not surprising, given the recent cooling in the initial-offering market and the newness of the project.)
Proponents of the new aid also say it can help in a time of heightened competition among venture firms, corporate investing arms and the wealthy individuals known as angel investors. As the broad gains in technology stocks grew spotty this year, the race intensified to rope in the high-quality prospects -- the Amazon.coms of tomorrow. Offering more than just loads of cash can give investors an edge.
FINALLY, the venture capital industry is flush with money to fuel these initiatives. It invested $59.9 billion in 1999; some experts expect the amount to double this year. With many of the new venture funds topping $1 billion as investors chase hot sectors like wireless communications, the firms have buckets of fund management fees to spend on big organization-building moves.
At Greylock in Boston, the new largess meant leasing several thousand square feet of office space near its Palo Alto branch to furnish free housing for up to three start-ups. The move is part of what Greylock calls its Fast Forward initiative to jump-start choice companies. The program also offers the services of three new specialists with backgrounds in finance, information technology, product development and recruiting.
"We're saying, 'Hey, we've got to do more to help our companies,' " said Henry McCance, Greylock's senior partner, who calls Fast Forward "a necessary additional service that we need to stay competitive."
In August at the Sundance resort in Utah, Greylock even held a retreat -- its first ever -- for 85 start-up managers. The event, at which participants listened to a speech by Gen. Colin L. Powell and dined on buffalo steak, showed how even established venture capital firms are seeing themselves not only as visionary financiers but also as businesses that must cater to their start-ups in a formal, organized way.
Battery Ventures has added eight employees this year to help start-ups with business planning, bringing to 20 the number who are aiding portfolio companies. The firm, which recently raised a $1 billion fund, has also hired a recruiter and two partners who focus on start-up marketing issues.
Mohr, Davidow Ventures has taken a different tack. It has five partners, two of them hired since December, whose full-time jobs are to serve as interim chief executives at its start-ups.
"It really makes a difference to the entrepreneurs and helps us attract some of the best deals and get them at the earliest stage," said Donna Novitsky, the Mohr partner who serves as the temporary chief executive of InLeague, an Internet payroll and benefits start-up in which Mohr has a stake.
"Venture capital is no longer about the money," Ms. Novitsky said. "It's about the resources you bring to companies."
Other firms are treading on narrower paths. For example, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, of Menlo Park, recently hired a leading headhunter to be used by its portfolio companies. Bessemer Venture Partners, also of Menlo Park, bought an entire executive-search boutique for the same purpose. And Matrix Partners, in Waltham, may hire someone to collect salary and bonus data that its portfolio companies can share.
TO help its start-ups, Charles River recently hired no fewer than 12 specialists -- in executive recruiting, product marketing, subordinated debt financing, equipment leasing and contract law. Three employees of Everynetwork, an information technology firm that is a subcontractor for Charles River, work full time helping the start-ups install computer systems. By year-end, the firm will include 15 more consultants, some working in business development, investment banking and volume purchasing of computers and other needs.
Many of these new Charles River specialists can help in areas like marketing in which most venture capitalists have little expertise. The consultants sometimes do the work themselves but generally offer detailed advice and refer start-ups to law firms, banks, recruiting agencies and others.
Charles River has also leased an additional 12,000 square feet at its Waltham headquarters to temporarily house up to four start-ups. The firm has held all-day forums for start-up executives and runs a Web site for its portfolio companies that details office-space rates and stock-option trends and, soon, will offer live chat and message boards.
In all, Mr. Dintersmith said, "any of our companies might now have a dozen points of contact with us."
Guardent, whose other investors are Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates, seems pleased with all the help. Maria A. Cirino, Guardent's chief executive, said the start-up used the CRVelocity program's property specialist to learn how to negotiate a remodeling of its offices. (Guardent's current conference room is an old bank vault lined with safe-deposit boxes.)
But all the assistance carries a price of sorts. As it puts more on its start-ups' table, Charles River is demanding more in return.
"Our bar for what we want to fund has gone up," said Mr. Dintersmith, who ran a leading division of a semiconductor company, Analog Devices, before plunging into venture capital 12 years ago. He said the higher standards meant more rigorous scrutiny of business models and company founders as well as a larger ownership stake -- at least 15 percent, up from 10 percent -- for its initial investments.
AND there are limits to what Charles River will do to help. For example, problems arose when HighWired.com, a Web site about high school that features yearbooks, clips from student newspapers and the like, relied on CRVelocity for legal advice on routine business matters.
"We had to reset their expectations," said Mr. Dintersmith, adding that in general CRVelocity would not become a Sherpa to companies. "We're not going to review their documents."
Don Young, chief executive of HighWired.com, acknowledged that his company was an active user of CRVelocity. But, he added: "CRVelocity will push back if it thinks it has to. They have a limited amount of resources."
Such growing pains may worry venture capitalists, some of whom see the risks in the changes even as they adopt them. "The whole thing is a little experimental," Mr. McCance of Greylock acknowledged.
On the other hand, whatever the merits, this growth of services may mark a turning point in the industry, said Prof. Paul Gompers of Harvard Business School.
"It's the evolution of venture capital," Professor Gompers said, "from an art into a business."
 
And Free Lunch, Too
 To give start-ups a push in the race for riches, some venture capital firms are furnishing them with offices and legal advice - even temporary chief executives. Above, executives at Charles River Ventures share lunch at the firm's offices in Waltham, Mass., with presidents of two companies the firm is aiding - Scott Berkey, far left, of Proficiency and Joel Hughes, second from left, of Snowshore. Ted Dintersmith, second from right, a general partner, hatched Charles River's plan; Izhar Armony, center, a general partner, is on the board of Guardent, another company it is financing. Sarah Reed, right, works full time furnishing the start-ups with legal advice. Here are details of the help that four of the firm's companies receive:
 
Start-up: Proficiency
Business: Software to help companies work together online
Charles River Ventures' stake: $4 million
Aid received: Free office space, legal advice, executive recruiting
 
Start-up: Guardent

HEADLINE: The World;
If Koreas Unite, Will Asia Divide?

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
FOR nearly 50 years, American troops billeted along the most heavily fortified border in the world have helped stave off a surprise attack by North Korea and have kept the line separating it from the south frozen in place.
Now, after a short few months of stunning diplomacy that started with a presidential summit in June and was recognized with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize last week to President Kim Dae-Jung of South Korea, many Koreans have finally been able to imagine an end to their nation's division. 
 But as the prospect for national reconciliation and eventual reunification grows, anxiety is spreading throughout Northeast Asia, suddenly bringing into sharp focus a feature of the American military presence whose effects are far more sweeping than its assigned role of defending a medium-sized ally.
The region is home to many of the most explosive loose ends of the 20th century. And by policing the Korean DMZ for five decades, the United States did far more than keep the truce here. It served as a cork in the bottle, preventing historic rivalries and animosities among China, Japan, Korea and even Russia from spilling forth.
Under the American shield, Western Europe came together during this same period, both economically and politically, and ultimately witnessed the collapse of the threat from the rival bloc to the east.
But this region, home to the world's most populous nation, its second largest economy and several of the world's biggest and best equipped armies, has seen no such coalescence. What remains in place instead are many of the same antagonisms of old, together with incomparably greater means to act upon them.
American policy makers are plainly aware of this. President Clinton himself recently warned against any premature American withdrawal from Korea. But thoughts are already turning to the substantial downsizing that would inevitably follow any peace treaty between the Koreas. "Mission defines force structure," said the United States ambassador to South Korea, Stephen W. Bosworth, who said that American ground troops could be cut back in the future. "If we are no longer here to deter, we may need different things. Our military planners would work closely with our Korean hosts to decide what is necessary."
But Korea's Asian neighbors are clearly not waiting for an uncertain peace treaty between the divided halves of the peninsula to begin thinking and worrying about what comes after the Pax Americana.
Indeed, they may not have to. If the two Koreas are able to sustain any momentum in their current engagement, public opinion in South Korea since the summit meeting, together with generational changes, will steadily increase pressure on present and future governments to shrink America's presence. Last month, one newspaper poll said that 67.3 percent of Koreans already favored a gradual withdrawal of United States troops, while 10.7 percent wished them to leave immediately.
"Simply maintaining good atmospherics could be a real destabilizer," said Han S. Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. "South Korea cannot maintain the necessary level of military preparedness under these circumstances. National security advocates in the society will find themselves on the defensive."
While South Koreans who are old enough to remember the devastation of the Korean War, or to have grown up in its shadow, worry that the prospect of peace on their peninsula paradoxically carries with it a heightened risk of renewed disaster, Korea's neighbors are haunted by patterns set in a distant past.
Western Europe's rivals came together around common cultural foundations, capitalist economies and democracy. But China and Japan, despite having much in common, are as divided as ever. One is Communist, the other capitalist. One is wealthy and increasingly gray, the other's system young and relatively poor, but fast-rising. Each craves stability. But neither can countenance being eclipsed by the other.
And for China, which sees itself as the region's Greece and Rome, the humiliation under Japan's brutal colonial rule drives its bid for renewed -- the Chinese would say rightful -- pre-eminence.
When these two powers have locked horns in the past, it has often been over control of the Korean Peninsula. And many of the worst nightmares of their leaders today involve the peninsula once again.
For Japan, the bad dream is an expansion of Chinese power and influence in the peninsula, including the military use of ports like Pusan to intimidate it.
"The closer the Koreas grow together, the more the rationale for the American forces will change, and if there is rapid movement, it will have a major impact on Japan's security," said Terumasa Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University in Japan. "Koreans tend to be very complacent and overly optimistic about China, and that worries the Japanese.
"The nightmare that Japanese have is that the peninsula one day will fall under the strategic sway of China. We have a fear of seeing the Chinese naval colors being flown in Pusan one day. To American eyes this may seem rather far-fetched, but this comes from a deep-rooted historic and cultural experience of the three nations in northeast Asia."
China, meanwhile, harbors a real fear of Japanese rearmament and a resurgence of Japanese militarism. Such a turn of events could flow from further North Korean nuclear or missile weapons testing, or from a feeling in Japan of being left exposed once there are fewer American troops.
HAVING had hundreds of years of experience of foreign interventions, Korea, the quintessential medium power surrounded by far more powerful neighbors, knows the frightening regional scenarios by heart. "Historically when Japan gets stronger they simply cannot remain on their own island; they try to expand their power on the continent," said Chun In Young, a political scientist at Seoul National University. "But China will then say, 'But this has been our traditional zone of influence.' Their worsening relations will inevitably have grave consequences here, and could prove to be the most persuasive reason for retaining an American presence."
But things are not quite that straightforward. Whether one considers allies, rivals or outright foes, the presence of American troops both grates and gratifies, often simultaneously. China, for example, has never officially favored the American deployment in South Korea, even though it has plainly profited from the resulting peace, to the point of establishing lucrative economic ties with South Korea. "If North Korea is no longer the threat, the Chinese will ask, why are the Americans still on the peninsula," said Mr. Park, of the University of Georgia. "Redefining the role under these circumstances is going to be a formidable task."
With few of these issues worked out, it is little wonder that none of the regional players appears to be in a hurry to address the question of the American troop presence as they watch events unfold between the Koreas. According to President Kim Dae Jung, even his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, told him that he wishes to see American troops remain.
"Frankly no one knows what the picture will look like in 10 or 15 years," said Mr. Nakanishi, the Japanese specialist in international affairs. "But the mainstay of order in this region is the American presence. And as Margaret Thatcher once said, you should not break down your old house until you have built a new one."

Latin America Loses Its Technology Gleam

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
SCANNING the wreckage of Latin American technology stocks, it is hard to believe that just six months ago investors in both North and South America were giddy about prospects that the Internet would grow faster in the region than anywhere else in the world.
Today, the pioneering Latin American Internet stocks lie battered and bruised. Planned initial public offerings have been scrapped. Venture capital money has dried up. Companies that were in hiring frenzies just months ago have let employees go. Some start-ups have shut down. Vultures are circling over others. 
 "The information technology sector is out of favor right now globally, but much more so in Latin America," Eduardo Cabrera, senior director of Latin America strategy for Merrill Lynch, said recently at the Council of the Americas annual economic forecast in New York. "It's hard to see some of these Internet companies ever coming back."
The bright outlook darkened last spring with the meltdown of the Nasdaq, where the biggest Latin American Internet companies are traded. For several reasons, the effect was magnified in Latin America. Internet companies there generally are smaller and less established than those here. The market is more segmented by country and culture, making widespread success harder than in the more homogeneous United States. Also, the Latin American market was literally being defined when the bottom fell out in April.
Finally, "As usually happens in Latin America, things happened with greater exuberance than in the United States," said David Yanovich, executive editor of Punto-com, a new information services company that tracks the Latin American Internet market. "For a while, everyone was falling in love with Latin American Internet," Mr. Yanovich said. "Now they hate it."
It is easy to see why. Shares in StarMedia, the biggest Latin American portal and the company whose successful $110 million stock offering in June 1999 spawned dozens of would-be followers, closed Friday on the Nasdaq exchange at $5.69, less than one-tenth of the high they reached a few weeks after listing. In September, StarMedia let go of 125 employees, about 15 percent of its work force.
StarMedia has said the layoffs were needed to consolidate recent acquisitions and will help it climb into the black by the end of next year.
Some analysts say the Nasdaq links of the big Latin American Internet companies yoked them to the Nasdaq fall, but that in the end the listing will help them restore confidence and rebound, if they can become profitable.
Until then, the going will be rough. El Sitio, for example, another big portal, is now trading on Nasdaq at $3.44, less than 10 percent of its high of $41 at the end of last year.
Quepasa, listed on Nasdaq just over a year ago for about $17, closed Friday at 67 cents. Terra Networks, part of the Spanish Telefonica congolomerate, has declined about 40 percent since late last year, closing Friday at $22.06.
Mr. Cabrera does not have buy recommendations on StarMedia and Terra, despite the low prices, but he advises shareowners to hold the stocks because the companies have solid plans and "the big will survive." He is not sure about the smaller companies, like El Sitio and Quepasa, which will not have access to more capital any time soon.
Richard C. Madigan, director of Latin American investments for Offitbank, said the explosive growth in Latin American Internet companies over the last year was speculative and ultimately unsustainable. "A lot of venture capital went into start-ups, but most of the money went into marketing and branding," he said.
Brian Kim, a director of CVC Latin America, one of Citicorp's venture capital arms, detects a "dramatic shift" in investors' views of existing companies, especially the start-ups that have not yet gone public.
"Five years from now, you'll have a handful of companies that will have a real opportunity to be catalysts in their sectors," he said. "Then there will be another tier of companies that will find a segment of the market and become niche players. But the vast majority of the companies that you see there today, quite frankly, are going to disappear."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Sometimes, Cheap Is No Bargain

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IS the stock market done going down, down, down?
Without a copy of next week's newspaper, it's a tough call to make. But because stocks have dropped sharply in the autumn over the last three years, only to rebound impressively, investors most likely suspect -- and almost certainly hope -- that the market's troubles are closer to their end than to their start. 
 Shares rallied on Friday, but all the major indexes closed down for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 13 percent since it peaked in January, while the Nasdaq composite has plummeted 34 percent from its March heights.
Investors in technology and telecommunications stocks have been the hardest hit. And as they survey the wreckage in these stocks, they may now think that they see bargains popping up.
There is a problem, though, with investing in stocks that have risen not on fundamentals but rather on headlong purchases by momentum traders. When these stocks fall, the throngs that bought them simply because they were going up have no idea what they are worth. With some stocks way down -- many have lost more than 60 percent of their value -- investors may think they have bottomed out when they haven't.
Consider Intel, a company revered by investors. Since last month's warning that third-quarter sales would miss analysts' estimates, traders have sliced 34 percent off Intel's value. But is it a buy?
No, says Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist Newsletter in Nashua, N.H., who has been dead right in his predictions of how the recent technology wreck would unfold. While Mr. Hickey acknowledges that some technology stocks are worth a look, Intel, he argues, is still too high.
Mr. Hickey points out that for years, as Intel had a virtual monopoly producing a highly specialized product, its shares traded in a range of 10 to 15 times earnings. Today, at $40.38, it is trading at 30 times earnings.
"Now they have real competition from the Taiwanese and A.M.D.," Mr. Hickey said, referring to Advanced Micro Devices. He also believes that investors can no longer count on the gains that Intel has enjoyed in its own portfolio of investments. "Maybe it's fairly valued somewhere in the teens," he said. "At $18, it would still be trading at four times sales, a lot for a semiconductor company selling commodity-type stuff."
Although Mr. Hickey thinks most of what looks cheap today may become even cheaper, stocks he says to consider include Lucent Technologies, Motorola and Lexmark International. "If you see new management at Lucent, there could be a turnaround there," he said. And Motorola, trading at a price equal to its sales, is attractive, too. Apple Computer has $10 a share in cash on its balance sheet, he added, giving the stock something of a floor.
James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, is another strategist who fears that the liquidation of technology stocks is not yet over. That is because the sales growth that technology companies enjoyed in the last few years is slowing.
The technology boom that propelled these stocks, Mr. Paulsen said, was fueled by falling computer and cell phone prices. Now the price declines are reversing, and consumers are slowing purchases. "Real personal consumption growth in technology went from an 80 percent rate in 1999 to 35 percent right now," he said. "When there's not real price declines, it slows the growth."
Unfortunately, technology is such a big contributor to economic growth in the United States that a slowdown in the sector could have much broader effects today than it would have had even five years ago. "Because it's such a huge piece of the economy," Mr. Paulsen said, "if tech is going down for a breather, the economy's going down for a breather."

High Oil Prices Start to Exact a Toll on the Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For much of this year, the surging price of oil did not seem to worry stock or bond investors. Even as the price of a barrel of crude jumped from $27 a barrel to $33 in August, the stock market rallied and the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell, dropping well below 6 percent.
But with the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in early September, investor sentiment seemed to change. Finally, the market realized oil might pose an inflation problem. The three major stock indexes seemed to turn down on cue, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note began to rise. 
 The additional 800,000 barrels a day of new production promised by OPEC was not enough to bring prices lower. The 30 million barrels of oil that the Clinton administration made plans to pump from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve helped bring down the price, but it could not break below $30 a barrel.
Then in October, the Fed said higher oil prices were beginning to be worrisome. "The increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, poses a risk of raising inflation expectations," it said.
Now Mideast turmoil is keeping oil in the news and helping to keep the price above $30 a barrel.
If the strong jump in retail sales in September is any indication, American consumers have not yet cut back spending much to make up for the higher cost of driving their cars or heating their homes.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Salvaging the Reputation of Sanctions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WITH euphoria sweeping the newly liberated Serbia, President Clinton might have expected a hearty greeting when he phoned Vojislav Kostunica last week to congratulate him on the democratic revolution he led. The conversation was cordial enough, the Serbian leader's aides said, but Mr. Kostunica had a few sharp words for Mr. Clinton: Lift the sanctions now.
Economic sanctions sting. When carefully applied and diligently enforced, they can work. Sanctions almost certainly contributed to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who had survived the loss of four civil wars and a bombing by NATO. The Yugoslavia case could salvage the reputation of these shout-instead-of-shoot expressions of moral and political outrage. 
 "There's no question that they played a significant role," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States deputy Treasury secretary who took part in designing and administering the sanctions. "They helped to bring down the economy and created the conditions that led to the uprising."
Exactly what prompted Serbians to vote Mr. Milosevic out of office and then take to the streets to enforce their will may take years to decipher fully. Some people argue that international pressure did more harm than good, creating a patriotic backlash that actually sustained Mr. Milosevic in power and postponed the day of reckoning.
There is also no question that the sanctions inflicted collateral damage on people who were never supposed to be targets. Mr. Kostunica's stern comments to Mr. Clinton reflect popular anger at the United States because it led the sanctions campaign.
At home, political sentiment has begun to turn against the use of trade and investment embargoes in all but the most egregious cases. Academic studies have shown that sanctions -- especially those applied by the United States alone without support from major allies in Europe and elsewhere -- rarely achieve the intended results even when left in place for many years.
Multinational corporations have formed lobbying groups devoted to eliminating or easing sanctions on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq and other nations. USA Engage, one such group in Washington, estimates that sanctions cost $15 billion to $19 billion in lost exports each year and that American companies employ 200,000 fewer people in high-wage, export-oriented jobs because of lost sales.
But the Yugoslavia case could plausibly be remembered as the most significant success for economic sanctions since the fall of the apartheid regime in South Africa more than a decade ago. Yugoslavia could also provide a road map for how to achieve results and avoid common pitfalls.
The NATO allies imposed a variety of sanctions on Yugoslavia beginning in 1992, during the war in Bosnia. The sanctions had so-called outer and inner walls, with the outer wall cutting off Yugoslavia from official aid and the inner wall, elements of which were added gradually, slapping restrictions on many Serbian companies and the Milosevic-linked elite.
The sanctions also included restrictions on air travel and oil sales to Yugoslavia, though both were eased even before Mr. Milosevic's fall. Mr. Clinton and European leaders have promised to lift many of the sanctions now that Mr. Kostunica has come to power. The outer wall may remain in place until Mr. Milosevic stands trial.
Perhaps the most significant breakthrough in Yugoslavia was that the United States and Europe stuck together. Basic unity prevailed despite numerous battles behind the scenes and frequent modifications to the sanctions.
The Western nations worked closely together to restrict commerce with state-owned companies, a major factor in the economic collapse that Serbia experienced after the war in Kosovo. The economy shrank by 20 percent in 1999, with inflation hitting 50 percent and almost one-third of Serbians surviving without regular work.
Another lesson is that as far as sanctions go, the rifle outperforms the shotgun. Western powers identified about 300 members of the Serbian elite closely tied to Mr. Milosevic and barred them from traveling to the West.
The ban forced businesspeople as well as the political and intellectual elite of this once relatively open Central European nation to choose between Mr. Milosevic and their ties to Europe. The crumbling of elite support may have helped undermine him.
Sanctions inevitably remain a blunt instrument, especially when the goal is the replacement of a single leader. Serbia suffered through severe electricity shortages and an effective cutoff of medical equipment, a shortage that many Serbs believe led to unnecessary deaths. At least for a time, such sentiments helped Mr. Milosevic rally anti-Western support.
Gordana Ristic, 35, a marketing executive in Belgrade who lost much of her business because of sanctions, said many Serbs felt a patriotic duty to defend their nation when sanctions were first imposed. That delayed what she described as an inevitable rebellion against Mr. Milosevic, though she did not deny that Serbs eventually rose up, in part because they tired of the pain and isolation.
"We have an image of ourselves as Europeans, and not as poor Europeans, so that hurt," she said in a telephone conversation last week. "But if you think we are going to thank the United States for doing this to us, you will be kept waiting."

HEADLINE: Providing Seed Money, in Defense of Corporate Turf

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
DAZZLED by the success of financial entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, companies as wide-ranging as advertising agencies, truck makers, package couriers and independent film marketers are racing to set up venture capital arms.
The prize is not merely the investment gains that are sought by traditional financiers. These companies are seeking primarily to finance start-ups that are working on innovative technologies that could make or break the corporate parents' own futures. 
 The trend is not entirely new. Some Fortune 500 behemoths established venture arms in the 1970's and 1980's, while giants of the new economy, like Intel and Lucent Technologies, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into their own venture capital units. Banks like Chase Manhattan have also become aggressive venture investors.
But companies in many other industries are also getting into the act. Consider Artisan Entertainment, an entertainment producer and distributor in New York, whose marketing on the Internet helped to turn the low-budget "Blair Witch Project" into a hit movie last year.
Last month, Artisan set up a $50 million venture capital fund, called iArtisan, to invest in start-ups working on new-media plumbing like streaming video and digital compression.
"This allows us to grow and expand our business," said Nicolas van Dyk, a former Disney executive who runs the fund, which has yet to make its first investment. Like a growing number of traditional venture capital shops, Artisan Entertainment may even offer various kinds of nonmonetary help, like office space, phones and advice.
David Barry, senior editor of The Corporate Venturing Report, counts some 350 corporate venture capital programs around the world. Corporate venture programs accounted for $8.2 billion, or 15 percent, of the $54 billion invested by the venture capital industry in the first half of this year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group in Arlington, Va. That is more than twice the level of two years ago.
"Corporations need a venture capital arm to stay on top of companies that may either be their future partner or eat their lunch," Mr. Barry said.
That is the motivation behind the $50 million that United Parcel Service has staked its Strategic Enterprise Fund. Its main goal "is to be hand-in-glove with companies with cutting-edge technologies coming down the pike that might have an application for us," said Bob Godlewski, a company spokesman.
"It's a nice accident if we make money," he added.
The fund, started in 1997, recently took a small stake in Air2Web, which produced technology that U.P.S. uses to let customers track shipments online.
Other recent corporate venture investors include Paccar, a truck maker in Seattle, which is pursuing technologies that may improve its operations, and the WPP Group, the advertising holding company, which is financing new-media start-ups.
Because corporations are beholden to shareholders and securities overseers, they cannot place as many highflying bets as venture capital shops, which are largely unregulated. And the venture capital firms can compensate their financiers far better than can their corporate counterparts, whose shareholders may resent huge payouts.
Some corporations are investing expertise, not cash, in the venture funds. Artisan Entertainment raised money from Grove Street Advisors, an investment advisory and venture capital firm, and Audax Ventures, a private equity and venture shop, that went into the iArtisan fund. For its part, Artisan is contributing services to the companies in which the fund will invest.
By contrast, Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, said last month that it would pour $1 billion into a venture fund it had created to bankroll new-media technology companies.

The Un-COLA Economy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
According to the script, we were supposed to spend this first year of the new millennium celebrating the glories of the new economy. If things did go wrong, they were supposed to go wrong in some appropriately futuristic fashion -- the Y2K bug would shut down the world, or we would have an exotic financial crisis involving e-commerce. (Business Week's economics editor has just published a book titled "The Coming Internet Depression.")
But instead, it seems, we're gonna party like it's 1979. Oil prices have already soared, and the news from the Middle East may send them higher still. Is stagflation about to stage a comeback? 
 The answer (knock on silicon) is probably not. If oil prices continue to rise, they will cut into the huge gains that the U.S. economy has achieved over the past few years. But there are good reasons to think that a replay of the grim years that followed the 1979 oil crisis isn't likely.
For one thing, so far the shock to the system hasn't been that large, because we were spending so little on oil to begin with. In 1978, before the last oil crisis, the United States spent almost 2 percent of its G.D.P. on oil imports; in 1998 we spent only slightly more than half a percent. The rise in oil prices since then has made the nation as a whole about 1 percent poorer than it would otherwise have been. That's not a trivial number. (Fuzzy yes, trivial no.) But in an economy whose workers become 3 or 4 percent more productive each year it should be a manageable burden.
Of course, "should be" is not the same as "will be." Twenty years ago, the hit to the economy from higher oil prices was only about twice as large as what we're seeing now. But the damage was multiplied many times over, because higher oil prices fed an inflationary spiral: higher prices led to higher wages, which led to further price increases, and onward and upward. To break this vicious circle the Fed raised interest rates, and plunged the economy into the worst recession since the 1930's.
The good news is that it's a different economy these days, and probably much less vulnerable to a wage-price spiral.
What was so deadly in 1979 was the prevalence of "indexation": wage settlements linked to inflation. Many wage contracts contained explicit COLA's -- cost-of-living adjustments -- that automatically raised wages in tandem with the consumer price index. And even where COLA's weren't written into the contract, the preceding decade of inflation had made workers highly sensitive to rising prices, and employers were quick to raise wages (and their own prices) whenever they saw the cost of living jump. So when a crisis in the Middle East sent oil prices sky-high, and consumer prices followed, it quickly translated into double-digit inflation across the board.
Nowadays, however, explicit COLA's are the exception rather than the norm. Partly this reflects the changing nature of labor relations. Only about one private-sector worker in 10 now belongs to a union, and the unions are weaker, too -- which means that they are no longer in a position to get ironclad protection for their members' purchasing power.
Equally important, after a decade of low inflation the implicit indexation that used to be prevalent in our economy -- the hair-trigger response to any sign that inflation was about to cut into earnings -- has vanished. By and large we have gone back to thinking that a dollar tomorrow is as good as a dollar today; and to some extent believing makes it so.
Does this mean that we are completely safe from an oil-fed economic crisis? Of course not. The biggest danger is that the Fed -- or its counterpart overseas, the European Central Bank -- will raise interest rates out of fear that 2000 will play like 1979, and in the process provoke a gratuitous recession. But I think the Fed is smarter than that. (I'm not so sure about the E.C.B.)
Still, this crude shock ought to be a warning to us. It shows that a country ought to follow responsible monetary and fiscal policies in good times, because that leaves it better able to handle the bad times when they come. And it shows how dangerous it is to base economic plans on the assumption that the good times will never end. Sound like anyone you've seen on TV lately?

Preventing Terrorism After the Cole Bombing

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
YEMEN is a failed state on the mend just around the corner from Somalia, in a truly wild neighborhood. It has been a haven for international terrorists and radical Islamic groups and there is little evidence that the government has any control over them.
Given these facts, some critics are already blaming policy makers for placing United States forces in such a dangerous place -- and by extension, in all such places. 
 Using a refueling stop to build stronger ties with a volatile and struggling Arab nation not only backfired, such critics say, it shouldn't have been tried.
"It's not worth the risk," said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George Bush. "Yemen has a bad record, and it's still a place where the government is unable or unwilling to take certain steps against certain terrorist groups. We must become more selective and more wary of who we do normal operations with."
Others at least as numerous insist that the United States must not let terrorists dictate how and where it projects its presence on the globe. And to be sure, the United States is staying put in the Middle East.
"We have very large interests in the region that aren't just important, they are vital," said Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman who headed the House International Relations Committee.
Mr. Hamilton's list of interests is a long one: unfettered access to affordable oil; protecting Israel's security; limiting the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to launch them; checking the influence of Islamic fundamentalists; advancing economic development in the region.
"It would be an absolute victory for terrorists, if they're behind this attack, if we pulled back and stopped doing our job in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, and we're not going to give them that victory," said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon.
Indeed, say critics of withdrawal, wouldn't abandoning the field in places like Yemen just leave them open to getting worse? Everyone points to Somalia as the example to avoid. But it wasn't the worst case by any means. Consider, for example, the experts in the Reagan administration who put American troops in a barracks at the airport in Lebanon in 1983.
After the killing of 241 American servicemen by a Shiite Muslim driving a suicide truck bomb in October 1983, American resolve was badly shaken and there was a furious domestic debate over whether the United State should have brought in troops in the first place, or whether it should have done so in a different way.
The alternative, which came to pass when the American troops left, was Syrian control, for which everyone in the region is still paying the price.
The thing the Saudis, Egyptians and others in the region remember most about the marines in Beirut was not their arrival, but their departure. In Arab eyes, the marines simply cut and ran from Lebanon when the Syrians and their Lebanese allies made the cost of staying too high.
Both sides of the leave-or-stay debate, however, ignore a simple point: that there are common-sense rules of engagement for doing business in dodgy places that could reduce the risks of operating in them.
First of all, the diplomatic and military services should invest heavily in intelligence, preferably the kind using real eyes and ears, which can infiltrate terrorist groups and snitch.
"We're constantly reading the tea leaves very carefully," said one four-star officer with experience in the Middle East. "You continually assess the intelligence, bounce those observations off others and gauge the host nation's level of security cooperation. These things don't stay on a flat line, they ebb and flow."
Second, avoid stationing forces where they can become targets of opportunity and resentment. After the 1996 bombing of a housing complex in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 airmen were killed, American troops in Dhahran were moved out of urban compounds into more defensible desert bases.
Third, when traveling around the region, go well armed and avoid falling into predictable patterns that are vulnerable to preplanned attack.
Fourth, to the extent possible, limit dependence on host-nation support for security, supplies and other services that would allow terrorists to carry out an inside job, as the bombing of the destroyer Cole seems to have been.
Fifth, work closely with the host country's intelligence and police forces to limit vulnerabilities.
These are pretty straightforward operating principles, but they may be ignored, ether because of overconfidence in American armed might (forgetting that the whole point of terrorism is to puncture that very image), or because American forces overseas often want to be seen as benevolent and helpful.
"It's very, very complicated," said Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, who commanded allied naval forces in the 1991 Persian gulf war. "The basic nature of Americans is that we're much more comfortable reaching out than being in a bunker mentality."
In Lebanon, the United States trusted all factions to accept that it would be an even-handed guardian of order. In Yemen, it trusted the port authority not to be infiltrated by Islamic kamikazes, a doubtful proposition at best. "They executed the plan as it was specified," Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations said of the American commanders' security precautions.
Today, it is clear that the plan was inadequate. What happened in Yemen is a reminder that the world abounds in dangerous places, that American forces are vulnerable whenever they venture into them and that they must take precautions equal to that knowledge.

HEADLINE: We're No. 1, and Paying for It

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel teaches international relations at the University of Southern California and is the author of "Temptations of a Superpower" and "In Love with Night: The American Romance with Robert Kennedy."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It was an eerie coincidence. On Wednesday night, Al Gore and George W. Bush debated foreign policy for some 40 minutes. The next day, the tense confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians erupted into virtual open warfare, and in Yemen, the American Navy destroyer Cole was bombed in a terrorist attack that took the lives of 17 sailors.
In retrospect, the debate last week didn't come close to touching on the real repercussions of an interventionist foreign policy. It's not that such a policy is wrong. But the terrorist attack on Thursday does demonstrate that in foreign policy, as in domestic policy, there is no free lunch; every policy exacts a price. 
 Terrorist attacks are not capricious, nor are they even irrational. They have happened with regularity over the years. In 1998, the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed and 224 people were killed. In 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside an American military compound in Saudi Arabia, killing and injuring more than 500 people. In 1993, the World Trade Center in Manhattan was bombed by foreign terrorists.
All these acts were directly related to the active role the United States plays in the world, and they were intended to punish and change that role.
Neither George Bush nor Al Gore wants to change that role in any kind of real way -- but they, and we as a country, have failed to address its repercussions. Instead, in this presidential campaign, we have focused on essentially rhetorical differences.
In the debate, Mr. Gore presented himself as a committed liberal interventionist in the Woodrow Wilson tradition. He defended the American intervention in Bosnia on humanitarian grounds, and also went on to argue that "genocide or ethnic cleansing . . . can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest, because I think it's based on our values."
Indeed, the promotion of American values throughout the world seemed to be the centerpiece of his foreign policy. The United States should "have a sense of mission in the world" and use its "values" and its strength to "project the power for good that American can represent," he proclaimed.
Nonetheless, he defended the administration's decision not to intervene in the Rwanda genocide, in which an estimated 600,000 people were murdered. He did so on the grounds that our "national security interest" was not involved.
This explanation hardy differed from that of Mr. Bush, who also opposed humanitarian intervention in Rwanda and supported the intervention in Bosnia (because of our interests in NATO). Although he opposed sending troops to Haiti to promote democracy, he supported interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama and the Persian Gulf.
"We can't be all things to all people in the world," Mr. Bush declared, nor should we "walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you."
For all their supposed differences, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush agree more than they disagree. They both believe in a powerful military, in strong alliances held together by America's armed forces, direct economic and political intervention where it serves American interests and the active discouragement of any potential rival power.
Mr. Bush may have spoken gently during the debate about the virtues of displaying "humility." But what he meant was the humility of the strong, not of the weak. Moreover, both men labored to portray their vision of American foreign policy as good not only for the United States but for the world.
The attack in Yemen serves as areality check. It reminds us that the very "values" in which we take pride can be viewed by others as hypocritical or corrupt or even evil. And it reminds us that our power to project our values can been seen as a mortal threat to the values of others, however objectionable we may regard those values.
Those we describe as terrorists do not see themselves in such terms. They are, in their own eyes, what Ronald Reagan once called the Nicaraguan contras: "the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers."
Even among our friends, admiration for our values is not unbounded. The attack on a McDonald's store in France by a disgruntled citizen was widely applauded there as an act of cultural resistance. For most of the world, America is the 800-pound gorilla that they must appease as they lie down with it uneasily every night.
It can hardly be otherwise. If the United States is to play a powerful role in the world -- and both candidates, along with virtually all Americans, want this -- it must do things that will annoy and even infuriate others.
This is true no matter what we do. It is particularly true if the United States more actively pursues what Mr. Gore has referred to as the policy of "forward engagement" -- of "addressing problems early in their development before they become crises."
This is another way of describing an activist, interventionist foreign policy of the sort that a great imperial power pursues to protect its interests and nip opposition in the bud.
But such policies exact a price. One of them is involvement in wars and crises over issues that we hardly understand; another is being subjected to the feverish contempt of those who scorn what we are and hate us for what we do.
This is the way the world works, and it does little good, except perhaps for our self-esteem, to proclaim, as Mr. Gore did in the debate that, "this nation is now looked on by peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what the future could be."
Nor can we realistically be a "humble nation," in Mr. Bush's phrase, in anything but rhetoric if we expect to retain our full power and influence. The suicide bombers in Yemen help remind us that virtue is not its own reward.
Great powers may be admired or emulated, but they are rarely loved. Both George Bush and Al Gore know this, even though they think that voters' tender sensibilities may be offended to hear it. But we and they have to recognize our nation as the great imperial power it has become.
And as Edmund Burke observed during the high tide of British power and influence, "A great empire and little minds go ill together."

Soaring and Plunging, But Without the Private Jet

BYLINE: By Julie Dunn

 BODY:
For Michael H. Jordan, the former chief executive of Westinghouse, the biggest change in moving from the old economy to the new as chairman of Luminant Worldwide, a provider of e-commerce services based in Dallas, was in transportation. "Life in the private sector -- i.e., without your Gulfstream -- really lacks," he joked last week.
But then, life at Internet speed is also much less predictable. Luminant stock, having peaked at $52 in November, has recently been trading at about $2. Mr. Jordan, in a speech on Thursday at the New York Infotech Forum, remained upbeat. "If you don't fail at something, you never tried hard enough to do something different," he said, alluding to the experience of new-economy companies. "I believe that the business revolution is not over, but the profile of their success will be somewhat different." 
 He predicted that the decline in Web businesses would turn around in the next 12 months as large corporations realized that the Internet was not "some great mysterious thing that you have to wear a ponytail to understand." The new economy will then permeate the old economy rather than standing apart, he said.
What about the downturn's effects on his own wealth? "The expression in Texas is, down here trees don't grow to the sky," Mr. Johnson said, noting that many other stocks are also way down. "It's either feast or famine; we're in love or we're going to run for the exits. I'm still chairman, and I still have a lot of stock."

 BODY:
There were no plastic pennants. "No balloons; no bunting," said Alasdair M. Stewart, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Bentley Motor Cars for North America. Instead, Mr. Stewart had several vintage and new cars outside -- along with Taittinger and an art show inside -- to open his new showroom on Thursday on Madison Avenue at 49th Street. That showroom is part of his strategy to bolster Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales in the United States from 672 last year to, eventually, 5,000. 
 Thanks to dot-com dollars, Mr. Stewart has succeeded in lowering the average age of Bentley buyers to 43, from 50 just 18 months ago. Ostentation run wild? No, no. With Bentleys starting at a mere $210,000, he said, "It gets positioned more as stealth wealth than brash cash."

Is What We've Got Here a Compulsion to Exaggerate?

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE of Vice President Al Gore's favorite stories is about the time he fell for a trick played on him as a cub reporter at the Nashville Tennessean. He was writing obituaries one night when a funeral director called to report that a Swedish gynecologist, a certain Trebla Erog, had passed away. Subsequent calls -- secretly placed by one of Mr. Gore's colleagues, Jerry Thompson -- kept adding dramatic details. Finally, he learned that the doctor's distraught wife had died, too, on her way to the hospital.
As Mr. Gore told it at a memorial service for Mr. Thompson earlier this year, he not only fell for the gag, but shouted at his editors to hold page one: "This thing is getting better all the time!" But hearing the story told this way alarmed the vice president's former editor, Frank Ritter, who has a signed photo of the Gores in his office. 
 "Thompson and I set him up on Trebla Erog" -- Albert Gore spelled backwards -- "but Al caught on pretty quickly," Mr. Ritter said in an interview several months back. It was another reporter, Mr. Ritter explained, who had been taken in. "But Al made himself the goat. It was funny, funny, but it didn't happen that way. I said to my honey, 'I'm worried. He's just said he invented the Internet and he and Tipper were the models for "Love Story." He ought to be more careful.' "
In fact, he is careful, sometimes excruciatingly so. In more than a dozen long interviews for a series of biographical articles over the last six months, Mr. Gore constantly monitored his own storytelling, self-editing as he spoke, trying hard to stick to what he knew to be true. "Now, this is a family anecdote," he'd say, "that like a lot of family anecdotes I can't really vouch for."
In a tight presidential race his colorized storytelling is no minor issue, with Republicans clearly exaggerating the exaggerations and Democrats worrying that the perception they're peddling could wind up losing him the race. Suddenly, details, details, could decide it all. That's probably because in a healthy economy, the heir to a still popular president, a man of considerable experience who a majority of Americans agree with on the issues, has as yet been unable to close the sale. For lack of a better way to get a handle on why this is so, the issue of Mr. Gore's exaggerations seems to be standing in for larger, fuzzier questions about his personal appeal.
Various friends, who allow that he has a habit of exaggerating, have various theories about why: That it's all in the tradition of southern storytelling. Or that it's the legacy of his political parents. His father, Senator Albert Gore, was himself considered a standout exaggerator in his day, even by Mr. Gore and his mother, both of whom have been quoted to that effect.
Or they point to the way Mr. Gore was raised, by parents who always had one eye on his political future. They were improving his resume before he was old enough to have one. When he was six, an item in the Knoxville News-Sentinel had Senator Gore bragging that Little Al had "out-talked a senator" when he got his dad to buy him a 98-cent bow and arrow set rather than the 49-cent model the senator had chosen: "He's a budding politician. There may be another Gore on the way to the political pinnacle. He's just six years old now. But with his experiences to date, who knows what may happen?" How could Mr. Gore be expected to know what was real and what was hype?
HERE he is, for example, struggling to stay within the lines even while reminiscing about some Tennessee cousins: "I lived with them when I was younger. When I was four years old my parents dropped me off there one day." But wait, he'd lived with them only briefly, during his father's first senatorial campaign, and wanted to clear it up, afraid of overstating something that was, for my purposes, irrelevant. "In the heat of the campaign, I lived with that family," he amended. "With Uncle Toadie, who's a well driller."
So, at age four, "I went out and drilled wells. Well, I didn't drill wells. I went out and played around while they drilled wells. And they had a baboon. Not a baboon, but some kind of big monkey in the backyard." And so forth.
Despite his determination, some of the things he told me were not so. Yet, mostly, he improved on the facts in ways that did not really improve them -- with stories that did not seem designed to better his political chances. He does aim to please, though. And when he tells a lot of these stories, like the one about his days as a kid reporter excited about his page one article on Trebla Erog, he seems, above all, to be looking to be liked.
Many times in our interviews, Mr. Gore cast his life much as his parents would have, and was protective of them, surely lying more to himself than to me when he said that no, he was never lonely as a kid -- though virtually all his boyhood friends remember he was, terribly.
"There was never a moment I felt the slightest push or urging" to follow his father into politics, he said. "There wasn't any expressed desire or manipulation or plan."
He was occasionally self-aggrandizing, as when he recalled that when he was a low-ranking enlisted man at Fort Rucker, Ala., Gen. William Westmoreland interrupted a formal departure ceremony to chat with him for an incredible 45 minutes. An Army buddy who was there recalled they talked for just a few minutes -- five, maybe.
He seems to view his story in heroic terms, a bit like a movie, with music swelling at appropriate moments. After he went to Congress, he said, "I guess it sounds corny, but if there had been a soundtrack, 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' would have been hummed in the background."
Yet a number of the stories that clanked were self-deprecating. He suggested that he got out of journalism because he wasn't good at it: "If I had been a better reporter, I might have sunk my teeth in." In fact, he was by all accounts incredibly dogged, and has an impressive clip file to show for his few years in the business.
He tells some funny, but highly suspect stories about being a dork campaigner -- like the one about not knowing a thing to say after one of his opponents beat him to the microphone and stole his one joke at a joint appearance during his first race.
And he goes a little over the top in describing 1988, when he ran for president and lost, a defeat he seems to have found humiliating in the extreme, and come down excessively hard on himself for, given that he ran at only 39. (He says 38.)
He did tell a couple of self-protective stories, though for no compelling reason: He said his assignment as an Army journalist came as a complete surprise; friends said he'd spent months figuring the surest shot at such a job. He said his ally Mayor Ed Koch's feud with Jesse Jackson during the New York primary in 1988 caught him off guard; if he didn't know about it, he hadn't been reading the papers. And he followed in the great presidential tradition of exaggerating his churchgoing.
Some of the stories about his stories are also wrong. He did work hard on his family's farm. He did not claim to have discovered Love Canal. On Imus last week, the Republican consultant Mary Matalin even accused Mr. Gore, inaccurately, of lying about having been at his sister Nancy's deathbed.
Still, it is no lie that Mr. Gore has a problem, and a problem of his own making. The public seems to accept -- if not to expect -- politicians to sandpaper the facts a bit when presenting their record.
Not much was made of George W. Bush's misstatement in the most recent debate that all three men tried for the murder of James Byrd, the black man killed in Jasper, Tex., were sentenced to death -- though it seems unlikely that the fact that one got a lesser sentence could have escaped his notice.
Nobody was puzzled by why Bill Clinton would lie about Monica S. Lewinsky. And even President Ronald Reagan's apocryphal stories about welfare queens driving Cadillacs and Soviets eating sawdust made sense in terms of expressing his worldview.
In Mr. Gore, on the other hand, we see someone stretching the truth for weird, inscrutable reasons, in ways we don't understand; Is it just to keep his skills up?
At least until recently, the vice president himself did not seem to believe he had a problem, other than one of press relations. When I asked him what he made of the assessment that he exaggerates, he thought for a moment and said, "Part of it is the modern -- the hair trigger on the hypocrisy pop gun these days and the politics of biography interacting with that hair-trigger."
BUT the explanation that best captures the many stories I've heard Mr. Gore tell came from Mike Kopp, who worked for him for years and says that usually, he embellishes in an effort to connect.
"When he would talk to the media, he'd embellish his media career to connect with the reporter," Mr. Kopp said. "If you said you'd worked 10 years with The Wall Street Journal, he'd say, 'Oh, I worked nearly 10 years at The Tennessean.' It was 'Hey, I'm one of you.' I don't ever think it was done intentionally to mislead. It was, 'I want to connect with you.' "
Of course, a more natural politician might not have to work so much, try so hard or stretch so far, to make those connections. Which is why Mr. Gore's exaggerations might not be so hard to understand after all.

HEADLINE: Jersey City Still Competes for Development

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Oct. 8 article on economic development in Jersey City ("Is Jersey City Too Alluring?") shed more heat than light on the process by which the city decides whether to provide tax incentives to encourage redevelopment. 
 For example, while the article mentions that the city has toughened its negotiation stance with real estate developers in order to take advantage of favorable conditions in the current real estate market, it failed to explain how that was done. In the early 1990's, office buildings in Jersey City paid an average of $2 per square foot under a tax abatement. The office buildings under construction today pay $3 per square foot under an abatement.
Further, in addition to shortening the term of abatements in Jersey City from 30 years to 20 years, the Schundler administration has also accelerated the rate by which an abated project reaches conventional taxation.
Finally, the Schundler administration was the first in Jersey City's history to require all development applications to be the subject of a rigorous cost-benefit analysis to ensure that any new commercial development would be paying more in taxes than it would likely demand in services. This helps ensure that new development is not subsidized by existing homeowners.
The article also suggests that Jersey City no longer has to compete with Manhattan for corporate tenants because the Big Apple doesn't have any development sites left. This is news to Jersey City. Our understanding is that Reuters, Morgan Stanley, Conde Nast, PricewaterhouseCoopers and The New York Times are currently in the process of developing over five million square feet of new office space in Manhattan.
It is also worth noting that Jersey City must compete with the entire region for corporate tenants, including Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Westchester in New York, and Newark, Florham Park and Parsippany in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

 BODY:

A Sign of Progress In a Georgia Contest
Here's a tale of racial and political progress in the Old South.
Georgia's Second Congressional District, in the state's southwest corner, is 60 percent white. But its representative in the House, Sanford D. Bishop Jr., is black. 
 In 1992, when Mr. Bishop, a moderate Democrat, was first elected, the district was 60 percent black, its boundaries having been drawn earlier to make it that way to satisfy new voting rights requirements. It was still predominantly black when Mr. Bishop was re-elected in 1994.
But in 1995 the courts held that the earlier redistricting had gone too far in favor of blacks. The boundaries were shifted again, this time leaving the district 60 percent white.
Not to worry. Mr. Bishop won re-election easily in 1996, getting almost 55 percent of the vote. A lot of white voters said they liked his moderate politics. And in 1998, he won still again, going unopposed in the primary and capturing the general election with almost 60 percent of the vote.
This year?
Again, Mr. Bishop faced no primary opponent. But he is up against an aggressive Republican in the fall, Dylan Glenn, an economic development specialist and former aide to the Bush White House.
Mr. Glenn is black. Two years ago, he tried to win the Republican nomination and the right to take on Mr. Bishop but was beaten by a white businessman, Joe McCormick, who then was beaten by Mr. Bishop. This year Mr. McCormick is one of Mr. Glenn's campaign chairmen.
Mr. Glenn says that while the Second District was Old South in the old days, "the race card has been taken off the table."
Mr. Bishop agrees. He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the other day that race had become the "so what" issue in the district.
 
Issue of Misconduct For a Judge-Elect
In Louisiana, the politics, like the food, comes well spiced. Think Huey Long and jambalaya or Edwin W. Edwards and file gumbo.
And consider . . .
Since 1988, Yvonne L. Hughes, a New Orleans lawyer, has run 15 times for state, local and party offices. Twice she won a seat on the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive Committee and twice she won a seat on the Democratic State Committee. But the job she wanted most, Juvenile Court judge, kept eluding her.
She was fond of saying that judges could get answers that other mortals could not. She talked of the power of a judge to keep the city's troubled youngsters on the "scared straight" and narrow, of helping them by deploying a corps of volunteer youth workers and by imposing boot-camp-style discipline.
Finally, two weeks ago, she managed to oust one of the parish's five juvenile judges, Salvadore Mule, beating him by a solid 15 points.
It seemed not to matter very much to a majority of voters that Ms. Hughes, while she was running, was under a well-publicized order to pay the Louisiana Ethics Board almost $50,000 in fines and fees for filing campaign reports late in six earlier elections. Nor did it seem to matter much that the board said that even after it levied the fines, she continued to resist producing the reports.
On Thursday, however, her troubles grew more serious -- perhaps serious enough to give some of her supporters second thoughts.
Or maybe not. Laissez-faire.
The Louisiana Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which handles accusations of lawyer misconduct, charged that in recent years she had taken $4,000 in fees from five criminal defendants without doing any work for them. When one defendant demanded a refund, the Disciplinary Counsel complaint said, she sent him partial refund checks twice -- and twice the checks bounced.
Ms. Hughes denied the accusations, saying none of them were of "any moment or consequence."
If convicted, she could face sanctions ranging from a reprimand to disbarment. Should it be the latter, presumably her career as a judge would be over, whatever slack supporters might be willing to cut her.
 
Polls Put Gore in Lead In Electoral College
The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a running tab of presidential preference polls in various states. At any moment, those polls provide a rough (very rough) indication of where the electoral vote contest stands -- at that moment. Here's where things stood at midday Friday, when The Hotline posted its latest compilation:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas led in 26 states, worth 227 electoral votes. Vice President Al Gore led in 23 states, worth 281 electoral votes.
Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.
 
The Reality Behind Some Poll Numbers
There are polls and there are polls. And the argument seems never to end over whether they are to be trusted, whether there is too much reliance on them and whether they skew the political process.
That said, here are some poll numbers put together by the Pew Research Center, which keeps a close eye on things political:
In 1996, 96 percent of voters said they planned to vote on Election Day. In fact, only 48.8 percent voted.
This year, 97 percent of voters say they plan to vote.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE INSURANCE ISSUE;
Gore and Bush Health Proposals Fall Short of Counterparts' Plans 8 Years Ago

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore has accused Gov. George W. Bush of ignoring the plight of the uninsured in Texas, which ranks near the bottom in health coverage.
Mr. Bush has attacked Mr. Gore as just another liberal who wants a "government-run health care system." 
 The issue of the uninsured has flared anew in the presidential campaign, with a fierce exchange in the last debate and a new round of charges and countercharges about the Bush record in Texas. But many health policy experts say that at least so far, the 42.6 million Americans without health insurance have drawn far less attention in this campaign than the experts would have hoped, given the budget surplus and the booming economy.
Both candidates have offered proposals to expand coverage, but neither plan is on the scale proposed by their counterparts in 1992, Bill Clinton and President Bush. Governor Bush's proposal to use tax credits to help people buy private insurance "is simply dwarfed by his father's plan," said Uwe Reinhardt, an expert on health policy at Princeton.
Mr. Gore would expand the existing Children's Health Insurance Program to ensure that all children have access to affordable coverage by 2005, a popular goal that gets high marks from health advocacy groups. But it also falls well short of the goal of health care for all, or universal coverage, that his party insisted on in 1992.
The contrast is particularly striking, some health experts said, because the more ambitious proposals of 1992 and early 1993 came at a time when the annual budget deficits were at their peak, running at nearly $300 billion.
For all of that, the step-by-step approach to expanding health coverage has many defenders, who note that it has the great advantage of being politically realistic. "I personally do not believe we're going to get universal coverage in one piece of legislation," said Ron Pollack, head of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that is among the strongest advocates of universal coverage.
"As a nation, we don't do very well at redistributing income," Mr. Pollack said, "and if you're going to try to do universal coverage, you're going to gore the ox of one of the big interests -- and they're going to spend a fortune in opposition."
Indeed, the political collapse of President Clinton's attempt at universal health insurance in 1993-94 still has an impact, pushing politicians to seek smaller, incremental solutions. Republicans, who conducted a fiercely ideological campaign against the Clinton plan are resurrecting it this year in campaigning against much more modest initiatives.
Mr. Bush, for example, recently asserted that Mr. Gore "likes Hillary-Care," adding, "He wants to nationalize the health care system of America." (Not exactly. Contrary to Republican dogma, the exceedingly complicated Clinton plan would not have nationalized the health care system; it would have required employers to provide insurance and created regulatory structures to oversee benefits and premiums.)
Senator Bill Bradley's failed effort to build his Democratic presidential campaign around the cause of universal coverage also probably had a chilling effect, several analysts said. Throughout the fall and winter last year, Mr. Gore picked apart the Bradley plan as unwieldy and unworkable.
"The high point of talking about the uninsured was the Gore-Bradley debate," said Stuart Butler, a health expert at the Heritage Foundation, a research group. But it was not, in the end, a pretty moment.
Finally, the uninsured have been eclipsed this year by a more popular health care issue with a more powerful constituency -- the lack of prescription drug coverage for the elderly. "The elderly are a powerful vote," said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health care at Harvard. "And not only do seniors vote more, but their ability to organize, to hold forums, has garnered their cause a great deal more attention than the uninsured."
Several analysts also noted that as complicated as the prescription drug issue can be, it seems easier -- and cheaper -- to solve than covering the uninsured.
Given this political context, some health experts see hopeful signs that this campaign has at least revived the debate -- and maybe even helped prepare the way for action next year. "The fact is they both take this issue seriously, they both have a plan," said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America.
Dr. Gail Wilensky, a health adviser to Governor Bush and a top health official in his father's administration, said: "Right before an election is a hard time to know where you are. But potentially, come February or March, we may be able to make a move. And what we've clearly learned in the last eight years is that prosperity alone is not going to make this problem go away."
In fact, the number of uninsured rose throughout the long economic expansion; only last year, for the first time in 12 years, did their ranks begin to show a significant decline, according to recent Census Bureau data. Still, the numbers remain so large that many health advocates fear what would happen in an economic downturn.
The two candidates' proposals reflect their different philosophical approaches. Mr. Bush would use refundable tax credits -- up to $2,000 for families and $1,000 for individuals -- to help low- and moderate-income families buy health insurance on the private market. The full tax credit would be available to families with incomes up to $30,000 and would gradually phase out at higher incomes, with a cutoff at $60,000. Mr. Bush would also provide $8 billion in additional money over 10 years to community health centers.
The main criticism of Mr. Bush's plan is that the tax credits are too small. "He's offering $1,000 for an individual policy that on average costs $2,000, and $2,000 for a family policy that on average costs $6,000," said Dr. Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, and a former top health adviser in the Clinton Administration. For a family making $30,000 or less, Dr. Feder argued, that's the equivalent of "giving a 10-foot rope to people in a 30-foot hole."
Mr. Gore would expand eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover all children in families with incomes up to about $42,000; children in families with higher incomes, whose parents did not have coverage through their employers, would be allowed to buy into the program, with the help of a new federal tax credit. That credit, 25 percent of the health insurance premium, would be aimed at middle-income people who had to buy insurance on their own. Moreover, the children's program would be expanded to cover uninsured low-income parents.
Mr. Gore is proposing to spend more money on expanding coverage -- his campaign puts the price tag at $146 billion over 10 years, to Mr. Bush's $75.1 billion in the same time period -- and his focus on children and their parents has earned praise from advocacy groups.
"If I had to pick two increments, I'd pick getting the job done for kids and providing meaningful coverage for low-income parents," Mr. Pollack said.
But several health care experts said that a more notable step would be to combine the Bush and Gore proposals. "I think there's a possibility of a real compromise after the election," Mr. Butler said, with conservatives willing to accept some expansion of the children's program and liberals willing to accept a greater use of tax credits for more moderate income people.
Dr. Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, asserted, "Ultimately, what would make most sense is if the two parties agreed to stop fighting over ideological differences and combined the two approaches."
Dr. Altman noted that for years, health analysts had assumed that the primary hurdle to doing something about the uninsured was the lack of money. Given the current surplus, he added, the basic question becomes, "If we're not able to deal with this issue now, when will we ever be able to deal with it?"

HEADLINE: Embargo Seen as Aid To Castro; Canada, Too

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: CHURCHILL, Manitoba, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The long-running United States economic embargo of Cuba has played neatly into the hands of both the Havana government and Canada, which has become the largest foreign investor in Cuba, Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said in an interview here today.
"It's the one thing that keeps them in power, keeping up their police state," Mr. Axworthy said, explaining that American economic sanctions give a nationalistic aura to Fidel Castro's 41-year-old rule in Cuba. "If the U.S. announced tomorrow that the embargo was going off, Castro would have to find something else to replace it. Otherwise, the whole place would go like wildfire." 
 Sherritt International Corporation, a Toronto company, has nearly $1 billion invested in Cuban oil production, nickel mining, power generation, cell phones, tourism and agriculture. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians travel to Cuba each winter for discount beach vacations.
By contrast, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved an agricultural financing bill today that would slightly ease the embargo on Cuba, allowing food and medicine sales.
"If the U.S. Congress were to allow American companies to make certain investments, it would make our prime minister very unhappy," Mr. Axworthy said. "The more Congress keeps U.S. companies out, the more it allows Sherritt to control the island."
Relations between Canada and Cuba cooled in the late 1990's because of Mr. Castro's continued crackdowns on dissident journalists and human rights activists. But this month, in a clear effort to repair ties, Mr. Castro attended the funeral of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in Montreal.
This week the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast extracts from a two-hour interview it had with Mr. Castro.
In the interview, Mr. Castro said no prisoner had been tortured since he took power in 1959 and indirectly confirmed that his jails hold about 300 political prisoners, telling the Canadian interviewer, "Listen, if we jailed all of those who receive a salary from the United States to fight against the revolution, there would be a lot more than those 300."
Mr. Castro, who has nearly outlasted nine American presidents, has shown no indication that he will get along with the 10th. In August, he remarked that George W. Bush and Al Gore were "the most boring and insipid" candidates in American history. On Canadian television, he said: "I'm against both of them, I'd like another candidate. But there are only these two and my position is this: I don't like either of them."
Recognizing that the seizure of American properties by Cuba's revolutionary government four decades ago is a sore point for some Americans, Mr. Axworthy predicted that Americans would have as much luck getting compensation from Cuba as British refugees did from the United States after the American Revolution.
Turning to other issues in the Americas, Mr. Axworthy, who plans to retire by the end of this year to head an international affairs institute in British Columbia, said that the "power of the street" dictated recent decisions to abandon power by Presidents Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru and by Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Last June, Mr. Axworthy led a mission by the Organization of the American States to Lima to ask Mr. Fujimori to make democratic changes in Peru after his tainted re-election in May.
"Those guys were scared when I was there," Mr. Axworthy said, recalling that 4,000 policemen guarded the streets during his visit with Cesar Gaviria, the Organization of American States' secretary general. Reflecting on Mr. Fujimori's decision in September to cut short his term and hold new elections, Mr. Axworthy said that even back in June, "the ruling class, the smoothies, knew it was over."
Turning to relations with the United States, with whom Canada conducts 86 percent of its foreign trade, Mr. Axworthy said he saw no need for the two nations to adopt a European-style customs union, a proposal that could mean adopting common immigration policies, common external tariffs and free movement of goods and people inside the two-nation zone.
"We don't need a footprint like the European Union, we don't need a superstructure," he said. Instead, he advocated the gradual "harmonization" of relations and extension of free-trade pacts into Central and South America.

HEADLINE: As Retail Space Grows and Spending Wanes, Some Stores Feel Pinch

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Warner Brothers seemed to have a hit on its hands in 1993, when an astounding 20,000 people a day began streaming through its newly opened studio store at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, plucking Bugs Bunny T-shirts, Batman dolls and action figures from the shelves.
Business was so brisk that Warner Brothers took over 6 floors, for a total of 11, at the Fifth Avenue store three years later, as retailers, restaurants and movie theaters scrambled to open amid a seemingly ever-expanding shopping boom in New York City. 
 But Thursday afternoon, Warner Brothers executives told employees that the giant Fifth Avenue flagship would shut its doors for good in January. The store is not only a casualty of declining sales at Warner studio stores in New York and nationwide, economists and retail analysts say, but also a yellow light warning of a softening in what is acknowledged as the strongest retail environment in decades.
Consumer spending is still solid, said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist for Economy.com, a consulting firm whose clients include the federal government and major banks, but it is not growing as rapidly this year as it did in the late 1990's.
Despite this slowdown, work has begun on four of five projects that call for a total of one million square feet of new retail space in Manhattan within the next three years. The four are the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle; a mixed-use tower on the site of the old Alexander's flagship department store on the Upper East Side; and two on 125th Street, Harlem USA and Harlem Center. The fifth, still in the planning stages, calls for 200,000 square feet of retail space in the blocklong Farley Post Office Building just west of Pennsylvania Station.
"The tremendous boomlike growth in retail space was not a problem when you had boomlike growth in consumer spending," Mr. Zandi said. "But there's been a definitive slowdown in consumer spending. And by next year we may see more problems for retailers and higher vacancy rates."
These trends will become more apparent, Mr. Zandi added, when economic indicators like year-over-year retail construction, retail sales and consumer spending figures are released early in 2001.
But signs of trouble are already visible in New York. Stern's has announced it will close its eight-story department store in Herald Square next spring, and the Official All Star Cafe just shut its doors in Times Square. Sales are down for the once seemingly invincible Gap Inc., which has five dozen Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores in Manhattan alone, and the chain does not plan to renew leases for at least four small stores on the East Side, said Robert K. Futterman, a major retail broker who worked with Gap.
Home Depot, which has plans to open a superstore in East Harlem, saw its stock plunge last week after analysts expressed fears that shoppers might be cutting back on home improvement projects.
The big HMV record store at Broadway and 72nd Street closed recently, admitting defeat in a battle with Tower Records several blocks away at Lincoln Square, much the same way Tower closed its store on East 86th Street a couple of years ago, ceding the territory to HMV. Taking over the HMV space on the Upper West Side is Urban Outfitters.
Despite the thousands of visitors and office workers who throng a revitalized Times Square every day, real estate brokers say that many owners of the new stores along 42nd Street complain that sales are not as strong as they had hoped. The brokers also say that the major theater chains that opened large multiplexes in many large apartment areas in Manhattan are now trying to pull out of similar projects in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
"It's not only New York," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a trade journal. "America is overstored. Competition is rampant. Too many stores look alike."
Many brokers dispute that a slowdown exists, however. Shoppers are still clogging the streets, they say, and retailers are still jostling for space. They contend that the store closings are nothing more than the results of the usual battles that separate winners from losers in retailing.
"A lot of the boom businesses of the 90's, like the Gap, have lost their luster," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a retail broker at Insignia/ESG who put together many deals in Times Square in the last few years. "And they are starting to be replaced by better or new concepts like Hennes & Mauritz, which features hip European fashions at low prices."
It is hard to find vacant retail space in Manhattan and rents are at an all-time high, brokers say. Ground-floor space can cost as much as $300 a square foot in Times Square and up to $500 on the premier shopping blocks like those along Fifth and Madison Avenues north of 55th Street.
Alan Victor, the executive vice president of Lansco Corporation, a broker that has represented J. Crew, Warner Brothers and other national retailers, said the Gap still planned to open new stores, despite a decline in sales at existing stores. High-end chains including Hugo Boss, Escada, Burberry and Hermes have also leased large new spaces or expanded existing stores on Fifth and Madison Avenues.
While brokers acknowledge that these high-rent stores cannot generate a profitable sales volume, they make sense from a marketing standpoint because they provide the prestige of an address in some of the most recognizable shopping areas in the world.
"Retailing is better than ever," Mr. Futterman said. "I've never seen more tenants ready to expand and pay top dollar."
That attitude is part of the problem, said Emme P. Kozloff, a retail analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a money management company. Many retailers are still acting as if consumer spending is growing at a rapid rate. The Gap chain, for instance, cannibalized its own market in New York and other places, Ms. Kozloff said, by opening stores within blocks of one another while facing stiff competition from discount stores also selling khakis, blue jeans and T-shirts.
Often the same retail chain is opening stores at several of the city's currently desirable shopping areas: the newly renovated 510,000 square feet of retail space at Rockefeller Center, the recently refurbished 300,000 square feet at the World Trade Center, and the newly expanded 170,000 square feet at Grand Central Terminal, as well as in SoHo and along Columbus Avenue. Again and again, Banana Republic, Sephora, J. Crew, Warner and Disney Stores have shown up at two or more of these hot spots.
"Whether it's New York City or the United States, overexpansion is one of the biggest fears among investors in the retail sector," Ms. Kozloff said. "The retail pie only grows but so fast. Somebody's going to get burned."
Ms. Kozloff and Mr. Zandi said they expected consumer spending to continue to slacken because of rising interest rates, higher home heating prices, an uncertain stock market and an increase in online shopping.
Some of the city's many new retail projects will undoubtedly succeed, analysts and economists say, but economists say there are not enough shoppers to justify all the retail space coming on the market, just as there were not enough moviegoers to justify the number of screens put up in the late 1990's.
A few years ago, the major theater chains put up huge megaplexes with stadium seating in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and elsewhere. Loews and AMC opened a total of 38 screens at two theaters on opposite sides of 42nd Street, near Eighth Avenue. Neither has lived up to expectations. Regal built a multiplex in Battery Park City that the company admits is doing poorly.
First, filmgoers abandoned existing theaters, and then attendance fell off altogether when the movie studios failed to produce any blockbusters. Now the theater chains are suffering financially.
Disney and Warner Brothers, as well as Viacom and Coca-Cola, began opening stores in the early 1990's to generate new revenue and increase awareness of their brand names. Warner Brothers opened the first of three stores in New York in 1993. Its chief rival, Disney, opened the first of six New York stores in newly resurgent Times Square in 1996. A month later, Warner signed a deal for a new store across Seventh Avenue, and doubled the size of the Fifth Avenue store.
But it was not long before those companies and others exhausted much of the public's appetite for theme merchandise. Two years ago, Viacom closed 15 Nickelodeon stores nationally. More recently, Coca-Cola closed its store on Fifth Avenue. Disney has announced that it expects to shed 140 of its 740 studio stores, and several brokers say the company is trying to sell the lease on its store on 34th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.
In recent years, both Warner and Disney suffered from competition with discount stores that sold studio-licensed T-shirts emblazoned with the same cartoon characters for far less money than the studio stores. Brokers and executives familiar with Warner Brothers' sales figures also said that the Times Square studio store undercut its sister store on Fifth Avenue. "They're dying over there," said one executive, referring to the Fifth Avenue location.
Warner Brothers executives declined to discuss sales. They would say only that the company would continue to operate its stores in Times Square and the World Trade Center, and that it expected to be part of a large store showcasing Time Warner's entire line of products when the company's headquarters opens at Columbus Circle in three years.
Ms. Kozloff, for one, was doubtful. "Character merchandise has saturated the market," she said. "How many Mickey Mouse or Tazmanian Devil T-shirts can you sell? Not as many as they'd hoped."

HEADLINE: Ex-Premier Of Singapore Sees Pitfalls In Debt Relief

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Lee Kuan Yew, who turned a pestilential port called Singapore into a country with living standards to rival those of Europe, is warning leaders of developing nations against viewing debt relief as a panacea for faltering economies and also urging them to avoid the trap of development theories that are more ideological than practical.
Mr. Lee, who now bears the title of senior minister for his country and next week opens a series of lectures by world leaders at Harvard, said that writing off or reducing the debt of developing nations -- a policy now supported by rich nations like the United States, Japan and many in Europe -- may only make nations look perennially uncreditworthy and unattractive to investors. 
Mr. Lee, who was Singapore's prime minister from independence in 1965 until his retirement in 1990, has been criticized, particularly in the United States, for his tight control of politics and the social engineering he employed, complete with myriad rules about public behavior, as he developed his small city-state.
Economically, however, development experts acknowledge that his tropical island without resources has become a high-technology and banking center with one of the world's best airlines, high health and education standards, and decent housing for all. Singapore, with a highly educated work force, is also considered one of the least corrupt countries in the world, in part because of the strength of its civil service.
Too many third-world leaders, Mr. Lee said, had bought into fashionable theories of development that were more political than pragmatic. It happened, he said, in the first round of the post-colonial age, and it seems to be happening again.
"Third-world leaders become prisoners of contemporary ideas of the time," he said in the interview Wednesday, sitting beside his wife, Kwa Geok Choo, whom he met and married while they were students at Cambridge University in England in the 1950's. They are both lawyers.
"The first generation were greatly influenced by Nehru, Nasser, Tito, Sukarno -- and at that time they believed that the way to industrialize, the way to catch up with the West was to concentrate on heavy industry, state enterprises -- shortcut the whole process," Mr. Lee said. "This was the result of the myth that the Soviet Union did it that way."
"It also fitted in with their natural desire to be in charge," he said. "If you leave it to the market, you're not in charge. If you're in charge, it means that you get the benefits of a percentage and your friends are favored and so on. And so they just drifted into this course of action, which has been most unproductive. "
Mr. Lee's message is reflected in a new book, "From Third World to First: The Singapore Story, 1965-2000," (HarperCollins). The statesman, now 76, recounts how he saw trouble coming among new nations in the 1950's and 1960's as patterns of dependency on richer nations and corruption and ostentation took hold in post-colonial administrations.
Mr. Lee said he read and heard out all the arguments made by writers like the Argentine economist Raul Prebisch, who recommended state planning and import substitution to shield countries against market forces, as well as other development economists at the London School of Economics. "I said, this is rubbish!" said Mr. Lee, a free marketeer who preached competition and cooperation with economic giants. "But they believed it because it was also emotionally satisfying."
"Now, they are in a different stage," he said. "Their economies are really malfunctioning, they've missed opportunities of growth, their infrastructure is inadequate, education has not been as thorough as it could have been, literacy -- poor, technical skills -- poor."
This puts many nations at a disadvantage in the face of a digital revolution and a global economy, he added. The fear of being exploited by the economically powerful is thus real, he said. "But if you are left out, the world will just pass you by, and the catch-up would be even more difficult."

HEADLINE: World's Health Officials Seek Global Treaty to Curb Smoking

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Tackling one of the top health scourges in the world, officials from 191 governments are gathering next week to begin negotiating a new global treaty aimed at controlling the use of tobacco and curbing smoking, especially among adolescents.
Over the past few days, major tobacco companies and anti-smoking groups drew the lines for yet another battle over smoking. The World Health Organization, which is spearheading the push for a tough international agreement to curb smoking by 2003, made its views plain. It wrapped conference papers in a cover that took direct aim at the best-selling Marlboro cigarette brand. Silhouetted against an orange sky, one cowboy tells the other, "Bob, I've got cancer." 
 The agency also became the first United Nations body every to hold two days of public hearings on tobacco which were dominated by anti-smoking groups. Philip Morris, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, and British American Tobacco (BAT) were unusually contrite, acknowledging that their products are deadly and addictive.
They made clear, however, that they will resist stringent global rules, insisting that they are free to sell and advertise their wares. "Today, with near-universal awareness of the health risks, a billion adults choose to smoke," said Christopher Proctor, BAT's science director, who argued that regulatory schemes can only work at the national level.
The negotiations here will be fierce, tussling over whether to ban tobacco multinationals from advertising and sponsoring sports events; whether to increase taxes to make cigarettes more expensive, and whether to discourage tobacco growing and adopt measures to deter young people from smoking.
The World Health Organization maintains that tobacco use already kills four million people annually and will worsen over the next two decades. Unchecked, tobacco's death toll will rise to 10 million yearly by 2030, according to the agency, which would take huge chunks out of budgets of both rich and poor countries.
American medical groups have argued in recent days that the consequences of inaction are dire, and urged the Clinton administration to apply its tough domestic smoking stand to the international arena. "If smoking is not curbed, China alone will have one million lung cancer deaths in 2025," said Dr. Randolph D. Smoak, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, who recently returned from China, where about 70 percent of men smoke.
The strategy of big tobacco firms appears to be lobbying national governments, which may prove vulnerable to the companies' influence, and counting on the fact that any global agreement is only as good as the number of countries that sign on, ratify and implement provisions -- which, at best, is years away.
A proposal to raise taxes on cigarettes in order to cut consumption, especially among the poor, the young and the less educated -- a method favored by the World Health Organization and the World Bank -- is likely to run into stiff resistance.
A report by the two organizations last August maintained that tax increases do not lead to job losses and increase smuggling, two arguments advanced against the measure. Based on the study, its authors will argue that a 10 percent rise in cigarette prices would lead to as many as 42 million people quitting smoking, and prevent about 10 million tobacco-related deaths. Such tax increases could also combat wholesale smuggling, which now amounts to around 355 million bootleg cigarettes yearly.

HEADLINE: FOLLOWING UP

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:

It's a Bird, It's a Plane, But Now a Smaller Risk
It's still big birds versus little birds at Kennedy International Airport.
The big birds, of course, are the metallic monsters weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds that carry wingless members of the ecosystem on their migrations around the globe. The little birds are the flesh-and-feather fliers weighing as little as a pound that nest next to the airport, in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens. 
 It would seem to be no contest should a jetliner or even a smaller plane collide with a gull or a goose. While the bird is surely a goner, however, the plane can also suffer, even fatally. Birds sucked into an engine can cause it to stall and the plane to crash, as has sometimes happened around the world.
At Kennedy, where the bird threat is among the country's worst, close calls are remembered. In 1975, an engine choked with gulls caused a departing DC-10 to catch fire, but there were only minor injuries among the nearly 150 people on board. In 1995, an arriving Concorde caught fire after its engines sucked in geese, but none of the 79 people aboard were hurt.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Kennedy's operator, has long been in a shoo-and-shoot war against the birds. Early tactics, such as firing propane-gas cannons to frighten them with loud noise, did not help much. In 1991, the authority began using marksmen to shoot down gulls, among the leaders on the bad-bird list because of their prevalence.
Advocates for animals were enraged, but an average of 10,000 gulls a year were shot through 1996, when the authority added a method to reduce the shootings: falconry. Bird wings are swung in the air on long cords, inciting the falcons to swoop after the lures.
"The theory is birds can see them in a hunting mode and are frightened away," said Laura Francoeur, a wildlife biologist with the authority.
Peter Yerkes, an authority spokesman, said that all the efforts had helped cut contacts between birds and planes from 315 in 1989 to 133 last year, and that falconry had helped reduce the number of birds shot from nearly 15,000 in 1991 to 3,400 last year.

Manhattan Auto Racing Can Be Stop and Go
Some New Yorkers found the idea outlandish and disliked the sponsor. Others saw a boon to the city's economy. In 1992, the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins gave the go-ahead for a Marlboro Grand Prix of New York, in which Lower Manhattan's streets would become a temporary auto racing track.
Professional drivers would zoom up to 165 miles an hour within concrete barriers, as they had on streets in some other major cities and still do in Houston and Long Beach, Calif. New York officials envisioned $56 million being spent at hotels, restaurants and stores by visitors to the spectacle.
Then it disappeared like exhaust. The promoters canceled, citing higher costs than expected.
The idea, however, is not out of gas. The City Sports Commission has received another such proposal from another promoter, Ralph E. Preite, a Manhattan lawyer and the president of New York Motorsports.
"It's very preliminary," Mr. Preite said on Friday, adding that he would seek financing if chances of city approval seemed good. "We prefer Manhattan, but it could be any borough."
The sports agency's commissioner, Kenneth J. Podziba, said it was too early to discuss the proposal because "it hasn't left the infancy stage." JOSEPH P. FRIED

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Aides Say Bush Camp Is Exploiting Mideast Crisis

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The presidential campaign turned again toward the Middle East today, as Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush talked of hope and prayers for peace and their aides battled over charges that the Bush camp was exploiting the turmoil for political gain.
On a day that the vice president attacked Mr. Bush on policy issues, Mr. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, accused Republicans of "injecting campaign rhetoric and presidential politics" into the crisis. 
 On Friday, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, used events in the Middle East to bolster calls for decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil and for strengthening the military. "Given the situation, people ought to be careful, be responsible," Mr. Lehane said.
Mr. Bush's senior adviser, Ari Fleischer, dismissed today's accusation as a smoke screen.
"Mr. Lehane's comments are a mark of Al Gore's weak leadership at a time when his campaign is struggling," Mr. Fleischer said. "The crisis in the Middle East should not prevent our nation from discussing the implications of this administration's failure to have an energy policy. Governor Bush will continue to credit the administration in its efforts to stop the violence in the Middle East, but he will not hesitate to critique the administration's failed energy policies."
The candidates themselves were more circumspect. Mr. Bush, who was in Texas preparing for Tuesday's debate, issued a statement after President Clinton announced a summit on Monday in Egypt: "I welcome this development. I hope that Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak will do everything possible to stop the violence so that our longstanding goal of peace in the Middle East can be achieved."
Mr. Gore said his prayers were with the families of the sailors killed and injured in the attack on the Navy destroyer in Yemen.
"We're praying as well for the success of the summit meeting that's going to be held on Monday," he said.
Mr. Gore continued: "As we grieve for those who were affected by the violence there, we think not only of the Americans, we think also of the Palestinians and the Israelis and the suffering that the families on both sides have felt."
Mr. Lehane said the summit would not alter Mr. Gore's schedule, which called for him to leave Washington on Sunday evening for St. Louis, where he will prepare for the debate.
At a rally in this fiercely contested state today, Mr. Gore delivered a spirited, turn-the-tables speech to a partisan crowd by accusing Mr. Bush of using "fuzzy math" to justify his policies on tax cuts, Social Security and health care.
Mr. Bush introduced that term into the campaign when he used it repeatedly to criticize Mr. Gore in their first debate. Today, Mr. Gore appropriated the phrase, even as he argued that the differences between him and Mr. Bush were more about priorities than numbers.
Mr. Gore's tone was notably vigorous and aggressive, a discernible change from his flat delivery in a speech in Iowa on Friday. He confidently, almost mockingly, assailed Mr. Bush for his campaign proposals and his record as governor.
After telling of a health maintenance organization that had declined to pay for the treatment of a heart attack because it was not considered an emergency, Mr. Gore said, "To those on the other side, maybe the absence of a heart isn't considered an emergency, but to us it is."
Mr. Gore arrived in Michigan only a day after Mr. Bush departed and as a new poll showed Mr. Bush gaining on Mr. Gore in Michigan..
The poll, taken on Wednesday and Thursday by EPIC/MRA, a Lansing firm, gave Mr. Gore a lead of 45 percent to 42 percent over Mr. Bush. That gap was within the margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
Previous polls by the same organization had Mr. Gore ahead by six percentage points in late September and by eight percentage points in mid-September.
Speaking to a crowd dominated by union members and African-Americans, Mr. Gore charged that Mr. Bush has failed to explain how he would pay for his proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security deductions in the stock market, at an estimated cost of $1 trillion. That plan would eventually bankrupt the system, Mr. Gore said.
"They promise not to cut Social Security benefits, a promise that can only be kept by also using that same $1 trillion to continue paying the benefits at the current level," he said. "Now if you take $1 trillion and promise it to two different groups and it doesn't show up in the budget, fuzzy math, fuzzy math."
He also used a study released this week by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, to assert that Mr. Bush had been wrong when he said in Wednesday's debate that "the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up."
The study found that monthly enrollments in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, have declined in Texas by 7.6 percent between June 1997 and December 1999, while enrollment in the country as a whole increased by 2.3 percent during that period.
"What I believe I heard last week was him saying the uninsured population in America went up and the uninsured population in Texas went down," Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush. "But what the figures seem to show is exactly the reverse. Now what is the phrase that describes that kind of calculation?"
"Fuzzy math!" the crowd shouted.
"I believe you're right," Mr. Gore said. "Fuzzy math."
Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore had distorted the study by failing to acknowledge that the economy in Texas had raised incomes and therefore reduced the number of people eligible for Medicaid.
"While there was a 7.6 percent drop in Texas Medicaid enrollment," Mr. Bartlett said, "there was also an 11 percent drop in the number of people eligible for Medicaid."

HEADLINE: Ambitious Antidrug Plan For Colombia Is Faltering

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Three months since the United States approved a huge aid package for Colombia, the overarching $7.5 billion plan to stabilize that nation and thwart its guerrilla movements and drug traffickers is already showing signs of disarray, officials and experts say.
European nations have balked at providing donations to help Colombia address its social problems, Latin American leaders are voicing concerns about creeping United States militarism and the government of President Andres Pastrana has been reluctant to promote the plan at home or to dedicate funds to it, American officials concede. 
 In a report to Congress this week, the General Accounting Office said "the Colombian government has not demonstrated it has the detailed plans, management structure and funding necessary" to meet the plan's goals, and international financial support from beyond the United States "has yet to materialize."
Mr. Pastrana announced the so-called Plan Colombia as an initiative of his government a year ago. But the skepticism it has met reflects a concern abroad that the plan was drafted by the United States as a way to ease its own drug crisis and not as a coherent strategy to lift Colombia from a quagmire involving two guerrilla insurgencies, right-wing death squads, a faltering economy and a crisis of confidence in government.
"They see it as something that was cooked up in Washington," said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum for leaders from the hemisphere. "If other countries saw this was moving in the direction of being more responsive to Colombian concerns, they would support it."
Mr. Pastrana set a goal of reducing the coca cultivation and distribution of Colombian narcotics by 50 percent over six years. Pledging $4 billion in Colombian funds to the effort, he asked for an additional $3.5 billion from the United States, Europe and multilateral lenders in order to advance Colombia's peace efforts, promote economic development and judicial reform and fight drug traffickers.
The Clinton administration in July approved $1.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia -- including more than a dozen Black Hawk helicopters -- to help the Colombian Army strike into southern territories under the control of drug traffickers and guerrillas.
American officials acknowledge the plan cannot succeed without international support for the "softer" programs to raise Colombians' living standards and provide alternatives to drug trafficking and war.
But European nations so far have failed to pledge funds at hoped-for levels. At a donor's conference in Madrid in July, Spain promised to contribute $100 million, and Norway pledged $20 million. The United Nations promised $131 million, and Japan and international lending institutions offered $70 million and $300 million in loans, respectively.
Europe, which is the second-largest consumer of Colombian narcotics, after the United States, is still considering its role and may announce additional funds at a followup to the Madrid conference on Oct. 24., diplomats said.
But one European envoy said the European Union has no intention of supporting Plan Colombia.
"The E.U. and member states are supporting the peace process in Colombia and not specifically the Plan Colombia, which is an American project," the envoy said.
Although the Clinton administration has portrayed Plan Colombia as Mr. Pastrana's work, much of it was drafted by American officials, according to people familiar with its preparation.
The plan emerged last year after Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House anti-narcotics coordinator -- under pressure from Congressional Republicans -- declared that Colombia was a foreign policy "emergency." He noted its steady increases in drug cultivation, the widening influence of rebels and its general potential to destabilize the region, given Colombia's position between the Panama Canal and Venezuela, the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States.
"We've been totally naive in this process, in thinking that's going to shake loose some matching funds from the donor community," said a senior administration official. "From their perspective, this is our problem."
Mr. Pastrana, who took office on a pledge to bring peace to his country, has himself proven a lackluster champion of the plan, American officials say, and has only allocated $15 million to the project.
Analysts say Mr. Pastrana is torn between hopes that the American attention and largess could provide Colombia with a rare opportunity for foreign investment, on the one hand, and concerns, on the other, that deepening ties to the Pentagon could unleash greater violence in Colombia and possibly draw in its neighbors.
Members of Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, were suspected this week of kidnapping five American oil workers and five of their colleagues in neighboring Ecuadaor. The rebel group denied responsibility for the unusual cross-border operation, but Ecuadorean authorities said the guerrillas had carried it out in retaliation for Plan Colombia.
Colombia's most influential neighbors -- Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela -- last month voiced support for peace negotiations in Colombia, but pointedly refused to back the military aspect of the plan. Mr. Pastrana is now touring the region trying to broaden their endorsement.
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has "reservations with respect to the military component of the Plan Colombia," said Toro Hardy, his ambassador in Washington. "It risks projecting Colombia's internal conflict into the neighboring countries."
Clinton administration officials counter that the risk of doing nothing is far greater.
"Colombia's historic neglect of the nation's outlying areas has allowed the problem to fester, and it has been exacerbated by an economic downturn of a magnitude Colombia has not seen for 70 years," said Rand Beers, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs.
Republican lawmakers who have vigorously pressed the administration to expand its military aid to Colombia say there are sufficient legal constraints on the American presence in that country -- including on the size and nature of training programs -- that there is little danger that American troops will get drawn into a decades-old civil war.
"Colombia does not want -- and has never asked for -- American blood to be shed on its battlefields," Representative Benjamin Gilman of New York, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said in a hearing on Colombia this week. "Let's not be fooled by that old 'it's another Vietnam' canard."
But some critics voiced concerns that the United States is allying itself with an army that has a notorious human rights record.
Amnesty International warned that increased support for Colombian security forces would result in a "humanitarian catastrophe" in the country's conflict zones.

HEADLINE: A Colder, Fuel-Burning Winter Is Expected to Chill the Northeast

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Winter in the Northeast this year is expected to be colder and snowier than in recent years, the National Weather Service says, raising the prospect of significantly higher heating bills for consumers even as oil prices have already been rising.
In major cities across the region, temperatures are expected to drop two to five degrees below the average of the last three winters, which were unusually warm, the service said. 
 That drop could contribute to heating bills that are as much as 25 percent higher than last year for consumers of heating oil, and 45 percent higher for consumers of natural gas, says the Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department.
"What they are saying is the winter will be normal, and normal means a lot more demand for heating fuel because last winter was warm," said David Costello, an economist at the energy agency.
The weather service said temperatures in New York and Washington are expected to fall three degrees below the average of the last three winters, while in Boston they are expected to drop by two degrees. Philadelphia is likely to be five degrees colder this winter.
Mr. Costello estimated that the lower temperatures would cause an increase in demand for heating fuels of about 8 percent. He said that increase could push up prices significantly. "We're starting out with already low supplies," he said, so prices will be more responsive to an increase in demand.
In the case of heating oil, the energy agency expects that the greater demand will translate into a 16 percent increase in price, to $1.37 a gallon from $1.18 last winter for residents of the Northeast, who use more of it than people in other regions of the United States.
The price of natural gas is expected to be double what it was, or about $5 per thousand cubic feet.
Natural gas is the heating fuel of choice across the country, but the Northeast relies heavily on heating oil, more so than any other region.
Besides lower temperatures, the weather service predicted more storms and greater precipitation in the Northeast.
The weather is also expected to vary throughout the season more than it has in recent years, the weather service said.
"We expect considerable swings in temperature and precipitation," said Jack Kelly, director of the service.
The last three winters have set records for warm temperatures.

HEADLINE: Market Turbulence Does Little to Curb Investors' Optimism

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
After watching its portfolio sink for four months, the SJR investment club got another dose of bad news when it met Wednesday night in Frank Piraino's Staten Island home. Lucent Technologies, the club's biggest investment, had announced a profit shortfall that morning, and its stock had plunged 32 percent.
"I don't know how low it can go," grumbled Joseph Fisher, president of the six-member club. "I say sell," Richard Ling said with a smile, to which Tom Navarria retorted: "Sell? We almost came to blows last month because you wanted to buy." 
 But despite the losses, the club members quickly decided not to sell Lucent -- or any other stock in their $67,000 portfolio. Instead, with $4,000 in cash, they looked for companies to buy. Within minutes, they settled on Pfizer and Intel, despite Mr. Fisher's advice to avoid "highflying tech stocks." Intel is "a unique company," Mr. Navarria said.
Intel may be unique, but Mr. Navarria's faith in the future of technology companies and the health of American stock markets is not. The get-rich-quick hysteria of recent years may be gone, and in the last six weeks stocks have looked fragile amid fears that economic growth is slowing and corporate profits will fall short of expectations.
But a raft of evidence, both anecdotal and statistical, suggests that exactly six months after the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered its worst week ever, Americans remain optimistic that stocks are the best place for their money.
The confidence is striking, considering that prices have not regained the ground they lost since the Nasdaq plunged in mid-April, a 25 percent drop that wiped out more than $1 trillion in paper wealth. The euphoria of 1999 and early 2000, when investors paid seemingly any price for money-losing Internet stocks, is long gone, replaced by pessimism about rising oil prices and slowing growth in corporate earnings.
Despite a strong rally Friday, the Nasdaq closed at a level below its April low. So far this year, it is off 18.5 percent. Some smaller Internet and technology companies have fared far worse, falling more than 90 percent from the highs they set earlier this year.
The broader American market is also hurting, although not as badly. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which measures the performance of large companies, closed Friday down 6.5 percent for the year and 11.5 percent from its March highs.
Yet individual investors continue to pour money into mutual funds at a pace even higher than last year's, especially those buying aggressive growth companies, according to AMG Data, which tracks mutual fund inflows. Charles Schwab, the giant brokerage house based in San Francisco, reports that its clients continue to add tens of billions of dollars in new cash to their accounts every month, a pace substantially higher than last year's. And the number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, after falling over the summer in its typical seasonal lull, rose strongly in September and this month.
To be sure, the frenzy of last year, when many small investors scrambled for initial public offerings and 18 relatively large stocks rose tenfold or more, has abated. Trading volume has fallen from its peak in March, and the amount of new money invested in mutual funds has dropped substantially from the first quarter. The amount of money raised from the public in initial offerings has leveled off, and the average amount a new stock rises after its offering is lower this year than in 1999.
In the winter and early spring, "the market reached ungodly levels of speculation," said Gregory Smith, an analyst at Chase H & Q who covers online brokerage firms. He noted that trading in over-the-counter bulletin board stocks, which are often highly risky companies that trade for pennies a share, rose fivefold between October 1999 and March 2000. Since then, volume has fallen to last year's levels.
"What I do see is the risk appetite changing," Mr. Smith said. "People aren't buying speculative stocks, they're not trading as much."
But if the Nasdaq's plunge has eased last winter's fever, it has hardly eroded the underlying confidence in stocks that two decades of rising share prices and a decade of strong economic growth have instilled in Americans.
Investors also remember that big drops in 1998, after the Asian financial crisis, and 1987 proved to be little more than great buying opportunities, said Charles Geisst, finance professor at Manhattan College and author of "Wall Street: A History."
"Everybody, including myself, views this as a short-term blip," Mr. Geisst said.
After all, despite its losses so far in 2000, the Nasdaq is up 18 percent from a year ago. Over the longer term, the index's gains are even more striking. It has more than doubled in the last two years and has risen tenfold in the last decade. The S.& P. 500 has risen 37 percent in the last two years and almost fivefold in the last decade.
As a result, although this year's losses have been painful for many investors, most have years of appreciation to cushion the blow. Terry Sneed, a theatrical director in Knoxville, Tenn., has watched his investments drop by half this year. But he said the fall does not trouble him, because in the four previous years his portfolio rocketed, thanks largely to his purchase of the Internet company Yahoo in 1996.
"My whole portfolio has a 2,000-something percent return over the past five years now," Mr. Sneed said. "This was a down year rather than an up year, but I think if you're a long-term investor, you've got to take the downs with the ups."
Despite the Nasdaq's fall, Mr. Sneed remains convinced that technology companies will grow faster than others over time. "I'm a big believer in tech," he said. "I don't have any of those old-economy stocks, Procter & Gamble, or any of those. I still hope to keep pumping money into the market."
Many investors who sat out the Nasdaq's 1999 boom have, meanwhile, also missed out on its bust and suffered relatively small losses this year. "Of course I've lost money," said Dorothy Brown, an Episcopal priest in Morgantown, W.Va. "Everybody's lost money." After gaining 8 percent in 1999 and 12 percent in 1998, she is down about 5 percent this year.
Still, Ms. Brown, 53, said she believed stocks were the best way to save for retirement and she plans to keep buying them. "I'm definitely going to stay invested," she said. In fact, Ms. Brown recently bought a fund that invests in small companies, increasing her exposure to one of the riskiest areas of the market.
Ms. Brown is not alone. AMG reported that investors bought almost $200 billion in funds through the first nine months of this year, compared with $110 billion last year. Nearly all the new money went to higher-risk funds investing in technology stocks and in growth and aggressive growth stocks, which have strong potential for big profit gains. But since the first quarter, investors have put less money in technology-only funds, which are among the riskiest of all, preferring funds that invest more broadly and are therefore perceived as safer.
Of course, not everyone who has suffered this year has the cushion of big gains, and some individual investors say their losses have soured them on stocks. "I've lost money, and I'm not too happy with it," said Bevalene Waldrip of Blairsville, Ga., a retired customer service representative for BellSouth. "I'm just kind of burned out and trying to hang on." Ms. Waldrip estimated her portfolio had fallen 60 percent this year. She does not plan to invest new money in stocks.
But back at the SJR club, Ms. Waldrip's views do not carry much weight. "We should take advantage of the drops in some of the quality names," said Frank P. Miello. "I see it as a buying opportunity."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Jeter Pays Price in Off-Season; Seattle Pays Price in Postseason

BYLINE: By Jack Curry

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
The alarm clock buzzes at 8 a.m. in January, and Derek Jeter crawls out of bed to start another day of workouts. He stumbles across the hardwood floors and into his kitchen for some orange juice, and leaves his house by 8:30. Spring training is six weeks away, but Jeter is already working because he wants to be able to do exactly what he did last night.
Jeter wants to get stronger, better and smarter, which is why he moved to Tampa, Fla., six years ago and spends 50 weeks a year playing baseball. His eyes are still bleary and the weather is cool when Jeter gets to the Yankees' minor league complex there. The fields are empty and Jeter starts to work like an unemployed minor leaguer. 
 The relevance of those wake-up calls resonated in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series last night. Jeter knows the lusty swing that produced a prodigious three-run homer off Paul Abbott and helped steer Roger Clemens and the Yankees past the fading Mariners, 5-0, was born in a backyard in Kalamazoo, Mich., and is now bred in Tampa. Those endless hours of practice are Jeter's secret weapon.
"I think you give yourself a chance to reflect about that stuff when the season is over," Jeter said. "I don't want to do that now. If you do that now, you get yourself in trouble."
 As Jeter's shot kept climbing to center field, Mike Cameron kept pursuing it. The acrobatic Cameron stole a homer from Jeter in April, but his leap was in vain this time. When Abbott saw Jeter's ball vanish over the fence, he said, "Oh my God." There was silence at Safeco Field when Jeter, blowing a bubble and pumping his fist, breezed around the bases.
"Huge at-bat, huge hit," right fielder Paul O'Neill said. "He's Derek Jeter, man. That's what he's supposed to do."
Because Clemens was intimidating the Mariners, Jeter's homer in the fifth inning surely deflated them. The game was over. Clemens buzzed fastballs that reached 99 miles an hour and he was even more relaxed after Jeter's homer, finishing with a one-hitter spiced with 15 strikeouts.
Before the game, Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Famer who was known as Mr. October, was praising the Yankees for knowing how to win. Jackson lumped Clemens, the future Hall of Famer who now has four victories in 15 postseason starts, in a group of players who thrive when the scrutiny is most intense. Why Jackson said it was uncertain, but the real Mr. October was right about the Mr. October for a night.
"Clemens is going to show you that tonight by pitching well," Jackson said. "He's going to have a tough time. If he gets out of it, they're going to get beaten. The good ones are like that."
After hitting 15 homers this season, his lowest total since he had 10 in 1997, Jeter has already belted two during the A.L.C.S. Jeter hit a two-run homer during the seven-run eighth inning in Game 2 and then helped bury the Mariners last night and probably forever.
Back in Wesley Chapel, Fla., Gary Denbo was smiling. Denbo, who was Jeter's first minor league manager and is now the Yankees' hitting coordinator, works with him during all of those quiet mornings on barren fields.
Denbo called Jeter last week and offered three pieces of advice. He told Jeter that he needed to stand more upright because he had no chance to bash certain inside pitches if he tilted forward. Denbo also advised Jeter to try to hit to the middle of the field instead of trying to pull everything. Finally, Denbo counseled Jeter on taking a better swing path and moving his bat through the strike zone at a steady rate. On the memorable homer, Jeter remained upright, he hit the ball to the middle of the field and his swing was true.
"It's a good feeling to know that you've worked with him and maybe you've contributed a little bit to his success," Denbo said by telephone last night. "He's a great student. After you talk to him, he does it."
When Jeter was asked if he might buy Denbo dinner, he said, "I owe him a lot more than one dinner."
Denbo sheepishly warned whoever plays the Yankees this October or in Octobers to come about what the future holds for Jeter. "He can hit for more power and for a higher average," Denbo said. "I don't think he's as good as he's going to get. That's good for the Yankees."
Alex Rodriguez, Jeter's buddy, placed his right foot in the batter's box and swiveled his cleats in the dirt to get comfortable. The game was in the first inning and, even as fans waved white towels, there was still a serene atmosphere.
Clemens changed that with one fastball that whistled near Rodriguez's neck and caused him to stumble backward as if he were shoved. Boos erupted. Just to make sure the message was received, Clemens unleashed another fastball that almost kissed A-Rod's chin.
That was the first message Clemens sent, but it was not the last as he showed the ferocious approach that the Yankees have always wanted to see. Jeter sent another message with a homer. If the Yankees send one more today, they will be in the World Series again.

HEADLINE: Energy Salvation? Not in the Arctic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "It's Not Oil vs. Beauty in the Arctic" (Op-Ed, Oct. 9): Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, argues that oil production and environmental protection can coexist. But the real question is whether oil consumption and environmental protection can coexist. 
 If increased emissions of greenhouse gases disrupt the climate system, and the evidence is strong that they do, it seems foolhardy to continue our oil dependence through the old explore-and-produce paradigm.
Sustainable economic vitality, strengthened national security and long-term environmental benefits will not be found at the bottom of the oil well, but in the creation and distribution of diverse, efficient and renewable energy technologies.

HEADLINE: Energy Salvation? Not in the Arctic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Senator Frank H. Murkowski (Op-Ed, Oct. 9) fails to recognize that the real choice in deciding whether to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil is between short-term profits for big oil companies or a lasting legacy of rare and incomparable wilderness for future generations. 
 In this treeless expanse, any intrusion will destroy the wilderness, described in statute as an "area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man." Slightly raising fuel-efficiency standards would save far more oil than the Arctic refuge might produce.
None of the predictions about the amount of oil that may underlie the Arctic refuge even come into play unless there is oil there. The odds of any economically recoverable oil being in the refuge are slim: less than one in five.

HEADLINE: To Help the Homeless, New York Must Build

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Though I am pleased with New York City's decision to start a rent-subsidy program for 500 homeless families (news article, Oct. 12), I must point out that this is considered only a remedial plan in response to the current emergency, and will assist fewer than 10 percent of the more than 5,000 families now languishing in the shelter system. Moreover, it provides no relief to the "hidden homeless," those thousands of families living tenuously, doubled and tripled up in the homes of families and friends. 
 The only long-term solution to our housing problem is the construction of affordable housing. Even during the most difficult fiscal period of the 1990's, the city invested much more in affordable housing than it does now. Ultimately, the monetary cost of new housing is small compared with the cost that our continued failure has on the social and economic fabric of the city.

 The Ralph Nader Reader
 By Ralph Nader.
 441 pp. New York:
 Seven Stories Press. Paper, $19.95. 
 As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush slap new slogans on the screen, baffle the electorate with arguments over prescription drugs and try to one-up each other in televised debates, it is worth rereading the best speech announcing a presidential candidacy of this campaign. Or reading it for the first time, since it got minimal attention when delivered and cannot be found even today on the candidate's Web sites.
Ralph Nader's speech on Feb. 21 declaring his sure-thing quest for the Green Party's nomination was an angry, principled and coherent condemnation of the current state of American politics. Although his anger sometimes swerves into petulance and his principles into dogmatism, his speech presented a stark and provocative contrast to those of the Republican and Democratic candidates, who sounded as if they had the same pollsters. In their June 1999 announcements, Gore and Bush emphasized exactly the same themes: opposing drugs in schools, involving religious organizations in social welfare programs, promoting foreign trade and using prosperity to help the American family.
This is what the graying Nader said as he reflected on the waning influence of the consumer and environmental movements he has led since the 1960's:
"Over the past 20 years, big business has increasingly dominated our political economy. This control by the corporate government over our political government is creating a widening 'democracy gap.' Active citizens are left shouting their concerns over a deep chasm between their government and themselves. . . . The unconstrained behavior of big business is subordinating our democracy to the control of a corporate plutocracy that knows few self-imposed limits to the spread of its power. Moving on all fronts to advance narrow profit motives at the expense of civic values, large corporate lobbies and their law firms have produced a commanding, multi-faceted and powerful juggernaut. They flood public elections with cash, and they use their media conglomerates to exclude, divert or propagandize. They brandish their willingness to close factories here and open them abroad if workers do not bend to their demands. By their control in Congress, they keep the federal cops off the corporate crime, fraud and abuse beats."
This speech is the most compelling contemporary document in "The Ralph Nader Reader," a collection of articles and speeches that span his career before, during and after the years when he had more influence on his country than Al Gore and George W. Bush have had, combined. But it pales in comparison with the best of Nader's earlier writings. "The Safe Car You Can't Buy" (1959), " 'Brown Lung': The Cotton-Mill Killer" (1971) and the essential "Remarks Before the Conference on Property Tax Reform" (1970) have the details of the problems and the urgency and specifics of suggested solutions that made him the scourge of big business until the late 1970's.
Car safety was Nader's first crusade, and the 1959 article in The Nation reporting that a Cornell laboratory had designed a safe car and the auto industry had ignored its findings included this striking thought: "Automobiles are so designed as to be dangerous at any speed." That was the forerunner of his book attacking General Motors' Corvair, "Unsafe at Any Speed," which made him famous, especially after G.M. admitted sending out gumshoes to seek material to smear him with. The brown lung article, which also appeared in The Nation, represented a shift in focus from workers to consumers. Nader detailed the textile industry's efforts to block any action to curb byssinosis, a condition resembling emphysema that made each breath a struggle for thousands of workers, who were routinely fired if they reported the disease, which could not be claimed under workmen's compensation in any state at the time.
Almost a decade before the property tax revolt that sparked measures like California's Proposition 13, Nader was offering a simple explanation of why residential taxes were so high. With his staff of "Nader's Raiders," he studied cities large and small and found that industrial giants like United States Steel and Union Carbide had the political muscle to win low assessments. Nader ended his report with the sort of call to action that runs throughout the book: "The combined force of courageous citizens in every locality, together with efforts by national organizations and authorities, will rapidly lead to a much more equitable property tax system with all that means for city and county services, education, small property holders, land use, the elderly and a more honest political structure."
Nader's other strain of optimism concerned the law as a weapon for social justice. In 1972, the Harvard Law School's most distinguished graduate in the second half of the 20th century urged that year's students to consider becoming "offensive attorneys for justice." He was still at it in 1991 at Hofstra's law school when he said "the principal function of the law ideally should be to curb the abuses of raw power and to clear the way for the fulfillment of the human potential."
But while the earlier essays were more hopeful than angry, anger dominates the pieces from the 1990's, which make up more than half of those in the book. In a 1996 article titled "It's Time to End Corporate Welfare as We Know It," he raged against the exploitation of public lands, the savings and loan bailouts and giveaways of drug patents. "Yet what," he asked, "is the big issue in this country and in Washington when the word 'welfare' is spoken? It is the $300 monthly check given a welfare mother, most of which is spent immediately in the consumer economy."
Nader's despair about the Democrats, who provided the allies he praises in his earliest essays, emerged in the 80's. In the course of a wide-ranging denunciation of Ronald Reagan at the National Press Club in 1984, he was even harder on the Democrats. He recalled Thomas Jefferson saying government should curb "the excesses of the moneyed interests" and Franklin D. Roosevelt condemning "the malefactors of great wealth." Reagan, he said, had been "blessed by an opposition party that has largely surrendered the basic contention of its politics -- namely that of challenging the maldistribution of power between the haves and the have-nots." In 1996, in an article condemning President Clinton as a lackey of Wall Street, Nader complained that "the defiantly deteriorating national Democratic Party, stripped of any grass-roots engagement, obligated to corporate moneys and personnel, and chaired by the senator from Aetna (Dodd), refuses to recognize the need for a comprehensive pro-labor agenda, leaving a supportive A.F.L.-C.I.O. as supplicant with nowhere to go."
So perhaps his Green Party candidacy has the internal logic of providing a refuge for liberal Democrats who feel betrayed by the party's drift to the center. Of course, had he run instead in the Democratic Party primaries, he would have got some intense exposure, participation in winter debates and perhaps influence on Gore's proposals. He would not have become president, but he won't this way either. In fact, this useful book undercuts Nader's campaign argument that the major party candidates are "tweedledum and tweedledee" with "few major differences."
Whatever Gore may have done to keep business happy with him -- and despite his recent attacks on the drug and oil industries, he has done quite well at the Wall Street trough -- he has hardly been a corporate welfare recipient of the sort Nader condemned in these words: "Local governments are anteing up three, four, five hundred million dollars to lure very profitable baseball, football and basketball sports moguls who don't want to share the profits. Corporate sports are being subsidized by cities."
That is, on the other hand, a fair description of how the Texas Rangers got a new ballpark out of the city of Arlington when George W. Bush owned the team. Unless its $135 million price tag puts it below Nader's threshold. Then there is one of Bush's proudest boasts about his first year as governor, the 1995 passage of tort reform legislation, an idea Gore does not support. That same year, Nader was writing about comparable legislation pending in Congress, warning that "if the wrongdoers' lobby prevails, the local control that judges and juries have had over wrongdoers will be severely limited."
In an odd way, "The Ralph Nader Reader" shows that Nader is part of an old political stream, if not a mainstream. When he dismisses his opponents as "a political duopoly, the DemRep Party," he employs the traditional exaggeration of third party candidates. But George C. Wallace said it better when he insisted there was "not a dime's worth of difference" between Republicans and Democrats.

HEADLINE: Jewish Newark's Urban Pioneers Rest Uneasily;
The Dead, Left Behind in the Suburban Diaspora, Lay Amid a Landscape of Ravaged Monuments

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
HARRY BALK died a young man in 1925. He was just 21, and like many impoverished Jews living here at the time, he was probably taken away by tuberculosis, influenza or a simple infection. His grief-stricken family spent a lot on a handsome granite marker, affixed to it his photograph, and etched in stone the following words:
"You took with you all that made life worthwhile. The flare of your youth has gone with you too. And all that is left is a beloved memory of you." 
 Looking at his grave in a crowded cemetery in Newark, hard by the Garden State Parkway, it is difficult to imagine that anyone remembers Harry Balk.
His headstone has been vandalized, his sepia photograph pummeled with a rock. All that is left of his image is a torso dressed in suit and tie. Spreading out from his narrow plot in every direction is a landscape of chilling desecration. Photographs obliterated, headstones toppled and bronze memorial plaques ripped out, perhaps to be sold as scrap.
When Ed Brody went to look for his grandfather's grave a few years ago at the cemetery, he was stunned to find that the tombstone had disappeared.
"Maybe it ended up as a first base for someone," said Mr. Brody, 76, who grew up in Newark but now lives in Livingston. "It's very disheartening."
There are nearly 100 Jewish cemeteries in Newark, and most of them are monuments to vandalism and neglect. Gates are flung open, beer bottles litter the ground and tombstones are pushed over like bowling pins.
These are not the pillaged burial grounds of the vanished European shtetl, but the resting place of Jews whose descendants, among the wealthiest in the country, live just a few miles away in places like South Orange, Short Hills and West Caldwell. Except for one day during the High Holidays, when aged Jews make an annual cemetery pilgrimage to Newark protected by the police, there are no visitors. New interments are rare, most of them first-generation Russians still struggling with poverty.
America is strewn with abandoned cemeteries, but few have been as ravaged as those in Newark, a city that once boasted a vibrant Jewish community of 80,000. European immigrants who arrived at the turn of the century, they started out destitute and within a generation, had achieved a prosperity that fueled a second mass migration, this time to the fabled suburbs of Essex County and beyond.
Jewish Newark, immortalized by Philip Roth and kept alive through the stories of its former residents, is a familiar one. But it is difficult to understand how this community of urban pioneers, so proudly linked to Newark, could so easily leave behind their dead. After all, these cemeteries are the only physical reminders of what once was.
To William B. Helmreich, a sociologist at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, Newark's forgotten graveyards are a heart-rending metaphor for a people whose memories are often tinged with bitterness.
"They are darkest expressions of how a community was born, flourished and then withered away and died," said Mr. Helmreich, whose 1999 book, "The Jews of Newark and Metrowest," (Transaction Publishers), documents the rise and fall of Jewish Newark.
Talk to a Newark native, and the story is almost always the same. Life was sweet, the story goes, until the 1967 riots, when everything was swept away. Of course, history is much more complex. In fact, Newark's Jews had begun leaving their Weequahic neighborhood and migrating west long before black rioters burned and looted stretches of the Central Ward.
If anything, it was the charms of suburbia, the alternative to cramped urban living, that lured Jews from their beloved Bergen Street, Weequahic's civic and commercial spine. The post-war building boom, generous loans for returning G.I.s, and the affordable automobile helped draw Jews to the new Promised Land of Livingston, Millburn and the Oranges.
"It's a typical American story," said David Mallach, the director of community relations for the United Jewish Federation of MetroWest, an organization that is trying to rehabilitate the graveyards. "Everyone scatters and disperses and only the cemeteries are left."
BUT Mr. Helmreich sees something deeper in the abandonment. To him, the cemeteries are unpleasant symbols of loss, a reminder of the guilt that some people feel for having walked away from Newark. "For many, it is just too painful so to keep the memory out of their consciousness they don't go back," he said.
It was not supposed to be that way. In contrast to Christianity, with its strong belief in heaven and hell, Judaism focuses on remembrance as a way of immortalizing the dead. According to Jewish tradition, the cemetery serves as a memorial those who have passed on, a place that helps the living keep alive the memory of the dead.
"In Judaism, there is a feeling of connection to the people who went before us, of seeing oneself in a chain of generations," said Rabbi Cathy Felix, director of the federation's rabbinic cabinet. "The spirit may be gone, but we still have an obligation to people who died, even if they're not our own family members."
And because some Jews believe the Messiah will bring about the resurrection of the dead, cemeteries are considered sacred places.
Throughout their long history of migration and forced relocation, Jews made the establishment of a burial ground one of their first civic tasks. In Newark, with its colorful collection of European Jews -- some Orthodox, some barely observant, some German, some Polish -- that meant a jumble of competing burial societies.
By the 1920's, there were nearly 100 of them, their sponsors a mix of trade unions, congregations and groups named for a town in the old country, known in Yiddish as landsmanshaftn. Even today, the arches that grace the cemeteries along Grove Street attest to the dizzying variety of organizations: Anshe Warshaw (for those from the Polish capital), Workmen's Circle (a union) and B'nai Jeshurun, Newark's first congregation, founded in 1848 by a group of German immigrants.
Typically, an organization would buy a cemetery and sell off graves to subscribers, who would pay between $5 and $10 a year for a plot no bigger than the dimensions of a coffin, said Irwin Shipper, former president of the New Jersey Cemetery Board.
Unlike the generously spaced plots in an adjacent Catholic cemetery, the string of Jewish graveyards along Grove Street is thick with headstones, each one nearly touching the next, as if close proximity to one another might give comfort to the dead. In reality, economics more than anything probably dictated the tightly packed layout of Jewish cemeteries.
But the multitude of fraternal organizations and burial societies were not long for this world. Formed by newly arrived immigrants, groups like the Oddfellows and Anshe Russia had little appeal to American-born children eager to assimilate.
Today, except for a handful of congregations that long ago moved out west, none of these burial societies survive. Newark, which once boasted 63 synagogues, now has just one. "These people just didn't see a day when their societies would fade away," said Mr. Shipper. "And they didn't leave endowments for long-term care." By 1971, when a state law mandated that cemetery owners establish permanent maintenance funds, it was already too late.
AS Jews relocated to the suburbs and Newark's fortunes declined, people sought out newer burial grounds in places like Clifton or Kennilworth. Landscaped memorial parks, with their flat grave markers and expansive lawns, made Newark's Old World cemeteries seem even more obsolete.
Sandy Epstein, who still runs the monument business his grandparents founded in 1913, said there were about 500 annual interments in Newark's Jewish cemeteries in the late 1960's. Today, there are a few dozen, he said. "We still have room but they hear the word Newark and they want to go elsewhere," said Mr. Epstein, whose company still maintains graves here.
By the 1970's, as Newark was consumed by crime and decay, reports of cemetery muggings kept visitors away. Of course, as time claimed the older generation, fewer and fewer people had any connection to those buried in Newark. "People may visit their parents' graves, but not many people visit the graves of their grandparents or great grandparents," Mr. Epstein said.
The annual cemetery pilgrimage, once a central part of Jewish culture, has also faded. Alice Gould, 71, a retired math teacher from West Caldwell, remembers growing up in Newark, when her family would visit her Uncle Albert's grave every year around Rosh Hashanah. "Younger people just don't do that anymore," she said.
Marsha Dubrow, 51, a musicologist and information technology consultant from Upper Montclair, recalls the shock she felt four years ago when she visited the graves of her grandparents in Talmud Torah, a small cemetery that is adjacent to the parkway and enveloped by a much larger Catholic one.
"I was absolutely appalled by the condition," Ms. Dubrow said. "I said to myself, 'Why isn't anyone doing anything about it?' I couldn't fathom that this enduring legacy was being neglected."
Armed with a series of photographs she had taken, Ms. Dubrow started showing the images to friends and family members. "I decided I had to do something about the destruction," she said.
MS. DUBROW was not prepared for the response. On seeing the photographs, an uncle wrote her a generous check and before long, she had $300,000 in her Legacy Fund, which is now administered by the Whippany-based federation. Ms. Dubrow ultimately hopes to raise $2 million for the rehabilitation and restoration of Newark's orphaned cemeteries. As its first act, the group recently set upright about 70 headstones that had been knocked over in the Adas Israel cemetery. Ultimately, the organization hopes to do more than spruce up burial plots.
Ms. Dubrow said she wants to create a museum documenting the rich history of Jewish Newark and its dispersal to the suburbs. She envisions a walkway of the diaspora using the archways that still bear the names of Eastern European towns erased by the Nazis.
"These cemeteries are a symbol of an era when there were these vast waves of Jewish immigration to this country," Ms. Dubrow said. "All of us who are descended from this wave have benefited from the efforts of these pioneers, and because of that, we really should honor this community. It also becomes a way of understanding our own heritage." According to her plan, an abandoned cemetery office in Talmud Torah would be turned into a small museum.
Even without a museum, those curious or intrepid enough to venture into the cemeteries can learn a great deal from this great forest of headstones. There are mausoleums to once-legendary rabbis and powerful industrialists and monuments referring to episodes of history that few can remember. In one Grove Street cemetery stands a majestic granite archway memorializing a pair of 22-year-old unionists, Morris Rubin and Abe Nowak, who died during a furrier strike in 1915.
Another marks the grave of "the Lizzie Borden of Newark," who was convicted of killing her brother with an ax in the late 1940's. After spending the rest of her life in prison, she, who died in 1998 and was given a Jewish burial. The numerous plots of children and young adults, some of them topped by seated lambs, are testaments to the epidemics that swept through the city's overcrowded tenements. Sprinkled throughout are the graves of fallen soldiers who died in two world wars.
TO help document the dead, a group of volunteers has begun collecting information from headstones and researching the defunct burial societies, using deeds and death notices. Because most of the cemetery records have been lost, the Jewish Genealogical Society, led by Alice Gould, has spent the last five years creating a registry of names that will be accessible on the Web. So far, she has collected 13,000 entries, which include the Hebrew name of the deceased, the dates of birth and death and the location of the plot.
"If we don't do it now, all this history could be lost forever," Ms. Gould said. The database she and her late husband created has already helped numerous people track down the long-lost graves of their relatives. "It's very gratifying when I can help someone find the plot of a family member," she said.
On Nov. 5, Mrs. Gould plans to bring another group to Grove Street. As in the past, members of the Essex County Sheriff's office will be on hand to keep an eye on the workers. (Each year, around the High Holy Days, a volunteer group of Jewish law enforcement officers escorts people to the cemeteries. The annual pilgrimage, sponsored by the federation, drew hundreds on Sept. 24.) "People are afraid to go there without protection, and rightly so," Mrs. Gould said, although she admitted to occasionally working in the cemeteries alone.
Those seeking to preserve and protect the final resting place of some 150,000 Jews hope they can interest the heirs of those who lived and died in Newark. Although MetroWest has a modest budget to repair fences and cut back weeds, there is not enough money for more extensive rehabilitation work, Mr. Mallach said.
The task, Mr. Mallach said, is daunting. But ultimately he hopes that even those who do not trace their roots to Newark will be moved to contribute to the cemetery campaign. Honoring and caring for the dead, he points out, is considered a mitzvah, or a blessed act, in Judaism because it does not involve any tangible compensation.
"There are no tangible rewards," he said. "It's the ultimate act of reverence."
The Jewish cemeteries of Newark will be the subject of a program Oct. 29 presented by the New Jersey Historical Society. A lecture at the society's headquarters, at 52 Park Place in Newark, will be followed by a bus tour to several cemeteries. Price: $10. Information: (973) 596-8500.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
A Happy, Scary New Day for Design

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
IT is scary to be living at a time when a particular creative field grips the public imagination as powerfully as design has in recent years. I can't recall anything like it since the late 60's and early 70's, when movies and pop music exercised a magnetic hold on the minds of baby boomers. Today, the vigor pulses through fashion, furniture, art direction, graphics and product and image design with a similarly captivating verve. Design has taken on its own life, and this raises a problem often encountered in consumer culture. The energy is pure delight. But can we turn it off?
The new economy has been the major stimulus for the design phenomenon. Its most conspicuous expressions are appliances for data exchange -- computers, cell phones, personal organizers, digital cameras -- and the software programs and communications systems to which they are linked. Another stimulus emanates from the world of medicine: designer drugs, genetic engineering, cyber-prosthetics and advanced techniques in cosmetic surgery. 
 As expressions of The New, these products have inherited the myth of progress, modernity's defining legend. This is not the first time design has embodied that myth. In the early 20th century, the old economy (machine age) myth revolved around cars, ships, planes and other mechanized forms of transportation. But the myth also reshaped the face of buildings, fashion, decoration, paintings and other conventional forms. The new economic myth is having a similar impact. In addition to generating snazzy new shapes for laptops and hand-helds, this myth is transforming the look of buildings, interiors, books, landscapes, advertisements and other traditional forms of design.
Environmentalists use the term ecotone to describe the area where two adjacent ecosystems -- a wetland and a forest, say -- overlap. The ecotone has an ecology of its own. It can support forms of life not found in either of the adjacent systems. Today there exists the cultural equivalent of an ecotone between the old and new economies, between the culture of industrial production and that of informational exchange. Design today is flourishing in this region. Its symbol is the veil, a graphic device that conveys the conflicting desire to conceal and reveal.
Shadow, translucency, reflection, refraction, dappling, stippling, blurring, shimmering, vibration, moire, netting, layering, superimposition: these are some of the visual devices used to render the veil in contemporary design. Recent examples include the Apple G4 Power Cube; shadow niches in the walls of the British architect John Pawson; the spring 2001 collection by the fashion designer Helmut Lang; curtains by the Dutch designer Petra Blaisse; a new book, "Life Style," by the Canadian graphics designer Bruce Mau. His book, which is to be published next month, is an ideal opportunity to examine the significance of the veil as a contemporary design motif.
"Life Style" (Phaidon, $69.95) is one long Salome's dance. A 627-page strip tease performed with an endless variety of veils, the book tantalizes readers with glimpses into the thinking of one of the most creative minds at work in design today. Book covers, posters, videos, exhibitions, collaborations with architects, editors, filmmakers, performance artists and writers: Mau's projects in these and other media are graphically documented in a book that presents itself as a manifesto as well as a monograph.
You should not skip over the written portions, for these make clear that Mau does far more than bombard people with alluring, decontextualized images. "Life Style" is a designer's celebration of the book. Mau champions books at a historical moment when print culture is thought to be vanishing into the new economy's trash compactor. In this sense, Mau is picking up the threads of his fellow Canadian, Marshall McLuhan, and weaving them into a counterargument against McLuhan's prophecies of the book's doom. While perceived by some as trendy, Mau has a staunchly traditional attachment to the printed page.
Recently, Mau mentioned to me that graphic design is a young man's game. Now at 40, perhaps he sees "Life Style" as a summary of his work in a field he is preparing to quit. More likely, his comment simply reflected his commitment to working in the present. Contemporaneity -- the atmosphere of the present -- is Mau's product. It is easy to see him selling it in the many media he has yet to tackle.
Mau, who is based in Toronto, is best known to date as Rem Koolhaas's co-author of "S,M,L,XL," the acclaimed 1998 monograph on Koolhaas's buildings and ideas. Though the architect's work provides most of the book's content, Mau gets equal billing for the project: on the book's cover, the two names appear in type of equal size. The collaboration sent a message. Form and content are not fully divisible. A book's design, particularly when its content is visual art, should match the intelligence of its subject and even interact with it throughout the course of production. An enriched sensibility may emerge along the way. This is the message Mau has been sending from the outset of his career.
His professional present began in 1985 with the publication of Zone 1/2, a soft-cover anthology of writings on the contemporary city. He designed a cover of blue and dark blue squares arranged in a tight mosaic pattern that evoked satellite surveillance photography. The letters of the title were made from perforated dots that revealed the flamingo pink of the page beneath.
Zone 1/2 s reprinted in "Life Style" in its entirety, a book-within-the-book laid out on five double-page spreads. The print is too small to read. It registers as a series of thumbnail scrims, periodically punctuated with photographs, maps and other graphic devices. These create the effect of small explosions in the text, the visual equivalent of urban events.
Mau's sensibility is resolutely urbane: the artistic quality of his work is more essential to him than its commercial success. By the standards of academic publishing, however, Zone 1/2 was quite successful, and this led to the launching of Zone Books, a publishing co-venture with MIT Press. Edited by Jonathan Crary, Michel Fehrer and Sanford Kwinter, the imprint has specialized in visual art and urban culture, new titles as well as classic studies in these fields by authors like Panovsky and Batailles.
Since 1990, Mau has designed books in a similar vein for the Getty Research Institutes Publications Program, under the direction of Julia Bloomfield. In 1992, he was hired by Chee Perlman to redesign I.D. magazine, a trade publication that under Perlman's editorial direction became the leading chronicler of contemporary design.
Mau is now the imprint's imprint. There is a characteristic Bruce Mau look. It didn't come out of nowhere. Rauschenberg's silkscreens; color field paintings by Lewis, Frankenthaler and Olitsky; the pointillism of Seurat: these are some obvious visual precedents for the superimposed veils of image and text that one encounters throughout Mau's print work. Too, his approach echoes the visual/textual collage aesthetic of "The Medium Is the Massage," the 1966 paperback by McLuhan and the graphic designer Quentin Fiore. This book has become a classic for the wired generation.
WHAT emerges in the pages of "Life Style," however, is not just a distinctive aesthetic -- a Mau brand -- but the consistently high level of cultural sophistication represented by his clients. His roster consists almost exclusively of high-end publishers and cultural institutions. This focus, as well as the intelligence of his own work, is responsible for Mau's own lifestyle, the professional image Mau currently projects.
To put it another way, Mau's reputation rests on the ingenuity with which he blurs the boundaries between picture and text. He operates in an ecotone between print and visual culture. From that position, Mau perceives the distortions that images and words can separately impose on our view of the world. Mau is powerless to correct these distortions. But he can call attention to their presence. And he can provoke us toward skepticism about their claims to truth. That is the function of Mau's veils.
The veil evokes a universe of metaphors. Religious: maya, the veils of illusion; the veil of the temple; the glass we now see darkly through; glory be to God for dappled things.
Political: the deceptions practiced on a grand scale by public officials, particularly at election time.
Economic: the use of advertising and public relations to screen consumers from consumerism's unsavory effects.
Philosophical: the shadows in Plato's cave; the borders between our private worlds and the public realm we share.
Psychological: mental structures -- denial, desire, dissociation -- that enable us to filter, focus or ignore feelings, knowledge and perceptions.
The veil design motif brings all these connotations into play.
With the Apple Power Cube, we see through a glass, darkly, but on the Internet we shall see each other virtually face to face. In advertisements, the Cube is presented as the embodiment of omnipotence and omniscience, an entity whose name we almost dare not utter. The inner and outer enclosures create an ecotone of color, a silver shade generated by the laying of clear plastic over white.
From the exterior, the Cube is a pure product of what used to be called industrial design. Even its abstract, geometrical shape harks back to the Bauhaus-influenced products displayed in the Good Design shows organized in the 50's by the Museum of Modern Art. The innards, easily removed by means of a handle, represent the increasing miniaturization of information-age technology. The Cube's inner and outer enclosures symbolize an interface between the old and new economies.
"Silver makes everything disappear," Andy Warhol remarked apropos the decor of his 47th Street studio. The tone of the G4 nudges this technology-packed device toward immateriality. So does the silence of its fan-less operation. Perhaps this is not, after all, a machine, but a box of emptiness, a chunk of force-field that has been captured from the event-horizon of a black hole and returned to earth, where its power to warp time, space and gravity has been harnessed to serve consumer needs.
The Cube plays off against the infinite variety of forms in which other computers come packaged, and the ceaseless abundance of images that materialize on its dematerialized flat screen. The Cube is a rounded-off Platonic solid. Its speakers play the music of the spheres. On the screen -- a veil of pixels -- everything is changing, morphing, mutating, pointillistic. The Cube transcends change.
Helmut Lang's clothes display the rigor, consistency and playfulness of a philosophical system. But what is the philosophy? Some garments in his new collection have been compared to bondage attire. Featuring strips of cloth, tightly woven around the torso, they could also be seen as resortwear for mummies. Lang himself said his inspiration came from pictures of insects. Both interpretations are true. Fashion is a convention for simultaneously loosening and defining the boundaries between an individual and the social and natural environments in which she moves. It is a form of bondage, but one that the wearer is free to change or discard at any moment. Indeed, part of the bondage of fashion is that the cut and color of the boundaries must be changed as often as possible. They have, at most, an insect's life span.
Norbert Elias, author of "The Civilizing Process," used the term homo clausus, the conventional sociological image of the individual as a self-contained entity. Just because human organs are contained within the skin, it does not follow that a self is likewise circumscribed. On the contrary, a self is in large part an accumulation of relationships with the world outside the skin, a set of complex interactions with a rich variety of environments that began before birth. In the fashion world, society is an ecotone between a self and the stars. Self-image becomes tantamount to a world view.
Consider the fashion show. The young woman on the runway is a walking ecotone. We may identify her personality with her appearance, but even her appearance embodies cultural expectations ranging from body type to facial characteristics to the changing image of fashion projected on her by designers of clothes, hair, make-up.
Then of course there are the conventions of the fashion show itself: lighting, sound, movement, photography, editorial rank and spectatorship. Where does she stop and we start? Perhaps, if it weren't for the straps, the model's self would be very nearly uncontainable. She would dissolve in the glare of flashbulbs, her corporeal presence dissipating ever outward in reproductions transmitted by newspapers, magazines and TV.
Petra Blaisse makes Christo look like a hobo. Blaisse wraps walls, windows and entire buildings with fabrics and landscapes of great subtlety and strength. Her work, now the subject of a fine show at Storefront for Art and Architecture on Manhattan's Lower East Side, includes projects for private houses, theaters, a convention hall and a men's prison.
Many of Blaisse's projects were designed in collaboration with Rem Koolhaas. Her curtain for the Nederlands Dans Theater, a composition of metallic discs on black fabric that repeats the grid of stage lights behind, has become the logo for the Koolhaas building in the Hague. For the Rotterdam Kunsthal, Blaisse designed a diagonal terrace of trees that veils the windows. Inside, she conceived a spiral curtain track that transforms a two-dimension wall of fabric into a fluted cloth column.
The Villa Floirac, designed by Koolhaas for a family in Bordeaux, has become the most celebrated private house of recent times. For it, Blaisse designed a curtain system that allows fabrics to envelop the exterior and interior of the building. An inner curtain of aqua-colored netting covers a plate-glass wall extending the length of the second-floor living room. On the exterior, the owners can deploy a metallic thermal sheet. A screen of thin birch trees extends the effect of veiling into the landscape.
Koolhaas's architecture, designed for a wheelchair-bound man and his family, is an essay in the interweaving of prospect and refuge. Blaisse's curtains are the warp to the architect's woof. The combination of thermal sheeting, plate glass, aqua netting and birch trees is a vision out of a dream. It reminds us that architecture arises from the ecotone between material and metaphor.
Apple claims that the Power Cube's minimalist design makes it suitable for any decor. Not true. The little gizmo wants to be enveloped within an environment as basic and translucent as the Cube itself. Specifically, it wants an interior by John Pawson, our leading maestro of light, shadow and void. The British architect, designer of the Calvin Klein store on Madison Avenue, is the subject of "John Pawson," another monograph published by Phaidon this month. With an illuminating text by Deyan Sudjic, the book describes the spiritual underpinnings of Pawson's aesthetic.
In the 1970's, Pawson traveled to Japan, lived for a time in a Buddhist monastery and briefly considered becoming a monk. According to Sudjic, Pawson's design work is still informed by Buddhist beliefs. A central tenet of Japanese Buddhism is the concept of esho funi. Roughly translated as "the oneness of life and its environment," esho funi means that living beings and their surroundings, while different, are two sides of one entity. Buckminster Fuller exhorted his followers to "Reform the environment, not man." Fuller's idea would be unacceptable in Buddhist philosophy.
Yet architects do design environments. Clients hire them to make agreeable places, not to reform their spiritual lives. The most architects can hope for is a client whose values are sympathetic to their own. Even then, the places created by architects are spatially circumscribed. Even a Buddhist temple may be situated in an unsympathetic milieu, or why would a religion be needed at all? (This is the perpetual Utopian problem.)
From a Buddhist perspective, the spiritual and the material are also aspects of a single entity. This is why there is no contradiction in the alliance between Pawson and Calvin Klein. The work of both men is aspirational. Klein makes more explicit links between aspiration and desire (for sex, money, fame), but neither is Pawson running a monastery. What links the two, to each other and to the culture at large, is an appreciation for beauty, and a talent for creating real and virtual spaces where beauty shines.
Some artists and critics like to think of beauty as an incentive to reach toward the good and the true. I agree that art can be part of a philosophical system. But in the consumer society, beauty can also be a smokescreen -- a tool for distracting our attention from the bad and the false, the less savory side of consumerism itself. What a car! What a body! What a cool computer! Who wants to think about the sweatshop labor, acid rain, social disruption and disease that may be caused by the manufacture or use of these products? In this sense, beauty can be a veil, an invitation to overlook the ugly that we implicitly accept by buying into the system.
This is the case not only with individual objects. The desire to overlook the ugly is a major factor behind the present infatuation with the design medium as a whole. With that infatuation, consumers -- what used to be called the public -- are giving design enormous authority. Call it a myth, a virus or a mass psychosis. Like any authority, the design phenomenon derives its power from denial. It persuades people to leave unpleasant things out of the picture. A fancy story like this one is an example of denial at work.
Buildings account for 63 percent of energy consumption and 50 percent of so-called greenhouse gases. Yet I make a living writing about architecture as if it could be separated from this reality. (Smog as veil?) There are many ways to rationalize this practice: if buildings are going to be built, they ought to be good. Science falls outside my sphere of competence. Since my column runs in an arts section, readers would get bored with continuous commentary on solar collectors, the violence of urban development, sick building syndrome and the politics of French social housing.
SOMETIMES I take the unsavory aspects of architecture into account, the social and cultural as well as the environmental degradation. But I'm no good as Jeremiah. I write about buildings because I find the flux of urban life aesthetically appealing. I'll go on using the Truth is Beauty trick as long as I can get away with it.
Buildings, being large and expensive, are typically seen, at a distance, as totems of external authority. In the context of the new economy, they become emblems of the global operating system, allied more closely to similar totems in other cities than to their own towns. The Power Cube, being small and cheap, occupies personal space. For consumers, the stakes here are higher. One can choose to buy another computer. One cannot choose to opt out of the global operating system.
Your oil company is working hard to protect the environment! It's relatively easy, even accurate, to blame big business for consumerism's sinister effects. The hard task is to reckon with the psychological mechanisms that enable consumers to look the other way. This is the subject tackled by Israel Rosenfield in his dazzling and uncanny new novel "Freud's Megalomania." In the book's fictional last testament by the father of psychoanalysis, Freud argues that the need for self-deception (denial) is far more powerful than the sex or death drives as a motive for human behavior.
At once a satire and a probing philosophical essay, the book combines a bogus manuscript with footnotes that cite true events from Freud's life along with references to his writings and other psychoanalytic texts. These are then framed by other fictional devices: an introduction by a fictive editor (Prof. Albert J. Stewart) and a (fictional) postscript by (the real) Anna Freud. The result is an ecotone between two kinds of reality: (subjective) fiction and (objective) fact. The book's intellectual texture resembles a moire: truths about human nature shimmer in the layering of reporting atop invention. Reading it, the mind swivels among similarities and differences, between objective and subjective realities. It occupies a region that cannot be sustained either by reporting and invention alone.
This is one of the major ideas uncovered by the structure of Rosenfield's book. The mind is dense with veils that float between what we see, what we know, what we believe and how, or whether, we choose to act. What is the value of this? To produce skepticism. To induce doubt. To propose that seeing is not believing.
Design can perform a similar service. Mau does this. Like Rosenfield, he rubs together different kinds of information. The opaque and and the semitransparent. Picture and text. Focused and blurred. That the mind is given no place to rest. The eye can momentarily alight here or there, only to be quickly drawn away, to a different place on the same plane, or toward an implied zone of great or lesser depth. The effect is equivalent to critical thinking: a constant oscillation between conviction and doubt.
Pawson, Blaisse and Lang beckon the beholder into a similar frame of mind. Their work simultaneously expresses a given condition and a problem. The condition is that the information age operates as much inside the brain as outside it. The problem is how to clear up mental confusion so as to reach a place of historical and moral awareness. Veils are at once facts to be contemplated and fictions to be pulled aside.
Even the Power Cube computer, which visually abases itself before the new economy, enlarges the user's capacity to resist as well as to conspire with economic globalization. Computers have made it possible for opponents of the World Bank to contest its trade policies, for example, as organizers of the Seattle protest did earlier this year. The image of power projected by the Cube is ambiguous. Where does the power lie? The Cube's beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Doubt, too, is an individual matter.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday with the continuation of a front-page article about the role of design in contemporary culture misstated the location of a Calvin Klein store designed by John Pawson. It is in Seoul, South Korea, not Manhattan.
An article on Oct. 15 about trends in design and the work of the graphics designer Bruce Mau with Zone Books misspelled the surname of one of the imprint's editors. He is Michel Feher, nor Fehrer. The article omitted the names of two other prominent editors at Zone who have worked with Mr. Mau; they are Hal Foster and Ramona Naddaff. The article also misspelled the surnames of two authors published by Zone. They are the art historian Erwin Panofsky, not Panovsky, and the philosopher Georges Bataille, not Batailles.

HEADLINE: A Music Collection Gets a Home

BYLINE: By PATRICIA GRANDJEAN

 BODY:
IT was lunchtime on a Tuesday in the kitchen of Samuel and Ann Charters in Storrs, and over a turkey sandwich, Mr. Charters was discussing rap music, particularly the work of early gangsta rappers like the Geto Boys and the late Tupac Shakur.
"Never has there been the kind of folk expression in music that rap represents," he said. "There's so much anger being worked off." While he doesn't approve of rap's sometimes violent and pornographic imagery, he declares that "rappers are producing the most complex, inventive rhyme schemes of anyone in pop music today." 
 Whether you share his views or not, when you talk music with Mr. Charters, 71, you're conversing with one extraordinary fan. In the past 50 years, he has developed a reputation as one of African-American music's most formidable producers, field researchers and historians, along the way earning a Grammy Award (for producing Clifton Chenier's 1983 zydeco album, "I'm Here"), a Deems Taylor Award for Excellence in Music Writing (for his 1981 book "The Roots of the Blues"), and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame.
On Friday, he and Ann, 63, an English professor at the University of Connecticut since 1974, will preside over the opening of the Charters Archive at UConn's Thomas J. Dodd Research Center. Drawn largely from the couple's personal collection, the archive incorporates recordings (including gospel, ragtime, rap, jazz, Caribbean and almost every subgenre of the blues), sheet music, books, videos, photos and research materials that date from the mid-19th century to the present.
"It's arguably the most comprehensive African-American music archive yet compiled in one place," said Robert Stevens, a UConn music professor and the interim director of the university's Institute of African-American Studies.
Mr. Charters's appreciation of music was fostered by his jazz-loving family in Pittsburgh; several relatives were musicians. As a teenager he took up clarinet, but was frustrated by his own limitations. In 1950, he traveled to New Orleans in the hope of improving his technique, and came under the tutelage of legendary clarinetist George Lewis.
More interested in the personal anecdotes Lewis shared -- about his own life and those of fellow jazz musicians -- than in the notes he played, Mr. Charters said he "realized that none of the jazz books I had read had ever told me what George was telling me. There was so much more we needed to learn."
Much of the blues folklore and history now taken for granted hadn't been recorded at that time. Names like Mississippi John Hurt, Son House and Charley Patton were long forgotten, or yet to be discovered.
John and Alan Lomax, a Texas-based father-and-son team of ethnomusicologists, had canvassed the deep South in the 1930's and 40's, seeking indigenous folk music on behalf of the Library of Congress. Mr. Charters decided to do similar research into blues music, but his orientation was more biographical.
"The Lomaxes were simply interested in developing a broad sociological picture of folk music," he said. "I was more interested in finding the great artists who helped to shape and redefine the blues tradition."
In the 50's, he first attempted to uncover the story of Robert Johnson, a Mississippi bluesman who was barely known at that time. There was no clue to go on except a song called "Stones in My Passway," recorded in San Antonio.
"So, I walked the streets there, asking people, 'Did you ever hear of Robert Johnson?' " Mr. Charters said. "Of course, he'd only been in town for two weeks' worth of recording sessions. Still, people gave me many wonderful stories, not all of which were true."
In time, Mr. Charters's activities shifted from field research to field recording, much of it under the direction of the founder of Folkways Records, Moses Asch. "I felt if I didn't record them, it might not get done," he said. "But I realized in the mid-1950's that I was pretty much covering the whole South myself. It was too big; I needed help."
His 1959 book "Country Blues," a series of profiles of artists like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Big Bill Broonzy, Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, was a call to arms. A major inspiration for the widespread blues revival of the 1960's, it's still in print more than 40 years later.
Mr. Charters may have been the Pied Piper for a whole new generation of blues enthusiasts, but he found his true soul mate in Ann. Married in 1959, the couple had met five years earlier, while taking the same musical counterpoint class at the University of California at Berkeley. He was an economics major, she a gifted pianist (and Connecticut native) who had just decided to major in English. They kept in touch after Mr. Charters graduated in 1956 and embarked on his projects for Folkways.
"He sent me the first record he produced, 'Looking for Blind Willie Johnson,' " Ms. Charters said. By that time the Texas gospel blues legend had died, so the disc consisted of a handful of reissued recordings combined with Mr. Charters's commentary and an interview with Johnson's widow. "I took it into my little cottage where I had an inexpensive phonograph and just listened, entranced," she added. "The work he was doing blew me away. I thought to myself, 'I could marry him.' "
In the summer of 1957 Ms. Charters drove cross-country intent on pursuing a graduate degree at Columbia University and, she joked, "getting my man," who had relocated to New York City. They've collaborated on many projects since, including the 1958 "A Joplin Bouquet" -- the first album to record Scott Joplin's rags in traditional style -- and a trip to the Bahamas the same year, to research the African-inspired vernacular music of Andros Island. There, they discovered the guitarist Joseph Spence as well as Ms. Charters's talents with a camera.
"I'd bought a secondhand Brownie while at Berkeley," she said, "but up to that point I'd never taken anything but pictures of my cat."
One day, while Mr. Charters set up his tape recorder, Ms. Charters became fascinated with some handmade fishing sloops nearby. "I was wearing a dress, so I hitched up my skirt, wandered knee-deep into the water and shot the pic," she says. The photo ended up on the cover of the resultant Folkways release, "Music of the Bahamas," and launched her on her avocation as Mr. Charters's field photographer. Her portraits of blues musicians are now included in the UConn archive and spotlighted in the couple's new book, "Blues Faces."
On her own, Ms. Charters has cultivated a reputation as one of the world's foremost experts on the Beat Generation poets, befriending Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac (she helped him compile a bibliography of his works in 1967) and writing innumerable articles and books, including an acclaimed biography of Kerouac in 1973. "I fell in love with the Beats the way I fell in love with Robert Johnson," she said. "For a long time, the literary scholars were just trashing them, but to me they seemed to be talking honestly about something archetypally American, and I wanted to champion that."
These days, the Charterses are busier than ever. They are currently making appearances to promote "Blues Faces" and "The Day Is So Long, and the Wages So Small," an account of their summer on Andros Island. Mr. Charters has just completed a biography of Bebo Valdes, an influential Cuban pianist and bandleader.
"Bebo's story is of a man who gave up an international career because he fell in love with a young Swedish girl," he said. "Since 1963, he's been living quietly in a Stockholm suburb. But the musicians from the Buena Vista Social Club all worked with Bebo when he had his big orchestra in Havana."
While researching the book in Sweden, Mr. Charters also recorded Mr. Valdes for Gazell Records, a sister label to Mr. Charters's Connecticut-based independent record company of the same name, which specializes in new jazz artists and veterans of the 1960's Greenwich Village folk scene (such as Dave Van Ronk).
He and Ms. Charters still set aside an hour every day for shared music-listening sessions, which feature everything from Japanese koto music to Indian ragas. "That's our sacred time," Ms. Charters said.
Though he remains conversant on contemporary popular musicians from Beck to Eminem, Mr. Charters admitted: "I'm not interested in rock acts per se, because of the compromises made. But if an artist is doing something creative, to expand himself or herself, then I'm always interested. I buy many more records than I should."
UConn's Institute of African-American Studies, Thomas J. Dodd Research Center and department of music will commemorate the opening of the Charters Archive with a daylong symposium on Friday culminating in a Jorgensen Auditorium performance by the Mississippi blues guitarist Otis Rush.
