HEADLINE: Romney Is Sounding Note of Inevitability

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
To hear Mitt Romney tell it, a Romney administration is not a question of if, but when.
Speaking to a group of veterans in Springfield, Va., Thursday morning, Mr. Romney made a point of stressing that come Nov. 6, he expects to be the president-elect. 
"And if I become president - no, when I become president of the United States - we're going to do what we have to do," he told the group, pausing for effect.
In the face of public polls that show President Obama leading Mr. Romney in a number of crucial battle ground states, Mr. Romney has recently added a deliberate line to his stump speech - a when-not-if quip - that seems designed not only to pump up the crowd, but perhaps also to reassure weary Republicans and staff members that he has what it takes to wrest the Oval Office from Mr. Obama on Election Day.
Addressing a group of wealthy donors at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles last weekend, Mr. Romney tried to sound a confident note.
"I'm asked from time to time, 'What are going to do if you get to become president?' " he said, gearing up for his big applause line. "And the answer is, 'Well first of all, I'm going be president.' That's No. 1."
Making his way through Ohio Wednesday on a modified day-and-a-half long bus tour, Mr. Romney made sure to incorporate the line at every stop.
At a morning rally in Westerville, Ohio: "I can commit to you this: With every ounce of my energy, when I'm president of the United States," Mr. Romney began, before repeating the phrase again, for added emphasis, "When I am president of the United States, I will strengthen America."
Before a business round-table discussion in Bedford Heights, Ohio, encouraging the small business owners to give him suggestions: "So if there's some impediments to that growth, some challenges you think we face, if you'll let me know what those things are, because I'm going to be the next president of the United States and I want to know."
And at an evening rally in Toledo, Ohio: "If instead I - no, instead when I become president - we're going to get this economy growing again, we're going to do the things that ignite this economy."
The cheerily confident assertion that Mr. Romney believes he will be the next president has become a fail-safe applause line for him - akin to repealing the president's health care plan, or making the nation energy independent - and a way for Mr. Romney to project optimism at the daunting path he faces to 270 electoral votes.The line is a big hit with voters.
Don Byers, 80, a Korean and Vietnam veteran, recalled that when Mr. Romney reassured the audience Thursday morning that he was going to be president, "the crowd roared."
So what did his wife, Joyce Byers, 80, think?
"Hope," she said emphatically. "We hope that he does, hope that he makes it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ammunition for a Trade War Between U.S. and Mexico

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM and ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
Estimates are that nearly one out of two tomatoes eaten in the United States comes from Mexico -- a statistic Florida growers would like to change, even at the risk of a trade war.
On Thursday, they got a reason to hope.
The United States Department of Commerce signaled then that it might be willing to end a 16-year-old agreement between the United States and some Mexican growers that has kept the price of Mexican tomatoes relatively low for American consumers. American tomato growers say the price has been so low that they can barely compete.
Within hours of the American action, Mexico threatened to retaliate, claiming that the Obama administration was trying to placate farmers in an important swing state. The Mexican government has support from seemingly unlikely backers in the United States: the big box stores like Walmart, which fear they will have to raise their prices, and other commodity producers, who worry that their products will be caught in a trade war.
''It will be very unfortunate if this devolves into a shooting war because this becomes a tit-for-tat and in the end, nobody wins,'' said John Keeling, chief executive of the National Potato Council. 
As part of a complex arrangement dating to 1996, the United States has established a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes can enter the American market. Over the years, Florida's tomato sales have dropped as low as $250 million annually, from as much as $500 million, according to Reggie Brown, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange, which has led the push to rescind the agreement. The state is the country's largest producer of fresh market tomatoes, followed by California.
In the meantime, Bruno Ferrari, the economy minister of Mexico, said the value of Mexico's tomato exports to the United States had more than tripled to $1.8 billion since the agreement was signed, and the tomato industry there supports 350,000 jobs. Producers of other commodities and big retailers still have stark memories of the high tariffs Mexico slapped on United States producers of potatoes, pork and toilet paper -- $2.4 billion worth of goods -- during a trade fight over trucking that began in 2009 and ended last year.
In the first year of the trucking fight, potato exports to Mexico fell more than 35 percent and growers lost $64 million in revenue as Mexicans shifted buying to Canada, Mr. Keeling said.
An analysis by an economist at Iowa State suggests that pork producers, who also lost money during the trucking trade fight, would lose about $14 an animal if Mexico imposed similar tariffs on pork now, said Nick Giordano, vice president at the National Pork Producers Council.
''We're already having one of the worst financial periods ever because of high grain prices, and if we were to lose a major market like Mexico, it would be like Armageddon,'' Mr. Giordano said.
Mr. Ferrari said Mexico was prepared to take all retaliatory measures available under the law. He warned that a final ruling against Mexico could also jeopardize talks over other trade disputes between the two countries.
The Mexicans say they fear that ending the agreement will clear the way for American growers to file formal complaints accusing the Mexicans of unfair trade practices, which they did repeatedly before the agreement.
Thursday's announcement came as Mexican tomato producers prepared to meet with officials at the Commerce Department on Friday to propose new terms to sweeten the agreement. The growers have said they are willing to accept a higher floor price for their tomatoes, expand the number of growers in the agreement and establish new measures to enforce the deal.
''We're disappointed. We're confused. We're frustrated. We're angry,'' said Martin Ley, vice president of Del Campo Supreme, a family business that exported $60 million in tomatoes to the United States and Canada last year. ''We don't understand where this is going and where this is coming from.''
Robert S. LaRussa, a lawyer who represents Mr. Ley and other growers from Sinaloa, the largest exporting state, said it was an ''insult'' for the Commerce Department to make its announcement a day before their meeting. He noted that more than 300 letters had been filed in favor of maintaining the agreement.
''They need to take into account much more than the interests of five or six families in Florida,'' Mr. LaRussa said.
The Mexicans argue that they are under attack for producing a better product. They say they have invested heavily in new types of tomatoes, in greenhouses and in sophisticated agricultural techniques to improve productivity and quality.
The Mexicans say Florida tomatoes are picked green and then gassed with ethylene to turn them red, but tomatoes grown in Sinaloa ripen on the vine, which accounts for the explosion in vine-ripened tomatoes sold in American grocery stores.
The risk of hurricanes in Florida makes it harder for growers there to set up greenhouse cultivation, though growers elsewhere do not have that concern.
Mr. Brown, of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said he could not envision anything that the Mexicans could offer that would make the agreement palatable to the American growers.
The public has 40 days to comment to the Commerce Department after Thursday's announcement is printed in The Federal Register, probably sometime next week, and the department has to make a decision in May.
The Mexicans -- and many others -- speculated that Florida's role in the coming elections may have had something to do with the timing of the proposal.
''This is a debate being fought out in the context of this presidential election, and Florida is one of those swing states,'' said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy at the Treasury Department. ''But we also have a lot of fish to fry with Mexico, a lot of reasons to maintain better relations there.''
The 1996 agreement suspended an investigation that began as a result of a dumping complaint filed by tomato growers in the United States against their Mexican counterparts in 1996, after the North American Free Trade Agreement eliminated tariffs on Mexican tomatoes. The complaint accused the Mexican growers of selling tomatoes at an unfair price. Antidumping regulations forbid an exporter to sell products abroad at so low a price that the producer loses money while the goods flood another country's market.
The Commerce Department will decide whether to lift the suspension permanently, ending the investigation and the agreement.
The agreement, which has been amended since it was struck, sets the floor price for Mexican tomatoes at 17 cents a pound in the summer and 21.6 cents in the winter. American growers say they cannot compete at that price.
Mr. Hufbauer said American companies typically sought to end such agreements because they planned to file new dumping charges, hoping for better terms.
''The only strategy we have right now is to get out of a deal that is the only trade agreement I know of in history where the restricted party is more concerned with it staying in place than the domestic industry,'' Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Nod to Obama By Netanyahu On Iran Bomb

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE and DAVID E. SANGER; Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Jodi Rudoren and Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Steven Lee Myers from New York.

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told the United Nations on Thursday that Iran's capability to enrich uranium must be stopped before next spring or early summer, arguing that by that time the country will be in a position to make a short, perhaps undetectable, sprint to manufacture its first nuclear weapon.
In his speech at the annual General Assembly, Mr. Netanyahu dramatically illustrated his intention to shut down Iran's nuclear program by drawing a red line through a cartoonish diagram of a bomb. But the substance of his speech suggested a softening of what had been a difficult dispute with the Obama administration on how to confront Iran over its nuclear program.
Only two weeks after that dispute broke into the open, Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday praised the warning Mr. Obama gave Iran in his own General Assembly speech on Tuesday. 
''I very much appreciate the president's position, as does everyone in my country,'' he said. The Israeli leader's speech also suggested that his deadline for a military strike was well past the American presidential election and into 2013 -- perhaps as late as next summer.
Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC that was broadcast on Sept. 16 that he believed Iran was six months from amassing most of the enriched uranium needed for a bomb. ''You have to place that red line before them now,'' he said. But his speech on Thursday was more explicit about his time frame for a military strike.
While such a strike seemed like a receding possibility in recent weeks, it had remained a possible ''October surprise'' that worried the White House and military planners.
Mr. Netanyahu's softened tone may also have also reflected Israel's reading of the American presidential polls, which have shown Mr. Obama's lead widening somewhat since the prime minister's harsh words in mid-September, when he said the United States had no ''moral right'' to hold back Israel from taking action against Iran because the Obama administration refused to set its own red line.
''It seems that Netanyahu's Iran policy is becoming more Obama-friendly,'' Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-Israeli lecturer at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel, said in an e-mailed reaction to Mr. Netanyahu's speech.
''What was most impressive was that he drew a red line, without committing himself to it,'' Mr. Javedanfar said. ''He also did it in a way which takes the pressure off Obama, illustrated by the fact that he pushed back the timelines to next year.''
Michael Herzog, a former chief of staff to Israel's defense minister and an Israel-based fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said it was implicit in Mr. Netanyahu's remarks that ''there are six or seven months more to continue to pressure the Iranians. The international buzz before was that Israel had to act before the November elections.''
Mr. Netanyahu's speech also came against a backdrop of revived international diplomacy with Iran, which has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful. Foreign ministers from the so-called P5-plus-1 group of countries -- the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany -- met to discuss how to advance negotiations with Iran that have been stalled since June.
''All of the ministers were unified in their belief that diplomacy is the much preferred way forward,'' a senior Obama administration official said after the meeting.
A new report by Israel's Foreign Ministry calls for another round of sanctions against Iran, seemingly another acknowledgement by the Israelis that there might be time to stop its rival's nuclear program by means other than military action.
The report, published on Thursday by the newspaper Haaretz, states that the international sanctions already imposed are having a deep effect on Iran's economy, and may, according to some assessments, also be affecting the stability of the Iranian government. But because the sanctions have not persuaded Tehran to suspend the program, the report concludes, ''another round of sanctions is needed.''
Much of Mr. Netanyahu's speech was devoted to what he described as the existential and increasingly ominous threat that would be posed by a nuclear-armed Iran, which he equated to a nuclear-armed Al Qaeda. He portrayed a Middle East increasingly in the hands of Islamic radicals, many threatening Israel's existence.
But it was his description of Iran's nuclear progress that was at the heart of his speech. Perhaps mindful of the experience of former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who laid out an ultimately flawed case against Iraq nine years ago, Mr. Netanyahu revealed no new intelligence -- he just urged his audience to do some math based on the public findings of inspectors.
With an almost professorial air, Mr. Netanyahu held up a diagram of a bomb with a fuse to show the Israeli view of Iran's progress in achieving the ability to make a nuclear weapon. He drew a red line through the point at which Iran would have amassed enough medium-enriched uranium to make a bomb -- which he said would be in the spring or summer of 2013.
His calculus turned on a stockpile of medium enriched uranium -- uranium enriched to the level of 20 percent -- that Iran has produced, ostensibly to fuel a research reactor, provided to the country by the United States in the days of the shah. Right now, Iran does not possess enough of that fuel to make a single weapon. In fact, its stockpile of it has declined in recent months, as it has converted some for the research reactor.
But based on current production rates, Mr. Netanyahu said it would have enough in its stockpile by the middle of next year, a conclusion shared by many nuclear experts who have examined the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Obama administration does not dispute Mr. Netanyahu's math, but it does challenge his logic. Its officials, in background conversations, have insisted that if Iran wanted to convert its uranium to bomb-grade fuel, which is much higher purity than 20 percent, it would have to throw out the nuclear inspectors and take steps that would be easily detectable.
''We'd almost certainly see it,'' one of Mr. Obama's top advisers said two weeks ago.
Mr. Netanyahu challenged that assessment in his speech, asserting that the actual assembly of a bomb could be done clandestinely anywhere in Iran.
''Do we want to risk the security of the world on the assumption that we would find in time a small workshop in a country half the size of Europe?'' he asked.
In response to Mr. Netanyahu's speech. Iran again denied what it called ''baseless and absurd allegations'' that it is seeking a nuclear weapon and insisted the goals of its nuclear program are ''exclusively peaceful.'' But Iranian officials, including President Ahmadinejad." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_%3cb%3eahmadinejad%3c/b%3e/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have declined to rule out the possibility that Iran would continue producing 20 percent uranium, even though it has now made enough to keep its medical reactor running for the next 6 to 10 years. And in its statement Thursday night it reserved its ''full right to retaliate with force against any attacks''
Mr. Netanyahu also used his speech as a rejoinder to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who earlier had harshly denounced Israel from the General Assembly podium.
Mr. Abbas said he believed that Israel intended to destroy the basis for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. He also declared his intention to pursue full-member status at the United Nations as an alternative path to statehood, an effort begun last year that has faltered because of Israeli and American objections.

HEADLINE: California Issues 10,000th Rebate for Zero-Emissions Incentive Program

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The 10,000th rebate was claimed by the buyer of a 2012 Nissan Leaf. 

 BODY:
Start undressing California's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, a program intended to spur the sales and leases of zero-emission vehicles, and front-page topics come into view -- reduction of greenhouse gases and job creation chief among them. So when the program recorded its 10,000th rebate earlier this month, it merited some pomp.
Natasha Casteel of Meadow Vista, Calif, was recognized on Friday as the state's 10,000th owner of a ZEV. A librarian for the city of Roseville, Ms. Casteel said in a telephone interview that she used to drive a 2003 Volkswagen Passat for her 48-mile round-trip commute. Saying she wanted to "greatly improve" on that car's fuel economy, she sought out the purely electric Nissan Leaf.
The state's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project began in 2008 as part of a broader mission to push innovation in the transportation sector. To spur sales of E.V.'s, the state provides a $2,500 rebate on either a lease or purchase of an eligible vehicle, which can be combined with a maximum federal tax credit of $7,500.
When she learned a charging station was located essentially right outside her office door, Ms. Casteel bought the Leaf, one of the more than 15 eligible vehicles under the program. "The rebate process was very simple, because the $7,500 was provided up front to reduce the cost directly, then the $2,500 was the rebate check coming from California," Ms. Casteel said. "It was all handled by the dealer, except for the $2,500. I just had to fill out an online form and they e-mailed me. It was easy."
Ease of use was a critical consideration for the state's Air Resources Board, the body charged with ensuring the quality of the state's air. "Our goal here in California is to reduce greenhouse gases. Passenger vehicles account for about 28 percent of our gases," Cassandra Hockenson, a spokeswoman for the board, known as ARB, said in an interview. "The purpose of the program is to get people to take that leap and buy these vehicles and see how wonderful they are and what they can do."
"We are saying, 'We know this is new, we know you're not comfortable and that it's a whole different ballgame, so we want to give you an incentive to jump into this ring and see what you think,'" Ms. Hockenson added.
The California Center for Sustainable Energy is responsible for collecting rebate forms and ensuring criteria are met. According to the center, private individuals account for 88 percent of rebate funds, with nonprofits, government agencies and businesses claiming the remainder. Roughly $16 million remains to be distributed, but the California Energy Commission has committed up to $5 million in additional financing, according to ARB.
A study by the California Electric Transportation Coalition concluded industries involved in the production of E.V.'s could create almost 100,000 additional jobs in the state by 2030.
"When we have new opportunities, we have new jobs. And the project helps people buy these vehicles, who maybe normally couldn't, and the more people who buy them, the more the cost goes down," Ms. Hockenson said. "And as more people buy them, we get more infrastructure."
Infrastructure, most notably the availability of charging stations, was an important factor for Ms. Casteel in her purchase decision.
"I think people would buy more electric cars if there was more charging infrastructure, and that would really help remove any range anxiety they have," Ms. Casteel said, echoing a sentiment expressed on Monday by Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, in statements about his ambitionsto create a nationwide network of charging stations for Tesla vehicles.
"At the library, I'm the only employee who has one, but as my husband says, 'You don't really want to advertise it's an electric car, because everyone will get one and you'll have to wait in line to charge,'" Ms. Casteel said.

HEADLINE: The 'Illegal' Trap

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: Is the term 'illegal' immigrant improper, or useful? 

 BODY:
A vigorous discussion is taking place online about the word "illegal" as an adjective for certain immigrants. An immigrant activist named Jose Antonio Vargas, a former reporter, is urging news organizations like The New York Times to stop using it. He says the word is inaccurate, improper and demeaning.
The Times's public editor, Margaret Sullivan (an independent voice who writes about The Times but is not part of its news or opinion operations), has been looking into this, interviewing editors and reporters and soliciting readers' opinions. She says she will weigh in soon.
I figured I should, too, because I have thought about "illegal" a lot (I write immigration editorials). Five years ago I wrote an Editorial Observer called "What Part of 'Illegal' Don't You Understand?" explaining why I didn't like the word, but used it anyway. Not surprisingly, the article didn't settle the debate. It's still going around, in circles.

Those who agree with Mr. Vargas say "illegal" should be banned because it suggests that "illegal immigrants" are criminals, which often isn't true. No human being is illegal, they say.
Those who disagree say Mr. Vargas is trying to whitewash the truth. Words like "undocumented" ignore the fact that the people so described have broken the law.
As so often happens in the immigration debate, these people end up talking past one other. (Look at the comments on Ms. Sullivan's blog, and the ones that I expect will attach to this post.)
I'm in roughly the same spot I was in five years ago: I use "illegal" somewhat interchangeably with "undocumented," recognizing that both words are imperfect. I also use "unauthorized," which is unfamiliar and a little clunky, but has a distinct advantage: while it acknowledges the unlawfulness of someone's immigration status, it also recognizes that this status can be fixed.
This is where "illegal" causes the most trouble, and where I find myself empathizing with Mr. Vargas. What bothers both of us is the way "illegal" in "illegal immigrant" defines an entire person, not merely an unlawful act. It taints everything that person does, and suggests an irreparable offense. How do you legalize an illegal person?
This is what many people can't get their heads around, and why the simple act of legalization through punishment and reparation - paying a fine and back taxes, getting to the back of the citizenship line - is unthinkable to them.
And if immigrants are "illegal," then it follows that they don't deserve legal protections. You can do anything you want to them - abuse them, insult and berate them, arrest and detain them, split up their families - because their "illegality" severs them from any rights. That's the argument used in Arizona and Alabama, and it has the advantage of being easy to understand.
As one of my immigration-activist sources says, it's very hard to fight for civil rights and fair treatment for "illegal immigrants" because you can never complete the sentence "Illegal immigrants should ."
Of course they shouldn't - they're illegal!
The word turns 11 million people into a suspect class of quasi-criminals. It is a class-action adjective. It is the reason the country has not yet passed sweeping immigration reform, which in theory should be an easy thing to do - it's a simple reordering of the labor market with the labor supply. How many visas do we need? Let's get them. How many people work off the books and owe back taxes? Let's bring them out of the shadows and allow them to earn legal status-- by meeting reasonable conditions, like learning English and waiting until the legal immigration backlogs are cleared. You deal with lawbreakers as you always do - by giving them a chance for restitution, with penalties, fines and other punishments that are proportional to the offense. You recognize that the vast majority of "illegal immigrants" had no criminal intent, but are aspiring workers who have a critically important place in the economy and society at large, as employees, entrepreneurs, taxpayers, parents - and as Americans-to-be.
Here's what's so frustrating: The word I find necessary is also one that is powerfully useful - for the reasons above - to the many passionate participants in the immigration debate who don't want any "illegals" to ever become "legal."
These are the people who hate pressing "1" for English. They are the anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Numbers USA and the Center for Immigration Studies, created by a zero-population-growth zealot named John Tanton. Those groups have distanced themselves from their founder's xenophobia, but are pursuing his dream of lower immigration rates and increased deportation, and staunchly oppose any and all legalization programs, which they deride as "amnesty for illegals."
And then there are the racists, who see "illegal immigrant" as shorthand for "Latino." For them "illegal" is a perfect slur, because it cloaks their bigotry with the sheen of virtue. People who hate immigrants can fling "illegal" as viciously and effectively as the N-word - and I have heard them do this at rallies on street corners in Phoenix- and yet when they do, they do so indignantly, taking great offense if anyone suggests their words were motivated not by scrupulosity about the law, but by hatred.
All the while, people like me keep trying to use "illegal immigrant" dispassionately, to describe someone from another country who enters this one without permission, who has no legal right to be here, no documents conferring authorized status, whose presence poses a challenge to the economy and society.
The United States has absorbed wave upon wave of people who fit that exact definition. The first ones wore big black shoes and buckles on their hats. We mark their arrival every year with a celebration of America's first great immigrant amnesty, also called "Thanksgiving."
Maybe Mr. Vargas and others will succeed in driving out "illegal." It won't be the first time a word has become defunct through misuse or changing times. Many a well-meaning person has innocently used words like "Negro" and "retarded," for example, and one is long gone, the other (I hope) is on the way out.
But a change in usage won't necessarily change hearts. As the linguist and former senator S.I. Hayakawa used to say, the word is not the thing, the map is not the territory, the symbol is not the thing symbolized. "You don't change the word, you change the attitude," Mr. Hayakawa said.

HEADLINE: Reviewing the Tesla Model S

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The automobile has not undergone a fundamental change in design or use since Henry Ford introduced the Model T, but the Tesla Model S has the potential to be a game-changer. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, Bradley Berman reviews the 2012 Tesla Model S in a more thorough manner than any other journalist has yet. 
In addition to driving the electric sport sedan in the vicinity of his home in Northern California, he takes his test car, fitted with a 362-horsepower drivetrain and 85-kilowatt-hour battery pack, from the north shore of Lake Tahoe to Tesla's design studios in Southern California, driving 531 electric-only miles in a single day.
Along the route Mr. Berman avails himself of charging stations erected by Tesla in strategic locations around the state, a process he also describes in Sunday's Automobiles section.
Mr. Berman has quibbles with the rear lighting, impractical sun visors and a lack of grab handles above the doors for passengers. Beyond these, however, he finds the Model S to produce a thrill that -- if it can be transferred to higher-volume, lower-price vehicles -- could very well be game-changing for the industry.
Read the entire review, check out the slide show and share your thoughts on the Model S in the comments.

HEADLINE: Redistribution of Wealth in America

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The United States has a long history of redistribution of wealth for the social good, and the real debate about it needs to focus on the levels at which it should kick in, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. 
A recent article in The Washington Post and an audio clip accompanying it on the Web featured an excerpt from a speech in 1998 by Barack Obama, then an Illinois state senator, at Loyola University Chicago. 
In that speech he remarked, "I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot."
The article then quotes Mitt Romney: "I know there are some who believe that if you simply take from some and give to others then we'll all be better off. It's known as redistribution. It's never been a characteristic of America."
Really?

Aside from hard-core libertarians, who view the sanctity of justly begotten private property as the overarching social value and any form of coerced redistribution as unjust, how many Americans on the left and right of the political spectrum would disagree with Mr. Obama's very general and cautiously phrased statement? 
In fact, I wonder whether even Governor Romney actually disagrees with that general statement, aside from some dispute over "the certain level" at which redistribution takes place. After all, he has promised elderly voters to protect the highly redistributive Medicare program, which would remain highly redistributive, or become more so, under proposals by his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, for restructuring Medicare. 
The fact is that redistributive government policy - mainly through benefits-in-kind programs, agricultural policy and the like - has been very much a characteristic of American life, just as it has been in every economically developed nation, albeit at different levels. 
Start at the local level. Through property taxes, local governments all over the United States routinely take from high-income Americans living in expensive houses to subsidize the education of children from lower-income families. It is the American way, based on the widespread belief that doing so will make society as a whole better off. Is there a significantly large constituency for abolishing this form of redistribution at the local level and instead letting every family fend for itself, with its own budget, in a private market for education? 
The same can be said, at the local level, for fire and police protection. One could imagine a world in which every family cuts a deal with private contractors to provide fire and police protection - leaving poor neighborhoods to fend for themselves - but that is just not an American characteristic. Is there a sizable constituency in America for completely privatizing local fire and police protection?
At the state level, consider Medicaid. By design, Medicaid is purely redistributive. It takes from higher-income people at the state and federal levels and pays fully for the health care of low-income people. Is there a strong constituency for abolishing Medicaid and letting the poor, when they are ill, fend for themselves in the market for health care? 
Or take public colleges and universities. Although tuition has increased in past years, these institutions are still heavily supported by the states and charge tuition much below the full cost of the education they impart. 
At the federal level, Social Security and Medicare were deliberately structured by their designers to be in part redistributive. As Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso of the Urban Institute's Retirement Project have reported, both programs redistribute from retirees who had been high-income earners in their work years to those who had been low-income earners. 
Would elimination of this redistributive feature inherent in Social Security and especially in Medicare have much of a political constituency today? Would any politician dare propose openly - and I stress openly - that Medicare beneficiaries who had been high-income earners in their work years should have a health care experience superior to those who had low incomes in their work years? Would that proposal be a winner this year?
By the way their benefits and the financing of these benefits are structured, Social Security and Medicare also redistribute income from the current working population collectively to the currently retired population collectively. Is that fair?
In thinking about this issue, keep in mind that a young generation about to enter the workplace has, for a fifth to a quarter of a century, been the beneficiary of huge transfers of human and nonhuman capital. Overwhelmingly, they have taken from society and not contributed to it.
By human capital economists mean the education and training that foster in the young marketable skills that can be traded for cash at the workplace. Although, unlike students in many other countries, American students do contribute significantly to the financing of their human capital - at the college and postgraduate levels - the production of their human capital remains very heavily subsidized by the preceding generational cohorts. Charge the total value of that transfer to an intergenerational account.
Charge to it next the nonhuman capital transferred to the young. This includes the vast array of physical structures built and largely financed by preceding generations, transferred virtually free of charge to the younger generation for its use, along with the scientific knowledge and the blueprints for applied technology developed and financed by previous generations but available, again largely free of charge, as an economic platform for the younger generation.
I believe the designers of Social Security and Medicare were mindful of this vast redistribution of assets to the young when they embedded in these programs a social contract creating a reverse redistribution from the young to the old during the latter's retirement years. 
These designers seem also to have kept in mind that future generations benefit greatly from the secular increase in overall productivity in the economy. It can reasonably be assumed that future long-run growth in real gross domestic product per capita will be 1 to 2 percent a year. At only 1 percent, real G.D.P. per capita in 2050 will be about 46 percent larger than it is today. At 2 percent growth, it will be more than twice as large. 
At issue between the two political camps in this election season, then, is not redistribution per se, which is as American as apple pie. Rather, at issue is the "certain level" to which that redistribution is to be pushed. An honest and thoughtful debate on that would certainly be useful at this time. It would be useful at any time. 
To be respectful to voters, such a debate should proceed at a level concrete enough to allow voters - or at least researchers and news organizations - to estimate fairly precisely how different families would fare under the different visions of that "certain level." 
It is the minimum voters ought to expect from political candidates.

HEADLINE: Sept. 27: The Impact of the '47 Percent'

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: By the time the "47 percent" video came to public attention, President Obama's convention momentum appeared to have stalled. But he has gained ground in the polls since then. 

 BODY:
After a secretly recorded videotape was released on Sept. 17 showing Mitt Romney making unflattering comments about the "47 percent" of Americans who he said had become dependent on government benefits, I suggested on Twitter that the political impact of the comments could easily be overstated. 
"Ninety percent of 'game-changing' gaffes are less important in retrospect than they seem in the moment," I wrote. 
But was this one of the exceptional cases? A week and a half has passed since Mr. Romney's remarks became known to the public -- meaning that there's been enough time to evaluate their effect on the polls.There's a case to be made that they did damage Mr. Romney's standing some.
In the chart below, I've tracked the progress of the national popular vote in the FiveThirtyEight "now-cast" over the past five weeks. The "now-cast" reflects our best estimate of what would happen in an election held today, based on a combination of recent national and state polls. Unlike our Nov. 6 forecast, the "now-cast" does not account for economic measures, and it does not adjust for the effect of the party conventions. This makes it a little bit more straightforward to interpret in terms of tracking the progress of the polls in real time.

In the chart, I've highlighted the dates of what are probably the four most important political news events of the last month: the Republican and Democratic conventions; the deaths of four Americans in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya; and the release of the "47 percent" tape.
The first of these events, the Republican National Convention, did not produce much in the way of a discernible change in the "now-cast." My view is that Mr. Romney probably did receive a bounce in his polls, but it was small and short-lived, since the Democratic convention began only a few days after the Republican one ended. The "now-cast" is trained not to overreact to modest changes in the polls, and so it had trouble distinguishing any convention bounce for Mr. Romney from statistical noise.
The Democratic convention, however, did produce a clear (if quite middling by historical standards) bounce in the polls for President Obama. He went from being 1.4 percentage points ahead in the "now-cast" popular vote when his convention began, to four points ahead a week after it ended, once there had been time for it to work its way through the polls. 
It's not clear whether the Libya attacks had any impact on the polls, despite the news media judging Mr. Romney's reaction to them very harshly (while spending less time scrutinizing a potential security lapse on the part of Mr. Obama's administration). 
By Sept. 17, the date when the video of Mr. Romney's remarks was released and received widespread attention, the momentum from Mr. Obama's convention appeared to have stalled (although not necessarily reversed itself). Mr. Obama led in the popular vote by 4.1 percentage points on that date, according to the "now-cast." 
Since then, however, Mr. Obama has gained further ground in the polls. As of Thursday, he led in the popular vote by 5.7 percentage points in the "now-cast," a gain of 1.6 percentage points since Mr. Romney's remarks became known to the public.
It's hard to tell whether this recent gain for Mr. Obama reflects the effect of the "47 percent" comments specifically. But the most typical pattern after a party convention is that a candidate who gains ground in the polls cedes at least some of it back. 
Instead, the more pertinent question seems not whether Mr. Obama is losing ground, but whether he is still gaining it. 
 Thursday's Polls 
What we can say with more confidence is that Mr. Romney is now in a rather poor position in the polls. In three of the four national tracking surveys published on Thursday, Mr. Romney trailed by margins of six, seven and eight percentage points. He also trailed by five percentage points in a one-off survey published by Fox News. The exception was Thursday's Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, which showed the race in an exact tie, although that was improvement for Mr. Obama from a two-point deficit on Wednesday.
The state polling published on Thursday was more of a mixed bag. Mr. Obama led by seven points in an NBC News-Marist College survey of New Hampshire, a strong but not extraordinary result for him. He also led by two points in a Marist poll of North Carolina, continuing a streak of stronger polling for him in that state. For the first time all year, Mr. Obama is listed as the favorite in North Carolina in the "now-cast" -- although he still trails slightly in the Nov. 6 forecast, which expects his numbers to decline some between now and Election Day. 
However, Mr. Obama got middling results in a Suffolk University poll of Virginia, which put him ahead by 2 points, and in the Marist poll of Nevada, which also had him up by 2. Perhaps it's damning Mr. Romney with faint praise to describe swing-state polls in which he trailed as constituting "good" news for him -- but these surveys were a little bit better for Mr. Romney than other swing-state polls in recent days.
There were also a series of partisan-tinged polls released on Thursday: in Mr. Romney's case, a poll by Voter Consumer Research in Iowa for the Web site The Iowa Republican, which showed him leading by one point in that state; and for Mr. Obama, a series of polls conducted by Public Policy Polling on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Ohio and other swing states. 
We have taken a rather inclusive attitude toward which polls are included in the forecast this year -- excluding only those conducted directly on behalf of the campaigns, or by "super PACs" very closely associated with them like Priorities USA Action. The philosophy here is that persistent bias in these polls will be corrected for by our "house effects" adjustment, and that there is little merit in making overly fine distinctions about which polls qualify as partisan and which don't. There are nominally nonpartisan polls that have strong house effects -- and arguably partisan ones that normally play it pretty straight. Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend that you rely on these borderline cases to tell you much about the momentum in the race.
The overall story line, however, is fairly clear: Mr. Romney is at best holding ground in the polls, and quite possibly losing some, at a time when he needs to be gaining it instead. Further, it's increasingly implausible for Mr. Romney to attribute the numbers to temporary effects from the Democratic convention. Mr. Obama's probability of winning the Electoral College advanced to 83.9 percent in the Nov. 6 forecast, up from 81.9 percent on Wednesday.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to the organization on whose behalf Public Policy Polling conducted a series of polls in Ohio and other swing states. It was the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the National Resource Defense Council.

HIGHLIGHT: The Day: New Yorkers love few things more than to hate the United Nations, and they really love to hate it in a week like this one, when world leaders convened for the General Assembly. 

 BODY:
 Here in the "capital of the world," which is New York's characteristically modest description of itself, people seem to have survived their annual immersion in foreign affairs with but the faintest disruption to their lives. We knew all along that they could do it, despite the overblown forecasts of impending disaster, including the menace they were instructed by television to dread most of all: traffic jams. 
 What tends to be forgotten by many New Yorkers - including, and perhaps especially, their politicians - is that the only reason their city dares call itself the "capital of the world" without being laughed out of the room is the presence of the United Nations. 
 The United Nations adds a few billion dollars a year to the local economy, while its noxious aspects are eminently ignorable most of the time. Despite that reality, New Yorkers love few things more than to hate the United Nations. 
 They really love to hate it in a week like the one that is drawing to a close, when world leaders appeared by the barrelful for their autumnal gabfest, generally referred to in polite circles as the convening of the General Assembly. 
 They really and truly and deeply love to hate it when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the bile-spewing president of Iran with one of the creepiest smiles this side of the Joker, shows up, as he does each September, to take his turn at the lectern. 
 Another reality is that there is no way for the United States to deny entry to Mr. Ahmadinejad - A-jad to some - without causing more of a diplomatic tempest than he is probably worth. Part of the price of having the United Nations headquarters here is an obligation to open the gates even to loathed leaders wishing to attend these sessions.
 So the week played out pretty much according to a dog-eared script. Street protesters and tabloid crafters of hyperthyroidic headlines denounced A-jad in the strongest language possible, and could thus feel good about themselves. He, no doubt caring not a fig what his critics said, got to give his speech (described by some who heard it as not so much vile as incoherent). New York police officers got to put in for welcome overtime. And nothing changed as a result of all this to make the Middle East a better, or at least a less volatile, region. 
 In short, everything went as usual. 
 In some quarters, there was extra hyperventilating this year because A-jad was assigned a speaking slot on Wednesday, which happened to be Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day. Given the man's threats against Israel and his denial of the Holocaust, this bit of scheduling struck some as unbearably outrageous. 
 Never mind that it wasn't Yom Kippur at the United Nations. Never mind that 26 countries besides Iran were assigned speaking slots that day, including several with deplorable histories in regard to Jews, among them Yemen, Egypt, Italy, Poland, Ukraine and Romania. Never mind, too, that Israel has suffered, and survived, a good deal worse on Yom Kippur than a rotten speech - like the start of an Arab war against it in 1973.
 Some of those with Yom Kippur shpilkes, a splendid Yiddish word for a state of agitation, were similarly bent out of shape because President Obama did not meet with the visiting Israeli prime minister, .
 Back to the never minds. Never mind that the president had another pressing matter on his agenda, an imminent election, and had no time for extensive conversations with any of the visiting leaders.
 That notwithstanding, lamentations arose from some whose worldview boils down to a belief that the president of the United States should nod his agreement with whatever the Israeli prime minister says. He is "throwing Israel under the bus," they cried. This is a damnation often hurled at Mr. Obama, oddly so. His administration is no different from its predecessors in not only riding the same bus as Israel but also in providing a good deal of fuel for it, in the form of billions of dollars a year in economic and military aid.
 Anyway, Mr. Netanyahu, after giving his own speech at the United Nations on Thursday, got to meet with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at Gracie Mansion. Surely that was reward enough for anyone.

HEADLINE: The Debate Expectations Dance

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Presidential debates are coming up, and it's time to lower expectations for your campaign and raise the bar for your opponent. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - Ripping the stuffing out of your opponent means it is another day on the campaign trail.
But suddenly changing course to praise the other guy's experience, know-how and oratorical brilliance can mean only one thing: Presidential debates are coming up, and it is time to lower expectations for your campaign and raise the bar for your opponent. This way viewers will be unexpectedly surprised and score your candidate the winner. 
Thus on Thursday did a senior adviser to Mitt Romney declare President Obama "a uniquely gifted speaker" and "one of the most talented political communicators in modern history.''
The adviser, Beth Myers, wrote in a memo to Republican surrogates that for Mr. Obama the first debate with Mr. Romney on Wednesday "will be the eighth one-on-one presidential debate of his political career."
"For Mitt Romney, it will be his first," she added in the memo, first obtained by CNN. 
Do not try selling that story to Mr. Obama's team. The president's senior adviser David Axelrod made excuses that Mr. Obama has been too busy running the country to prepare for a debate and painted a gloomy scenario. 
"First, just as he was in the primaries, we expect Mitt Romney to be a prepared, disciplined and aggressive debater," Mr. Axelrod wrote in a memo on Friday to "interested parties.'' "Second, debates - and particularly the first debate - generally favor challengers. Five out of the last six challengers were perceived to win the first debate against an incumbent president."
Twisting the knife of sky-high expectations, Mr. Axelrod added, "Maybe this is why the Romney campaign has so confidently predicted for months that he will turn in a campaign-changing performance such as Ronald Reagan's in 1980."
Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, wrote in a memo last week of Mr. Romney, "He's quick, polished and ready with a punch attack against the president."
And Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who fired up Democrats at their convention last month, was suddenly not so optimistic this week, predicting flat-out "the president is going to lose the first debate next week."
"Mark my words," Ms. Granholm said on her Current TV show, "The War Room." "First off, he's obviously a brilliant man, but the president is not a great debater. You know it, you saw him hemming and hawing in debates four years ago."
It is enough to make one think both candidates are spending the days ticking down to the first of three debates, in Denver, cowering under their beds. Do not believe it. Both are burrowing into their studies like the overachievers each has always been. Mr. Obama plans to spend three days beginning Sunday hunkered down and preparing for the debate in Henderson, Nev., outside Las Vegas. And although Mr. Romney is already a seasoned veteran of 20 primary debates, he attended a presidential "debate camp" in Vermont while the Democrats held their national convention last month, and he conducted five mock debates over two days recently, according to reports. 
Parodying the quadrennial habit of lowering expectations, Ben White of Politico wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "Pre-debate flak spin: 'I'll just be happy if my guy doesn't vomit blood and flat out murder our opponent with an ax.' "
The praise for opponents is no more sincere than Br'er Rabbit's pleas not to be tossed into the briar patch. In the same memos hailing their opponents, both campaign advisers went on to explain why no matter what happens in the debates, their candidate will ultimately trounce his opponent. 
"This election will not be decided by the debates, however," Ms. Myers wrote. "It will be decided by the American people. Regardless of who comes out on top in these debates, they know we can't afford another four years like the last four years."
And from Mr. Axelrod: "But in this debate, Americans will not be holding a scorecard to see who lands the most punches or who is quickest with the snappy sound bite. They'll be focused on what they have been throughout this campaign - who's going to lay out the most credible plan to create good-paying jobs for the middle class and to restore economic security?"
But please, don't hit me so hard.

HEADLINE: Romney Continues to Hit Obama on Defense Cuts and Foreign Policy

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking to his second military group in two days, Mitt Romney hammered President Obama over cuts to military spending, as well as of his handling of foreign policy issues. 

 BODY:
RADNOR TOWNSHIP, Pa. - Speaking to his second military group in two days, Mitt Romney on Friday hammered President Obama over cuts to military spending, as well as of his handling of foreign policy issues.
Before a backdrop of straight-backed, stone-faced cadets at Valley Forge Military Academy and College here, Mr. Romney returned to a criticism introduced earlier this week, over comments Mr. Obama made on "60 Minutes" in which he described recent developments in the Middle East as "bumps in the road."
"The other day the president said that, you know, he has a vision for what's going to happen in the Middle East, but that there are going to be bumps in the road along the way," Mr. Romney said. "You know, I don't consider 20- or 30,000 people dying in Syria just a bump in the road, or a Muslim brotherhood president in Egypt a bump in the road. I don't consider the killing of our diplomats in Libya a bump in the road, and I sure as heck don't consider Iran becoming nuclear a bump in the road."
He added: "We need someone who recognizes the seriousness of what's ahead and is willing to lead."

Turning to the topic of cuts to the defense budget, Mr. Romney told the cadets that he felt he would do more to help the military than Mr. Obama.
"I have to tell you that I don't know how a single person who goes to this institution could consider voting for the incumbent for president," he said. "And I say that for this reason: If they want to go into the military - why, he is planning on cutting our military by about a trillion dollars over the next decade."
The military spending cuts Mr. Romney was referring to are set to automatically occur if the president and Congress can't come to an agreement over alternate cuts to the budget, a fact the Obama campaign was quick to point out.
"Mitt Romney's campaign said that they wouldn't be dictated by fact checkers, and that much was clear from his remarks in Pennsylvania today," said Lis Smith, an Obama campaign spokeswoman. "He falsely accused the president of supporting automatic defense cuts that could be prevented if Republicans in Congress, including Romney's running mate, would drop their refusal to ask for a penny more from millionaires and billionaires."
Mr. Romney, who while campaigning in Ohio on Wednesday warned voters "don't be expecting a huge cut in taxes because I'm also going to lower deductions and exemptions," on Friday promised not to raise taxes on middle-income Americans. Mr. Obama, he said, "wants to raise the income tax."
"I don't want to raise taxes on the American people, not when our economy's in the kind of trouble it's in," Mr. Romney said. "I will not raise taxes on middle-income Americans."
The Obama campaign, however, promised to challenge Mr. Romney over his tax assertion, as well.
"He said he wouldn't raise taxes on the middle class, but independent, nonpartisan experts agree he'd have to raise taxes on middle-class families to pay for his $250,000 tax cuts for multimillionaires," Ms. Smith said. "In next week's debate, facts will matter - and Mitt Romney simply failed to meet the bar of honesty today."
Campaigning in Pennsylvania, a state where he trails in the polls, Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, ended his speech on a confident note.
"You know, I've got a little secret here and that is that the Obama campaign thinks Pennsylvania is in their pocket - they don't need to worry about it," Mr. Romney said, as the crowd booed. "And you're right and they're wrong we're going to win Pennsylvania. We are going to take the White House."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $17.5 Million

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A five-story Greek Revival-style house, with fireplaces and a roof deck, was owned by the "24" actor Kiefer Sutherland. 

 BODY:
Apparently bulletproof when it comes to investing in antique West Village real estate in need of renovation, Kiefer Sutherland, a k a the infamous Jack Bauer of "24" and presently starring in "Touch" on Fox television, has sold his five-story brick town house at 763 Greenwich Street for $17.5 million, in the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.
Mr. Sutherland, a practiced dabbler in the art of buying, enhancing and divesting himself of properties, bought the 1838 Greek Revival-style town house for $8.25 million in 2008. He promptly secured the design services of Steven Gambrel, who transformed nearly 5,000 square feet of raw space - the building had done duty as a six-unit apartment house in a previous life - into a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath residence of rugged elegance.
 As a result, Mr. Sutherland received his full asking price even as the town house was in the process of being formally listed by Meris and Kenny Blumstein of the Corcoran Group.
The initial bid held up, with the anonymous buyer of this distinctive residence protected by a limited-liability company with a relatively unimaginative name, 763 Greenwich. Then again, the entire real estate blogosphere seems hip to the fact that the Beverly Hills-based Dave T. Doglas Trust is a pseudonym for Mr. Sutherland, who is said to have been advised early on by his father, the actor Donald Sutherland, to invest the fruits of his Tinseltown labors in real estate rather than less tangible assets. Obviously the son has an eye for feathering special nests: he previously scored a nice profit when he sold his two-bedroom condominium at 134 West 10th Street.
The town house is rife with character. It has multiple old-fashioned wood-burning fireplaces, as well as a roof deck with a summer kitchen and an outdoor shower, a basement sauna, and a patio surrounding a fire pit (modern touches, but rustic). An internal elevator makes floor-to-floor ascension a snap. There are four bedrooms, each with an en-suite bath; in addition, the master suite takes up an entire floor and, naturally, offers his-and-hers baths, for the ultimate in privacy.
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Mets Post Third Consecutive Decline in Attendance

BYLINE: KEN BELSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Mets sold 2,242,803 tickets in 2012, 109,793 fewer than in 2011. 

 BODY:
During their meltdown after the All-Star Game, the Mets tried everything to get fans to go to Citi Field: T-shirts on Tuesdays, half-price tickets for those who brought Pepsi cans and free tickets for children.
In the end, the promotions did only so much. The Mets drew 4.7 percent fewer fans than in 2011, the third consecutive annual decline since moving into Citi Field. In all, the Mets sold 2,242,803 tickets, though how many were redeemed is unclear. At some games in the worst of the Mets' slide, Citi Field looked as empty as a movie theater on a sunny summer's day.
The team drew 109,793 fewer fans this year even though the Mets cut ticket prices in the off-season on more than 80 percent of seats. They also used a dynamic pricing model, which gave them the flexibility to raise or cut prices up to game time.
The team's performance, it seemed, trumped the values offered at the box office. With six games remaining - all on the road - the Mets appear almost certain to finish in fourth place for the fourth consecutive season. While the weak economy no doubt played a role in the decline in attendance, the Mets did not help matters. After a surprising first half, the team fell apart in July and played especially poorly at home, where they struggled to score.
The Mets were 36-45 at Citi Field, 10-25 after the All-Star break. The loss of Johan Santana and Dillon Gee from the starting rotation hurt, but so did an inconsistent bullpen and lackluster hitting by Jason Bay, Josh Thole, Andres Torres and others.
The Mets need to win five of the remaining six games to equal last year's 79-83 record.

HEADLINE: Sept. 28: A Circular Relationship Between Political and Economic Views

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: We often talk about the important role that the economy plays in the election. But Americans perceptions of the economy are also colored by their political views. 

 BODY:
President Obama's probability of winning the Electoral College fell slightly in Friday's FiveThirtyEight forecast, from 83.9 percent to 82.7 percent on Thursday.
Although Friday's polls were a bit more equivocal than on some recent days, the shift mainly came because of a decline in the FiveThirtyEight economic index, which continues to have some influence on the forecast.
A government report on Friday showed a decline in real personal income in August, one of the economic data series that the forecast model uses. Furthermore, the July personal income figures, which had initially looked quite positive, were revised downward to show slower income growth.
Real personal income is up 2 percent from one year ago, a below-average number, but one that roughly matches other economic figures. However, it had been flat to negative for much of 2011, and it has increased only at about the growth rate of the population over the whole course of Mr. Obama's term.
Another economic data series that the model uses, personal consumption expenditures, was also published on Friday and showed sluggish growth in consumer spending after adjusting for inflation. 
Numbers from the manufacturing sector have also been poorer lately, and this month's monthly jobs report was mediocre.
And yet, consumer confidence was up sharply this month across several surveys, reaching a four-month high in The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's monthly measurement of it.
What accounts for the discrepancy? Some of it might be in the timing: the reports on consumption and personal income covered August, whereas the consumer confidence surveys are quicker to update and instead reflect numbers for September. And there have been some recent positives in the economic data, like tentatively better numbers from the housing sector.
Politics undoubtedly also plays a part, however. We often talk about the important role that the economy plays in the election. But Americans perceptions of the economy are also colored by their political views.
Gallup, which tracks numbers on economic confidence daily, found a substantial increase in consumer confidence that was unmistakably timed to the Democratic convention. Most of the increase, however, was caused by Democrats, who now view the economy much more positively. The numbers also improved modestly among independent voters, but there was no improvement among Republicans. 
It seems that Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton were able to persuade some voters in their speeches at the convention that there are silver linings in the economy. It is the most persuasive explanation for how subjective perceptions of the economy improved at a time when objective measurements of it had worsened.
But could improved consumer confidence actually translate into improved consumer spending, which could help stimulate the economic recovery? Or do measures of consumer sentiment become unreliable predictors of actual economic behavior once we're this deep into an election cycle?
Some academic studies of this question find that improved consumer confidence actually may affect consumer behavior -- even if the initial impetus for the change was rooted in political factors. Democrats might be going out to dinner a few more times this month -- even if Republicans don't.
On the other hand, Gallup's tracking of self-reported consumer spending has not seen much of a change since the Democratic convention. Self-reported assessments of spending are not always reliable. But we'll have to wait several more weeks until September data on retail sales is available, giving us a harder measure of how consumers are actually behaving.
These ambiguous relationships between political attitudes, economic attitudes and actual economic behavior are complicated. It isn't necessarily so straightforward to say what constitutes the economic "fundamentals," when those economic variables may be influenced in part by the political attitudes of consumers and businesses, along with fiscal and monetary policy.
However, I am especially wary of using sentiment-based measures like consumer confidence in elections analysis, and forecasting models that have done so have had extremely poor results when applied to real data. If you had an elections model based on horse-race polls and consumer confidence right now, you'd run the risk of double-counting Mr. Obama's gains, since in this case the consumer confidence figures seemed to have been influenced by electoral politics more than the other way around.
 Friday's Polls 
Speaking of silver linings: Friday's poll numbers were a bit more hopeful for Mitt Romney, at least as compared to his extremely poor numbers over the past week or so. A number of swing state polls congregated at a lead in the low- to mid-single digits for Mr. Obama, but we weren't seeing as many polls with him ahead in mid- to high-single digit leads.
Mr. Obama's lead also declined by one point in the RAND Corporation's national tracking poll, and by two points in the Ipsos online tracking poll, and in a poll published by United Press International. It held steady at six points, however, in the Gallup national tracking poll.
Our "now-cast," which looks at the polls alone and does not account for the economic data, held steady on Friday, suggesting that it would be premature to make too much out of these shifts. A couple more days' worth of polls like this, however, and Mr. Romney might be able to make the case that Mr. Obama's momentum has abated some.
The smart money is that Mr. Obama's standing in the polls will erode some between now and Nov. 6, especially if we continue to see the mediocre economic data that we did on Friday. It is probably too late in the election cycle for the economic data alone to prevent Mr. Obama from being favored in the race, unless the numbers are poor enough to give voters the sense that the economy has reached some new state of acute crisis. But it could soften the ground a bit for Mr. Romney down the stretch run if he can find some other ways, like the debates, to also make gains.

HEADLINE: Debate Challenge? What to Call Your Opponent

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Will it be "Mr. President" or "the president" when Mr. Romney refers to his rival? Will Mr. Obama talk about the "governor" or "my opponent"? Or will "Mitt" and "Barack" slip out? 

 BODY:
As Mitt Romney and President Obama huddle with their debate coaches this weekend, they will each have to make a simple - but potentially critical - decision ahead of Wednesday's face-off.
What do they call each other? 
Will it be "Mr. President" or "the president" when Mr. Romney refers to his rival on the stage? Will Mr. Obama talk about the policies that "the governor" wants to pursue? Or will he talk about the impact of those policies from "my opponent"?
Or will there be less formal moments, when "Mitt" and "Barack" slip out?
Millions of people will be watching the two men in one of the very few direct interactions they have had during the 2012 campaign. Among the things being scrutinized: how much respect will each contender pay to his rival? 
"There's a certain amount of decorum that we expect in our debates," said Brett O'Donnell, one of the Republican party's top debate coaches. "The reference that they use for each other is a beginning point for that decorum."
Washington is famous for its fake friendliness - think of how often senators heap praise on their "good friend, the gentleman from Ohio" just before skewering the Ohio senator's motives and killing his legislation with a parliamentary maneuver.
Presidential debates are no different. They are among the highest-stakes moments in American politics. Yet they demand smiles and handshakes at the beginning - a demonstration of respect and friendliness that is often at odds with the tough rhetoric that often follows. 
There have been few occasions in modern political history of outright nastiness or scorn when it comes to how presidential candidates refer to each other during debates. Still, campaigns have often made subtle choices as they seek an advantage.
During the first debate between Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008, Mr. Obama all but ignored Mr. McCain's decades as a senator, perhaps hoping not to draw too much of a contrast to his own short tenure in the chamber.
Almost every time Mr. Obama referred to his rival during that debate, he simply used his first name.
"I don't know where John is getting his figures," Mr. Obama said at one point. Another time, he said: "John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important." Later, he spoke directly to Mr. McCain, saying: "John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
In all, Mr. Obama used Mr. McCain's first name 25 times. By contrast, Mr. McCain referred to Mr. Obama as "Senator Obama" or "the senator" each time.
"It was a backhanded compliment," Mr. O'Donnell said, recalling Mr. Obama's use of Mr. McCain's first name. "On the outside, he was being friendly, trying to be comfortable. It was a way of being respectfully distrustful."
Three weeks later, in the third debate of the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama had apparently thought better of his choice. He called Mr. McCain "John" only once, referring to him as "Senator McCain" throughout the rest of the debate.
That same year, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and Mr. McCain's vice-presidential nominee, asked her rival, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., "Hey, can I call you Joe?" while shaking his hand at the debate's opening.
She went on to call him "senator" during most of the debate, but did drop the formality when responding to Mr. Biden's criticism of the previous Republican administration.
"Say it ain't so, Joe," Ms. Palin said. "There you go again pointing backwards again."
Debate coaches often suggest that candidates do whatever they can to subtly undermine their rival's experience and stature. In 2004, President George W. Bush repeatedly referred to Senator John Kerry as merely "my opponent," even when referring to Mr. Kerry's Senate votes.
Mr. Bush used the same approach four years earlier, when debating Vice President Al Gore. Sometimes he called him "the vice president," but often switched to "my opponent." Mr. Gore stayed with the formal "Governor Bush," reminding all who were watching of the limits of Mr. Bush's experience.
Mr. Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, always referred to Michael Dukakis as "Governor Dukakis" in 1988. President Jimmy Carter was careful to say "Governor Reagan" during their 1980 debates. In fact, most presidential candidates seem to adopt that careful approach: be respectful by using a proper title that doesn't risk offending anyone.
The exceptions seem to come in those unscripted moments when candidates either clash angrily or interact warmly, dropping for just a brief moment the formal pretense.
Perhaps the most memorable of those moments came during a presidential primary debate in 2008. When a moderator asked Hillary Rodham Clinton why people thought Mr. Obama was more likable, she answered, "I don't think I'm that bad."
Mr. Obama dropped his guard and stopped calling her "Senator Clinton" in a moment that helped breathe new life back into Ms. Clinton's campaign against him.
"You're likable enough, Hillary," he said. "No doubt about it."

HEADLINE: Bank of America Settles Suit Over Merrill for $2.43 Billion

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America announced on Friday that it would pay $2.43 billion to settle a class action lawsuit related to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. 

 BODY:
 9:19 p.m. | Updated 
The price being paid by Bank of America for its missteps during the financial crisis rose sharply on Friday as the bank announced a $2.43 billion deal to settle accusations that it misled investors about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
It is the largest securities class-action lawsuit settlement yet to arise from the financial crisis.
Shareholders, led by pension funds, including those in Ohio and the Netherlands, had accused the bank of providing false and misleading statements about the health of the Wall Street firm, which, unknown to the public, was racking up huge losses in late 2008 amid turmoil in the markets.
 Bank of America denied the allegations, but said on Friday that it had agreed to settle in order to put the case behind it. "Resolving this litigation removes uncertainty and risk and is in the best interests of our shareholders," Brian T. Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement.
The settlement, however, may undermine a battle between the New York attorney general and the bank. In 2010, Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general at the time, sued Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's former chief executive, and Bank of America, contending that the bank and its executives hid from shareholders billions of dollars in losses at Merrill, later causing Bank of America to need a bailout from Washington.
The case, which now falls to Eric T. Schneiderman, could lose much of its steam. Under a decision by New York's highest court, the attorney general can recover losses on behalf of shareholders. Once the shareholders settle, though, Mr. Schneiderman's office can expect to obtain little more than a penalty, according to people briefed on the matter. The attorney general's office declined to comment.
The huge size of the settlement underscores how two deals in 2008 - the Merrill acquisition and the purchase of the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial earlier that year - have weighed on the bank, one of the country's largest, keeping it from making a full recovery.
The Countrywide acquisition, made as the housing market was collapsing, has now cost Bank of America more than $40 billion in losses on real estate, legal costs and settlements, according to several people close to the bank. That deal alone would have been enough to hobble Bank of America, but coupled with the questionable acquisition of Merrill Lynch, it nearly crippled the institution.
Since 2009, Bank of America has closed bank branches, sold billions of dollars in assets and cut tens of thousands of jobs.
When the deal to buy Merrill Lynch for $50 billion was announced in September 2008, Lehman Brothers was preparing to file for bankruptcy and the American International Group was rapidly crumbling. At the time, Bank of America and Merrill crowed about creating a financial giant unrivaled "in its breadth of financial services and global reach." Bank of America executives emphasized Merrill's "great global franchise" and its extensive network of financial advisers. The company said the deal would bolster earnings by 2010.
But by the time the deal closed in January 2009, Merrill Lynch's health had deteriorated precipitously. Internal calculations showed that Merrill, which was saddled with billions of dollars in souring mortgage assets, had a staggering pretax loss in excess of $10 billion for October and November 2008, and December was looking even worse.
Even as the losses continued to pile up within Merrill, executives were pushing forward to close the deal by January 2009. On Dec. 5, at separate meetings in Charlotte, N.C., and New York, shareholders of each company voted to approve the deal.
What they did not know, shareholders contended, was that just days before that meeting, bank executives worried that Merrill Lynch would have a fourth-quarter loss of at least $16 billion. There was no public disclosure of that internal forecast.
In court documents, lawyers for Mr. Lewis have said that the executive was aware of the mounting losses heading into the shareholder meetings, but that after discussions with lawyers he concluded that an interim disclosure was not necessary because the crucial regulatory filing in support of the merger did not contain projections on Merrill's fourth-quarter results.
"The losses, though large, were not out of line with losses Merrill had experienced in prior quarters; and investors were well aware that banks were sustaining significant losses as the economy deteriorated," according to a court filing.
The marriage with Merrill was a rocky union almost from the start. Amid the 2008 market turbulence, John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill, privately sought out Mr. Lewis of Bank of America during a break in a crisis meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Thain realized then that his firm was in critical condition and might not survive past the weekend. It was a shotgun wedding, and the two executives announced Sunday night that their firms were merging.
While the deal gave Merrill a much-needed lifeline, the brokerage firm was still hemorrhaging money. As the losses inside Merrill continued to build, some executives inside Bank of America considered abandoning the deal altogether. But regulators urged executives at Bank of America to continue, arguing that a broken deal would cause further turmoil in the already roiling financial system. Instead, Bank of America received a fresh injection of capital to buffer against the Merrill losses.
On Jan. 16, weeks after the deal had closed, the bailout was announced, along with Merrill's fourth-quarter net loss of $15.31 billion. Shareholders, unaware of the severity of the losses in late 2008, were furious.
Neither Mr. Thain nor Mr. Lewis survived the debacle. A week after the bailout was announced, Mr. Lewis flew to New York from Charlotte to see Mr. Thain, telling him the board blamed him for the losses. Mr. Thain has previously said he viewed this meeting as a firing.
In April 2009, Bank of America shareholders stripped Mr. Lewis of the title of chairman. Later that year, he stepped down as chief executive.
Bank of America later paid $150 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit that contended the bank did not tell its shareholders about big bonus payments Merrill had approved before the merger closed. For a federal securities class action, the size of Friday's Merrill settlement is surpassed only by the Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Cendant settlements, according to Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor of securities litigation at Stanford University Law School.
Bank of America said on Friday that the settlement would hurt its results for its current quarter. Profit will also be hurt by a $1.9 billion adjustment related to the value of its debt. And the bank faces an $800 million charge related to an income tax expense. All told, third-quarter earnings - to be reported on Oct. 17 - will be cut by 28 cents a share, the bank said.
David M. Trone, an analyst with JMP Securities, said on Friday that he expected Bank of America to take a loss in the third quarter of 17 cents a share. Mr. Trone described the settlement in his note Friday as "far larger than we expected."
It is unclear how much relief the shareholders - those who owned Bank of America shares or call options from September 2008 to January 2009 - will receive. A chunk of the settlement amount will go to the plaintiffs' lawyers, who are expected to ask the court for $150 million in fees. Bank of America will use its litigation reserves and litigation expenses to cover the settlement, saying that it and other legal expenses cost it $1.6 billion.
The bank also said on Friday that it had agreed to adopt a "say on pay" shareholder vote, an independent compensation committee of the board and policies for committees focused on acquisitions, among other corporate governance changes.
Despite the legal woes, the Merrill Lynch business has helped bolster Bank of America, contributing roughly half the bank's revenue since 2009, according to bank analysts.
The Countrywide acquisition has proved to be a bigger albatross for Bank of America. The purchase effectively saddled Bank of America with hundreds of thousands of homeowners struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments.
The bank has spent billions of dollars to defend lawsuits related to Countrywide's mortgage business. In the second quarter of 2011, for example, the bank reported an $8.8 billion loss, mainly related to a settlement with mortgage investors.
Earlier this year, Bank of America and four other banks agreed to a $26 billion settlement related to their foreclosure practices. That deal evolved from an investigation of the mortgage servicing practices by state attorneys general that was begun in 2010 amid mounting fury over revelations that banks evicted homeowners from their residences with false or incomplete documentation.

HEADLINE: Iranian News Agency Plagiarizes The Onion

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Apparently unaware of the unwritten rules of both ethical journalism and satire, an Iranian news agency published an edited copy of a report from The Onion on Friday, without crediting the original. 

 BODY:
Last Updated: Saturday, 6:13 p.m. Apparently unaware of the unwritten rules of both ethical journalism and satire, an Iranian news agency published an edited copy of a report from The Onion on Friday, without crediting the original or acknowledging that it was fiction.
The Fars News Agency, which is close to Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, posted its version of the report on its English-language Web site under the same headline used by The Onion for the original four days earlier: "Gallup Poll: Rural Whites Prefer Ahmadinejad To Obama."
Gallup Poll: Rural Whites Prefer Ahmadinejad to Obama http://t.co/snzZBomZ
- Fars News Agency (@FNA_Iran)28 Sep 12
Although the dateline for the news brief says that the reporting was done in Tehran by Fars, the first sentence is identical to the earlier Onion parody: "According to the results of a Gallup poll released Monday, the overwhelming majority of rural white Americans said they would rather vote for Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad than U.S. president Barack Obama." 
The second sentence of the Fars report, however, changed "have a beer with Ahmadinejad," to "have a drink with Ahmadinejad," and entirely omitted The Onion's description of the Iranian president as "a man who has repeatedly denied the Holocaust and has had numerous political prisoners executed."
The final two sentences of the original Onion report, quoting a fictional voter in West Virginia who prefers Iran's president, were published unchanged by Fars:
"He takes national defense seriously, and he'd never let some gay protesters tell him how to run his country like Obama does." According to the same Gallup poll, 60 percent of rural whites said they at least respected that Ahmadinejad doesn't try to hide the fact that he's Muslim.
The only other difference between the two versions of the fake report is that The Onion used a more flattering photograph of Mr. Ahmadinejad, showing him with a broad smile.
For more than an hour after the error was noticed, and mocked, by bloggers including David Kenner, an editor for Foreign Policy in Cairo, the report remained on the home page of the Fars English-language site, where it was promoted as the day's third most important story. Although the article was eventually removed, after The Times approached the press office of the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for comment, The Lede saved a screenshot of the complete text.
The news agency has in the past copied an entire blog post from The Lede without attribution.
The Onion responded by upping the satirical ante, referring to Fars as "our Iranian subsidiary," in an update to the original article, and providing its readers with a link to a copy of the copied article.
Iran's Finest News Source, FARS (@fna_iran), is a subsidiary of The Onion. Thus, we freely share any and all content. http://t.co/eiBVf15R
- The Onion (@TheOnion)28 Sep 12
While it is unclear how Fars came across the fictional report, Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi, who blogs about the Iranian press, first noticed on Wednesday that the main, Persian-language version of Fars Web site had mistaken the Onion report for real news. Mr. Sadeghi-Boroujerdi notes that report has now been removed by Fars, but was picked up by at least two other Iranian news sites, and Mehr.
The episode might also reflect how it is increasingly easy to come across information online that has been intentionally or accidentally denatured through copying as it is passed along from one site to another, or one social media user to another.
The Onion has been criticized in the past for posting fake news updates on Twitter -- where the text is divorced from contextual clues that make it easier to identify the reports as satire. As the Guardian editor Matt Wells wrote last year, when The Onion used Twitter to post fictional live updates on a hostage crisis that was also fictional, as information is passed from user to user on social networks, fiction can easily be mistaken for fact.
The viral way that information spreads online also makes it easy for errors to proliferate. To take a recent example, before a violent protest against an anti-Islam film took place in Cairo on Sept. 11, the United States Embassy released a statement condemning the makers of the film for abusing their right to free speech by promoting religious bigotry. After the protest turned violent, however, a version of that statement posted on Twitter was passed around by opponents of the Obama administration who mistakenly described it as an apology to the protesters, released after attack on the embassy. Within hours, Mitt Romney joined the chorusin repeating the false accusation that the statement was posted online after rather than before the protest.
Then too, Fars might have been more easily confused by The Onion's satirical report because competition from satirists and Internet news sites seems to have encouraged traditional news organizations to allow their journalists to lace their reports with comic elements.
A remarkable example of the dangers of the new laughter-based news economy can be found in the great difficulty Reuters has had in correcting a flawed video report produced in Iran in February, on the popularity of the martial art of ninjutsu among Iranian women.
As my colleague David Goodman reported in March, Iran's government imposed a harsh sanction on Reuters journalists in Tehran, rescinding their press cards, in retaliation for errors in what was apparently intended to be a lighthearted video report distributed by the news agency under the headline, "Thousands of Female Ninjas Train as Iran's Assassins." 
Although Reuters issued a correction once the government pointed out that the women featured in the report were not studying the martial art of ninjutsu in a dojo outside Tehran with the intention of killing anyone, but simply to keep in shape, the agency has no control over what news organizations do with the material it provides to them, so several versions of the story remain on the Web sites and YouTube channels of its clients.
While the corrected item is no longer available on the Reuters Web site, video reports repeating the false premise -- that Iranian women who practice the sport primarily for exercise are a squad of trained killers -- produced by the American networks CBS and MSNBC, the Saudi channel Al Arabiya, Britain's Channel 4 News, Japan's state broadcaster NHK and The Telegraph in London, can all still be viewed online.
Similarly, there is no correction attached to a version of the report, headlined "Iran Trains 3,000 Female Ninja Assassins," which has been viewed more than 160,000 times on the YouTube channel of Britain's ITN since February.
The narration for that version seems to retain the jokey tone of the original Reuters script, mocking the women's efforts to appear fierce even as the narrator makes the ominous-sounding claim that "these are Iran's ninja assassins and they are deadly serious. Some 3,000 women are being trained to defend the Islamic Republic to the death, with hand-to-hand combat, and evasion skills." Interestingly, the ITN journalist who narrates that report, Sam Datta-Paulin, explains on his personal Web site that he is "also a performing comedian."
As Max Fisher explained in a post on The Atlantic's Web site in March, the Reuters report followed an initial report on the female ninjas broadcast on Jan. 29 by Press TV, an Iranian government satellite channel that exists to put Tehran's spin on the news. Four days after that broadcast, the Press TV report was posted on YouTube, where it quickly went viral. Thanks in large part to attention from Internet news outlets like The Daily, which detected some inadvertent comedy in the notion of Iranian female ninjas, the Press TV report has been viewed nearly a million times on YouTube.
Beyond the mocking tone of the Reuters report, Iranian officials seem to have been most angered by the fact that the initial script cast the efforts of the women to learn the martial art in terms of a potential conflict with Israel, despite the fact that the dojo has been in operation for more than two decades.
First on Twitter and then in a careful reconstruction of how the Press TV story spread and was then picked up by Reuters, Shiva Balaghi, an Iranian-American cultural historian who has lived in both countries, argued that journalists working in the era of The Daily Show had perhaps lost focus on what mattered about the story.
Suspension of Reuters from Iran is no laughing matter. Shame on all who've chuckled over it on blogs, twitter, & FB. (1of3)
- Shiva Balaghi (@SBalaghi)30 Mar 12

The Iranian govt's reaction is another attack on press freedoms. Where's the humor in this situation? (3of3) #Reuters
- Shiva Balaghi (@SBalaghi)30 Mar 12
Ms. Balaghi suggested that something about the images of the young Iranian women wielding swords and running up walls struck journalists used to thinking of ninja moves as the stuff of action movies and video games as inherently funny. The drive to maximize that comedy then seemed to overwhelm more sober journalistic instincts, like factual accuracy and the need to place the images in context.
"Academics are often rightly accused of being too insular," Ms. Balaghi wrote in the online journal Jadaliyya. "The same could be said of some journalists, especially those who work for social media sites. One wonders if there isn't too much pressure to get more 'likes,' retweets, mentions, and followers. Brevity and witticism have become valued tools of the trade." 
At the end of her essay, she observed that a far more serious issue, the restrictions placed on women in Iran, was ignored in reports that sought to hype the comedic potential of the story:
Iran's women athletes remain caught in a web of government control within Iran while their modest Islamic attire makes them subject to prohibition by international sporting bodies.
And now some careless or unethical journalists made the women athletes in the Karaj dojo the butt of jokes or props in their jingoistic drum beating for war on Iran. More power to them for speaking out for themselves. Unfortunately, the whole sordid affair provided the Islamic Republic a handy excuse to withdraw Reuters' credentials, making it even harder for us to get accurate reporting from Iran at a critical time. Above all else, the story of Iranian women martial artists turns out to be a cautionary tale.
When the Reuters bureau in Tehran was first shut down, after the women featured in the report took the news agency to court, The National in Abu Dhabi explained that part of the context for the story was that state-owned Press TV has an ax to grind with Britain:
Press TV, which has spearheaded the blowback against Reuters, is viewed as Iran's propaganda mouthpiece in the West. Ofcom, Britain's independent media watchdog, revoked the channel's license in January for failing to pay a record £100,000 fine for broadcasting an interview with a prisoner obtained under duress.
Unlike Press TV, Reuters enjoys an excellent reputation for accuracy and impartiality. It had managed to maintain its bureau in Tehran after Iran's disputed presidential elections in June 2009 which was followed by a crackdown on Iranian journalists. Visas for western reporters have since been very hard to come by. The activities of those allowed in on rare visits are strictly monitored and curtailed.
In late July, Iran's official news agency reported comments from an Iranian official who said that after the lawsuit against Reuters takes its course in Iranian courts, the wire service's office in Tehran "is likely to be shut down for good." 
An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the military force that Fars News Agency is close to; it is the Revolutionary Guards, not the Republican Guards.

HEADLINE: Judge Strikes Down a Dodd-Frank Trading Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street posted another victory in the battle over regulation, as a federal judge on Friday struck down the so-called position limits rule, a central piece of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. 

 BODY:
Wall Street posted another victory in the battle over regulation on Friday after a federal judge struck down a central piece of the Obama administration's financial overhaul. 
The court decision dealt the latest blow to the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory crackdown passed in response to the financial crisis. The decision on Friday, aimed at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's so-called position limits rule, is the second time a Dodd-Frank rule has suffered legal defeat.
The futures commission adopted the rule last year to place new restrictions on speculative trading, capping the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on certain commodities. The agency aimed to rein in trading blamed for inflated prices at the gas pump and the grocery store.
The future of the rule is uncertain. Judge Robert L. Wilkins of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the rule, sending it back to the agency for "further proceedings." 
But in a statement on Friday, the agency hinted that it might appeal the court decision.
 "I believe it is critically important that these position limits be established as Congress required," the agency's chairman, Gary Gensler, on Friday. "I am disappointed by today's ruling, and we are considering ways to proceed."
The case stems from a lawsuit that two Wall Street trade groups filed last year. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association complained that the agency erred in writing the rule, saying it would have had the unintended effect of causing wild price swings. 
In a joint statement, the groups said they were "pleased with today's ruling" but are "committed to working with the commission and other regulators to promote safe, efficient markets." 
The ruling is sure to embolden Wall Street as it shifts the attack on Dodd-Frank from piecemeal lobbying to broader legal challenges. Industry groups are currently challenging another futures commission rule, while others are weighing lawsuits against the so-called Volcker Rule, a still-uncompleted plan to stop banks from trading with their own money. 
Companies have already seen some success. A federal appeals court last summer struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank policy that would have empowered shareholders to oust company directors. The court, which also would hear an appeal to the position limits rule, is friendly turf for Wall Street, tossing out S.E.C. rules six times in seven years.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, fearful of legal challenges, delayed its position limits rule on multiple occasions. It also tamed parts of the plan to accommodate concerns from traders. 
But the concessions failed to placate Wall Street. The two trade groups point to the fine print of Dodd-Frank, saying the law leaves it to regulators to enforce position limits only "as appropriate." The groups argue that the law, in essence, required regulators to determine whether limits are necessary and appropriate before creating them.
For its part, the agency argued that Congress gave it no choice but to impose position limits. 
Judge Wilkins vacated the rule, saying the agency did not have a clear mandate to set position limits. But it was unclear whether he agreed with Wall Street's arguments. In a ruling on Friday, the judge said that the central question in the case is whether Dodd-Frank "clearly and unambiguously" requires the agency to conclude the limits are necessary before imposing them. "The answer is yes."
The judge appeared to contradict himself elsewhere in the ruling. "Ultimately, however, this court need not choose between the competing interpretations," he wrote, because the law "is ambiguous as to the precise question at issue."
Public Citizen, a group that supports position limits, said on Friday that "the winners and losers from this ruling are clear: Wall Street wins, consumers lose."
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who championed position limits, argued that the rule would protect consumers from speculative commodities trading. The trading, he and the rule's other supporters say, have sent energy costs and food prices soaring. 
The rule would cap the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on 28 commodities, including energy products like oil for the first time. Until the agency adopted the plan, the limits covered only nine agricultural commodities, including corn and wheat.
"I will continue to push hard for a position limits rule, as mandated by Congress," Mr. Chilton said in a statement on Friday. "This is clearly a setback but we can learn from it and continue this critical effort to help make our markets safe and fair."

HEADLINE: Remembering the Dream Team's Remarkable Supporting Cast

BYLINE: HARVEY ARATON


HIGHLIGHT: The new documentary "The Other Dream Team" capably illustrates the narrative from the Lithuanian players, who in four years went from winning gold for their Soviet oppressors to a hair-raising bronze medal victory over what passed for a Russian team. 

 BODY:
This has been quite the commemorative 20th anniversary year for the 1992 Dream Team, often referred to as the first and only collection of N.B.A. stars worthy of the signature. There was a documentary film shown on NBA TV. There was Jack McCallum's excellent best-seller - "Dream Team" - that needed no subtitle but tacked on the rather verbose "How Michael, Magic, Larry, Charles, and the Greatest Team of All Time Conquered the World and Changed the Game of Basketball Forever."
It is ancient news that the Dreamers managed to do all that at the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, without playing in a single game that was competitively memorable. But the change they brought occurred largely along commercial and social lines, given the growing impact of Michael Jordan as the world's most marketable athlete and the celebrity of Magic Johnson, whose participation months after his H.I.V. disclosure was almost a book in itself.
Competitively speaking, there was much evidence that the world basketball landscape had made a dramatic shift by the summer of 1992, beginning with fascinating old footage of Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis - who in his youth may have been every bit Bill Walton's equal.
On top of that, Sarunas Marciulionis (Lithuania) and Drazen Petrovic (Croatia) were already in the N.B.A. Petrovic's countryman Toni Kukoc and others were well on their way. Even more compelling than the glitz and gold medal glory of the Dream Team was the story of how those barriers - the Iron Curtain itself - came to be crashed.
A new documentary that has just opened in Los Angeles and New York - "The Other Dream Team," directed by Marius A. Markevicius - capably illustrates that narrative from the Lithuanian players, who in four years went from winning Olympic gold for their Soviet oppressors to a hair-raising bronze medal victory over what passed for a Russian team. 
Those of us who had a reserved seat in the news media area of the basketball arena in the Barcelona suburb - Badalona was the dateline - tend to rate that assignment as a transcendent career standout, our benchmark in the emerging global sports economy. And though the NBA TV account seemed to think those Olympics were all about one country, the show's headliners had a remarkable supporting cast.
While third place was unthinkable for Jordan, Johnson and Larry Bird, it symbolized an escape from tyranny for players like Marciulionis and Sabonis, who speak of family members being sent off to Siberia by the Soviets. The documentary traces not only the decades of Russian occupation from 1939 but the role of basketball as a means of maintaining and strengthening the tiny country's resolve and pride after becoming a World War II pawn.
I have never been too enamored of nationalism being given equal billing in the sports arena - these days, so many of our nation-hopping athletes are more citizens of the world - but in Barcelona it was unavoidable and unmistakably buoyant in the cases of Lithuania, Croatia (having broken from Yugoslavia) and a host of other athletes caught in the political earthquake.
There was, for instance, the story of Igor Miglinieks and Goundars Vetra, who chose to play for the Commonwealth of Independent States, or Unified Team, instead of their native Latvia, which had almost no chance of qualifying for the Games. For aligning with the team identified as the Soviet remains, they were branded at home as traitors. In Barcelona, Marciulionis said, "I would never do what they are doing."
Lithuania was so broke upon gaining independence that it needed Marciulionis to embark on a fundraising mission to even field a team. He raised $200,000 with the help of his N.B.A. brethren, the Golden State Warriors. When The Grateful Dead contributed cash and tie-dyed shirts (and shorts) that featured the rock band's trademark skeleton insignia dunking a ball, Lithuania became the American Dream Team's socio-economic opposite, with the slogan, "Better Dead than Red."
Lithuania trounced the Unified Team by 37 in Olympic qualifying and word circulated that they had tried to win by 53 - the number of years in occupation. In pool play, they were on the way to another blowout, leading, 53-34, when they collapsed and lost. Marciulionis wore dark glasses to interviews to hide his tears.
"The Other Dream Team" builds to the bronze-medal-game climax, in which Valdemaras Chomicius was cut badly, only to have the country's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, tell him, "You're bleeding for Lithuania."
Marciulionis and company went on to win and take their place on the medal stand - in all their tie-dyed glory - with the Dream Team and the equally jubilant silver medalist, Croatia. That scene - beloved mercenaries alongside the newly emancipated - was both sweet and surreal, like a strange dream.

HEADLINE: New York May Restart Review of Gas-Drilling Rules

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New York State is further slowing its effort to craft rules governing fracking. 

 BODY:
New York State appears to be further slowing its effort to produce rules governing fracking, shorthand for the suite of drilling methods used to extract natural gas from deep shale deposits. The pressure to drill has fallen sharply along with gas prices, and in the face of inevitable litigation. [Sept. 30, 11:13 p.m. | Updated | Danny Hakim describes the reaction of drilling supporters and foes to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's latest move on fracking.]
The news is on Politics on the Hudson and Shale Gas Review, the blog of Tom Wilber, author of "Under the Surface: Fracking, Fortunes, and the Fate of the Marcellus Shale." Here's an excerpt and link to the rest: 
New York officials crafting policy to regulate shale gas drilling amid unanswered health concerns will likely re-open the process to public hearings, essentially guaranteeing more momentum for the movement that has effectively stalled the industry's advancement into the Empire State for more than four years.
Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, said late this afternoon that agency officials expect to begin a new rulemaking process rather than try to meet a Nov. 29 deadline to complete a regulatory overhaul. The news comes a week after DEC Commissioner Joseph Martens announced that the agency will turn part of the review over to the Department of Health Commissioner Nirav Shah to address persistent questions about how shale gas development and high volume hydraulic fracturing will affect public health in communities where it is allowed.
"Given that DEC has said no regulations or final decision will be issued until the completion of Dr. Shah's review, should high-volume hydraulic fracturing move forward, it is expected that a new rulemaking process would be undertaken," DEC spokeswoman Emily DeSantis said. That process would include at least one public hearing although DeSantis said no timeframes had been made. [ Read the rest.]
The rush to develop gas deposits in other parts of the Marcellus Shale, the vast area of ancient seabed underlying communities from Ohio through upstate New York, has deeply divided communities over balancing economic benefits and environmental and economic impacts. I spoke on energy and climate at Cornell University last Monday to an audience for whom the threat from drilling clearly dominated. In the presentation, sponsored by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, I showed this short video to make the point that gas country over the border in Pennsylvania offers ammunition for almost any argument:
You can watch the talk and a long, and sometimes heated, question period here:
The divisions, and intensity, will never go away over gas drilling, to my mind, because the potency of the fears of direct impacts will always trump any argument involving broader tradeoffs, like the merits of moving more electricity production from coal to gas.

HEADLINE: Emergency Aid to Egypt Encounters an Objection

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The Obama administration notified Congress on Friday that it would provide Egypt's new government an emergency cash infusion of $450 million, but the aid immediately encountered resistance from a prominent lawmaker wary of foreign aid and Egypt's new course under the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The aid is part of the $1 billion in assistance that the Obama administration has pledged to Egypt to bolster its transition to democracy after the overthrow last year of the former president, Hosni Mubarak. Its fate, however, was clouded by concerns over the new government's policies and, more recently, the protests that damaged the American Embassy in Cairo. 
The United States Agency for International Development notified Congress of the cash infusion on Friday morning during the pre-election recess, promptly igniting a smoldering debate over foreign aid and the administration's handling of crises in the Islamic world.
An influential Republican lawmaker, Representative Kay Granger of Texas, immediately announced that she would use her position as chairwoman of the House appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign aid to block the distribution of the money. She said the American relationship with Egypt ''has never been under more scrutiny'' than it is in the wake of the election of President Mohamed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.
''I am not convinced of the urgent need for this assistance and I cannot support it at this time,'' Ms. Granger said in a statement that her office issued even before the administration announced the package.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking at a meeting of the Group of 8 nations in New York, said on Friday that the world needed to do more to support the governments that have emerged from the Arab Spring uprisings, including those in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.
''The recent riots and protests throughout the region have brought the challenge of transition into sharp relief,'' Mrs. Clinton said, without mentioning the assistance to Egypt specifically. ''Extremists are clearly determined to hijack these wars and revolutions to further their agendas and ideology, so our partnership must empower those who would see their nations emerge as true democracies.''
The debate comes as the issue of foreign aid in general made an unexpected appearance in the presidential campaign.
In a speech in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Obama's Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, called for revamping assistance to focus more on investments in the private sector than on direct aid -- a shift administration officials have said is under way.
While Mr. Romney did not address aid to Egypt directly, he cited Mr. Morsi's membership in the Muslim Brotherhood as one of the alarming developments in the Middle East, along with the war in Syria, Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the killing of the American ambassador to Libya.
''A temporary aid package can jolt an economy,'' he said. ''It can fund some projects. It can pay some bills. It can employ some people some of the time. But it can't sustain an economy -- not for long. It can't pull the whole cart, because at some point the money runs out.''
The $1 billion in aid, announced by Mr. Obama in May 2011, was initially intended to relieve Egypt's debts to the United States, though negotiations stalled during the country's turbulent transition from military rule to the election of Mr. Morsi this summer.
In recent weeks, negotiations over the assistance picked up pace, and the administration decided to provide $450 million instead, including $190 million immediately, because the country's economic crisis has become acute, with an estimated budget shortfall of $12 billion.
The assistance outlined in letters to Congress on Friday would be contingent on Egypt's setting in motion economic and budgetary changes that the International Monetary Fund is now negotiating as part of a $4.8 billion loan.
The administration has also thrown its support behind that loan, and officials said they hoped it would be completed before the end of the year. A $260 million infusion would come when the much larger loan is completed, according to officials familiar with the package. By law, all assistance to Egypt is contingent on the country's meeting certain requirements, including adherence to basic democratic values and the Camp David peace treaty with Israel.
The protests over an anti-Muslim video and the storming of the American Embassy in Cairo on Sept. 11 came even as senior White House and State Department officials led a large business delegation to promote economic assistance and trade in Egypt.
Mr. Morsi's slow response to the protests raised concerns in Washington, although administration officials later cited improved cooperation over the embassy's security.
The $1 billion in assistance has been cobbled together from funds already appropriated by Congress, but the administration is required to notify lawmakers of its intention to release any of the funds. Ms. Granger presumably can put a hold on that release and pursue legislation to reverse the appropriation.
Mrs. Clinton lobbied lawmakers last week during closed-door briefings that focused on the tumult across the region, including the attack at the American diplomatic mission in Libya that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
In addition to the $1 billion in assistance, the administration is working with Egypt to provide $375 million in financing and loan guarantees for American financiers who invest in Egypt and a $60 million investment fund for Egyptian businesses. All of that comes on top of $1.3 billion in military aid that the United States provides Egypt each year.
A senior State Department official said that the administration would consult with members of Congress in the days ahead ''to make the case that this budget support is firmly in U.S. interests in seeing peace, stability and democracy in Egypt and the wider neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: Bank of America Settles Suit Over Merrill for $2.43 Billion

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
9:19 p.m. | Updated
The price being paid by Bank of America for its missteps during the financial crisis rose sharply on Friday as the bank announced a $2.43 billion deal to settle accusations that it misled investors about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
It is the largest securities class-action lawsuit settlement yet to arise from the financial crisis.
Shareholders, led by pension funds, including those in Ohio and the Netherlands, had accused the bank of providing false and misleading statements about the health of the Wall Street firm, which, unknown to the public, was racking up huge losses in late 2008 amid turmoil in the markets.
Bank of America denied the allegations, but said on Friday that it had agreed to settle in order to put the case behind it. "Resolving this litigation removes uncertainty and risk and is in the best interests of our shareholders," Brian T. Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement. 
The settlement, however, may undermine a battle between the New York attorney general and the bank. In 2010, Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general at the time, sued Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's former chief executive, and Bank of America, contending that the bank and its executives hid from shareholders billions of dollars in losses at Merrill, later causing Bank of America to need a bailout from Washington.
The case, which now falls to Eric T. Schneiderman, could lose much of its steam. Under a decision by New York's highest court, the attorney general can recover losses on behalf of shareholders. Once the shareholders settle, though, Mr. Schneiderman's office can expect to obtain little more than a penalty, according to people briefed on the matter. The attorney general's office declined to comment.
The huge size of the settlement underscores how two deals in 2008 - the Merrill acquisition and the purchase of the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial earlier that year - have weighed on the bank, one of the country's largest, keeping it from making a full recovery.
The Countrywide acquisition, made as the housing market was collapsing, has now cost Bank of America more than $40 billion in losses on real estate, legal costs and settlements, according to several people close to the bank. That deal alone would have been enough to hobble Bank of America, but coupled with the questionable acquisition of Merrill Lynch, it nearly crippled the institution.
Since 2009, Bank of America has closed bank branches, sold billions of dollars in assets and cut tens of thousands of jobs.
When the deal to buy Merrill Lynch for $50 billion was announced in September 2008, Lehman Brothers was preparing to file for bankruptcy and the American International Group was rapidly crumbling. At the time, Bank of America and Merrill crowed about creating a financial giant unrivaled "in its breadth of financial services and global reach." Bank of America executives emphasized Merrill's "great global franchise" and its extensive network of financial advisers. The company said the deal would bolster earnings by 2010.
But by the time the deal closed in January 2009, Merrill Lynch's health had deteriorated precipitously. Internal calculations showed that Merrill, which was saddled with billions of dollars in souring mortgage assets, had a staggering pretax loss in excess of $10 billion for October and November 2008, and December was looking even worse.
Even as the losses continued to pile up within Merrill, executives were pushing forward to close the deal by January 2009. On Dec. 5, at separate meetings in Charlotte, N.C., and New York, shareholders of each company voted to approve the deal.
What they did not know, shareholders contended, was that just days before that meeting, bank executives worried that Merrill Lynch would have a fourth-quarter loss of at least $16 billion. There was no public disclosure of that internal forecast.
In court documents, lawyers for Mr. Lewis have said that the executive was aware of the mounting losses heading into the shareholder meetings, but that after discussions with lawyers he concluded that an interim disclosure was not necessary because the crucial regulatory filing in support of the merger did not contain projections on Merrill's fourth-quarter results.
"The losses, though large, were not out of line with losses Merrill had experienced in prior quarters; and investors were well aware that banks were sustaining significant losses as the economy deteriorated," according to a court filing.
The marriage with Merrill was a rocky union almost from the start. Amid the 2008 market turbulence, John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill, privately sought out Mr. Lewis of Bank of America during a break in a crisis meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Thain realized then that his firm was in critical condition and might not survive past the weekend. It was a shotgun wedding, and the two executives announced Sunday night that their firms were merging.
While the deal gave Merrill a much-needed lifeline, the brokerage firm was still hemorrhaging money. As the losses inside Merrill continued to build, some executives inside Bank of America considered abandoning the deal altogether. But regulators urged executives at Bank of America to continue, arguing that a broken deal would cause further turmoil in the already roiling financial system. Instead, Bank of America received a fresh injection of capital to buffer against the Merrill losses.
On Jan. 16, weeks after the deal had closed, the bailout was announced, along with Merrill's fourth-quarter net loss of $15.31 billion. Shareholders, unaware of the severity of the losses in late 2008, were furious.
Neither Mr. Thain nor Mr. Lewis survived the debacle. A week after the bailout was announced, Mr. Lewis flew to New York from Charlotte to see Mr. Thain, telling him the board blamed him for the losses. Mr. Thain has previously said he viewed this meeting as a firing.
In April 2009, Bank of America shareholders stripped Mr. Lewis of the title of chairman. Later that year, he stepped down as chief executive.
Bank of America later paid $150 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit that contended the bank did not tell its shareholders about big bonus payments Merrill had approved before the merger closed. For a federal securities class action, the size of Friday's Merrill settlement is surpassed only by the Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Cendant settlements, according to Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor of securities litigation at Stanford University Law School.
Bank of America said on Friday that the settlement would hurt its results for its current quarter. Profit will also be hurt by a $1.9 billion adjustment related to the value of its debt. And the bank faces an $800 million charge related to an income tax expense. All told, third-quarter earnings - to be reported on Oct. 17 - will be cut by 28 cents a share, the bank said.
David M. Trone, an analyst with JMP Securities, said on Friday that he expected Bank of America to take a loss in the third quarter of 17 cents a share. Mr. Trone described the settlement in his note Friday as "far larger than we expected."
It is unclear how much relief the shareholders - those who owned Bank of America shares or call options from September 2008 to January 2009 - will receive. A chunk of the settlement amount will go to the plaintiffs' lawyers, who are expected to ask the court for $150 million in fees. Bank of America will use its litigation reserves and litigation expenses to cover the settlement, saying that it and other legal expenses cost it $1.6 billion.
The bank also said on Friday that it had agreed to adopt a "say on pay" shareholder vote, an independent compensation committee of the board and policies for committees focused on acquisitions, among other corporate governance changes.
Despite the legal woes, the Merrill Lynch business has helped bolster Bank of America, contributing roughly half the bank's revenue since 2009, according to bank analysts.
The Countrywide acquisition has proved to be a bigger albatross for Bank of America. The purchase effectively saddled Bank of America with hundreds of thousands of homeowners struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments.
The bank has spent billions of dollars to defend lawsuits related to Countrywide's mortgage business. In the second quarter of 2011, for example, the bank reported an $8.8 billion loss, mainly related to a settlement with mortgage investors.
Earlier this year, Bank of America and four other banks agreed to a $26 billion settlement related to their foreclosure practices. That deal evolved from an investigation of the mortgage servicing practices by state attorneys general that was begun in 2010 amid mounting fury over revelations that banks evicted homeowners from their residences with false or incomplete documentation.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Strikes Down Commodity Speculator Limits

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Wall Street notched another victory in the battle over regulation on Friday after a federal judge struck down a central piece of the Obama administration's financial overhaul.
The court decision dealt the latest blow to the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory crackdown passed in response to the financial crisis. The decision on Friday, aimed at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's so-called position limits rule, is the second time a Dodd-Frank rule has suffered legal defeat.
The C.F.T.C. adopted the rule last year to place new restrictions on speculative trading, capping the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on certain commodities. The agency aimed to rein in trading blamed for inflated prices at the gas pump and the grocery store. 
The future of the rule is uncertain. Judge Robert L. Wilkins of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the rule, sending it back to the C.F.T.C. for "further proceedings."
But in a statement on Friday, the agency hinted it might appeal the court decision.
"I believe it is critically important that these position limits be established as Congress required," the agency's chairman, Gary S. Gensler, said in a statement on Friday. "I am disappointed by today's ruling, and we are considering ways to proceed."
The case stems from a lawsuit that two Wall Street trade groups filed late last year. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association complained that the C.F.T.C. erred in writing the rule, saying it would have had the unintended effect of causing wild price swings.
In a joint statement, the groups said they were "pleased with today's ruling" but are "committed to working with the commission and other regulators to promote safe, efficient markets."
The ruling is sure to embolden Wall Street as it shifts the attack on Dodd-Frank from piecemeal lobbying to broader legal challenges. Industry groups are currently challenging another C.F.T.C. rule, while others are weighing lawsuits against the so-called Volcker Rule, a still-uncompleted plan to stop banks from trading with their own money.
Companies have already seen some success. A federal appeals court last summer struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank policy that would have empowered shareholders to oust company directors. The court, which also would hear an appeal to the position limits rule, is friendly turf for Wall Street, tossing out S.E.C. rules six times in seven years.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, fearful of legal challenges, delayed its position limits rule on multiple occasions. It also tamed parts of the plan to accommodate concerns from traders.
But the concessions failed to placate Wall Street. The two trade groups point to the fine print of Dodd-Frank, saying the law leaves it to regulators to enforce position limits only "as appropriate." The groups argue that the law, in essence, required regulators to determine whether limits are necessary and appropriate before creating them.
For its part, the C.F.T.C. argued that Congress gave it no choice but to impose position limits.
Judge Wilkins vacated the rule, saying the agency did not have a clear mandate to set position limits. But it was unclear whether he agreed with Wall Street's arguments. In a ruling on Friday, the judge said that the central question in the case is whether Dodd-Frank "clearly and unambiguously" requires the agency to conclude the limits are necessary before imposing them. "The answer is yes."
The judge appeared to contradict himself elsewhere in the ruling. "Ultimately, however, this court need not choose between the competing interpretations," he wrote, because the law "is ambiguous as to the precise question at issue."
Public Citizen, a group that supports position limits, said on Friday that "The winners and losers from this ruling are clear: Wall Street wins, consumers lose."
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who championed position limits, argued that the rule would protect consumers from speculative commodities trading. The trading, he and the rule's other supporters say, have sent energy costs and food prices soaring.
The rule would cap the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on 28 commodities, including energy products like oil for the first time. Until the agency adopted the plan, the limits covered only nine agricultural commodities, including corn and wheat.
"I will continue to push hard for a position limits rule, as mandated by Congress," Mr. Chilton said in a statement on Friday. "This is clearly a setback but we can learn from it and continue this critical effort to help make our markets safe and fair."

HEADLINE: Who Depends on Government?

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Mitt Romney stirred up a hornet's nest with his comments about the 47 percent of Americans who he thinks are dependent on the government.
It turns out, according to 2008 data from the Cornell Survey Research Institute reported Monday in a Times opinion piece, that 96 percent of Americans have taken part in government benefit programs in one form or another. 
Listed below are 21 programs referenced by the researchers. Numbers 1 through 13 are "direct," meaning that the aid comes directly from the government; the remainder are considered "submerged," in that they come indirectly, through government tax policies. (For instance, the money you put in your workplace 401(k) plan grows tax-deferred).
Head Start
Social Security Disability
Social Security Retirement and Survivors Benefits
Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
Medicaid
Medicare
Welfare (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or T.A.N.F.)
G.I. Bill
Veterans' benefits
Pell Grants
Unemployment Insurance
Food Stamps
Government Subsidized Housing
Home Mortgage Interest Deduction
Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits
Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
529 accounts (qualified tuition programs) or Coverdell education savings account (Education I.R.A.'s)
Earned-income tax credit
Employer subsidized health insurance
Employer subsidized retirement benefits
Federal student loans
In an e-mail, Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell, explained a bit more about the two forms of employer benefits (Numbers 19 and 20), saying they "are even more submerged than the other policies in that group, because unlike with the others, people take no actual steps to claim the government benefit. As long as one is acquiring those employer-provided benefits, one simply gets the tax benefit - if the employer put the same money in people's paychecks, they would have to owe taxes on it."
I personally have benefited from student loans, the home mortgage deduction and employer health and retirement benefits, and my children have 529 education savings plans. My dad went to college (proudly) on the G.I. Bill. My upbringing was middle class.
Take a look at the list and let us know: How many of these have you received or relied on? Are you poor, working class, middle class, upper middle class, or part of the 1 percent?

HEADLINE: To Fight Crime, Camden Will Trade In Its Police

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
CAMDEN, N.J. -- Two gruesome murders of children last month -- a toddler decapitated, a 6-year-old stabbed in his sleep -- served as reminders of this city's reputation as the most dangerous in America. Others can be found along the blocks of row houses spray-painted ''R.I.P.,'' empty liquor bottles clustered on their porches in memorial to murder victims.
The police acknowledge that they have all but ceded these streets to crime, with murders on track to break records this year. And now, in a desperate move to regain control, city officials are planning to disband the Police Department.
The reason, officials say, is that generous union contracts have made it financially impossible to keep enough officers on the street. So in November, Camden, which has already had substantial police layoffs, will begin terminating the remaining 273 officers and give control to a new county force. The move, officials say, will free up millions to hire a larger, nonunionized force of 400 officers to safeguard the city, which is also the nation's poorest. 
Hardly a political battle of the last several years has been fiercer than the one over the fate of public sector unions. But Camden's decision to remake perhaps the most essential public service for a city riven by crime underscores how communities are taking previously unimaginable steps to get out from under union obligations that built up over generations.
Though the city is solidly Democratic, the plan to put the Police Department out of business has not prompted the wide public outcry seen in the union battles in Chicago, Ohio or Wisconsin, in part because many residents have come to resent a police force they see as incompetent, corrupt and doing little to make their streets safe.
A police union has sued to stop the move, saying it is risking public safety on an ''unproven'' idea. But many residents, community groups and elected officials say that the city is simply out of money, out of options, out of patience.
''There's no alternative, there's no Plan B,'' the City Council president, Frank Moran, said. ''It's the only option we have.''
Faced with tight budgets, many communities across the country are considering regionalizing their police departments, along with other services like firefighting, libraries and schools. Though some governments have rejected the idea for fear of increasing police response time, the police in Camden -- population 77,000 -- are already so overloaded they no longer respond to property crimes or car accidents that do not involve injuries.
The new effort follows a push by New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, a Republican, and Democratic leaders in the Legislature to encourage cities and towns to regionalize government services. They maintain that in a new era of government austerity, it is no longer possible for each community to offer a full buffet of government services, especially with a new law prohibiting communities from raising property taxes more than 2 percent a year.
Most municipalities have so far remained committed to local traditions, fearing a loss of community identity, but officials in Camden County say they expect others will soon feel compelled to follow the city's example.
Camden's budget was $167 million last year, and of that, the budget for the police was $55 million. Yet the city collected only $21 million in property taxes. It has relied on state aid to make up the difference, but the state is turning off the spigot. The city has imposed furloughs, reduced salaries and trash collection, and increased fees. But the businesses the city desperately needs to attract to generate more revenue are scared off by the crime.
''We cannot move the city forward unless we address public safety,'' the mayor, Dana L. Redd, said. ''This is about putting boots on the ground.''
Even union officials acknowledge that the contract is rich with expensive provisions. For example, officers earn an additional 4 percent for working a day shift, and an additional 10 percent for the shift starting at 9:30 p.m. They earn an additional 11 percent for working on a special tactical force or an anticrime patrol.
Salaries range from about $47,000 to $81,000 now, not including the shift differentials or additional longevity payments of 3 percent to 11 percent for any officer who has worked five years or more. Officials say they anticipate salaries for the new force will range from $47,000 to $87,000.
In 2009, as the economy was putting a freeze on municipal budgets even in well-off communities, the police here secured a pay increase of 3.75 percent.
And liberal sick time and family-leave policies have created an unusually high absentee rate: every day, nearly 30 percent of the force does not show up. (A typical rate elsewhere is in the single digits.)
''How do I go to the community and say 'I'm doing everything I can to help you fight crime' when some of my officers are working better hours than bankers?'' the police chief, J. Scott Thomson, asked.
Chief Thomson, who is well regarded nationally, is expected to lead the new force. Though Camden County covers 220 square miles and includes 37 municipalities, the proposal calls for a division focused exclusively on the nine-square-mile city of Camden.
Camden, in the shadow of Philadelphia's glimmering towers, once had a thriving industrial base -- a shipyard, Campbell Soup and RCA plants along the waterfront. About 60,000 jobs were lost when those companies moved or shifted them elsewhere.
Nearly one in five of its residents is unemployed, and Broadway, once the main shopping strip, is now a canyon of abandoned buildings.
The burned-out shell of one house, a landmark built by one of the city's founding families, has become a drug den.
This month, a heroin user there demanded that a passer-by give her some privacy to use it. ''Can you show me a little respect?'' she said. ''I'm in a park.''
Camden reorganized its Police Department in 2008 and had a lower homicide rate for two years. Then the recession forced layoffs, reducing the force by about 100 officers.
The city has employed other crime-fighting tactics -- surveillance cameras, better lighting, curfews for children -- but the number of murders has risen again: at 48 so far this year, it is on pace to break the record, 58.
The murder rate so far this year is above 6 people per 10,000. By contrast, New York City's rate is just over one-third of a person per 10,000 residents.
Many of the drug users come to Camden from elsewhere in the county, getting off the light-rail system to buy from the drug markets along what police call Heroin Highway in the neighborhood of North Camden.
''That is cocaine, that is heroin, that is crack,'' Bryan Morton, a community activist, said recently as he used his car key to flick away empty bags while his 3-year-old daughter played nearby. This summer, Mr. Morton tried to set up the city's first Little League in 15 years in nearby Pyne Poynt Park. Drug users colonized even the portable toilets set up for the players, littering them with empty glassine drug packets and needle caps.
Like other residents, he is resentful of the police union for making it so prohibitive to hire more officers. ''The contract is creating a public safety crisis,'' Mr. Morton said. ''More officers could change the complexion of this neighborhood.''
John Williamson, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, blamed the city for creating the problems by shifting officers onto patrols, where they receive extra pay, from administrative positions. He said he was open to negotiation but believed that the city simply wanted to get rid of the contract.
''They want to go back to a 1930s atmosphere where employees and officers have absolutely no rights to redress bad management and poor working conditions,'' he said.
Under labor law, the current contract will remain in effect if the new county force hires more than 49 percent of the current officers. So county officials say they will hire fewer than that. Nevertheless, they expect that the new force will eventually become unionized.
Officials say that simply adding officers will not make all the difference, given the deep suspicion many residents harbor toward the police. As the chief and his deputy drove through the Whitman Park neighborhood this month, people sitting on their stoops stood up to shake their fists and shout obscenities at them. When police officers arrested a person suspected of dealing drugs in a house on a narrow street in North Camden last year, residents set upon their cars and freed the prisoner.
The new county officers will be brought in 25 at a time, while the existing force is still in place, and trained on neighborhood streets, in the hopes that they can become part of their fabric and regain trust.
Ian K. Leonard, a member of the Camden County Board of Freeholders and the state political director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said he did not blame the union officials who won the provisions. But he said he believed that the contracts were helping to perpetuate the ''most dangerous city in America'' title that he and others hate.
''If you add police, it will give us a fighting chance,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''People need a fighting chance.''

HEADLINE: Romney Team Tries Hanging a Jimmy Carter Label on Obama

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A president struggling simultaneously to cope with anti-American tumult in the Middle East and fix stubborn economic trouble at home: Is President Obama replaying the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carter?
So Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan have repeatedly suggested, trying to use the glum precedent of the Carter presidency to taint Mr. Obama's record and produce the same electoral result 32 years later.
The Republican candidates and their supporters have played the Carter card not nearly as often as the Obama team has brought up George W. Bush, who lurks near Mr. Carter in the lower ranks on historians' ratings of American presidents. But they have pressed the Carter parallels all the harder since militants assaulted an American diplomatic mission in Libya and killed four Americans, saying it recalled the Iranian hostage crisis that dominated the news as Ronald Reagan ran his successful campaign against Mr. Carter.
''I mean, turn on the TV and it reminds you of 1979 Tehran, but they are burning our flags in capitals all around the world, they are storming our embassies,'' said Mr. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, on a visit to Ohio on Monday. ''We've lost four of our diplomats, and what is the signal that our government is sending the rest of the world?'' 
In a campaign stop in Virginia in May, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama was overseeing ''the most anti-small business administration I've seen probably since Carter,'' one of several campaign statements linking the current economic doldrums to the infamous ''stagflation'' of the late 1970s.
Historians say the broad parallels between Mr. Carter's term and Mr. Obama's make for legitimate comparisons. But many of the details differ, and some tilt decisively in Mr. Obama's favor, both factually and politically.
And even some Republicans say that Mr. Obama's greater personal popularity may mean the Carter label will not stick. Mr. Obama's latest Gallup approval rating was near 50 percent; Mr. Carter's was 37 percent in roughly the same period.
''The big difference is personality,'' said Frank J. Donatelli, a veteran Republican operative who helped run Mr. Reagan's 1980 campaign against Mr. Carter and later served as political director in the Reagan White House.
''Carter was dour, inward-looking, suspicious by nature,'' he said. ''Obama's not. Despite presiding over a terrible economy, Obama has remained pretty popular personally.''
Mr. Donatelli said he did see ''weak foreign policy and economic mismanagement'' as a valid criticism of both presidents.
''What defeated Carter,'' he said, ''was the public's sense that he couldn't handle the job. That's the point Romney and Ryan and are trying to make about Obama -- that however nice a guy he may be, he's in over his head.''
Gerald M. Rafshoon, who served as communications director in the Carter White House, said Mr. Carter's experience showed the hazards of a volatile world for an incumbent president.
''All the advertising in the world can be rendered irrelevant because as an incumbent, you're at the mercy of events,'' he said. ''The taking of an embassy was a symbol to Americans: 'Why are we being pushed around by this third-rate power?' ''
On the surface, at least, the recent anti-American protests across the Muslim world do bear resemblance to those in Iran after 1979. Both came in the chaotic jostling for power that followed the overthrow of authoritarian leaders.
But ''America Held Hostage,'' as ABC News called it in daily reports, dominated the news for more than a year. The standoff came to symbolize American helplessness and frustration.
By contrast, the deaths of American diplomats in Libya are not a continuing crisis. In fact, they prompted thousands of Libyans to demonstrate in protest against the violence, especially the killing of the widely admired American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens. Mr. Obama has responded, in part, with tough talk, vowing at the United Nations on Tuesday to be ''relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice.''
Or consider the risky covert missions that will always define the two presidencies, and the undeniable role of luck in shaping a president's image. Mr. Carter gave the orders for a daring mission in April 1980 to dispatch eight helicopters to rescue the American hostages; a sandstorm, mechanical problems and a fiery collision resulted in disastrous failure, with eight servicemen dead and no hostages freed.
Mr. Obama, of course, approved his own covert helicopter operation -- and its risks were underscored when one helicopter crashed. But the operation ended in triumph, with Osama bin Laden dead and all members of the SEAL team safe.
Mr. Obama began his presidency by reaching out to Iran and gave a tempered response when the pro-democracy Green Movement protests broke out there in 2009 -- a position the Romney campaign has seized on to accuse the president of ''projecting weakness.''
But the case for weakness runs up against Mr. Obama's record when it comes to the targeted killing of terrorism suspects, with hundreds of drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. On Iran, administration officials point to tough sanctions and the president's vow not to permit the country to obtain a nuclear weapon.
David Patrick Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of a book on the Iran hostage crisis, said the Carter comparisons were ''mostly unfair'' -- both to Mr. Carter and Mr. Obama. He singled out as ''utterly false'' Mr. Romney's claim that Mr. Reagan's tough reputation caused Iran to release the American hostages just as he became president; in fact, the Carter administration had negotiated their release.
''This campaign has become a kind of opportunity to fling around bogus history,'' he said.
David Farber, a Temple University historian, said Mr. Obama appeared to have learned from Mr. Carter's mistakes
Notably, the president has avoided any echo of Mr. Carter's famous 1979 speech about a ''crisis of confidence'' that he said had struck ''at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.'' While well received initially, it became a political millstone for Mr. Carter, who was accused of blaming the public for the country's troubles.
''Rhetorically, Obama hasn't fallen into that trap,'' Mr. Farber said.
Mr. Farber said the economy was getting worse in 1980, with the complication of inflation on top of high unemployment. However slowly, it appears to be improving today, making it less devastating to Mr. Obama's campaign.
But Mr. Farber pointed to image as the bottom line. Both men were ''outsiders'' when they reached the White House, he said. ''But Obama turned that outsider quality into a kind of steely leadership,'' he said. ''For all his gifts, Carter was never able to do that.''

HEADLINE: Viewing the Economy Through Campaign Glasses

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
ACCORDING to numerous economic indicators, the American economy is getting better.
According to the same indicators, the economy is not doing very well.
The accompanying charts illustrate that dual reality, and do so in ways that either the Barack Obama or Mitt Romney campaigns might choose to use if they were producing charts.
The short-term charts -- the ones the Obama campaign might endorse -- show the changes in four indicators since July 2010. They are consumer confidence in the current economic situation, new-car sales, new-home sales and unemployment. All have gotten substantially better during the period shown. 
The other charts -- think of them as the Romney ones -- are based on the same data. But they show changes since December 2000.
Those dates were not, of course, chosen at random. The earlier date came at the end of a great economic boom, when the economy was running at full speed and arguably a little more. In those days, there were newspaper articles on how hard it was for companies to find workers. The unemployment rate was 3.9 percent.
The July 2010 date came a few months after the American economy hit bottom. The unemployment rate then was 9.5 percent, down from the peak of 10 percent but still very high.
Since then, the rate has declined to 8.1 percent. That decline of 1.4 percentage points looks pretty impressive on the short-term chart, while the same decline is far less impressive in the context of the longer term.
Perhaps the sharpest difference in the charts comes in new-home sales. They have rallied strongly in recent months, and the short-term chart makes that rally look quite strong. But those gains have pushed the annual rate of sales -- based on the most recent three months of data -- up to only 369,000 new homes. That is little more than a quarter of the rate in the heady days of 2005.
Car sales were strong and showed relatively little volatility during the years before the credit crisis and recession sent them plunging. The recovery since then has produced a rate of over 14 million sales per year, more than two million below the pace that once seemed normal.
The consumer confidence figures shown are for the current condition, as measured by the Conference Board. The index is based on answers to two questions: Are business conditions currently good, bad or normal? Are jobs plentiful, not so plentiful or hard to get?
Americans are a lot more confident than they were at the bottom. In the preliminary September results, released this week, 15.5 percent of respondents said they thought business conditions were good, while 33.3 percent thought they were bad. In July 2010, the figures were 8.8 percent and 43.3 percent. Those are significantly improved numbers.
But back in December 2000, 40.8 percent thought conditions were good, while just 9.5 percent deemed them to be bad.
Similarly, back in 2000, only 12.4 percent thought jobs were hard to get. By July 2010, that figure had leapt to 45.1 percent. Now it is down to 39.9 percent, a long way from boom times even if it is an improvement.
In the days of vaudeville, a staple joke had one comedian asking another, ''How's your wife?''
''Compared to what?'' was the reply.
So it is with the economy. It is very good, compared to a couple of years ago. It is quite poor, compared to the good old days.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Looking Better, or Looking Bad? With the economy an issue in the presidential campaign, the answer to the question of how the economy is doing may depend on one's point of reference. The charts show four economic indicators, using a relatively short time frame that shows substantial improvement, and a much longer one, showing that current conditions are well below prerecession levels.

HEADLINE: Before Debate, Tough Crowds At the Practice

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a conference room at the Democratic headquarters, President Obama has been preparing for the debate next week, but the reviews of his staff are already in. Too long, they tell him. Cut that answer. Give crisper explanations. No one wants a professor; they want a president.
Hundreds of miles away in New England, Mitt Romney's team has been working to make sure he avoids coming off as a scold. His sparring partner, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, channeling Mr. Obama, has gone after him repeatedly, to the point of being nasty. The goal is to get Mr. Romney agitated and then teach him how to keep his composure, look presidential.
With more than 50 million people watching and the presidency at stake, the candidates will meet for their first debate on Wednesday at the University of Denver, and both are cramming like college students before an exam. But it is not enough to pore through the voluminous briefing books. Victory may come down to a single exchange, or a single impression, an answer that comes off as too edgy or, conversely, as too long-winded. 
Mr. Obama's team records his practices to sharpen his responses so that they connect on a more visceral level with the television audience. One of Mr. Romney's aides calculated his words-per-minute rate in the primary campaign debates to break him of the habit of feeling that he needs to rattle off the most statistics.
Mr. Romney's team has concluded that debates are about creating moments and has equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August. His strategy includes luring the president into appearing smug or evasive about his responsibility for the economy.
Mr. Obama is not particularly fluid in sound bites, so his team is aiming for a workmanlike performance like his speech at the Democratic convention. He is looking to show that Mr. Romney would drive the country in an extreme ideological direction at odds with the interests of the middle class.
For both men, it is a chance to reintroduce themselves to the largest audience in the campaign to date. ''The debate at one level is almost a Zen moment -- who is this person?'' said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who debated Mr. Romney during the Republican primary campaign. ''What's the larger story? What are we watching? What's the drama we're watching?''
As the candidates prepare, the first trick for Mr. Obama is finding time. His rehearsals have started late and ended early because of events like the tumult in the Middle East. He showed up at one practice just after speaking at a ceremony for the four Americans killed in Libya, and aides found that his mind was elsewhere.
''The ability to find solid blocks of time to do nothing but prepare for debate is almost impossible for a president,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''The world doesn't wait for debate prep.''
The president plans to decamp on Sunday to Nevada for a less distracting couple of days of practice.
During preparations, fewer than a dozen advisers are in the room. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts plays Mr. Romney. Aides press Mr. Obama about unemployment, taxes and foreign policy, and try to be ''as annoying as a White House correspondent,'' as one put it. ''You want to push the button and see how he will react,'' the aide said.
Mr. Obama is a practiced debater after participating in more than 20 during the Democratic primary campaign in 2008, followed by three during the general election. But this will be his first as an incumbent, presenting new challenges.
David Plouffe, the president's senior adviser, watched debates back to Gerald R. Ford's against Jimmy Carter with the sound down to understand how a challenger's stature increases by sharing a stage with the president. Other research found that incumbents unaccustomed to being challenged generally lost the first debate to challengers being taken more seriously by the public than ever before.
Obama advisers are acutely aware that Mr. Romney used debates to dispatch Republican rivals one by one during the primary campaign. When they watched Mr. Romney's recent interview with ''60 Minutes,'' they noticed that his answers were succinct and well rehearsed, a sign of the hours he had invested.
The president's advisers said they were less interested in one-liners and were focused instead on making Mr. Obama more accessible.
''He had a hard time getting every point across within the time limit,'' Mr. Plouffe said of past debates. ''You are trying to make a case to the people, so you have to make sure your answers connect with people.''
Those who have gone up against Mr. Obama said he rarely stumbled over facts but needed to show he understood that voters were hurting.
''Show them personally that you care about them. Empathize,'' said former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who debated Mr. Obama in 2008. ''Take a page from Clinton's book and say, 'I feel your pain,' or something like that.''
While advisers said Mr. Obama would present Mr. Romney as a dangerous alternative, the president has an incentive to avoid risks, given his lead in battleground states. As important as scoring points will be avoiding mistakes.
''The sale has been made,'' said Neera Tanden, who ran debate preparations for Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mr. Obama in 2008 and is now leads the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group. ''He just needs to reaffirm it. He just needs to not get in the way.''
By contrast, Mr. Romney needs to change the dynamics of the race.
''The debates are very important,'' said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney. ''We see it as an important opportunity to persuade those voters who haven't yet decided that Governor Romney would take the country in a better direction.''
Mr. Romney has focused on going after Mr. Obama without looking too aggressive. He participated in 23 debates during the nomination process, including a pair in Florida in which he effectively destroyed Mr. Gingrich's threat. But general election debates tend to be more sober than the food-fight-type confrontations of a primary season.
''He came in very, very aggressive, very well prepared and ready to stick with his pitch no matter what,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''That is a pretty good setup for Obama. The challenge he's going to have is he's essentially indicting Obama while standing next to him. He has to do it in a way that's firm, respectful and pleasant.''
During rehearsals, Mr. Romney has tried lines of attack suggesting that Mr. Obama distorts the facts and sloughs off responsibility on others. Mr. Romney's aides recall Mr. Obama's tart ''you're likable enough'' line to Mrs. Clinton in 2008 and hope to goad him into a similarly churlish moment. Mr. Romney will win, the advisers said, if he can force Mr. Obama to come across as condescending or smug.
To prepare Mr. Romney, Mr. Portman has played Mr. Obama combatively, attacking Mr. Romney as a rich man who does not care about average Americans. Evidently, he has gotten under the candidate's skin. ''We get the chance to debate one another, and after the hour and a half or so is over, I want to kick him out of the room,'' Mr. Romney said recently.
True to reputation, Mr. Romney has practiced for months, starting in June in Utah, through three days this month in Vermont. Once, when a problem with a charter plane kept Mr. Romney out until after midnight, his adviser, Beth Myers, asked if he still wanted to practice the next day. ''Painful,'' he e-mailed, ''but yes.''
All the practice in the world, though, may not matter if he cannot control the dialogue and keep Mr. Obama from throwing him off his plan.
''The governor's done a great job of convincing people that the economy's bad,'' said Brett O'Donnell, a Republican debate coach who worked briefly for Mr. Romney. ''He's got to do a better job of making the case that President Obama's directly responsible for that. That's got to be his focus. If it becomes about anything else, then I think the governor's at a disadvantage.''

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Cause Rise In Consumer Spending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans increased their spending in August even though their incomes barely grew. Much of the spending increase went to pay higher gas prices, which may have forced consumers to cut back elsewhere. 
The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August from July. It was the biggest jump since February.
Gas prices rose nearly 50 cents a gallon in July and August, but have since leveled off. Excluding the impact of higher gas prices and other price gains, spending ticked up only 0.1 percent last month.
Income grew only 0.1 percent, too. But after accounting for inflation and deducting taxes, income actually fell 0.3 percent -- the poorest performance since November.
The increase in prices and slower growth in pay forced people to save less.
''The U.S. personal income and spending data for August are worse than the headline figures suggest and indicate that subdued jobs growth is hitting incomes,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist with Capital Economics. The increase ''was largely due to extra spending caused by the surge in gasoline prices.''
''American household spending and income remain weak, indicating continued subpar growth,'' said Sal Gautieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The combination of weak income growth and a big jump in spending meant that households saved less. The saving rate dropped to 3.7 percent of after-tax income in August, down from 4.1 percent in July.
A price gauge tied to consumer spending jumped 0.4 percent, reflecting the rise in energy prices. It was the biggest one-month jump since March 2011. Excluding food and energy, prices barely changed. Over the last year, prices excluding food and energy rose only 1.6 percent, well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target.
Consumers spent 0.9 percent more at retail businesses in August from July. The retail sales report showed Americans cut back on clothing, electronics and at general merchandise outlets.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, released Friday, rose this month to its second-highest level in nearly five years. A separate survey from the Conference Board said consumer confidence jumped in September to its highest level since February.

HEADLINE: Chris Economaki, 91, Dies; Rumbling Voice of Racing

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN; Frank Litsky contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Chris Economaki, whose gravelly broadcast voice and prolific pen -- specifically, his manual Royal typewriter -- narrated the rise of auto racing from county-fair dirt tracks to a global multibillion-dollar business, died on Friday in a nursing home in Wyckoff, N.J. He was 91.
His death was announced by National Speed Sport News, which Mr. Economaki owned, edited, published and transformed into, by most estimations, the bible of motor racing. He also wrote a column for it for 74 years. 
Mr. Economaki maintained a romance with racing from the time he was a child sneaking over, under or through a fence into a raceway near his home in Ridgewood, N.J. He was soon selling photos he took with his Kodak Brownie camera and hawking the earliest editions of National Speed Sport News, then called National Auto Racing News, a weekly tabloid. By 14, he was writing a column, ''Gas-O-Lines,'' for the paper.
He introduced his distinctive spoken voice in 1951 to announce races at various tracks. It reminded some of a rumbling racing engine. A decade later, hired by ABC, he became one of the first television commentators in the sport. He forged a niche by explaining what mechanics and tire-changers did at pit stops.
Mr. Economaki reprised the role at CBS, ESPN and other networks, channels and radio stations. When Hollywood directors needed a racetrack announcer or commentator, they turned to him. He twice played himself in movies, in ''Six Pack'' (1982) and ''Stroker Ace'' (1983).
Mr. Economaki was a fixture in the sport in all its variations, showing up at Indianapolis, go-cart tracks, the Grand Prix circuit and drag races. Bill France Sr., who was often called the father of Nascar, was his patron. The champion driver Mario Andretti said, ''If he wasn't aware of you, you simply were not a factor in the sport.''
Mr. Economaki was considered the dean of American motorsports journalism well before he became the first journalist inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame, in 1994. The Road Racing Drivers Club said in his biography: ''No driver in any series, no publicist, no sanctioning-body head will ignore his phone call.''
Christopher Constantine Economaki was born on Oct. 15, 1920, in the front bedroom of his grandmother's home in Brooklyn. His father, Christopher, was a Greek immigrant; his mother, Gladys, was a great-niece of Robert E. Lee. He lived most of his life in Ridgewood. The family fell into poverty after the 1929 stock market crash.
Mr. Economaki said the first race he watched was on a board track in Atlantic City when he was 9. At a track near his home, he would sneak into races by lying on the running board of a car as it passed through the ticket gate.
He volunteered to sell 200 copies of the first issue of National Auto Racing News for a nickel each, and earned a penny a copy. Take-home pay of $2 a day was good during the Depression, he said. His high school yearbook predicted he would spend his working years in auto racing.
At 17, he said, he hitchhiked to Indianapolis with $15 in his pocket, spent a week watching races and returned with $3 in his pocket. In 1938-39, he traveled the eastern half of the United States as a mechanic for Duane Carter, a driver of very small racecars called midgets. He served in the Army in Europe during World War II and experienced combat.
After the war, he noticed that the most popular tracks had the best announcers, so he honed his speaking skills and became an announcer at a succession of tracks. In 1961, France, who had founded Nascar, agreed to let ABC broadcast the Firecracker 250 from his track at Daytona, provided that Mr. Economaki was part of the team. In an interview with The Boston Globe in 1983, Mr. Economaki said he had refused to read the lines a director gave him and instead wrote his own.
'' 'Not bad,' the guy said, and I went on the air,'' Mr. Economaki recalled.
He wanted to broadcast from the press box, but ABC could find no one to equal his performance as a track-side commentator describing the action in the pits. ''I try to tell stories while explaining the machinery,'' he said.
His signature line: ''This is Chris Economaki in the pits.''
After 23 years at ABC, Mr. Economaki switched to CBS Sports, for which he covered Daytona 500s and Formula One Grand Prix events. In 1995, CBS dismissed him after he used a racially charged phrase in a column.
Mr. Economaki's wife, the former Alvera Helene Tomljanovic, died in 2001. He is survived by two daughters, Corinne Economaki and Tina Riedl, and two grandchildren.
For all Mr. Economaki's intimacy with racecars, he raced one only once. At 16, he drove a midget car on a cinder track carved from a used-car lot in Ashley, Pa.
''It wasn't for me,'' he said. ''It was a really frightening experience.''

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Backs Proposal To Realign Airwaves

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government took a big step on Friday to aid the creation of new high-speed wireless Internet networks that could fuel the development of the next generation of smartphones and tablets, and devices that haven't even been thought of yet.
The five-member Federal Communications Commission unanimously approved a sweeping, though preliminary, proposal to reclaim public airwaves now used for broadcast television and auction them off for use in wireless broadband networks, with a portion of the proceeds paid to the broadcasters. 
The initiative, which the F.C.C. said would be the first in which any government would pay to reclaim public airwaves with the intention of selling them, would help satisfy what many industry experts say is booming demand for wireless Internet capacity.
Mobile broadband traffic will increase more than thirtyfold by 2015, the commission estimates. Without additional airwaves to handle the traffic, officials say, consumers will face more dropped calls, connection delays and slower downloads of data.
The F.C.C. will issue proposed rules for what it calls incentive auctions -- the sale of airwaves that are voluntarily given up by broadcasters in exchange for a portion of the auction proceeds.
A proposal detailing the program will be released next week, officials said.
The commission will seek public comments over the coming months.
''In this flat, competitive world, capital and talent can flow anywhere,'' Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said before the vote. ''We're in a global bandwidth race. It's similar to the space race in that success will unleash waves of innovation that will go a long way toward determining who leads our global economy in the 21st century.''
The auctions are not expected until 2014, but commission officials and Congress have estimated that the process could generate $15 billion in proceeds. About $7 billion of that would be set aside to build a nationwide emergency communications network for public safety officials, a yet-unfulfilled recommendation of the 9/11 Commission.
The auction proposal received widespread acclaim from wireless companies, Internet trade groups and telecommunications experts -- just about everyone, that is, except television broadcasters. Most broadcasters want to retain their airwaves, and they have disputed a brewing shortage of spectrum.
Industry lobbyists note that broadcasters gave up significant amounts of airwaves several years ago in the conversion of television signals to digital from analog format. That spectrum was auctioned in 2008, with no compensation to broadcasters, and industry officials grumble that many of the buyers of those airwaves have not used them yet.
Gordon H. Smith, a former Republican senator from Oregon who is president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said on Friday that he thought the high expectations for the auction ''may be premised on the mistaken belief that broadcasting is an industry in decline.''
Some major broadcast groups, including CBS, which owns more than two dozen broadcast channels around the country, have said they do not intend to give up their broadcast spectrum.
But Mr. Genachowski said he believed there were many small broadcasters, particularly independent, individually owned stations in urban areas, whose low profit margins and lack of original programming made them more likely to give up spectrum in the auctions.
Also casting some wariness on the auction details were the commission's two Republican members, who warned against making the auction rules so complicated that they exclude potential bidders, lessening the chances the auctions will raise enough money for the public safety network and other uses.
Robert M. McDowell, a Republican commissioner, said that the agency must remain open to public and industry recommendations about how best to structure the auctions and the movement of broadcasters to new places on the electromagnetic spectrum.
''In the past, regulatory efforts to over-engineer spectrum auctions have caused harmful, unintended consequences,'' Mr. McDowell said.
The auction process will have three parts. In the first, the F.C.C. will conduct a reverse auction to determine which holders of broadcast television licenses will submit bids to voluntarily give up their spectrum rights in exchange for payment.
In addition to seeking the broadcasters that will give up their licenses and go off the air, the agency will also consider whether to allow alternatives, like agreeing to allow broadcasters to share spectrum with another station or to move from a UHF television channel to VHF, which occupies different spots on the dial.
A second portion of the process involves repacking -- essentially moving and squeezing together the remaining airwaves so they occupy a smaller portion of the spectrum band, known as UHF. Once those bands of newly available spectrum are identified, they would be auctioned in the traditional format, going to the highest bidders.
Those three parts can be conducted either consecutively or concurrently, and the F.C.C. is seeking comment on that approach as well.
The F.C.C. also voted to begin a review of its mobile spectrum ownership policies, specifically whether it should revise its limits on how much spectrum any one wireless telecommunications company can own in a geographic area.
The F.C.C. now limits companies to holding no more than one-third of an area's available airwaves. Big wireless companies have said those rules, put in place more than a decade ago, should be changed to allow bigger holdings by dominant carriers.
Smaller wireless companies, however, say the F.C.C. should keep limits while also changing its counting method to give greater weight to the most attractive spectrum bands, on which signals travel further and more easily through obstacles like buildings.

HEADLINE: Merkel's Ex-Finance Minister to Oppose Her

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Germany's leading opposition party on Friday nominated a quick-witted former finance minister to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in next year's general election, in a jolt to a race that had appeared heavily weighted in favor of the incumbent.
The former minister, Peer Steinbrück, 65, vowed in remarks after the announcement of his nomination to put the center-left Social Democrats in a ''strategic position'' to build a government with the Green Party, a clear rejection of the so-called grand coalition with Ms. Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats that ruled from 2005 to 2009. 
''I accept this challenge to win the next election with and for the S.P.D.,'' Mr. Steinbrück said, using the German abbreviation for the Social Democratic Party. ''We want to replace this government.''
The Social Democrats' executive committee will convene on Monday to make Mr. Steinbrück's nomination formal. Sigmar Gabriel, the party's chairman, who had also been considered a possible candidate, said the leadership agreed two weeks ago to nominate Mr. Steinbrück after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the party's parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.
Many Germans remember Mr. Steinbrück, 65, now a member of Parliament, as an effective finance minister and a man of action from the early days of the debt crisis in the euro zone during his tenure as finance minister under Ms. Merkel from 2005 to 2009. Earlier this week, he presented a plan to rein in the financial sector that included a call for banks to create a $258 billion rescue fund.
''This is a good day for the S.P.D.,'' Mr. Steinmeier said. ''Peer Steinbrück is, I am firmly convinced, not just the best candidate, but will he will be the right chancellor for our country.''
Germany's Green Party, the Social Democrats' preferred coalition partner, welcomed Mr. Steinbrück's nomination. The two parties have ruled together in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, since May, when the Social Democrats soundly defeated Ms. Merkel's party in a regional election.
''We don't just want a change of government, we want a change of policy,'' Claudia Roth, a member of the Greens' leadership team, told reporters in Berlin.
Although Mr. Steinbrück has also won the endorsement of former Chancellors Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Schmidt -- the Social Democratic Party's elder statesman -- his nomination is not without risk.
Outspoken and at times abrasive, Mr. Steinbrück predicted in 2008, in the wake of Lehman Brothers's bankruptcy, that the United States' days as a financial superpower were numbered. One year later, he clashed with the Swiss over his crackdown on tax havens, likening Germany's Alpine neighbors to ''Indians'' running scared from the cavalry.
Last year, Mr. Steinbrück was upbraided by Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany's widely respected finance minister, for heckling him during a session in Parliament.
''If you want to become chancellor, you better learn some manners,'' said Mr. Schäuble, drawing attention to his predecessor's impulsive temperament, which could become a liability in a country that values moderation in politics.
The Social Democrats face the difficulty of trying to unseat a widely popular chancellor.
Still, there is a belief that Mr. Steinbrück has the strongest chances of the Social Democrats' three possible candidates.
''He is the best candidate that the S.P.D. has,'' said Timo Grunden, a political scientist at the University of Giessen. ''He is a candidate who can attack, who can polarize and who is most feared from within the C.D.U.''

HEADLINE: At Paris Show, Automakers Try to Dazzle Young, Digitally Entertained Drivers

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
PARIS -- The digital generation is apathetic about cars. And that's a problem for automakers.
Among car companies, which are displaying their latest products at the Paris Motor Show now under way, there is a growing recognition that young people may simply not care about cars as much as their elders. Smartphones now rival automobiles as the default symbol of adulthood, and the portals to the world beyond home and school. Electronic technology competes ever more for the younger generation's disposable income.
As a result, in Paris automakers seem to spend more time talking about how well their cars interact with an iPhone than they do about engine performance. Connectivity is the new horsepower.
''Before we talked about steering, ride and all those elements,'' said Gunnar Herrmann, vice president for quality at Ford of Europe. ''You could argue those are dropping down in importance. Connectivity is getting more important.'' 
That means not only docks for smartphones but also technology like voice recognition to allow devices to be used while driving, or Internet radios that can stay tuned to the hometown station even when hundreds of miles away. Audi showed a concept car in Paris with onboard Wi-Fi so that passengers could remain connected while on the road.
In essence, for the generation of mobile apps, carmakers are offering app-mobiles.
''I think it's true that the generation coming up now, who will be the car buyers for the next 20 years, are fairly unique,'' said Douglas C. Speck, senior vice president for marketing and sales at Volvo. ''They grew up in a world where computers and cellphones and connectivity all came together at the same time.''
Few auto executives are ready to concede that young people will not want actual cars.
'''They like iPhones and iPods more than they like cars' -- you hear that,'' said Ralf D. Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, which is undergoing a renaissance due to investment from its new owner, Tata Motors of India. But, he said in an interview here, ''everyone still needs to get from A to B.''
There is a consensus, though, that younger buyers will want to get from A to B in a different kind of car. It must be more stylish. Performance is still important, but it must come wrapped in technology that appears more environmentally responsible.
''They like technology. They like innovation. They like design,'' said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Ferrari, who noted that many of the company's U.S. customers were young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
The shift in the market reflects not only competition from smartphones and other technology, but also the growth in the number of people around the globe who are living in urban areas. Cars are often unnecessary or even burdensome in places where there is good mass transit or networks of bicycle lanes of the kind that cities like New York and Paris have expanded in recent years.
If a younger urban buyer wants any vehicle, it may be a fashionable small car like a BMW Mini or Daimler Smart that is easier to park, or even a radical new vehicle like the battery-powered Renault Twizy, which is beginning to appear on Paris streets. Half scooter, the narrow Twizy has four wheels, but the passenger seat is behind the driver.
Younger buyers, raised in a social-networking environment, may also be more open to car sharing as an alternative to car ownership. Rental car companies and car-sharing services like the municipal Autolib' in Paris or the commercial Zipcar in the United States may become even more important as fleet buyers.
The digitally distracted consumer, meantime, may be happy to embrace cars that can drive themselves, freeing the driver to concentrate on Facebook, Twitter or whatever social media may be prevalent when self-driving technologies mature in a decade or so. (Google has already built working prototypes.)
More immediately, manufacturers are trying to find ways to balance the craving for constant connectivity with the need for drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Voice recognition technology is already available in cars by Volvo and others as a way to operate some of the onboard electronics, and will become more sophisticated. BMW and others have heads-up displays that project information on the windshield in the driver's line of sight. These technologies are likely to become less expensive and more common.
While executives express confidence they will find products to appeal to the ''millennials,'' as they are known in marketing speak, the car companies also betray a level of anxiety. At a press event Wednesday night in a Left Bank hall usually used for fashion shows, Volkswagen seemed almost obsessively at pains to show how its model line was tailored to the young.
There was nary a driver above 30 in the short promotional films that VW showed between presentations by executives of its new models. There was a heavy emphasis on how the company was working to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. ''Sustainability is the key issue of our time,'' the narrator intoned.
Environmental impact, in fact, has become a main factor for buyers under 30, though many executives are skeptical about whether young drivers are any less interested in performance than their elders. They car companies contend that younger people still want to drive fast -- but not feel guilty about it.
''If you're not that good at fuel economy, that can turn off a younger buyer,'' said Chris Ellis, head of Jeep sales in Europe. The maker of off-road vehicles is trying to expand its sales on the Continent as part of the alliance between Chrysler, its parent company, and Fiat.
Mr. Ellis added, ''It still has to drive in a way that is acceptable to the customer.''
Carmakers have begun shrinking the size of engines, subtracting cylinders while adding turbochargers to maintain horsepower and acceleration. Smaller engines have become a selling point even in the United States, which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
In Paris, Ford was touting its three-cylinder, one-liter EcoBoost engine. Ford uses a turbocharger to get more power out of a cylinder displacement that would have been regarded as laughably inadequate a few years ago.
Cars equipped with the new engine accounted for almost a third of sales of the compact Focus in Europe in August, and Ford plans to offer the EcoBoost in the next generation of the midsize Mondeo, known as the Fusion in the United States. (It has not set a date for the introduction or said whether the three-cylinder version will be sold in the United States.)
Daimler and the Renault-Nissan alliance said Friday that they are expanding their existing cooperation with each other to jointly develop a new, four-cylinder turbocharged engine family. The cooperation between the companies is an example of how carmakers are trying to reduce the cost of developing new fuel-saving technologies at a time when the European car market is abysmal.
Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, said at a press conference in Paris that their cooperation on various component and vehicle projects had saved them billions, though they did not provide exact figures. Such cooperation is especially critical for Renault, which serves the midrange, South European markets hit hardest by the euro zone crisis.
''We are gearing up for many tough years in Europe,'' Mr. Ghosn said. He predicted that the decline in car sales that began in 2008 would continue. ''We have to be frugal,'' he said. ''The sale of products in Europe is going to go down.''
Even the high-end carmakers are boasting about their sustainability, partly with youngish buyers in mind. Land Rover has reduced the weight of its Range Rover SUV by about 700 pounds, or 320 kilograms, in the version that will be sold in the United States starting in December. Like the company's new Jaguar F Series sports car, which will go on the market next year, the Range Rover body and chassis are made almost completely of aluminum to save weight and fuel.
Younger buyers also seem more open to the trend toward smaller autos with more premium features -- provided the cars look cool. Martin Smith, design director for Ford in Europe, said the company designed the Fiesta to appeal to a fashion-conscious, late-20s city dweller. It became the best-selling car in the world in its subcompact category, he said.
Still, Mr. Smith indicated that carmakers had not abandoned hope that, like their parents, the younger generation would graduate to roomier Fords as they aged. As a rule bigger cars are more profitable for carmakers.
''Hopefully,'' Mr. Smith said, ''the overall experience will drive them into other cars as they get family.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Flexing the Wrong Muscles

BYLINE: By NASSRINE AZIMI

 BODY:
HIROSHIMA -- Shigeru Yoshida, the suave, cigar-smoking former diplomat and one of Japan's most prominent postwar prime ministers, has gained renewed popularity, thanks to a historical drama on national television and the talents of the actor Ken Watanabe.
In one scene, Yoshida points to the letters ''GHQ'' -- the initials of the General Headquarters of the Allied Occupation of Japan -- and renders them as ''Go Home, Quickly.''' 
Yet despite his desire to see the foreigners leave, Yoshida was able to work closely with Gen. Douglas MacArthur and a succession of former enemies. The ''Yoshida Doctrine,'' emphasizing economic growth and dependence on the United States for security, charted a realistic and ultimately successful course for his defeated and discredited nation. His political heirs could benefit from his example in pragmatism and statecraft.
For months now the waters around Japan have been teeming with territorial disputes, first with South Korea and now with China and Taiwan. The virulence of this latest Chinese-Japanese spat is chilling, and there's no end in sight.
Neither history nor geography are clear on the complicated ownership of the tiny islets called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. In this sensitive period of political transitions in both countries, wisdom would have dictated restraint. But in April, Shintaro Ishihara, the influential governor of Tokyo, threatened to buy the disputed islands from their private owners. His taunting forced the normally measured prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to take a hard stance by announcing the national government's purchase of the isles.
Across China protesters took to the streets, smashing and looting Japanese cars and property and littering the Japanese Embassy in Beijing with trash. Thankfully, the Japanese have remained calm. Still, the damage to ties between the two Asian giants has been extensive. Trade, which reached a record $345 billion last year, has been affected. Academic conferences and cultural exchanges were canceled. As of this week dozens of Japanese schools have called off their autumn study visits to China, and tourism between both countries is in free fall.
Repeating an oft-heard refrain, all five candidates for the leadership of the main opposition party declared during a recently televised discussion that ''a strong Japan'' was their most pressing goal, and expressed resolve to protect its endangered territorial integrity.
Is Japan's ''weakness'' real, and if so in what way? When politicians call for a ''stronger Japan,'' do they mean militarily, economically and internationally? Or is this merely a distraction from Japan's real structural problems?
The favorite scapegoat of many Japanese nationalists is Japan's Constitution -- in particular Article 9, which forever renounces war as an instrument of settling international disputes. And I fear that it's in for a new round of criticism, even though the benefits of peace over the past 65 years far outweigh its constraints. Even the conservative Yoshida would vouch for this point: When in 1947, fearing the spread of communism, the Americans made a volte-face and started pressing Japan to remilitarize, Yoshida stuck with the Constitution, keeping his country out of America's wars as he focused on rebuilding.
Moreover, Japan's self-defense forces can hardly be described as weak. In terms of military spending, the country actually ranks sixth worldwide. As to Japan's alleged ''weakness'' in protecting its far-flung archipelago, international law and diplomacy have thus far served it remarkably well. Indeed, under the 1982 Law of the Sea, its Exclusive Economic Zone, in which a country enjoys special exploration and resource rights, is far greater than China's.
Japan's weaknesses are inherent to itself, a post-industrial society of the 21st century unable to reform fast enough. Too many politicians still wax lyrical about the moneyed 1970s and '80s, of the ''Japan that can say no.'' But that era is not returning; the challenges the Japanese faced back then are not applicable to today's conditions. Saber rattling is of little value in a rapidly aging society: Roughly 30 million of its people are over 65, some 24 percent of the population, according to the most recent census.
Japan's very real problems -- its revolving door politics, rising social costs, energy conundrums, inflexible work environment, stalled immigration policies, decaying infrastructure and a depopulating countryside -- all need to be resolved. Yet its rigid, hierarchical system provides little opportunity for the young, women and foreigners -- precisely those who might help the establishment think differently.
It would be just as dangerous for Japan to forget its own strengths: It is a functioning democracy, a harmonious society with a powerful work ethic, a country of great achievement in science and technology. Surely the solidarity Japan received after the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 is proof enough of its international prestige.
The Chinese government has canceled events marking the 40th anniversary of the normalization of ties with Japan. This is regrettable. It is not only the painful history of this past century or even the current territorial spats that define, bind and separate these two lands. For almost 1,300 years -- from the adoption of Chinese characters, Buddhism and statecraft in the early 7th century until the Sino-Japanese war of 1894 -- the two neighbors were able of get along and even enrich each other. One cannot give up hope that they may do so again.
As Yoshida would surely have advised, the Chinese and the Japanese don't need to love one another -- simply working effectively for their own mutual benefit should be sufficient.
Nassrine Azimi is senior adviser at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research in Hiroshima.

HEADLINE: Spain Needs $76 Billion to Recapitalize Its Banks, Independent Audit Finds

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- Spain's ailing banking industry could need as much as 59.3 billion euros, or $76.4 billion, in additional capital, according to an independent banking assessment published on Friday. The report paves the way for Madrid to request bank rescue loans that European finance ministers have agreed to extend.
The number was within the range of previous estimates and well below the potential 100 billion euros, or $128.8 billion, in bailout money that Spain negotiated with other euro zone countries in June. 
And of the 14 banks assessed by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, half are not in need of emergency funds. These include Santander, BBVA and La Caixa, the country's three largest financial institutions.
Presenting the report, Fernando Jiménez Latorre, the Spanish secretary of state for the economy, said at a news conference that Spain would probably soon request about 40 billion euros, roughly $50 billion, of the European bailout offer. The audit, he said, should end the debate among investors about whether the Spanish banking sector can survive the consequences of a decade of reckless property lending. After Spain's real estate bubble burst in 2008, many of its banks found themselves holding growing numbers of loans in or near default.
The bailout negotiations, and the need for an audit to assess the extent of the damage, were prompted by the government's seizure in May of Bankia, one of the biggest real estate lenders, and signs that several others were on the brink of collapse.
The latest findings ''should remove all the doubts about the strength of the system,'' Mr. Jiménez Latorre said. ''The bulk of it is solid, and the problems are well identified.''
The European Central Bank and the European Commission both issued statements Friday applauding the audit and expressing support for Spain. ''This is a major step in implementing the financial assistance program and toward strengthening the viability of and confidence in the Spanish banking sector,'' the commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, said in its statement.
In Washington, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also issued a statement, which said in part, ''I strongly support the authorities' commitment to ensure that capital needs are met in a timely manner and that the weakest banks are dealt with effectively.''
Still unresolved, though, is an issue over which Spain has been wrangling with its European partners since June, involving the exact terms of the banking rescue. The Spanish government has argued, so far without success, that emergency loans should be channeled straight to the banks rather than through the government, which would add to Spain's debt load. Spain's credit rating has gradually been lowered by the main rating agencies, with Moody's expected to deliver another blow to Madrid as early as this weekend.
The poor credit rating is one reason that the Spanish government's borrowing costs have been higher than those of many other euro zone countries, which could pose an even bigger challenge for the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Mr. Rajoy and his finance officials have been pondering whether to ask for help through a bond-buying program recently announced by the central bank, which in many ways was designed with Spain in mind.
The problem for Mr. Rajoy is the stigma of seeking assistance from the central bank program -- along with the requirements for tougher fiscal discipline that might accompany the aid. He is already facing an increasingly restive public, and threats of secession by the economically powerful Catalan region, over the austerity budget measures his government has imposed.
And yet, the audit showed at least a potential exit path for Spain from its bank problems.
The independent report, which Oliver Wyman based on its own work and on audits from four other firms, indicated that the banks could need as much as 53.745 billion euros to be cleaned up, assuming that mergers and restructuring plans currently under way were completed. The figure would climb to 59.3 billion euros if those plans failed, the report said.
The audit confirmed the central role played by Bankia in Spain's banking crisis, which peaked in early May with the government takeover. Bankia's new board then asked for 19 billion euros to replenish its capital reserves, on top of the 4.5 billion euros it had already received from a government bailout.
According to the report, Bankia could need a slightly higher amount, as much as 24.7 billion euros, to meet required capital levels if Spain's economy remained in recession.
Three other nationalized banks face a combined capital shortfall of 21.5 billion euros. Among the threatened institutions is Banco Popular, a big commercial bank that faces a shortfall of 3.2 billion euros, according to Oliver Wyman.
The findings were in line with a forecast the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, made in an interview last month, as well as with a preliminary assessment by Oliver Wyman, which estimated in June that Spanish banks needed 51 billion to 62 billion euros of extra capital.

HEADLINE: China Alters Its Strategy in Diplomatic Crisis With Japan

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- After allowing anti-Japanese demonstrations that threatened to spin out of control, China has reined them in and turned instead to hard-edged diplomacy over disputed islands in the East China Sea to lessen any potential damage the conflict might have inflicted on the nation's softening economy and a delicate leadership transition.
With relations between the two Asian powers at a low point, China decided to go ahead with a scaled-back reception here on Thursday night to honor the 40th anniversary of the resumption of their diplomatic ties on Sept. 29, 1972. A member of the Politburo's Standing Committee, Jia Qinglin, attended with several other Chinese officials. 
But Beijing sent a not-so-subtle message to Tokyo by not granting clearance to the plane that would have brought in an important Japanese guest, the chairman of Toyota. Other Japanese attended the event, though, and at the United Nations in New York, the two sides met in private and sparred in public.
Around the disputed islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by the Chinese and the Senkaku by the Japanese, a large flotilla of Chinese patrol boats was being monitored Friday by about half of Japan's fleet of coast guard cutters, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported.
The protests in more than 80 cities, including in urban centers where Japanese car dealerships and electronics plants were damaged, suggested that the Chinese leadership approved the outpouring of nationalism in part as insulation against criticism of the party itself during the transition of power that formally is scheduled to take place at the 18th Communist Party Congress, now set to begin on Nov. 8. But the protests threatened to turn against the Chinese government itself, diplomats and analysts said.
Even though China has overtaken Japan as the biggest economy in Asia, Beijing's handling of the dispute, precipitated by the Japanese government's decision to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owners, highlighted the interdependence of the Chinese and Japanese economies, and the limitations on what the leadership could allow.
Notions of punishing Tokyo economically for buying the islands, whose status was left unclear after World War II, are unrealistic, said Hu Shuli, editor in chief of Caixin Media and one of China's chief economic journalists. So many Chinese workers are employed at Japanese-owned companies, she said, that any escalation of tensions leading to a boycott of Japanese goods could lead to huge job losses.
This would be disastrous in an already shaky Chinese economy, Ms. Hu wrote in the Chinese magazine Century Weekly.
At a time when overall foreign investment in China is shrinking, Japan's investment in China rose by 16 percent last year, Ms. Hu noted. The Japan External Trade Organization reported $12.6 billion of Japanese investment in China last year, compared with $14.7 billion in the United States.
Not just China, but all of Asia, could face a serious economic downturn if Japanese investments in China were threatened, said Piao Guangji, a researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences.
Exactly how the anti-Japanese protests were organized, and by whom, remained murky.
A rough chronology showed that immediately after the Japanese government announced it had bought the islands, protests began in Beijing and other cities. The protests then spread, reaching a peak on the anniversary of the Sept. 18, 1931, Mukden Incident, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After that, the protests were shut down.
It appeared that permission for the weeklong protests had been discussed at very high levels, said one foreign diplomat who had followed the events closely.
Analysts said the protests might have been used as a weapon by one party faction against another as part of the internal machinations over who would win positions on the Standing Committee, but precisely how those possibilities played out, if at all, was not clear.
Bold color photographs on the front pages of state-run newspapers, particularly of the protests outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, were evidence that senior leaders approved of the demonstrations, and suggested that, in some respects, they were even organized by the government, diplomats said.
Photographs of protests are rarely seen in the state-run news media, they noted. By running them, the government sent a message to the Chinese people that joining the demonstrations was acceptable, said a foreign diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with protocol.
Municipal workers in Beijing who normally guard local neighborhoods were called by their superiors at 4 a.m. on the day of one of the protests, directed to board buses that took them to the protest site outside the Japanese Embassy and provided with box lunches, one of the workers said. Their job was to provide security, alongside the police.
As the demonstrations grew in intensity, there were increasing signs that they might get out of control. Several protesters in Beijing carried signs saying ''Diaoyu belongs to China, Bo belongs to the people.'' That was a reference to Bo Xilai, the disgraced former Communist Party boss of the western city of Chongqing, who had developed a populist following before he fell from power this year after his wife was accused of murdering a British business associate.
Those signs were quietly removed from the hands of the protesters by plainclothes security men stationed around the crowd, said a person who watched one of the protests outside the Japanese Embassy.
A few placards bearing portraits of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong stood out among the Chinese flags carried by most of the demonstrators. A protester in the southern city of Shenzhen was heard on television shouting, ''Down with Communism!''
The end of the protests, however, did not mean the end of the fury against Japan.
At a meeting in Beijing this month, Western academics were taken aback by the depth of hostility toward Japan among Chinese foreign policy experts.
There was talk of ''conflict'' to teach Japan a lesson, said John DeLury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul, for making what the Chinese see as an unacceptable grab of territory that historically has belonged to them.
With the new leadership in Beijing set to assume full control soon, even as Japan may turn to a conservative Liberal Democratic government under the more hawkish Shinzo Abe in elections next year, a reduction in tensions looks remote, said Ren Xiao, a former Chinese diplomat who served at the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo.
''I think it will be less likely for the new Chinese leadership to make concessions,'' said Mr. Ren, now a professor of international politics at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''The same goes for a possible Liberal Democratic Party government in Japan. That's why I am very worried about the Sino-Japanese relationship.''

HEADLINE: Citizen Held After 9/11 Wins Right To Be Tried

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
A federal judge in Idaho has ruled that the United States, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, wrongly imprisoned an American under a law designed to keep trial witnesses from fleeing and that since there was evidence that the government may have willfully misused the law against him, his case should go to trial.
Judge Edward J. Lodge, who was appointed by President George Bush, issued his rulings late on Thursday in the longstanding case of Abdullah al-Kidd, an American who was seized at an airport in 2003, imprisoned for 16 days, repeatedly strip-searched and left naked in his cell. The Justice Department had sought to have his trial request summarily dismissed and denied having misused the law in detaining him. 
Mr. Kidd's lawyer, Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, welcomed the ruling, saying, ''It will finally put the government on trial for its post-Sept. 11 practices.''
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The department could appeal the decision or seek a settlement with Mr. Kidd.
Mr. Kidd, who was born Lavoni T. Kidd and was a star football player at the University of Idaho before converting to Islam and changing his name, was detained under the argument that he was needed as a witness against a former classmate, Sami Omar al-Hussayen. But Mr. Kidd was never called in that case and he has accused the government of using it as a pretext to hold and question him on suspicion of terrorism.
Judge Lodge's ruling affirms a June decision by United States Magistrate Mikel Williams that stated: ''The circumstantial evidence supports the inference that al-Kidd may have been detained for reasons in addition to securing his testimony at trial.''
Magistrate Williams, who granted the Federal Bureau of Investigation the warrant to arrest Mr. Kidd while he was at Dulles Airport outside Washington on his way to Saudi Arabia in 2003, also said that the information given to him to justify the arrest was misleading. He was told that Mr. Kidd had a first-class one-way ticket and had received more than $20,000 from Mr. Hussayen. In fact, Mr. Kidd had an economy-class round-trip ticket, and the payment was salary for work he had done for Mr. Hussayen's company.
In addition, the F.B.I. agent failed to mention that Mr. Kidd was a citizen, born and raised here, that his wife and son and many family members were in the United States and that he had never failed to cooperate with the F.B.I. Mr. Kidd was on his way to Saudi Arabia to work on his doctorate in Islamic studies, not to escape trial testimony.
Magistrate Williams wrote in June, ''Considering the affidavit as a whole, the information included about the plane ticket, coupled with the information chosen to link al-Kidd to al-Hussayen, is misleading and highly suggestive of illicit involvement with criminal activity, inferring a motive to flee.''
Judge Lodge added that the affidavit ''evidences a reckless disregard for the truth.''
Last year, the Supreme Court rejected Mr. Kidd's attempt to hold John D. Ashcroft, the attorney general at the time, liable for alleged misuse of the statute, the federal material witness law. The justices said Mr. Ashcroft had immunity, but four of them raised questions about the actions of the F.B.I.
The case was returned to federal court in Idaho.
Mr. Kidd, who described himself as ''anti-Bin Laden, anti-Taliban, antisuicide bombing, antiterrorism,'' said he suffered enormously from his treatment by the government. He lost his scholarship to Saudi Arabia and his marriage fell apart. He is currently living in Saudi Arabia, teaching English and coaching a group of young men in American football, according to Mr. Gelernt, his lawyer.

HEADLINE: Chastened King Seeks Redemption, for Spain and His Monarchy

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL and RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- With Spain mired in an economic slump, many Spaniards are questioning their king, long revered for his role in bringing democracy to the nation but now being scrutinized for his deluxe lifestyle and opaque fortune.
An accident this spring, when the king broke his hip while elephant hunting in Botswana, exposed a rarefied world of business contacts and set off an unusual public outcry over why the Spanish monarch, Juan Carlos I, was off on a pricey African safari during a time of national hardship.
The episode led to an unusual royal apology, but the collateral damage has left the king, 74, recalibrating his monarchy. He has stepped up his public appearances, embracing his role as an international business booster and conciliator amid rising fury over government-imposed austerity measures intended to help shore up confidence in the country's finances.
''The monarchy will continue as long as the people want a monarchy,'' the king said on a swing through New York last week, part of a palace strategy to meet with top opinion makers to help promote confidence in Spain. 
Europe's economic crisis has politicians and struggling taxpayers from Belgium to England openly weighing the costs of subsidizing royals. Unlike other European monarchs, Juan Carlos came to the throne after the death of the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975 with virtually nothing, and has worked hard to generate his own fortune beyond the annual 8.3 million euro budget (or $10.7 million) bestowed on the palace by the Spanish government.
The king is widely valued in business circles for acting as a sometime deal maker and economic ambassador for his nation, but how he has amassed his substantial personal wealth remains secret. The Spanish royal family's wealth has been estimated at up to 1.79 billion euros (or $2.3 billion), a sum that supporters contend was inflated by the inclusion of government properties.
To promote Spain's businesses and help repair his image, Juan Carlos took the controls this month of a cutting-edge NH90 helicopter during a visit to a Eurocopter manufacturing plant in Albacete. On Thursday, he inaugurated a new Barcelona container terminal.
It is all part of his campaign to advance ''Brand Spain,'' as the king put it in response to written questions, another palace step to demonstrate openness. His message for Spanish business, he added, is straightforward: ''Export, export and export.''
Juan Carlos's peripatetic role as a business diplomat and deal maker was brought into the limelight after the safari, which was subsidized and organized by Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a Syrian construction magnate.
The two longtime friends had worked together on a $9.9 billion bullet-train contract that the monarch helped broker last autumn for a Spanish consortium in Saudi Arabia. Leveraging his friendship with the Saudi king and other royals, Juan Carlos outmaneuvered a French bid.
Supporters and advisers to the palace insist the king does not receive commissions on the deals he mediates or promotes.
''They have tried to be more transparent by revealing their annual budget,'' said Herman Matthijs, a finance professor at the University of Brussels, who analyzes government spending on Europe's royalty and unsuccessfully sought information about the king's personal fortune. ''I suppose at least that he is a millionaire, but the question is: Is he a billionaire? What is their real wealth?''
Spain lived without a king for 38 years after the Spanish Bourbon family was exiled in 1931 and their properties expropriated. Franco, who operated as a dictator from the end of the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s to his death, handpicked the king in 1969 to succeed him.
The king's authority is limited by the Spanish Constitution to mostly ceremonial powers -- essentially a nonruling monarch.
Before his accession to the throne, the king was aided by financial advisers who created a subscription campaign when he got married to help build a financial cushion. During that period, the future king ''became obsessed with building up a personal fortune,'' said José García Abad, the author of two books about the monarch.
In this ''annus horribilis'' for the Spanish royal family, the king has kept himself at arm's length from an influence-peddling case aimed at his son-in-law, Iñaki Urdangarín, who is accused of using a nonprofit foundation to embezzle public money from sporting events and of exploiting his royal background to skip standard bidding procedures.
On his travels, the monarch can accept gifts in the name of the Spanish government, but there is no public list of the presents. Over the years, he has received yachts, an island home and luxury autos to add to his large collection of cars, provoking caustic Twitter messages like, ''The Spaniards in slippers and the king with 70 cars.''
In the midst of Spain's economic crisis, the king and his son, Crown Prince Felipe, agreed to a 7 percent cut in the royal budget.
But some opposition lawmakers see Spain's downturn as further reason to challenge the monarchy.
''There is absolutely zero control on the activities of the king and his household,'' said Joan Tardà, a national lawmaker from Esquerra Republicana, a Catalan party that wants Spain to hold a referendum on the monarchy.
Polls taken after the king's hunting trip accident in April showed that Spaniards forgave him, but most yearned for more transparency.
Supporters of and advisers to the royal palace describe the king as an irreplaceable resource with unmatched relationships with world leaders. They credit his skills in smoothing tensions between Spain's former Socialist government and the George W. Bush administration and helping to resolve disputes in Latin America.
''From a corporate point of view, he is Spain's No. 1 ambassador,'' said César Alierta, chairman of Telefónica, the Spanish telecommunications giant.
Some allies also consider him a crucial resource in advancing Spain's economic interests outside the country. The Saudi high-speed train is their case in point.
''Without the king, this contract would not have gone ahead,'' said a former Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos. ''This kind of contract comes down to a personal decision by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.''
The Botswana trip was subsidized by Mr. Kayali, who also serves as a key adviser to Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the crown prince in Saudi Arabia who played a role in awarding the Saudi train contract.
Mr. Kayali declined to comment.
Along on the expedition was a German princess, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, 47, and her young son and former husband. The Spanish gossip press labeled her the monarch's longtime mistress -- something she denied in an interview. She also denied that she had somehow benefited from her association with Juan Carlos through a now defunct Spanish-Saudi investment fund.
Ms. Sayn-Wittgenstein called the king a family friend and described her role on other royal trips as a strategic adviser to the Spanish government through her company, Apollonia Associates, which offers advice about high-end Middle East deals.
''The king is a national treasure,'' she said. ''When he walks into a room, he radiates warmth and charisma and he connects with everybody. Nobody remains untouched by it.''

HEADLINE: Shares Down for the Day, but Up for the Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks were mostly lower on Friday, pulled down by disappointing economic data, but the market posted its best third quarter since 2010 after a recent wave of central bank actions set off a recovery in equities in the last few months.
Despite Friday's losses, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 5.8 percent over the last three months, mainly on expectations that central banks around the world would take steps to stimulate their economies. That brought the benchmark index's advance so far this year to 14.6 percent. 
For the third quarter, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.3 percent and the Nasdaq composite index 6.2 percent.
On Friday, investors grappled with disappointing economic data on the United States economy. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's index of Midwest business activity showed contraction for the first time since 2009, falling to 49.7 in September from 53.0 in August.
The data follows other weak regional manufacturing reports and a sharp drop in durable goods orders last month.
On Friday, the Dow fell 48.84 points, or 0.36 percent, to 13,437.13. The S.& P. 500 fell 6.48 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,440.67, and Nasdaq fell 20.37 points, or 0.65 percent, to 3,116.23.
Reflecting the defensive tone, nine of the 10 S.& P. sectors fell. Only the utilities index was positive, up just 0.4 percent. European stocks dropped sharply Friday, with the Euro Stoxx 50 of euro zone blue chips declining 2.1 percent. Madrid's IBEX 35 was down 1.7 percent, as the early lift from Spain's new round of spending cuts, which had also bolstered Asian markets overnight, collapsed.
''On this last day of the quarter, the focus remains on the situation in Europe, which is causing nervousness,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
The euro fell against the dollar, closing out a second straight week of declines, as uncertainty persisted about Spain's bailout prospects.
An independent audit from the consulting firm Oliver Wyman released on Friday showed that Spain's banking industry would need 59.3 billion euros, or $76.5 billion, in additional capital to cope with a serious economic downturn. Spain, however, said it would ask for only $51.6 billion in European aid for its banks.
European governments have allotted a $129 billion credit line for Spain's banking sector.
The audit report was viewed as positive because the final figure on the country's banking capital needs was largely in line with market expectations, removing another layer of uncertainty.
The euro did trim losses versus the dollar after the news on the bank audit report, but the general stance on the common currency remained cautious.
Recent protests against austerity plans in Greece and Spain have also heightened investors' concerns as the turmoil could impede political maneuvering. However, stocks were off their lows of the day after Spanish bank stress tests were mostly within expectations.
"We had been seeing good data recently, but now we seem to be following the slowdown in China and Europe and we're seeing weakness," said Paul Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 99 30/32, and the yield fell to 1.63 percent from 1.66 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Talent Shows

BYLINE: By ROGER L. MARTIN. 
Roger L. Martin, the dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, is the author of ''Fixing the Game: Bubbles, Crashes and What Capitalism Can Learn from the NFL.''

 BODY:
IT was a thoroughly modern economic game, this three-way tiff between N.F.L. owners, players and referees. The N.F.L.'s unionized officials asked for significant wage and pension changes from America's leading sporting league. In response, the N.F.L. locked out the unionized refs and brought in replacements. The replacement refs struggled. In turn, players spoke out against the replacement refs -- especially after an egregious error that ended a marquee game between Green Bay and Seattle. Players, fans and members of the media demanded that the N.F.L. capitulate and pay whatever it took to bring back the regular refs. Finally, a deal was done.
But why the lockout, and why did the N.F.L. fight so hard? Because the league was fighting a bigger fight, one that is representative of a war beneath the surface of the modern economy -- the war between capital and talent. 
Since the Industrial Revolution, two groups have fought for the spoils of their joint production. On one side is capital -- the owners and investors who provide the means of production. On the other side is labor -- the workers who turn invested capital into profits. Traditionally, capital wielded disproportionate power.
As late as the early 20th century, capital brutally suppressed labor and ground down wages to subsistence levels. But labor fought back, aided by Congress, which passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The act paved the way for big increases in unionized labor wages, and union participation tripled.
Inevitably, capital fought back. Through the 1970s, owners moved jobs to Sun Belt right-to-work states. They automated, outsourced and worked to diminish the power of unions. When Ronald Reagan crushed the air traffic controllers' union in 1981, it was a clear signal: labor had finally been forced to capitulate entirely.
But around this time, a dangerous new adversary to capital emerged: talent. Talent, in contrast to the more generic labor, is highly skilled and portable. And in the 1970s, talent began to flex its muscles. In Hollywood, artists demanded ''percentage deals'' rather than straight compensation (see George Lucas's profit share on the ''Star Wars'' films). On Wall Street, investment managers demanded 20 percent of the upside on top of the traditional 2 percent of assets under management. In executive suites, C.E.O.'s accrued stock-based compensation so that they could share the upside with the capitalists. And, in 1975, baseball players won free agency, which led to the explosion of athlete salaries across professional sports.
Generally, capital was not amused. Yet capital capitulated because this was a different kind of labor, with unique, specialized skills that consumers want and need. Replacement air traffic controllers were O.K.; but not replacement N.F.L. players, or a replacement Harrison Ford.
The war between capital and labor became a three-way battle, with talent wedging its way onto the proverbial playing field. The biggest loser has been labor. Capital has given so much to talent -- because it has no choice -- that capital is even less inclined to give any quarter to labor. Capital is outraged because it is being beaten up by talent -- whether C.E.O.'s, investment bankers, consultants, movie stars, players -- and it takes out its anger on the easiest target: labor.
This is why income inequality is increasing. There are two kinds of inequality: the gap between the 99th percentile and the 50th percentile, and the gap between the 1st percentile and the 50th percentile. America's increase is primarily the former -- hence the ''99 percent'' movement. Talent is extracting more of the pie and getting richer. The gulf grows between talent -- the high-earning, differentiated workers -- and labor, those widget makers who support them. No surprise that owners have attempted to dissemble on this front, creating definitions of labor and talent that work to owners' advantage.
This is why the N.F.L. fought the referees so hard. It was attempting to prove that referees were replaceable air traffic controllers. The N.F.L. needs to squelch all its generic labor because its hugely expensive talent -- the players -- definitively can't be replaced.
The first three weeks of the N.F.L. season suggest that refs aren't so generic and replaceable after all, especially after Monday's ''touchdown reception.'' The response of talent was totally expected and undoubtedly exasperating to capital: ''Hey owners, don't be stupid; just pay these guys. You are ruining the game that makes us players rich.''
Sports has always been and will always be a metaphor for life. That's exactly what this battle has been. It is a metaphor for what will be the fundamental battle of 21st century business in America and beyond.

HEADLINE: Borrowing From Your Family, by Design

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
It's much tougher than it used to be for young Americans to make their financial way in the world, given the increasing cost of college and the challenge of finding a job with benefits and a wage high enough to cover the basics plus the servicing of any student loan debt.
So it's no surprise that many parents and other family members choose to smooth the way if they can, going into debt themselves to help pay for college and putting off their own retirement savings to help children in their 20s with health insurance, rent and other expenses. Other families, however, can't or won't help, which puts their family members at a distinct disadvantage. 
As I mentioned briefly in my column last week, the descendants of a farm family from Illinois have an entirely different way of providing an assist to the next generation -- a no-interest loan fund that assists family members who need help paying for educational expenses.
Many of you wrote to me wanting to know more about how it worked. Others reached out directly to 82-year-old George Lewis, the Quincy, Ill., lawyer who helped draw up the agreement that governs the loan fund, the Hersman Andrews Lewis Scholarship Trust.
''I got several calls,'' he said. ''I've been surprised that no one ever heard of the idea. I assumed other families did something like it.''
The family loan pool strategy was new to everyone I spoke to in the last two weeks, but it's not entirely new. The most prominent example is the one Berry Gordy, the founder of the Motown record label, cites in his 1994 memoir ''To Be Loved.''
His family built a savings fund with $10 monthly contributions from its members. People who wanted to borrow from it had to go before a full family meeting to make the request, and they didn't get anything without an unanimous vote of approval.
In 1959, as a 29-year-old songwriter looking to start his first record label, Mr. Gordy made his pitch and won over the group. The $800 loan had a 6 percent interest rate, and he was expected to pay it back within a year. Just in case, the family made him sign a promissory note that included a scribbled addendum requiring him to turn over future royalties if he couldn't make the payment within a year.
Suzette Haden Elgin, in a book called ''The Grandmother Principles,'' offered her own notion of a family loan fund that grandmothers can initiate. She suggests asking for a small deposit from everyone in the family, including children. Having the younger ones pitch in can help give them a stake in the process and a reason to track the fund's growth and its beneficiaries.
The Hersman Andrews Lewis fund was indeed started by a grandmother, though today it's a trust and a handful of trustees consider loan applications and make decisions through a majority vote. According to the trust agreement, the trustees take character, motivation and scholastic performance into account.
Trustees also consider the field of study, though the parameters are broad. Applicants can use loan proceeds for college at the undergraduate or graduate level or for a vocational education that leads to a certificate or license. Expenses for tuition, books, fees or room and board are all eligible. One law school graduate got a loan to pay for a review course for a state bar exam.
The loans are no larger than $5,000 per academic year or $10,000 in total at any one time. Any no-interest loan above that amount involves tricky Internal Revenue Service rules governing gifts and taxes.
Family members who contribute to the fund, which now has more than $111,000 in it, do not get a tax deduction. Still, that hasn't stopped them from bidding on various auction items every two years when the extended family gathers for a reunion. The balance of the fund is partly in safe, low-yielding accounts, though the trustees also made a bridge loan to older family members who were downsizing to a retirement condo from a larger house.
In 42 years, the fund has made 114 loans totaling more than $169,000, and there have been few difficult collection cases save for an incident involving a volatile divorce. ''We don't sue,'' Mr. Lewis said.
Loan recipients sign a commitment letter promising to ''exercise my best efforts'' to repay the debt ''within a reasonable time after I am financially able to do so.'' The trust agreement specifically notes that the trustees should not demand any payment until at least a year after loan recipients finish their studies.
The lack of loan defaults may have something to do with the smaller loan amounts. But there may also be something psychological in play here, too, given that if you don't make good on your debt, you're stealing from the entire family and everyone may find out about it. Trustees do also reserve the right to forgive the debt in cases of extreme hardship.
The Hersman Andrews Lewis fund already has one spinoff. When the widow of a family member died, she left $100,000 to the fund but also asked that her own family's descendants get access to loans. Rather than expanding eligibility to the original fund further, the two families chose to split the money in half, with $50,000 going to an entirely new fund.
That loan pool is now known as the ''Aunt Trude Education Fund,'' named for Gertrude Ruff Lewis, who was married to Carl C. Lewis. According to their grandniece, Katharine Newton, who is one of the trustees, they were of modest means. Mr. Lewis was a vocational agriculture teacher and his wife was a homemaker.
Still, they felt strongly enough about the importance of education that they wanted to help their descendants get as much of it as possible after they were gone. ''They had no children of their own, so we were like children to them,'' Ms. Newton said. ''This was their legacy to their family.''

HEADLINE: At Annual U.N. General Assembly, a Stage for All the World

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The annual United Nations General Assembly debate, which comes to a close on Monday with a final flurry of speeches, might be called a convention of knotty causes, some of them distinct long shots.
With dignitaries flocking here from every corner of the globe, the diplomatic jamboree offers a rare opportunity for people like Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, the caretaker prime minister of Somalia, who spent his time promoting his country this week as an investment opportunity rather than a byword for catastrophe.
Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who is running from the law, lobbied for his release via a satellite video, crowing that he was the true global defender of free speech and calling President Obama a false one. 
Have an idea about ending world poverty? That can pack a huge room this time of year, and attract a glamorous princess.
Critics dismiss the entire extravaganza, with its 120-plus world leaders and their motorcades, as the Olympics for bloviators. But there is no gathering quite like it for anyone with a global issue to press, no matter how tough the sell might be.
All week, Mr. Ali told the leaders that he could buttonhole that they had his country all wrong. Sure, suicide bombers have tried to kill him a couple times, but what country these days does not have woes?
After more than 20 years of civil war, Somalia boasts a new Constitution and a new internationally sanctioned government. The local Qaeda affiliate, the Shabab, which suffered a major assault on Friday, is on the decline. The country has the longest coastline in Africa, and one of the highest counts of livestock per capita on the continent.
''All they know about is piracy and lawlessness and chaos and the Shabab and famine,'' said Mr. Ali, 47, a former economics professor at Niagara University in New York. ''We are much more than that! We have more resources than Singapore!''
All countries hoping to reverse decades of ill fortune invariably market themselves as ''the next Singapore.'' Those feared headed toward the abyss are usually described as, well, ''the next Somalia.''
''We used to be called ''the Nation of Poets,' '' countered Mr. Ali. He wants development aid instead of disaster relief, a hard sell in tough economic times worldwide.
For the most part, Mr. Ali avoided the hectic reception circuit, focusing instead on meeting the roughly 40 officials who attended the ''Friends of Somalia'' meeting. He made an exception for the Australia party, however.
Australia is running for a two-year seat on the Security Council. Mr. Ali would not say it, but rich countries vying for that post tend to dole out new aid with zealous abandon. (Anyplace else, this might be labeled buying votes, a practice condemned by the election arm of the United Nations. In Security Council elections, though, that is called ''showing your commitment to development.'')
The Security Council contest was perhaps not the most important vote looming. Many leaders were asked to pronounce on the American election. Most demurred, although President François Hollande of France slipped in a sly endorsement even while proclaiming that he would not.
''I'm careful to say nothing because you can imagine that if a Socialist were to support one of the two candidates that could be to his detriment,'' he said. But wasn't Mr. Hollande offended that the American leader begged off meeting him or any other leader alone?
''No, I think everybody fully understood that Barack Obama is carrying out his campaign,'' Mr. Hollande responded. ''What's important is being able to see him after November, I suppose.''
One person certainly less enthusiastic about Mr. Obama was Mr. Assange.
Since June, Mr. Assange has been holed up in the cramped apartment that passes for the Embassy of Ecuador in London, avoiding extradition to Sweden for questioning on sex crimes allegations.
He maintains that is just a smoke screen for prosecution by the United States. The Ecuadorean foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, chaired a special meeting to allow Mr. Assange to make his case for asylum in South America on a scratchy satellite video, just a day after Mr. Obama made a resounding defense of free expression.
Knotty international issues rarely, if ever, find solutions during the marathon meetings. Mr. Ali, for example, did not attract any new aid commitments for Somalia. But the temptation of capturing even fleeting attention from so many leaders proved irresistible.
Denmark organized an event to allow Mette Hoffmann Meyer and Nick Fraser to show excerpts from a documentary series called ''Why Poverty?'' that they produced. Princess Mary of Denmark and the actor Danny Glover provided the celebrity glamour required of any such event.
Ms. Meyer, the guiding force behind a previous series called ''Why Democracy?'' has persuaded 70 broadcasters worldwide to broadcast the films in November, a potential audience of 500 million people. ''That's a billion eyeballs!'' she exclaimed.
Given the thin veneer of suits in the front rows versus the shaggy haircuts, hats and other hipster wear filling much of the sprawling room, it was not clear that the event attracted many leaders. But Ms. Meyer was not discouraged. She just wanted to inaugurate a global discussion on a topic politicians often prefer to overlook.
''We wanted to include that level of people in the debate,'' she said.
Some participants revel in the week; some deplore it. But given the hectic pace, most United Nations-based diplomats, like most New Yorkers, are happy to bid the leaders adieu.
Asked to summarize the entire event, one veteran diplomat riffed: ''It is running from one meeting to another meeting; it is checking that the cars are there at the right moment; it is finding a restaurant when suddenly a minister says, 'I want to eat a hamburger.' It is sending a security guard to Abercrombie to buy a T-shirt for a teenager.''
''It is really an exciting thing,'' he went on. ''It is trying to find the minister of Uzbekistan without confusing him with the minister of Tajikistan. It is finding that North Lawn Building, Room 17 doesn't exist. You discover that the interpreter only knows Italian when you needed Spanish and the minister only knows Russian.
''It is diplomacy at its worst,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Tip of Putin's Wedge Between Urban and Rural

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
YEKATERINBURG, Russia
IGOR R. KHOLMANSKIKH spent most of his working life on the gritty floor of a factory making tanks and rail cars. But these days, as Russia's most famous assembly line foreman, he strolls hallways paneled in marble and illuminated by cut-glass chandeliers, with aides and servants at his beck and call.
President Vladimir V. Putin plucked Mr. Kholmanskikh from his anonymous job and placed him in the most senior federal position in the Ural Mountain district after Mr. Kholmanskikh offered in a televised interview during the presidential election this winter to bring ''the lads'' from the factory and clear the Moscow streets of protesters. 
The ascendance of Mr. Kholmanskikh -- who leads In Defense of the Man of Labor, a new, Kremlin-backed movement of left-wing supporters of Mr. Putin -- represents a deliberate turn by the president. Using unabashed, Soviet-era language, he is picking a culture war with the idea of driving a wedge between the Moscow-based opposition and what is assumed to be his natural base of support among workers in the provinces.
Rather than appease the urban opposition, which seemed to be the Kremlin's strategy last winter, with laws easing elections and the registration of political parties, Mr. Putin has cracked down on protest leaders and looked to build support among people like Mr. Kholmanskikh and his movement of burly, cursing factory workers.
In this developing conflict, the opposition has made some costly errors, particularly allowing attention to focus on the Pussy Riot protest, in which an all-female, anti-Kremlin punk rock group staged a prank concert in an important cathedral, drawing prison sentences for three band members.
''The whole Pussy Riot affair seems to have been a gift to the Kremlin, which used it pretty effectively to drive a cultural wedge between the Moscow democracy movement and the more mainstream Russians,'' wrote Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
OUT in the blighted Siberian industrial towns, Mr. Kholmanskikh, a taciturn, strapping man who exudes not so much a politician's warmth as a sense of coiled anger at the post-Soviet decades of affronts and insults to industrial laborers, likes to drive that point home.
''People who create the wealth of the country with their hands should lead,'' Mr. Kholmanskikh said in a recent interview in a television studio built into his palace. ''The working class is not represented in contemporary politics.''
His movement consists mostly of provincial, blue-collar workers in their 30s to 50s -- ''Russia's rednecks,'' as they are widely known, and not disparagingly -- who have precious little patience for the urban opposition, ''people who are not very satisfied because they have a lot of spare time,'' Mr. Kholmanskikh said.
''If they worked more, they would protest less,'' he said. ''They should come to us and see real work. They could come and see train cars leaving the factory every day, the result of real work.''
The provincial, poor electorate in Russia, estimated to be around 20 million people, would not seem out of place in rural America. They typically tool about the Ural Mountain region in four-wheel-drive Ladas, like the one jacked up on monster tires parked recently in the lot of a metallurgical factory here. They grill meat, go ice fishing, ride snowmobiles and affectionately call one another ''real men.''
Mr. Kholmanskikh embodies the generation of post-Soviet Russian men who endured extraordinary hardship and humiliation in the 1990s, the once honored factory work of their fathers debased, and often unpaid, while survival came to depend on raising potatoes in a garden.
That, in fact, is how Mr. Kholmanskikh fed his wife and infant daughter in the early 1990s, when his factory, Uralvagonzavod, withheld pay for months.
''Well,'' he said, ''that was just my life. Everybody lived this way. Only now, when we look back on what happened, we realize this should not have happened, and should not be repeated. Our children should never know something like the 1990s.''
Only with the arrival of Mr. Putin in 2000, he said, did tank orders pick up and the factory creak back to life.
Nevertheless, some commentators question how heavily Mr. Putin can rely on rural Russians. Paradoxically, the 12 years of his rule as president and prime minister seem to have benefited them far less than the middle class that emerged in Moscow, where the protest was strongest. And if Russia slides into recession in the fall, as many economists expect on the heels of the European debt crisis, that support could evaporate along with jobs in rust belt cities.
''Putin still has the grudging support of many in the provinces,'' Professor Treisman wrote of the Kremlin's turn to rely on this part of Russia. ''But it is support with very little enthusiasm.''
THAT was seen in the parking lot of Rezh Nickel, one of the region's metallurgical plants, where Gennady Mineyev, a retired worker, was standing beside his car.
''We don't support Putin, but we vote for him,'' he said, revealing steel teeth in his grin. ''Who else is there?''
Mr. Putin wants to keep it that way, and Mr. Kholmanskikh is central to his strategy.
The extraordinary priority accorded to him was seen in his appointment, the first of Mr. Putin's after winning a third-term in the presidential election.
''I think that for you, a man who has spent his whole life at the plant, who knows ordinary people's lives, it will be right to take this post,'' Mr. Putin said at the time. He encouraged him to hire his former factory buddies as aides, as opposed to what the president called the ''office plankton'' who took to the streets of Moscow.
In Defense of the Man of Labor hosted a national convention in August in the Siberian oil city of Tyumen, and it plans to nominate candidates for local elections in October. Its broader appeal, though, remains untested.
Mr. Kholmanskikh has had no trouble highlighting his authenticity as a fan of Mr. Putin's who is also a working man.
Underscoring his credentials as a Russian ''muzhik,'' or ''real man,'' he has been compelled to rebut widespread rumors that he celebrated his appointment with a raucous vodka party for his factory worker friends in the palace. Absolutely not, he said. He drinks with friends in the steam bath.

HEADLINE: Thoroughbred Survival at the Racetrack

 BODY:
An alarming rise in thoroughbred fatalities last winter at Aqueduct Racetrack is prompting a much-needed overhaul of inept, pro-industry regulation of a sport that increasingly puts horses' lives at risk in the pursuit of profit. A report by a panel of experts said the lives of 11 of 21 horses that died at the track might have been saved if the state had had proper safeguards against overmedicated and substandard horses' running for purses inflated by profits from the new adjacent casino at Aqueduct. 
The report, ordered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, found considerable mismanagement of state racetracks by the New York Racing Association, particularly in leaving veterinarians' reports on horse safety subject to overrule by racing officials. A new equine medical director's office will be responsible for protecting horses, and the governor ordered far tighter controls on commonly abused racetrack medications. He also enlisted jockeys as whistle-blowers.
The report and the governor's recommendations for reform were the strongest alarm yet about a growing national scandal in which the industry's economic incentives find trainers, veterinarians and regulators cutting corners and putting horses at risk. An investigation by Joe Drape and Walt Bogdanich of The Times found that 24 horses a week die in breakdowns at American tracks -- a rate higher than in countries with tougher penalties for drug abuse and for trainers caught violating regulations.
Mr. Cuomo previously moved to take control of the scandal-ridden racing association and protect the industry and state revenues at the Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga tracks. He is wise to heed the experts' report as an urgent warning that far tighter controls for horse safety are needed to prevent further compromise of racing's integrity.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Ex-Gov. Spitzer

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
A federal judge on Friday dismissed a libel lawsuit against former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the online magazine Slate for a column Mr. Spitzer wrote in 2010 about an insurance bid-rigging scandal. 
The suit had been brought last year by a former executive at the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, who was the target of a prosecution by Mr. Spitzer when he was the state attorney general. The former executive, William Gilman, accused Mr. Spitzer of defamation and sought at least $60 million.
The judge, J. Paul Oetken of Federal District Court in Manhattan, did not provide his reasoning for dismissing the case, but wrote in a one-page order that an opinion would be forthcoming.
Marsh agreed in 2005 to pay $850 million to settle a lawsuit by Mr. Spitzer that accused the company of rigging prices and steering business to insurers in exchange for kickbacks. Mr. Gilman was among a group of Marsh executives who were later indicted; he was found guilty of a felony antitrust charge in 2008, but his conviction was reversed in July 2010 after new evidence emerged.
Mr. Spitzer wrote his column later that summer, responding to an editorial in The Wall Street Journal that criticized some of his prosecutions as attorney general, including his case against Marsh. Mr. Spitzer did not explicitly mention Mr. Gilman in the column, which carried the headline ''They Still Don't Get It,'' but referred generally to ''criminal conduct'' at the firm.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Spitzer, who now hosts a show on Current TV, said people on Wall Street who shouldered responsibility for triggering the financial crisis were trying to allow the passage of time ''to blind us to what was being done that was illegal and improper.''
''What the executives at Marsh & McLennan did was heinous, violative of the law, and the company settled for $850 million for a reason,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''The importance of the lawsuit is merely that hard as they tried to rewrite history, they can't be permitted to get away with it.''
Mr. Gilman's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Another former Marsh executive, Edward McNenney, had also filed a libel lawsuit last year against Mr. Spitzer and Slate; that suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, had been delayed while Mr. Gilman's lawsuit was considered.

''This president cannot tell us that you are better off today than when he took office,'' Mitt Romney said as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination. Since then, ''Are you better off?'' has become a central theme of the campaign, and is likely to surface next week at the first presidential debate.
Are Americans better off? By one important measure, that depends on who you are. Unfortunately for Mr. Romney, the group most likely to answer with a resounding ''no'' -- those who should be most receptive to his message -- appear to be the least likely to vote for him.
In raising the issue to such prominence, Mr. Romney is echoing Ronald Reagan's famous closing during his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter, which is widely credited with swinging the election in Mr. Reagan's favor. Exactly what he and other politicians have meant by the phrase ''better off'' is vague, but many commentators have looked to the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, household income and inflation rate as relevant statistics for comparison. 
By these measures, the answer is mixed. The unemployment rate in August was 8.1 percent, down from 10 percent in October 2009 but higher than the 7.8 percent in January when President Obama took office.
Gross domestic product increased at an estimated 2 percent rate in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second. While slow, that was a substantial improvement from the 3.8 percent contraction reported in January 2009, which was the worst drop in 27 years. Inflation was 1.7 percent in August, well within the Federal Reserve's target range and much better than the modest but worrisome deflation of early 2009.
Median household income for 2011 was an estimated $50,054, compared with $52,546 in 2008, according to the Census Bureau. About the best the Obama administration has been able to say is that trends show slow but steady improvement.
This ambiguity shows up in the latest polls. In a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS poll released this week, likely voters in Florida split 40 percent to 43 percent on the question of whether the United States is better off today than it was four years ago, with 40 percent saying the country is better off. In Ohio, it was tied at 39 percent, and in Pennsylvania it was 35 percent to 41 percent. Remaining voters thought the country was about the same or were undecided. But disaffection with the economy didn't translate into support for Mr. Romney, who trailed Mr. Obama by widening margins in all three states.
There's another measure that may help explain why Mr. Romney seems to be getting so little traction from the ''are you better off'' issue. It's the wealth effect, which occurs when rising asset prices make people feel more secure. And in that respect, the answer is clear. As Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told me this week, ''From the perspective of the aggregate household balance sheet, we're unambiguously better off than four years ago and are almost all the way back'' to the peak before the financial crisis.
That's because of a combination of rising asset prices, especially American stocks and real estate, and lower household debt. Total household net worth, which is assets minus liabilities, was $50.4 trillion in the first quarter of 2009 when Mr. Obama took office. It was $62.7 trillion in the second quarter 2012, which ended June 30. Mr. Zandi and other economists predict that it will be significantly higher for the third quarter ending this month thanks to this summer's stock market rally and recent strong gains in housing prices. It might soon hit the peak of $67.4 trillion reached in the third quarter of 2007.
A healthy household balance sheet is a crucial measure of financial security, and it affects a majority of the population. According to a Gallup poll this year, 54 percent of Americans said they owned stock either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and retirement plans. In that regard, they are much better off now than when Mr. Obama took office.
From January 2009 until this week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had gained over 55 percent. The Nasdaq composite index has surpassed levels last reached in 2007. There has been a stream of headlines and news reports about stocks hitting new highs.
Even more Americans own real estate. Sixty-two percent reported owning homes in April, according to Gallup. Housing prices are still far below their 2006 peak, but most of the collapse took place before Mr. Obama took office. The Case-Shiller index of 20 cities stood at 146.34 in January 2009 and hit a low of 134.10 in March of this year, according to Standard & Poor's, which compiles the index. This week it was 144.61, a steep 1.6 percent monthly rise from August. Even the hardest-hit low end of the market showed strong gains, and many commentators predicted housing prices had bottomed and begun a sustained rise.
The luxury housing market, especially in cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami, has fared even better, with many properties selling at headline-grabbing record prices. At the extreme upper end, several Manhattan condos have recently sold at prices close to $100 million.
For voters with short-term memories, these trends have been even more pronounced in the last year. Stock prices are up about 14 percent so far in 2012, and much of the gain in housing prices has come in recent months.
And a wide array of assets typically owned by the wealthy have surged in value, from jewelry to wine, antiques and art.
The combination of rising stock prices and a rebound in the real estate market may be a reason consumer confidence rose sharply this week to its highest level in seven months. The survey shows that the confidence is even stronger among people with higher income levels.
The wealth effect may also help explain why the rhetorical question was so successful for Mr. Reagan. The S.& P. 500 gained 27 percent during the Carter presidency, but those gains were more than eroded by inflation, which was near 14 percent when Mr. Carter left office. Median home prices went from $45,500 in January 1977 to $67,600 in January 1981, close to a 50 percent rise. But those otherwise impressive gains were similarly undercut by inflation, not to mention widespread anxiety about whether it could be contained. Inflation has been negligible during the Obama presidency.
Of course, the wealth effect benefits only those who own assets that are appreciating in value. ''It's a higher-end story,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has written extensively about the wealth effect. ''For most people, their wealth is their house. But I think housing and stock prices are having an effect. People are reading that the stock market is hitting new highs and that housing prices are rising. That affects future expectations. Look at consumer confidence, which is way up. It doesn't mean they'll go out and buy big-ticket items, but it does affect how they feel.''
Mr. Baker added, ''The irony is that the Obama administration has done very well for the top 10 percent of households and certainly for the top 1 percent.'' Mr. Romney himself surely falls into that category, given his high exposure to equity markets and the millions in capital gains he reported in 2010 and 2011.
By contrast, ''For low-income households, their balance sheets are still under pressure,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''Many have been through foreclosure. They may have student loans, and they're still struggling with credit card debt and auto loans.''
This is the group most likely to feel they aren't better off, and thus be more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney. But they also tend to be among the 47 percent of the population with no exposure to rising stock prices. Although Mr. Romney has said he wants to be a president for all Americans, that's the same percentage of the population he seemed to write off when he said ''my job is not to worry about these people'' at a Florida fund-raiser.
Conversely, people who are unambiguously better off would seem likely to vote for Mr. Obama. But wealthy people aren't flocking to the president. ''It's much more complex,'' Mr. Zandi said. Household net worth, no matter how much it's improved, ''isn't what really drives people's thinking. Many wealthy people prefer Romney's tax policies, and believe they'd be even better off with him as president.''
Still, the wealth effect seems to be blunting the impact of the question, despite widespread public dissatisfaction with the economy. ''If you look at the upper end of the scale, maybe the top third, their balance sheets are as good as they've ever been,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''They've got a mortgage at 4 percent and they're refinancing lower. It's basically free money. Their stock portfolios are back up and housing is kicking in. They're feeling good.''

HEADLINE: Philanthropists Weigh the Returns of Doing Good

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
ALL philanthropists want their donations to mean something, be it for a new wing for a hospital or to finance a program aimed at doing social good. Increasingly, though, philanthropists are looking for a way to measure the impact of their dollars.
There is certainly a lot of interest in impact investing -- essentially investing money in an organization, either profit-making or nonprofit, with the expectation that it will generate a social benefit and perhaps a financial return. But people who embrace impact investing as the future of serious philanthropy often seem to me like scolds. Shouldn't people be able to give away their money however they want?
Sure, you get a tax break for making a charitable donation, and some advisers to philanthropists argue this means you have a responsibility to give your money away wisely. The same could hold true for people making smaller donations.
Still, I had an interest in understanding impact investing better and was eager to sit down with Matt Bannick, managing partner of the Omidyar Network, an organization started by the founder of eBay that makes grants and investments in groups focused on economic and social change. 
Mr. Bannick's visit to New York coincided with the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual conference that has gained a reputation for encouraging people to make and fulfill bold promises about social change. Mr. Bannick and Paula Goldman, a director at the Omidyar Network, wanted to talk about a series of blog posts on the future of impact investing that they have written for the Stanford Social Innovation Review.
Their posts argue that impact investors should focus less on individual enterprises and more on entire sectors, like education or mobile technologies. It is a lofty idea, and I wanted to know how it could really be done.
Mr. Bannick pointed to Bridge International Academies, a Kenyan group that has created a ''school in a box'' that can be set up inexpensively in poor areas. Omidyar invested $1.8 million in 2009, and the group has built 83 schools, each of which cost less than $40,000 to build. Each one educates 343 students on average at a tuition of $4 a month.
''Education is generally where there should be sector-level change,'' he said. ''Bridge can scale up and affect millions. The real breakthrough is if others say, 'How do we bring this to Nepal or Cameroon?' ''
That program seemed like a pure impact investment -- building schools where they did not exist.
''It's quite possible we will get a nice return, but that wasn't the objective,'' Mr. Bannick said.
It seemed to me, though, that many impact investors are focused on problems outside the United States. ''People tell us, 'It's great you're working on education in the developing world, but we have our problems here,' '' Mr. Bannick said. ''The question for us is, How do we engage in a way that is catalytic? Opening a few new charter schools isn't going to cut it.''
I wondered whether it was easier to measure impact investments in places where you were bringing in something new rather than trying to fix something already there. With education in the United States, are the problems so daunting that it would be hard for any group to have an impact?
Luther Ragin Jr., chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, a nonprofit group that tracks and helps impact investors, said that education in the United States had been a difficult area for impact investing.
But he listed other areas where it has worked. He pointed to the New York City Acquisition Fund, where foundations, banks and government agencies have come together to lend money for the construction of low-cost housing. He also cited clean energy and entrepreneurial programs.
Where impact investing has not worked as well, he said, is in social services, like programs aimed at hunger and homelessness. ''Where housing is involved, there are clear streams of revenue that can support the investment,'' Mr. Ragin said. ''In social service investment, it's hard to determine what the revenue streams would be.''
(Data from members of the investors' council showed that 28 percent of them were making their impact investments in the developed world, 41 percent in emerging markets and 31 percent in both.)
Melissa A. Berman, president and chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, said that despite all the enthusiasm for it, impact investing needed to be seen in the right context.
''It's still small compared to philanthropy in general and tiny compared to the overall capital markets,'' she said. ''It's an important bridge between the two. When we step back and look at complicated problems, it's going to take philanthropy, impact investing and unfettered market forces to deal with things like poverty, lack of education and lack of access to markets.''
She added that making impact investments was also easier for individuals and smaller foundations to do since the investments tended to be small by foundation standards. ''An organization trying to deploy billions of dollars in capital can't do research on an impact investment of $250,000,'' she said.
Mr. Bannick said the size of investing opportunities is something that the Omidyar Network was interested in. It makes $120 million to $140 million in grants and investments each year and would like to invest in education projects like Bridge around the world, for example. But, Mr. Bannick said, it hasn't found a lot of similar groups.
For those smaller donors, the quest to have an impact could limit the causes they donate to, but it could also bring them the kind of satisfaction only the truly wealthy get. I found a group that was built on the idea of helping people do just that.
GiveWell, a nonprofit group founded by two young men who met at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, aims to find charities where the next dollar donated has an impact. Most of the money it directs to charities comes from smaller donors.
''We wanted to find organizations that were focused on improving people's lives,'' said Elie Hassenfeld, one of the founders. ''As we started doing research, we didn't find a lot that was helpful. There was plenty about charities that provided water in Africa, but there was no information out there to say if the well was still there a year later.''
To this end, GiveWell keeps its list of recommendations small -- two top charities and six ''standout organizations'' -- and it looks to groups that have a set goal in mind.
Holden Karnofsky, GiveWell's other founder, said he had been passionate about donating money to programs that promoted equality in the education system in the United States, but he grew disillusioned after researching organizations in the field.
''I believe in equality of opportunity, but I don't believe what is being done now is helping,'' he said. ''The gap between rich and poor students is there at age 5. I've come around on global health.''
GiveWell's top charity is Against Malaria Foundation, which provides bed nets across sub-Saharan Africa and then makes sure that people use them. For about $5 a net, the group can deliver something that saves lives and reduces malaria infections.
''In 2009, when we heard about them, they didn't go back and check that the nets were being used,'' Mr. Hassenfeld said. ''We talked to them about that. Now they go back six, 12 and 24 months later to see if people are using them.''
The group fulfills GiveWell's mission of making sure the next dollar donated matters. But it also shows the limits of focusing on measuring the impact: reducing malaria deaths with bed nets is relatively easy and quantifiable; improving the education system in this country is difficult both to do and to measure.

HEADLINE: Obama Orders Chinese Company to End Investment at Sites Near Drone Base

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, citing national security risks, ordered a Chinese company on Friday to divest its interest in four wind farm projects near a Navy base in northern Oregon where training missions for drone aircraft are conducted.
The order, the first time a president has blocked such a business deal in 22 years, is another step in the tougher line on China that Mr. Obama has taken in recent weeks, as Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have accused him of being weak on Beijing.
Mr. Obama, on a recommendation from the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, issued an order prohibiting the acquisition and ownership of the wind farms by the Ralls Corporation, and directing the company to divest the interest it acquired in the farms this year. Ralls is owned by Chinese nationals and is affiliated with a Chinese construction equipment company that makes wind turbines. 
The wind farm sites are near the restricted airspace at a naval weapons training facility that is used to test remotely piloted drones and electronic warfare aircraft that accompany American bombers on missions and can jam radar.
The president has the power to void foreign transactions under the Defense Production Act, which authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit certain acquisitions of American businesses if there is credible evidence that the foreign purchaser might take action that threatens to impair national security.
In 1990, President George Bush, acting on a case referred by the foreign-investments committee, blocked the sale of an American aircraft manufacturing company to a Chinese agency.
Obama administration officials said the timing of the order had nothing to do with politics. They said the president was obligated under the law to act once the committee sent the case to him.
The committee's timeline ''is determined by statute,'' a Treasury Department official said.
Ralls notified the authorities of the acquisition on June 28, and a 30-day review period began the next day. If the committee concludes that national security risks cannot be mitigated, the case is referred to the president, who has the sole authority to prohibit a transaction.
In an interview on Wednesday with The Plain Dealer of Cleveland, Mr. Obama said that while he planned to continue to push hard on trade issues with China that will help American workers, he was not ''interested in triggering an all-out trade war that would damage both economies.''
Beyond the political, the issue has national security resonance. The United States's near-monopoly on armed drones is widely viewed as coming to an end, and other countries, particularly China, have an interest in them, with far-reaching consequences for American security and warfare. While the Obama administration has aggressively embraced drone warfare, American officials are uneasy about other countries doing the same.
''Let's put it this way, we're not going to rush to make it easy for them,'' one senior administration official said on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was not surprised that Mr. Obama would stop Ralls's acquisition of the wind farms. ''It's very realistic that you would be concerned that the Chinese could collect intelligence,'' he said.
He and other national security experts pointed to a 1998 case in which the Central Intelligence Agency is said to have collected intelligence from Iraq by having C.I.A. engineers pose as United Nations weapons inspectors and technicians, installing equipment to spy on Iraqi sites without United Nations knowledge.
Tim Xia, the counsel for Ralls, said in a statement: ''We regret President Obama's order today prohibiting a jobs-creating wind farm project in Oregon. The project poses no national security threat whatsoever, and the president's order offers no explanation otherwise. The president's order is without justification, as scores of other wind turbines already operate in the area where Ralls's project is located.''
He said that Ralls would appeal the decision in United States courts.

HEADLINE: Should U.S. Stay Out of Mideast Affairs?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''America's Inevitable Retreat From the Middle East,'' by Pankaj Mishra (Op-Ed, Sept. 24), lays out the myopic approach to emerging nations that has cost the United States so dearly in lives, money and prestige over the past 40 years. He correctly points to the victory over fascism and the widespread belief in American exceptionalism as important components of this misguided path. However, Mr. Mishra's description of American power as ''waning'' doesn't seem correct; it waned long ago.
With the exception of the first Iraq war, we have not prevailed decisively in any major war since World War II. Even Korea was a stalemate. Rather than current events being a re-enactment of the fall of Saigon, they seem to be a continuation of a prewar colonial mentality. 
Despite our own revolutionary past, we have never understood the dynamics of emerging nationhood as it has developed since World War II, to the point that our nation's foreign policy seems to resemble the movie ''Groundhog Day'' -- repeating the same misguided actions. When will we wake up and finally get it right?
JOHN N. CORBIN Pleasantville, N.Y., Sept. 24, 2012
To the Editor:
Pankaj Mishra says American power is waning in the Middle East. I disagree; it is still as strong as ever -- just expressed differently. America has sought freewheeling democracies in the Middle East, unlike the British and French, previous peacekeepers in that region. The current turmoil in the Middle East, being stoked for political gain, will pass.
America should re-engage and reboot in the Mideast, not cut and run as we did in Vietnam. The re-engagement should be driven by more direct communication at the street level, not at the military leaders' level. How did the young democracy revolutionaries in Tahrir Square organize and communicate with one another? Via Facebook, an American innovation.
America should engage with the young unemployed radicals in the Middle East and share innovation and job training. According to the International Monetary Fund, the youth unemployment rate of 25 percent in the Middle East exceeds that of any other region in the world.
We need less aid (guns) to the generals and more ''butter'' for job training for the people.
JOHN TORRANCE-NESBITT Chicago, Sept. 25, 2012
To the Editor:
In the past week The Times has published an important interview with Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi (''Egypt's Leader Spells Out Terms for U.S.-Arab Ties,'' front page, Sept. 23), and Pankaj Mishra's Op-Ed essay, ''America's Inevitable Retreat From the Middle East.'' What they have in common is the argument that the United States can no longer act as an imperial power in the region, dictating actions and responses from Arabs or Muslims. Part but not all of this has to do with American support of Israel.
Propping up dictators (Egypt, Tunisia, the shah of Iran) or overthrowing them (Iraq) and assuming that Washington can control the results will no longer work.
I am reminded of a quote from Samuel P. Huntington's much misrepresented book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'': ''The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas, values or religion ... but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do.''
CHARLES D. SMITH Tucson, Sept. 24, 2012
The writer is professor emeritus of Middle East history at the University of Arizona.
To the Editor:
I am still waiting for the ''newly ascendant nations and awakened peoples'' of Africa and Asia to produce a legitimate democratic government that respects all people regardless of gender, race or religion, and treats them with equality under the law. While the United States is far from perfect, I have not witnessed any nation, especially in Africa and Asia, that even comes close to the ideals that we practice in America. The one that comes closest, and it is treated as a pariah, is Israel.
Imagine what would happen if America followed the advice of Pankaj Mishra. He seems to say that America should return to isolationism. Does he really think that the world would be better off if the Taliban return to power in Afghanistan, especially considering how they treat women? Or would other countries in the region be better off governed by Islamic fundamentalism?
America must become more involved and continue to serve the forces of equality and progress and freedom. It is exactly the wrong time for America to withdraw.

HEADLINE: The V.A.'s Responsibility to Homeless Veterans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 21 editorial ''Veterans in Los Angeles, Still in the Cold'' got it exactly right.
The Obama administration and the Veterans Affairs Department have not constructed a single housing unit on the 400-acre campus in Los Angeles deeded over a century ago to affordable housing for disabled homeless veterans. As you point out, this land is instead being leased for tens of millions of dollars to provide recreational facilities for residents of affluent neighborhoods bordering the campus. 
What's even worse is that in the federal litigation you refer to, government lawyers have repeatedly stated that the V.A. has neither the obligation nor the authority to provide housing desperately needed by veterans returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, brain trauma and other severe disabilities.
This isn't true; it's contradicted by V.A. construction projects elsewhere in Los Angeles and across the country and, most disturbingly, by the public commitments by the president to build the permanent supportive housing essential to getting these veterans off the streets and giving them access to psychiatric and medical services.
We must carry out our responsibility to the men and women who sacrificed so profoundly in the service of our nation.
RONALD L. OLSON LAURENCE H. TRIBE Los Angeles, Sept. 24, 2012
Mr. Olson, a name partner in Munger, Tolles & Olson, and Mr. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, are co-counsel for the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the government over housing and services for homeless veterans in Los Angeles.
To the Editor:
The dispiriting lack of urgency in housing homeless veterans in Los Angeles is mirrored in many other cities -- and conditions will only get worse if leaders in Washington cut more than 100,000 troops from active duty, as is currently planned to reduce the defense budget. Many of these troops will exchange the dangerous mountains of Afghanistan for the dispiriting lines of the unemployment office. And they'll probably face unexpectedly higher health care premiums -- another Washington proposal to reduce costs.
All Americans understand the need to reduce the deficit. But before Washington tries to wring savings from our troops and our veterans, it should take every possible step to cut waste and increase efficiency. How can we fail to help homeless veterans while the trillion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter program continues to run billions of dollars over its budget and the Pentagon wastes billions more each year through inefficient bureaucracy?
We've already asked our brave men and women in uniform to risk their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. We shouldn't ask them to balance our budgets too.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
The White House's shifting accountsof the lethal attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya have left President Obama suddenly exposed on national security and foreign policy, where the Romney campaign is now sensing an opportunity, Mark Landler reports. Beyond partisan politics, the attack calls into question the accuracy of United States intelligence gathering and the adequacy of the protection of the country's vulnerable personnel overseas.
        
With more than 50 million people expected to watch and a presidency at stake, both President Obama and Mitt Romney plan to use their first debate on Wednesday to reintroduce themselves to voters, Peter Baker and Ashley Parker write. 
        
Mitt Romney used more tempered language to describe his tax plan this week, dismaying conservative supporters who liked the tougher tone they heard in primary season, Michael Cooper reports. 
        
Mr. Obama issued an order prohibiting a Chinese company's acquisition and ownership of four wind farm projects near a Navy base in northern Oregon where training missions for drone aircrafts are conducted, Helene Cooper reports. The order is another step in the president's tougher line on China after Republicans accused him of being weak on Beijing.
        
As Mr. Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan try to use the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carterto taint President Obama's record, historians agree that the parallels between the two Democrats make for legitimate comparisons, Scott Shane writes. But many of the details differ, and some tilt decisively in Mr. Obama's favor. 
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama discussed one of the biggest causes of the financial crisis in this week's address: the housing market. "When the party stopped, and the housing bubble burst, it pushed our entire economy into a historic recession - and left middle-class families holding the bag," he said. "Four years later, the housing market is healing." Still, he said, millions are still struggling with their mortgages, which is why the administration teamed up with state attorneys general to help secure a settlement from the nation's biggest banks to help families stay in their homes. "When folks are spending less on mortgage payments, they're spending more at local businesses," he said. "And when those businesses have more customers, they start hiring more workers."
 Around the Web 

        
The Obama campaign could double as a party-planning committee. It will be hosting more than 3,200 debate-watching parties across the nation next Wednesday, Politico reports.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Middle school students from across the country will compete in the National Geographic S.T.E.M. competition, where they will showcase projects on artificial intelligence and tsunami safety systems. 
        
The North American Police Equestrian Championships will take place in Gaithersburg, Md., with competition in events like "the fleeing felon course."

HEADLINE: In Crisis With Japan, China Adjusts Strategy but Does Not Back Down

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- After allowing anti-Japanese demonstrations that threatened to spin out of control, China has reined them in and turned instead to hard-edged diplomacy over disputed islands in the East China Sea to lessen any potential damage the conflict might have inflicted on the nation's softening economy and a delicate leadership transition.
With relations between the two Asian powers at a low point, China decided to go ahead with a scaled-back reception here on Thursday night to honor the 40th anniversary of the resumption of their diplomatic ties on Sept. 29, 1972. A member of the Politburo's Standing Committee, Jia Qinglin, attended with several other Chinese officials.
But Beijing sent a not-so-subtle message to Tokyo by not granting clearance to the plane that would have brought in an important Japanese guest, the chairman of Toyota. Other Japanese attended the event, though, and at the United Nations in New York, the two sides met in private and sparred in public. 
Around the disputed islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by the Chinese and the Senkaku by the Japanese, a large flotilla of Chinese patrol boats was being monitored Friday by about half of Japan's fleet of coast guard cutters, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported.
The protests in more than 80 cities, including in urban centers where Japanese car dealerships and electronics plants were damaged, suggested that the Chinese leadership approved the outpouring of nationalism in part as insulation against criticism of the party itself during the transition of power that formally is scheduled to take place at the 18th Communist Party Congress, now set to begin on Nov. 8. But the protests threatened to turn against the Chinese government itself, diplomats and analysts said.
Even though China has overtaken Japan as the biggest economy in Asia, Beijing's handling of the dispute, precipitated by the Japanese government's decision to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owners, highlighted the interdependence of the Chinese and Japanese economies, and the limitations on what the leadership could allow.
Notions of punishing Tokyo economically for buying the islands, whose status was left unclear after World War II, are unrealistic, said Hu Shuli, editor in chief of Caixin Media and one of China's chief economic journalists. So many Chinese workers are employed at Japanese-owned companies, she said, that any escalation of tensions leading to a boycott of Japanese goods could lead to huge job losses.
This would be disastrous in an already shaky Chinese economy, Ms. Hu wrote in the Chinese magazine Century Weekly.
At a time when overall foreign investment in China is shrinking, Japan's investment in China rose by 16 percent last year, Ms. Hu noted. The Japan External Trade Organization reported $12.6 billion of Japanese investment in China last year, compared with $14.7 billion in the United States.
Not just China, but all of Asia, could face a serious economic downturn if Japanese investments in China were threatened, said Piao Guangji, a researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences.
Exactly how the anti-Japanese protests were organized, and by whom, remained murky.
A rough chronology showed that immediately after the Japanese government announced it had bought the islands, protests began in Beijing and other cities. The protests then spread, reaching a peak on the anniversary of the Sept. 18, 1931, Mukden Incident, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After that, the protests were shut down.
It appeared that permission for the weeklong protests had been discussed at very high levels, said one foreign diplomat who had followed the events closely.
Analysts said the protests might have been used as a weapon by one party faction against another as part of the internal machinations over who would win positions on the Standing Committee, but precisely how those possibilities played out, if at all, was not clear.
Bold color photographs on the front pages of state-run newspapers, particularly of the protests outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, were evidence that senior leaders approved of the demonstrations, and suggested that, in some respects, they were even organized by the government, diplomats said.
Photographs of protests are rarely seen in the state-run news media, they noted. By running them, the government sent a message to the Chinese people that joining the demonstrations was acceptable, said a foreign diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with protocol.
Municipal workers in Beijing who normally guard local neighborhoods were called by their superiors at 4 a.m. on the day of one of the protests, directed to board buses that took them to the protest site outside the Japanese Embassy and provided with box lunches, one of the workers said. Their job was to provide security, alongside the police.
As the demonstrations grew in intensity, there were increasing signs that they might get out of control. Several protesters in Beijing carried signs saying ''Diaoyu belongs to China, Bo belongs to the people.'' That was a reference to Bo Xilai, the disgraced former Communist Party boss of the western city of Chongqing, who had developed a populist following before he fell from power this year after his wife was accused of murdering a British business associate.
Those signs were quietly removed from the hands of the protesters by plainclothes security men stationed around the crowd, said a person who watched one of the protests outside the Japanese Embassy.
A few placards bearing portraits of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong stood out among the Chinese flags carried by most of the demonstrators. A protester in the southern city of Shenzhen was heard on television shouting, ''Down with Communism!''
The end of the protests, however, did not mean the end of the fury against Japan.
At a meeting in Beijing this month, Western academics were taken aback by the depth of hostility toward Japan among Chinese foreign policy experts.
There was talk of ''conflict'' to teach Japan a lesson, said John DeLury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul, for making what the Chinese see as an unacceptable grab of territory that historically has belonged to them.
With the new leadership in Beijing set to assume full control soon, even as Japan may turn to a conservative Liberal Democratic government under the more hawkish Shinzo Abe in elections next year, a reduction in tensions looks remote, said Ren Xiao, a former Chinese diplomat who served at the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo.
''I think it will be less likely for the new Chinese leadership to make concessions,'' said Mr. Ren, now a professor of international politics at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''The same goes for a possible Liberal Democratic Party government in Japan. That's why I am very worried about the Sino-Japanese relationship.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Till Death, or 20 Years, Do Us Part

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
IT makes little sense to explore a new era of family values based around Hollywood couplings. Or, worse yet, around mere rumors of the way movie stars conduct their marital affairs.
But might there be seeds of something worth considering in one such rumor, that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes signed a five-year marriage contract?
It's a dim data point but not an isolated one, suggesting people are rethinking marriage, at least around the edges. Prenuptial agreements, a different sort of contract, are on the rise, as is vowless cohabitation. The ages at which people marry have hit record highs, 28.7 years for men and 26.5 for women. And gay marriage has provoked widespread conversation about the institution's meaning and place.
Last year, several lawmakers in Mexico City proposed the creation of short-term, renewable marriage contracts with terms as brief as two years. The idea was to own up to the reality that marriages fail about half the time. 
Is marriage headed for an overhaul? A fundamental rethinking? Is it due for one?
When the Mexican legislators proposed their idea, which was not passed, the archdiocese there called it ''absurd'' and said it was anathema to the nature of marriage. I decided to put the questions to a different group: the people who study marriage and divorce. I was motivated not just by trend lines but, as a child of divorce, by ghosts.
I asked whether society should consider something like a 20-year marriage contract, my own modest proposal that, as in the one from Mexico, acknowledges the harsh truth that nearly half of marriages in the United States end in divorce and many others are miserable. The rough idea: two people, two decades, enough time to have and raise children if that's your thing; a new status quo, a ceremony with a shelf life, till awhile do us part.
But despite having proposed it, whimsically, as a journalistic expedition, I found myself surprised and even unnerved by the extent to which some experts I spoke with say there is a need to rethink an institution that so often fails.
''We're remarkably not innovative about marriage even though almost all the environmental conditions, writ large, have changed,'' said Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington and author of books on love, sex and marriage. ''We haven't scrutinized it. We've been picking at it like a scab, and it's not going to heal that way.''
The kinds of things that are changing: we're living longer; we live apart from families and are less inclined to religion, both marriage support systems; technology makes it easier than ever flirt or cheat and fuels instant gratification (''I will absolutely invest in this marriage after I watch this cat video'').
Over all, divorce rates have ticked down over the last 20 years, but just slightly. There is a growing marriage gap that mirrors the income gap, with people who are more educated and marry later in life more likely to stay married than less-educated people who marry earlier. And growing numbers of older people are getting divorced; a Bowling Green State University study found that the divorce rate for people 50 to 64 has doubled since 1990, and tripled for those 65 and above.
Dr. Schwartz said that gay marriage had become a tipping point to rethink marriage because it simply opened questions most people have been terrified to broach: Is there any other way to do this? Will doing so change the world?
Maybe, she said, for the better. As to my suggestion of a 20-year contract, she countered that people could do contracts of any number of years, adding: ''It's back to the past, which used to involve dowry, bride price, economic arrangement. Nobody pretended this was not an economic arrangement.'' The idea of contracts ''isn't new.''
But, she said, ''it's newly arrived at after a period of extreme romanticism.''
Kenneth P. Altshuler, the president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, the divorce-attorney trade group, said such contracts were neither so absurd nor impractical as they might sound. He thinks they could address some of the financial costs associated with divorce, which he estimates at hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
One key, he said, would be figuring out a formula for predetermining alimony, given the extent to which money becomes a proxy for bitterness during divorce. That could be solved, he said, through something like tables that show what payments each spouse would make based on his or her eventual income in Year 20.
In fact, he said that such tables already exist in some states for divorce settlements and that they exist in all states for purposes of deciding child support. Those tables, he said, have helped cut back sharply the level of divorce litigation.
But does it make sense to take another step by, say, codifying renewable marriage contracts? After all, should we take cues from the star of ''Mission: Impossible''?
As a thought experiment, Mr. Altshuler said, sure, given the lie we're currently telling ourselves. There's still a fantasy of Ozzie and Harriet, he said, ''and if that's what we've decided we're striving for, we are failing miserably.''
''So perhaps we need to change our expectations so we're not so unhappy,'' he said.
In his line of work, he tends to see divorces happen around seven years, the itch (statistically, most happen in the first seven years), and also around the 20-year mark, or, more to the point, when children leave home. He said it was a very clear pattern: parents focus on the kids, their work, grow apart, can't find each other again.
MY own folks split after 20 years, when I went to college. I don't think about it much. I've got a great marriage that, I'd bet the farm, ends no sooner than hospice. But my parents' mostly amicable split pops into my head sometimes when child-rearing. With my kids, I celebrate our unit. Big time. My son, though just 4, does, too, to the point that a preschool teacher told us with a laugh, ''Milo always talks about 'his family.' '' I feel a twinge; he's bought in just as I did.
I'm right to worry, if not for our son and daughter, then in general about how rampant divorce affects children, said Robert E. Emery, psychology professor at the University of Virginia, and author of ''The Truth about Children and Divorce.''
''They're devastated,'' he said. In the long run, children of divorce wind up no worse off than children from married families, but in the shorter run ''they're at risk for all kinds of psychological problems.''
A marriage contract, he said, wouldn't change that unless it had the effect of creating ''a cultural sense that divorce is part of life.''
This is the one point of agreement I heard: To the extent reform of marriage can destigmatize divorce, own up to its regularity, it will diminish disappointment, limit the emotional toll. Particularly for the children. (That said, Susan L. Brown, a sociologist at Bowling Green and the co-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research, noted that part of the damage done to children of divorce comes not from disappointment but from disruption of the rhythm of life.)
Dr. Emery thinks people are already innovating around marriage through coupling later and cohabitation. The marketplace of ideas (and emotions), he said, is responding to a widespread terror of divorce. But not yet with a clear alternative.
For instance, cohabitation isn't making us happier. Bowling Green found in a 2010 study that of cohabitating couples, 36 percent say both partners are ''very satisfied,'' compared to 57 percent for married couples.
Dr. Emery favors a candid, apolitical reckoning: an acknowledgment that marriage is not a sexfest with a flawless best friend but something that takes enormous investment. And that can pay off. Lifelong coupling, he says, bestows great benefits, including longer lives for men (''They're being nagged by a partner with selfish interest in their long-term health'').
''There are good reasons to be romantic about marriage,'' he said, adding, ''The big benefit of marriage is precisely the commitment over the long term.''
Stephanie Coontz, the research director at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit collection of relationship researchers, agrees, saying that when marriages work, they do so better than at any time in history. There is more equality, less domestic violence, more communication.
But marriages are also more vulnerable than at any time. (Given how long we live, '' 'Till death do us part' is a much bigger challenge than it used to be.'') She doesn't think a 20-year contract would make for happier marriages, but she believes there is value in asking people to consider and regularly assess their commitment, not necessarily based on a timetable but around life events: when you have kids, one spouse gets a new job or starts to work more hours, a family member dies, the kids leave home.
All these moments, she said, are when the marriage is most vulnerable.
''My advice would be to suggest a reup every five years, or before every major transition in life,'' Dr. Coontz said, ''with a new set of vows that reflect what the couple has learned.''
Others say that marriage needs an even more fundamental rethinking.
Virginia Rutter, an associate professor of sociology at Framingham State University in Massachusetts, told me the 20-year marriage proposal is ''incredibly conservative.'' As in: still too dogmatic. She says it presupposes people want to build their marriages around having children.
Her solution takes yet another step toward eliminating the ideal, religious and platonic.
''Ban all performative weddings, ban all crazy expenditures,'' she said. ''Ban the marriage pages in The New York Times. Ban those things that turn otherwise sensible people to start buying into that fantasy.''
BETWEEN Dr. Coontz and Dr. Rutter, I began to see the crystallization of alternatives. Dr. Coontz is talking about a new way of packaging the age-old solution of accepting and working through imperfect unions. Romance, hard hats and pickaxes, and compromise.
Dr. Rutter is talking about getting more real still. Eliminating the fantasy of marriage, or curtailing it sharply. On its face, it does sound like the most obvious side effect of acknowledging the reality that marriages often fail. But as I followed the logic, I found myself not wanting to.
I don't know if it's because I've internalized some inherent value of marriage. Or if it's simply because I fear that my own marriage would end if I, or, worse yet, my wife gave up the fantasy. There is too much good at stake. I better like my chances of recognizing that having kids, or sending them to college, losing a job or getting a new one, is a transition that we must manage.
I guess Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes walked the razor's edge of fantasy and reality. Maybe they had a marriage contract, but they also had a wedding, a fantastic, fantasy one. Did it end with all parties joyful, as if they got what they came for?
Only in Hollywood.

HEADLINE: The New Stars in Republican Commercials Attacking Obama: Babies

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Attack ads have come to this: President Obama makes babies cry.
That, in essence, is the message of a new commercial from a Republican ''super PAC'' called Americans for Job Security. And it is just one of several new advertisements that make a blunt appeal to women by using young children.
In the new ad, a worried mother jogs down the street, pushing her daughter in a stroller. ''I run to forget -- forget about my problems,'' she says. ''Now we're facing another recession. The future is getting worse under Obama.'' The camera then cuts to her daughter, whose face puckers as if she is about to burst into tears. 
Another new ad from Mitt Romney features a mother reading to her infant daughter. ''Goodnight Moon'' perhaps? ''The Giving Tree''?
More like the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
''Dear daughter,'' the mother says, ''your share of Obama's debt is over $50,000, and it grows every day.''
Babies are one of the oldest props in politics and advertising, whether they are being kissed at campaign rallies or swaddled in fresh linens in a commercial for laundry detergent. And, of course, a little girl starred in the grandfather of all attack ads, President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 ''Daisy'' commercial.
But this year babies have surfaced in ads designed to help Republicans chip away at the overwhelming support the president enjoys among women.
''Hey, it works for Johnson & Johnson, so there's no reason it wouldn't work in politics,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican advertising consultant.
In an advertising war that has already shattered records for both the number of commercials broadcast and the money spent, babies serve another useful purpose: they stand out amid the cacophony of ads that tend to blur together with their gloomy piano soundtracks and fretful-sounding announcers.
As blunt as some of these ads may sound -- and they are almost always produced by teams of ad men, not ad women -- there was copious research behind each line in the script. After months of conducting focus groups, Republican strategists found that appeals about the longevity of the deficit are more likely to stick with politically independent women when the issue is framed as a problem that their children will inherit.
Take a new ad from Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super PAC. It begins with a montage of pictures of a little girl. There she is, a baby, playing with a toy. There she is holding her father's hand as he leads her to kindergarten.
''Is her future getting better?'' a female announcer asks. ''Obama has added more debt than the first 41 presidents combined. Is America going forward or backward?''
Republicans said their goal -- and perhaps the key to this election -- was to appeal to the 2012 version of the ''soccer mom.'' This is a woman burdened by worry -- over precarious family finances, her aging parents or her adult children who have moved back into the house. Call them the anxiety moms.
''Why are jobs and the economy the No. 1 issue? Because women say so, and remember women make up 52 percent of the electorate,'' said David Winston, a Republican pollster. ''This is not an abstraction for them. How am I going to pay my grocery bills? How am I going to pay my mortgage? There are constant reminders of the difficult situation we're in.''
Commercials like these intentionally serve as yet another reminder that all is not well with the economy. But the trick is in not going overboard on the doom and gloom, both sides acknowledge. It is one thing to lay out a case for why Mr. Obama has failed women during his presidency, but those arguments can easily be defeated by hyperbole.
And some say these ads do exactly that.
''Scare tactics are nothing new, but with babies? This goes to new extremes,'' said Linda Kaplan Thaler, a longtime advertising executive who has worked on the presidential campaigns for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and now runs the Madison Avenue firm Publicis Kaplan Thaler.
Ms. Kaplan Thaler said these ads could backfire, especially if women see them as being too preachy. ''It's all about having a dialogue,'' she said. ''And when you are in a situation where you are telling voters something and not inviting a real conversation, you run the risk of voters having their own conversation.'' And these days that conversation often takes place on late-night comedy shows, where, Ms. Kaplan Thaler said, these ads could ultimately end up, as political punch lines.
With their measured appeals to voters who are disappointed in Mr. Obama's leadership, the ads echo a theme that Republican groups started emphasizing last spring after finding that harsh attacks on the president were falling flat with swing voters, especially women.
Crossroads GPS, which was founded by Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists, produced an ad called ''Basketball'' that featured a woman talking about how her faith in the president was shaken by, among other things, the fact that the economy was still so bad that her unemployed adult children had to move back home.
That ad and the two new super PAC ads featuring babies were all produced by McCarthy Hennings Media, the firm run by Larry McCarthy. His notable work includes the 1988 Willie Horton commercial, which hurt Michael S. Dukakis by linking him to a notorious prison furlough program, and ''Ashley's Story'' in 2004, which told the story of a young girl whose mother died in the Sept. 11 attacks. After meeting George W. Bush at a campaign rally, the young girl says, ''He's the most powerful man in the world, and all he wants to do is make sure I'm safe.''
Republican strategists believe they have found a damning message in the baby ads -- one that indirectly raises the question ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?''
But some Republicans cautioned that without answering what logically flows from that question -- will you be better off four years from now? -- they will not break through.
''People know they're in a hole,'' said Mr. Castellanos, the Republican advertising consultant. ''What they want is to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. They don't want you to throw the baby in the tunnel.''

HEADLINE: Three Muffled Syllables

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
IN a few days, as you may have heard, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will go head-to-head in their first presidential debate. What I most want from it isn't fireworks, though I'm as big a fan of political theater as the next hack. It's a word, one that has gone sadly out of vogue over recent decades and been mostly absent from this campaign.
Sacrifice. 
And I'm not holding my breath.
Romney, in his convention speech, never uttered it, and Obama, in his, said those three syllables just once, in a telling context. He thanked servicemen and -women who were fighting or had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan for what they'd risked and endured, a sacrifice limited to them and their families and not shared by the rest of us, who enjoyed tax cuts even as the wars' costs drove the federal debt ever higher.
It's odd. We revere the Americans who lived through World War II and call them the ''greatest generation'' precisely because of the sacrifices they made. But we seem more than content to let that brand of greatness pass us by.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, at the end of his presidency, warned Americans about ''plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow.''
''We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow,'' he said, as the writer Evan Thomas recalls in a new biography, ''Ike's Bluff.''
But the last president to make a truly robust call for sacrifice was ridiculed for it. That president, Jimmy Carter, suggested only that we turn down our thermostats a tad and guzzle a bit less gas, and in July 1979 observed, ''Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.''
Then came Ronald Reagan, whose many great contributions to America were coupled with less great ones, including the idea, which has dominated our political discourse ever since, that we should speak only of morning in America and that optimism, like virtue, is its own reward.
It isn't, not if it crowds out realism, which we need more of these days.
The size of the federal debt and the pace of its growth can't be ignored. Economists disagree on how soon and aggressively to tackle them, but not about the eventual need to.
Yet we have tax rates that, by some measures, are near the lowest in the postwar era. We also have polls that show that a clear majority of Americans don't think our country is positioned to afford its children as good a life as its adults have enjoyed.
Conditions, all in all, are ripe for a serious conversation about sacrifice. But this presidential campaign has been noteworthy for its nonsensical insinuations or assurances that although we're in a jam, we can emerge from it with discrete, minimal inconvenience.
This claim is most laughably manifest in Romney's ill-defined tax ''policy,'' which promises lower marginal rates without any reduction in the amount of revenue the United States Treasury collects.
Romney says that he intends to make this magic happen by closing tax loopholes, but he won't identify which, because God forbid any voter be told that he or she might have to surrender something advantageous. We live in a sacrifice-free bubble of volitional delusion.
Obama has lately taken to speaking of ''economic patriotism,'' which is in some sense his euphemism for sacrifice. But the patriotic pinch he suggests is a tax increase only for households that make more than $250,000. They represent a small minority of American taxpayers, and a tax hike extending well beyond them would be necessary to raise enough revenue to solve our debt problems.
Campaign rhetoric, of course, is campaign rhetoric. Even so, the amount of it devoted to lessening our anxieties about any financial pain in the present is alarming.
Those of us with health insurance are encouraged not to fear any negative consequence from the attempt to universalize coverage, rather than being told that such a goal is worth some giveback -- which it is.
All of us are assured that the cost of Medicare can be contained without the program's beneficiaries' feeling a significant impact. Really?
What once made Paul Ryan exciting even to some moderates was his readiness to sing a more somber song and say: folks, we can't have it all. But if you track his own changes to his budget proposals -- and then add the alterations that Romney layered on -- you hear a muffling of the summons to any current or imminent sacrifice.
Besides which, Ryan's notion of sacrifice is lopsided: diminished entitlements even for people who truly depend on them but not a cent more in taxes for affluent Americans like him. These days sacrifice is what you recommend for others, not what you volunteer for yourself.
How did that happen? One theory is the end of military conscription after Vietnam.
''As we baby boomers became adults, less than 1 percent of the population served in the military,'' wrote Matthew Paull, a former chief financial officer for McDonald's, and Steve Krause, the director of finance at the University of Chicago's business school, in an article in The New Republic last year. It was titled, ''Why Are the Children of the 'Greatest Generation' So Selfish?''
''In World War II, that figure was over 10 percent,'' the authors continued, later adding: ''With relatively few of us sharing the bonds, lessons and sacrifices of military service, perhaps there is little widespread experiential counterbalance to each of us pursuing only our self-interest.''
I think the rise of interest groups, identity politics and cause-specific lobbyists has diminished our attention to, and sense of, a communal good.
And cynicism about the intentions of politicians and the effectiveness of government has become an easy out: why sacrifice in ways that plump federal coffers or reduce federal obligations when Washington can't be trusted to make anything better or get anything right?
I have my own trust issues. But they'd be lessened considerably if one of the candidates got up at the first debate and said that climate change can't be mourned from the back seat of an Escalade; that the future benefits of expanded health care and more affordable college have a price tag in the here and now; that pain is a precursor to healing; and that it's time to take our medicine.

HEADLINE: Only the Songs Remain the Same

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
WHEN the 23rd annual New York Cabaret Convention begins three nights of performances on Oct. 17 at Rose Hall at Jazz at Lincoln Center, it will start a new chapter both for the convention and the nostalgic genre it celebrates. The future of both depends on cabaret's reinvention into something more contemporary than a museum for the American songbook.
After the death last March of the convention's founder, Donald F. Smith, the singer K T Sullivan, a Smith protégé, took over the creative reins with the tricky mission of attracting younger artists and audiences while preserving Smith's legacy. The convention, whose patron saints are Cole Porter, Noël Coward and Mabel Mercer, draws a loyal but diminishing and largely senior audience still in thrall to the golden age of New York night life before its decimation by television and rock 'n' roll. 
Smith's death and the demise this year of two of Manhattan's three major supper clubs -- the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel and the soon-to-close Feinstein's at Loews Regency -- have sent shock waves through the field. At the same time, a downtown alt-cabaret scene is drawing enthusiastic cult audiences to Joe's Pub at the Public Theater. But can these raucous underground figures refresh the genre? Or are they too marginal or extreme to make an impact?
The patron saint of this downtown world, Bette Midler, rejuvenated cabaret during its darkest days in the late 1960s and early '70s with her loudmouthed campy extravaganzas. Once Ms. Midler, who was then considered transgressive, achieved mainstream stardom, the genre she helped restart branched into two streams, each inspired by a different side of her personality.
The nostalgic chanteuse and songwriting connoisseur helped revive the polite, glamorous uptown supper-club world. The brash vaudevillian cutup and gay cult figure who told Sophie Tucker jokes was the forerunner of today's mouthy downtown divas like Bridget Everett, a brassy, boozy storyteller with a big voice, and Meow Meow, an Australian singer with a sophisticated European approach.
The biggest stars of the uptown branch -- Barbara Cook, John Pizzarelli, Jessica Molaskey, Christine Ebersole, Judy Collins, Andrea Marcovicci and Mr. Feinstein -- are all over 50, and make real money (up to $60,000 a week) from shows that are prohibitively expensive for most New Yorkers. Cabaret's best hope for the future may lie in the middle ground between uptown and downtown, in clubs like the recently opened 54 Below in the basement of the legendary Studio 54; the smaller Metropolitan Room on West 22nd Street; and the Laurie Beechman Theater, in the West Bank Cafe's basement on 42nd Street.
With its deluxe speakeasy ambience, 54 Below opened in June with a show starring Patti LuPone, the Broadway diva beloved for her sassy, Midler-like disregard for convention. Ms. LuPone subsequently bonded onstage, both at 54 Below and Joe's Pub, with Ms. Everett, whom some consider the most likely talent to break out of the downtown scene.
Attracting a younger, more exuberant crowd than those at Feinstein's or the Café Carlyle, 54 Below is fulfilling its goal of becoming ''Broadway's clubhouse'' and is ''approaching profitability'' in the words of Thomas Viertel and Richard Frankel, two of its managing and producing partners. If and when uptown and downtown sensibilities merge, this midpriced club could be the flash point.
Its creative consultant, Scott Wittman, the longtime director of Ms. LuPone's and Christine Ebersole's acts, has deep roots in the '70s avant-garde. He recently brought the gender-blending provocateur Justin Vivian Bond to the club for a successful run of Monday evening performances of songs inspired by Joan Didion's novel ''Play It as It Lays.'' Earlier this year, Mr. Wittman conceived and directed Bond's La MaMa show, ''Jukebox Jackie,'' about the pioneering drag performer Jackie Curtis, in which Ms. Everett played one of Curtis's alter egos.
The major reason cabaret flourishes in New York as in no other American city is its proximity to the theater world and that enormous talent pool. At 54 Below, Broadway stars like Brian d'Arcy James, Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie have been given a platform to unveil their pop and rock sides. Mr. Butz's recent show, in particular, was a revelation. But the economics of cabaret are so shaky that a lucrative role on Broadway or a TV series will always pre-empt a nightclub engagement. That's why cabaret is usually something done on the side between theatrical commitments -- for love, not money.
Besides 54 Below, several New York clubs, including Feinstein's, the jazz room Birdland (whose popular Monday night series, Jim Caruso's Cast Party, is a freewheeling off-hours Broadway playground) have theatrical components. The producer Scott Siegel, who runs a weekly Broadway series at Feinstein's, has turned Town Hall into a musical theater annex; he produces the New York Nightlife Awards, an annual contest show voted on by New York critics.
There is no lack of talent among the younger generation of mostly under-40 cabaret performers who occupy the middle ground behind cabaret's haute and demimondes. High on the list of the most promising is Emily Bergl, a sexy Midler-Madonna hybrid with a tough-cookie chirp who deconstructs pop songs of every genre, and eschews sentimentality. Typical of her irreverence is her inside-out version of ''It Had to Be You,'' which she delivers as a sneer of disgust at finding herself stuck with a creep.
Lauren Fox, a second-generation ''lady of the canyon'' in thrall to '70s Los Angeles singer-songwriters, delivered a knockout show earlier this year singing Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen songs with a startling depth and intensity. Her coming engagement, which begins Oct. 11 at the Metropolitan Room, explores Southern California pop in the late '60s and '70s. Both Ms. Bergl and Ms. Fox are protégés of Ms. Sullivan, who has put them on the Cabaret Convention's opening-night roster.
The much-heralded singer Nellie McKay, with a vocal resemblance to Doris Day and a protean songwriting gift that encompasses 1950s torch ballads and hip-hop, is another prodigious talent whose politicized miniature musicals address feminism, animal rights and environmental issues. Her recent show at Feinstein's was a zany musical biography of Rachel Carson.
Maude Maggart, whose groundbreaking show ''Good Girl/Bad Girl'' at the Oak Room several years ago dramatized her personal tug of war between enduring romantic love and free-spirited adventure, is another major talent. Like Ms. Bergl, Ms. Fox and Ms. McKay, she is a rebel with a streak of nostalgia for the traditional love song. In the age of the hookup, that love song, the foundation of popular music for decades, has been overtaken by sex and erotic combat as the default subject of popular music. Increasingly, the body matters more than the heart.
On the more conservative side of the middle ground are Nicole Henry, a glamorous, Florida-based pop-jazz-soul singer; Tony DeSare, the most promising in an unending stream of Frank Sinatra acolytes; Aaron Weinstein, a brilliant jazz violinist whose shows blend music with witty Woody Allen-like comedy; Jennifer Sheehan and Karen Oberlin, jazz-inflected traditional balladeers with modern attitudes; and T. Oliver Reid, a soulful crooner with resemblances to the young Bobby Short.
An obstacle they all face is a lack of media visibility in the youth-obsessed, post-''American Idol'' era of instant stars and teenage vocal acrobats for whom pop singing is an Olympic sport. Cabaret has been wounded by the scorn of television tastemakers like Simon Cowell who have singled out the genre for contempt.
This lack of visibility contributes mightily to the neglect of an art form that, outside of hotels, gets little, if any, institutional and corporate support. Not even the New York Nightlife Awards have succeeded in finding a television platform.
What could penetrate the barrier between television and night clubs that was so porous in the golden age of TV variety? The cabaret equivalent of ''Smash''? A reality series set in a club? Possibly.
The Lady Gaga phenomenon, with its ultra-theatrical trappings, isn't that far removed stylistically from alt-cabaret. Shanta Thake, the director of Joe's Pub, sees as a springboard to a possible nightclub renaissance. But are any of the downtown performers, which include Ms. Everett, Meow Meow, Bond, Lady Rizo, Taylor Mac and other extravagant avant-gardists for whom cabaret is inseparable from performance art, talented and determined enough to break through? Just as important: Do they even want to?
With its embrace of drag and transgendered performers, the downtown scene illustrates what might be called a crisis of masculinity throughout cabaret. Not long ago, American nightclubs from Las Vegas to New York cultivated a thriving, emphatically macho lounge tradition embodied by Frank Sinatra and his followers. One of its last apostles, Jack Jones, who recently performed at Feinstein's, is still a powerful pop-jazz interpreter. But the strutting patriarchal attitudes his type embodies seem anachronistic, if not downright offensive to younger audiences. That tradition has exhausted itself.
Which isn't to say that cabaret has no place for he-men. Brian Stokes Mitchell and Jason Danieley, magnetic Broadway leading men who occasionally dip into cabaret, belong to an enlightened breed of male entertainer whose virility is tempered by their sensitivity.
Yet as traditional gender stereotypes across the cultural map are increasingly challenged, cabaret's avant-garde could eventually revolutionize mainstream nightclub entertainment. But it's not going to happen overnight. Old ways of thinking die hard. In the meantime, cabaret in one form or another will struggle on. Its economic model may be broken. But the demand for intimate, personal shows by both performers and audiences will not let it die.

HEADLINE: Governor, Meet Mr. President

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
As Mitt Romney and President Obama huddle with their debate coaches this weekend, they will each have to make a simple - but potentially critical - decision ahead of Wednesday's face-off.
What do they call each other?
Will it be "Mr. President" or "the president" when Mr. Romney refers to his rival on the stage? Will Mr. Obama talk about the policies that "the governor" wants to pursue? Or will he talk about the impact of those policies from "my opponent"? 
Or will there be less formal moments, when "Mitt" and "Barack" slip out?
Millions of people will be watching the two men in one of the very few direct interactions they have had during the 2012 campaign. Among the things being scrutinized: how much respect will each contender pay to his rival?
"There's a certain amount of decorum that we expect in our debates," said Brett O'Donnell, one of the Republican party's top debate coaches. "The reference that they use for each other is a beginning point for that decorum."
Washington is famous for its fake friendliness - think of how often senators heap praise on their "good friend, the gentleman from Ohio" just before skewering the Ohio senator's motives and killing his legislation with a parliamentary maneuver.
Presidential debates are no different. They are among the highest-stakes moments in American politics. Yet they demand smiles and handshakes at the beginning - a demonstration of respect and friendliness that is often at odds with the tough rhetoric that often follows.
There have been few occasions in modern political history of outright nastiness or scorn when it comes to how presidential candidates refer to each other during debates. Still, campaigns have often made subtle choices as they seek an advantage.
During the first debate between Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008, Mr. Obama all but ignored Mr. McCain's decades as a senator, perhaps hoping not to draw too much of a contrast to his own short tenure in the chamber.
Almost every time Mr. Obama referred to his rival during that debate, he simply used his first name.
"I don't know where John is getting his figures," Mr. Obama said at one point. Another time, he said: "John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important." Later, he spoke directly to Mr. McCain, saying: "John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
In all, Mr. Obama used Mr. McCain's first name 25 times. By contrast, Mr. McCain referred to Mr. Obama as "Senator Obama" or "the senator" each time.
"It was a backhanded compliment," Mr. O'Donnell said, recalling Mr. Obama's use of Mr. McCain's first name. "On the outside, he was being friendly, trying to be comfortable. It was a way of being respectfully distrustful."
Three weeks later, in the third debate of the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama had apparently thought better of his choice. He called Mr. McCain "John" only once, referring to him as "Senator McCain" throughout the rest of the debate.
That same year, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and Mr. McCain's vice-presidential nominee, asked her rival, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., "Hey, can I call you Joe?" while shaking his hand at the debate's opening.
She went on to call him "senator" during most of the debate, but did drop the formality when responding to Mr. Biden's criticism of the previous Republican administration.
"Say it ain't so, Joe," Ms. Palin said. "There you go again pointing backwards again."
Debate coaches often suggest that candidates do whatever they can to subtly undermine their rival's experience and stature. In 2004, President George W. Bush repeatedly referred to Senator John Kerry as merely "my opponent," even when referring to Mr. Kerry's Senate votes.
Mr. Bush used the same approach four years earlier, when debating Vice President Al Gore. Sometimes he called him "the vice president," but often switched to "my opponent." Mr. Gore stayed with the formal "Governor Bush," reminding all who were watching of the limits of Mr. Bush's experience.
Mr. Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, always referred to Michael Dukakis as "Governor Dukakis" in 1988. President Jimmy Carter was careful to say "Governor Reagan" during their 1980 debates. In fact, most presidential candidates seem to adopt that careful approach: be respectful by using a proper title that doesn't risk offending anyone.
The exceptions seem to come in those unscripted moments when candidates either clash angrily or interact warmly, dropping for just a brief moment the formal pretense.
Perhaps the most memorable of those moments came during a presidential primary debate in 2008. When a moderator asked Hillary Rodham Clinton why people thought Mr. Obama was more likable, she answered, "I don't think I'm that bad."
Mr. Obama dropped his guard and stopped calling her "Senator Clinton" in a moment that helped breathe new life back into Ms. Clinton's campaign against him.
"You're likable enough, Hillary," he said. "No doubt about it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Lowest Fare? Ask the Crowd

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross, a professor of business at San Jose State University, is the author of ''The Launch Pad,'' published this month.

 BODY:
TRAVEL search sites have made it easy to find the lowest available fares ever since the Web's early Jurassic period, when pioneers like Expedia and Travelocity opened shop. Many others, like Kayak and Hipmunk, have since joined in.
Travelers with complex travel plans may have noticed, however, that the search results aren't necessarily consistent. This has created a business opportunity for Flightfox, a start-up company based in Mountain View, Calif., which uses a contest format to come up with the best fare that the crowd -- all Flightfox-approved users -- can find. 
A traveler goes to Flightfox.com and sets up a competition, supplying information about the desired itinerary and clarifying a few preferences, like a willingness to ''fly on any airline to save money'' or a tolerance of ''long layovers to save money.'' Once Flightfox posts the contest, the crowd is invited to go to work and submit fares.
The contest runs three days, and the winner, the person who finds the lowest fare, gets 75 percent of the finder's fee that the traveler pays Flightfox when setting up the competition. Flightfox says fees depend on the complexity of the itinerary; many current contests have fees in the $34-to-$59 range.
Travelers' savings can be considerable. In a contest for a long, complex trip that began in Sydney, passed through Barcelona and then many South American destinations before returning to Sydney, the difference between the lowest fare, $6,538 a person, and the third-lowest was about $1,400. Why couldn't every human searcher find the same fare that the winner did? The fact that the travelers specified 15 destinations for their four-month-long trip meant that no single search engine had all the needed information.
Flightfox asks travelers who have already found a good fare on their own to make clear at the outset that they will award the finder's fee only if a better price is found. The site also encourages travelers to consider awarding a finder's fee for flights that may not be less expensive but have fewer stops or shorter layovers.
Human searchers can find flights that handle special requests, like traveling with a pet or a surfboard, to which a travel search engine remains oblivious. Todd Sullivan, a software developer and co-founder of Flightfox, says, ''There are too many variables for it to be economically feasible to build an algorithm that covers every aspect of travel.''
Mr. Sullivan says the company has about 900 researchers, which it calls ''experts,'' who search fares on behalf of the sponsoring travelers. Anyone can apply to be an ''expert''; Mr. Sullivan says applicants need only show evidence of the ability to find good fares.
About 20 percent of the Flightfox researchers are travel agents. Another large group are what Mr. Sullivan calls ''flight hackers,'' people who enjoy the sport of fare-hunting and frequent sites like FlyerTalk. ''They do this at sites like this for free anyhow,'' Mr. Sullivan says. ''We've commercialized it.''
The other large group of researchers comprises frequent travelers seeking ways to make money to finance their travel. Mr. Sullivan says he and his co-founder, Lauren McLeod, were in this category when they started the company early this year.
The two say they have raised $800,000 in seed funding from Silicon Valley and Australian investors.
One of Flightfox's experts is Michael Roizman, a medical student at the University of Queensland in Australia, who has not done a lot of traveling himself. Nonetheless, he won a contest that Flightfox set up for fun, challenging searchers to find the lowest possible fare for an itinerary that would begin and end in a North American city and would touch all other continents except Antarctica. Mr. Roizman's winning fare was $1,730 for a trip that included stops in Guyana, Morocco, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur and Perth, Australia.
''A flight search engine is blind to the opportunity to break up a complex itinerary into separate segments that originate in low-fare markets,'' Mr. Roizman says.
He gives an example of a flight from Sydney to Germany. It's much cheaper, he says, to start with an inexpensive flight from Sydney to Southeast Asia, then fly on to Germany on any of several low-fare carriers.
The contest for the 15-destination trip from Sydney was won by Monique Krestyn, a Flightfox expert in Massachusetts whose days are mostly filled with looking after five young children. ''I have a cousin who is a computer geek,'' she says, ''and he once said that the only thing I could do better on a computer than him is find good flights.'' He ran across an ad for Flightfox and brought it to her attention.
Ms. Krestyn recalls, ''At first, I thought, 'Where in the world are these experts finding these fares?''' It took about a week, she says, to become familiar with smaller airlines that don't show up in travel search engines. She also discovered that fares ''are priced differently depending on where you look -- and where you are looking from.''
In that contest, she made $100, but more typically the winnings are $20 or $30. ''It doesn't sound like much, but it really does add up,'' she says. ''In three months, I've made $4,000 and that's just utilizing my downtime when home and family aren't demanding me.''
It's most heartening to see that in the domain of travel planning, humans still manage to hold their own. Every contest concluded at Flightfox is a small win for the species.

HEADLINE: Obama's New Normal

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
LAST winter, I had lunch with a junior White House official who works on economic issues. The unemployment rate had just dipped to 8.3 percent, and I asked if he was encouraged by the figure, and hopeful that it might be down another point by Election Day.
He shook his head. The positive news notwithstanding, he said, there were good reasons to think that we would still be staring at 8 percent unemployment in the fall of 2012. 
''Well,'' I told him, with all the authority a professional pundit can muster, ''then you should assume that you're going to lose the election.''
Today, just as he predicted, the unemployment rate is 8.1 percent. The year's second-quarter growth rate was just downgraded to an anemic 1.3 percent, real household income dipped in the month leading up to the two political conventions, and the American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis suggests that 2012 might turn out to be the worst not-technically-in-a-recession year in modern American history.
But Barack Obama would win if the election were held today, and probably by a relatively comfortable margin. My wintertime prediction, Mitt Romney's campaign strategy, the assumptions of Republicans and Democrats alike -- all have been confounded by voters' refusal to lean the way the unemployment rate suggests they should.
Why is this? In part, it's the hangover from the Bush years, and the fact that Americans don't yet trust the Republican Party given how little the party seems to have learned and changed since 2008. In part, it's Romney himself, a deeply flawed candidate whose ''47 percent'' remarks look like the rare disastrous sound-bite that actually turns the polls against the candidate who uttered it.
But something deeper is going on as well. Remember that the economy is growing, however slowly, and most working-age Americans do have jobs. (A Bureau of Labor Statistics reassessment just found that there are now -- finally -- more Americans employed than when Barack Obama took office.) It turns out that dreadfully slow growth isn't nearly as politically damaging as decline, because voters can adapt to stagnation, and approach it as a kind of grim ''new normal'' rather than a disaster requiring an immediate response.
Over the last two years, then, what still felt like an economic crisis during the 2010 midterms has become a grim-but-bearable status quo. In this new normal, Ronald Brownstein reports in the National Journal, ''a slim majority of Americans now say they define getting ahead as not falling behind -- not losing ground or falling into debt -- rather than the more traditional definition of enjoying steady increases in pay and income.''
It's voters like these who are giving Obama his cushion. The president trails among people who report themselves worse off than four years ago. But he leads comfortably among Americans who are merely treading water.
These signs of resignation are good news for the White House, but they're bad news for the country's future. Even if a rich nation like ours can learn to live with 8 percent unemployment and slow growth for now, the costs of persistent joblessness and sustained stagnation could be devastating in the long run.
As Don Peck pointed out in his 2011 book ''Pinched,'' an analysis of the Great Recession's likely consequences, the socioeconomic scars left by a period of mass unemployment get deeper the longer that period persists. Young people put off life decisions, delaying education, marriage, childbearing. Older people drop out of the work force permanently. Families are strained and split apart; people lose crucial years of saving and asset building; dependency on government assistance becomes a way of life. And a culture of fearfulness takes hold, discouraging risk-taking and entrepreneurship even when better times return.
Meanwhile, every year with subpar growth makes our government's existing liabilities larger, and the fiscal adjustments the country is facing that much more difficult to make. All of these problems will gradually intertwine, as they already do in Western Europe. Today's stagnation means that Americans a generation hence will face bigger-than-expected deficits, even as today's recession-dampened birthrate means there will be fewer younger workers to help pay them down.
This grim prospect doesn't necessarily make the case for electing Romney in Obama's place. Indeed, Romney's dismissal of the government-dependent 47 percent suggests a fatal misunderstanding of what should be his mission -- namely, to persuade precisely those Americans clinging, understandably, to government programs in tough times to choose the risks of further change over the temporary security of stasis.
But the costs of stagnation definitely make the case against the kind of resignation we're now seeing in the electorate. Whatever happens in November, American voters should be asking for more -- both for themselves, and for future generations -- than an economy in which stagnation is the best that we can hope for, and the American dream just means barely getting by.

HEADLINE: A Surge in New Treatment for Veterans' Trauma

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG. 
Tina Rosenberg is the author of ''Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World.''

 BODY:
Suicide has overtaken combat as the leading cause of death in the Army. The month of July, with 38 suicides among active duty and reserve soldiers, was the worst since the Army began counting. There are many reasons a soldier will take his own life, but one major factor is post-traumatic stress.
A study of Vietnam veterans 20 years after the conflict found that a quarter of those who served still had full or partial post-traumatic stress disorder. America's current wars may create even more suffering for those who fought them. Soldiers have been deployed to the Afghan and Iraq conflicts multiple times, and they face a deadly new weapon -- improvised explosive devices, which cause brain injuries that also seem to intensify PTSD. 
The two treatments in widest use involve a single patient and a therapist: cognitive processing therapy (C.P.T.), where patients learn to think about their experiences in a new way; and prolonged exposure, in which the therapist guides the patient through re-experiencing his trauma, teaching the brain to process it differently.
These treatments help about 40 percent of those who use them. But for many other suffering veterans, these therapies are too narrow. PTSD is often entwined with other serious problems -- depression, sleep disorders, chronic pain and substance abuse. Sometimes these are resolved if the PTSD is, but often they require specific attention that standard PTSD therapies don't provide.
There is another way these treatments need broadening -- they need to reach more people. The military and Veterans Affairs hospitals do not have enough psychotherapists to offer them on the necessary scale. And many soldiers are wary of psychotherapy and afraid of the stigma it carries.
The military is fighting that stigma with new research and more treatment. The V.A. has trained or added thousands of new mental health professionals and is trying to integrate mental health care into routine care for veterans. Only about 10 percent of those getting mental health care in the V.A. system, however, are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan; the vast majority are Vietnam veterans. But some 2.4 million soldiers have been through Iraq and Afghanistan. The RAND Corporation's Center for Military Health Policy Research found that one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans surveyed were currently affected by PTSD or depression or reported exposure to a traumatic brain injury; about 5 percent had all three. Only half of those who reported symptoms of major depression or PTSD had sought any treatment in the past year. The number of newly trained mental health professionals needed, said RAND, is ''likely to be in the thousands.'' Individual therapy is not enough.
Fortunately, there are other ways to treat PTSD. In January, 10 veterans with PTSD sat down in a small, drab room at a Veterans Affairs clinic in New Orleans for a course designed by the Washington-based Center for Mind-Body Medicine. Over the next 10 weeks they drew pictures of themselves, colored in their family trees, danced and shook to music. They learned conscious breathing, meditation, mindfulness, guided visual imagery and biofeedback.
The course is one of perhaps half a dozen different kinds of alternative therapies being tried for PTSD in military and V.A. hospitals: acupuncture, yoga, mindfulness, Buddhist lovingkindness meditation.
The Center for Mind-Body Medicine's program is the most comprehensive and has the strongest evidence that it works to cure PTSD. Kosovo high school students with PTSD who completed the 10-week program had significantly greater reductions in PTSD than a control group of students assigned to wait for the course. Other before-and-after studies (with no control group) in Gaza have found an 80 to 90 percent reduction in PTSD with the technique, and those results still held months later.
The center's program is being used at various V.A. hospitals, military bases and research institutes. The group in New Orleans is part of the first randomized controlled trial measuring the program's effect on PTSD among veterans. Researchers are still processing the results, but Dr. James S. Gordon, the director of the center, said that the patients' improvement was ''at least as good'' as the individual therapies the V.A. uses, with significantly lower dropout rates.
If this holds up, then the Center for Mind-Body Medicine's program will be a potentially valuable addition to the V.A.'s limited menu of treatments. It is built for large scale. Many of its groups are run by lay people who went through a 10-day training; in Kosovo, high school teachers ran the groups. In Gaza, center staff members have trained 420 group leaders and worked with some 50,000 people. The program is also showing success not only with PTSD but also depression, pain, sleep disorders and substance abuse. It is now being used at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to treat patients with substance abuse problems.
Mind-body medicine and the other alternative therapies may be more attractive to soldiers than the individual treatments, which have a 20 percent dropout rate. Both C.P.T. and prolonged exposure ask the patient to relive his trauma -- an upsetting prospect. Some veterans avoid psychotherapy because they do not want to be singled out and labeled deficient.
The alternative medicine groups, by contrast, have virtually no dropouts. Members can talk about their past trauma if they wish, but it's not necessary and there is no pressure to do so. Instead, the groups are centered on the present, helping members to learn practical skills. The facilitator is a participant in the group, sharing skills she might use herself for better sleep or stress reduction. Everyone, after all, can use help dealing with the stress of re-entry to civilian life. Going to a skills group instead of psychotherapy could remove much of the stigma of treatment.
Despite the vast increase in research money, studies of these alternative therapies have been small and isolated. Only randomized controlled trials are persuasive enough to get Washington to adopt a therapy on a wider scale, but these are too few and too slow, and starting new ones now would take years. It is time to take the most promising ideas and try them with thousands of people, not just a few dozen -- and if they work, to expand them further. That is not cautious. But treatment-as-usual condemns hundreds of thousands of soldiers to a tour of duty without end.

HEADLINE: Gas Drilling Jitters Unsettle Catskills Sales

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
HANCOCK, N.Y.
IN a secluded spot here lies a vacationer's dream: a three-bedroom ranch-style house with 14 acres of woods roamed by deer and turkey, just minutes from prime trout fishing on the Delaware River. The asking price is $107,000.
But even at this ''just reduced'' bargain price, said Leonard Piorkowski, a local real estate agent, he can't make a sale. ''One hundred seven thousand for 14 acres and a house and two garages, and we can't sell it?'' Mr. Piorkowski lamented as he guided a visitor across the property recently.
Coveted for its pristine water, pastoral landscapes and relative proximity to New York City, the Catskills region has long been second-home territory for urbanites. But brokers say many listings are languishing -- and not just because of the lag in the nation's economic recovery. The prospect that New York State will open the region to hydraulic fracturing, a controversial gas drilling process known informally as fracking, has spooked potential buyers.
There is concern that the drilling will not only ruin the natural environment but also depress property values, would-be buyers and real estate agents say. 
Until state officials decide where, when and how the drilling process will unfold, many prospective owners seem unwilling to take the leap. But public opposition to fracking has grown in the four years since New York regulators have been studying its potential environmental effect, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is taking his time making a decision. Administration officials recently announced another delay to allow the state's health department to review drilling-related public health risks.
Some buyers are also deliberating. ''What if I got there, and they start signing gas leases all around you?'' asked Lauren Carner, 62, a school psychologist from Putnam County who once lived in the area and longs to return when she retires. ''Even if I held out, my neighbors could sign leases. As gorgeous as it was when I bought it, it could turn into an industrial site.
''The whole idea seems so awful,'' added Dr. Carner, who once owned property near the Delaware County town of Treadwell and fears that drilling would ruin the area.
Properties with gas leases, like the 14 acres in Hancock listed at $107,000, are a tough sell, some real estate agents noted. Leaseholders generally get money upfront and royalty payments on any sales of gas extracted from their land. The owners could end up earning millions of dollars, but they are also inviting large-scale industrial activity.
Many leases in New York were signed for five-year periods for as little as $3 an acre and royalties of 12.5 percent. Leaseholders have since formed groups to negotiate better deals with gas companies or file lawsuits to get out of their leases. In New York, companies have extended leases without the owners' consent by invoking force majeure, a legal term referring to an unforeseen event -- in this case, New York's repeated delays in allowing fracking.
The drilling would take place on the Marcellus Shale -- a rich natural-gas field that runs through several states and spans more than two dozen counties in New York. The most productive area is believed to be in the counties above the Pennsylvania border.
But gas companies have leased land all over the Marcellus Shale, and until it is known where fracking would take place, would-be home buyers fret. Fracking involves injecting vast amounts of chemicals and water into underground shale formations to force out natural-gas deposits. Potential buyers worry that their dream of a serene retreat could turn into a nightmare of water wells contaminated by drilling chemicals, country roads choked by truck traffic and views blighted by noisy industrial activity.
The uncertainty has also upended the long- and short-term plans of sellers, and homeowners who had been contemplating renovations.
Patricia Wallace, whose family has owned a house on the East Branch of the Delaware River near Hancock for generations, said fracking was a major reason she and her brother delayed replacing the 1,800-square-foot house where they spend their summers. The siblings had hired an architect in 2007 to design a new $500,000 structure within the footprint of the 240-year-old house, she said. But then the economy worsened and the gas companies began leasing land around them, as well as across the state line into Pennsylvania, where fracking got under way in earnest in 2008.
''It was one of the things that made us think,'' said Ms. Wallace, 56, a professor of psychology at an Oregon college. ''What if we invest the money and then fracking is allowed and everything is contaminated?''
But the old house started falling down, she said, and the siblings have now decided to rebuild by next summer, whatever happens. If there is fracking and they want to sell, she said, ''there are people who probably would buy the property anyway because the waterfront is so nice.''
Some buyers from downstate have settled on a property only to back out. Six months ago, Arthur Gillett, a resident of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and the research director for a food sustainability business, found what he considered the ideal spot: a Cape Cod-style cottage with a garden on four wooded acres near Livingston Manor in Sullivan County. At $140,000, the price was right.
But Mr. Gillett, 32, let it go, deciding to search closer to parkland and reservoirs where state officials have promised that fracking will be banned, even if it is allowed elsewhere in New York.
Mr. Gillett said he did not believe that oversight by state regulators would guarantee safe drilling, and he worries about the accidental contamination of water supplies. ''If you're really looking for something for use for a long time,'' he said, ''the idea of the groundwater being bad is just disconcerting.''
The New York State Association of Realtors says that residential sales across the state were up 6.7 percent in the second quarter. But in Sullivan County, a second-home destination that sits on the Marcellus Shale, sales were down 4 percent.
House hunters notice fairly quickly that the specter of fracking is as much a part of the landscape as ponds and lakes. Signs with a circle and backslash superimposed on the word ''frack'' are ubiquitous on lawns and porches in some towns, while placards in others proclaim, ''I'm a friend of Marcellus.''
Some agents say they are bombarded with questions from would-be buyers: How likely is fracking in this area? How does one find out if leases are being signed in a given area?
''I'm not going to hide how I feel about this issue,'' said Darren Wiseman, an agent in the Catskills area who opposes the drilling. He advises clients to do their own research. ''I tell people, 'Go online and type fracking and read about it.' '' Landowners who welcome the economic boost from fracking dispute the notion that it deters buyers.
Noel van Swol, the president of the Sullivan-Delaware Property Owners Association, said that large parcels had become more desirable because of their broader drilling potential. His group represents owners of 70,000 acres in Sullivan and Delaware Counties who are ready to sign gas leases once the state approves fracking. ''A lot of land has been taken out of the market over the last three years because people realize they're sitting on a fortune,'' he said.
Even so, plenty of agents worry that their livelihoods could be doomed, citing anecdotal evidence from colleagues in Pennsylvania. Jennifer Canfield, a former agent on the other side of the Delaware River in Wayne County, Pa., said she closed her office in 2010 after her business collapsed. ''The last year, I sold two properties,'' she said.
Although the drilling has so far been concentrated more than 60 miles north, she said, plenty of gas leases have been negotiated in Wayne County. That's why she has had no luck selling a ranch house she owns on six acres near leased properties, she said. Originally listed at $219,000 two years ago, it is now going for $164,000. ''Nobody looks at it,'' she said, ''because people don't want to be anywhere near the drilling. If the economy turned around, we still wouldn't get these people back.''
Still, some prospective buyers in New York State hold out hope. Mr. Gillett, who grew up near Fallsburg in Sullivan County and whose parents still live there, is anxiously awaiting a magic bullet: an unequivocal state decision that would rule out fracking in the area. ''I love the mountain streams and the largely untouched forests,'' he said, adding wistfully, ''I have my deposit ready.''

HEADLINE: The World We're Actually Living In

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
FOR the first time in a long, long time, a Democrat is running for president and has the clear advantage on national security policy. That is not ''how things are supposed to be,'' and Republicans sound apoplectic about it. But there is a reason President Obama is leading on national security, and it was apparent in his U.N. speech last week, which showed a president who understands that we really do live in a more complex world today -- and that saying so is not a cop-out. It's a road map. Mitt Romney, given his international business background, should understand this, but he acts instead as if he learned his foreign policy at the International House of Pancakes, where the menu and architecture rarely changes. 
Rather than really thinking afresh about the world, Romney has chosen instead to go with the same old G.O.P. bacon and eggs -- that the Democrats are toothless wimps who won't stand up to our foes or for our values, that the Republicans are tough and that it is 1989 all over again. That is, America stands astride the globe with unrivaled power to bend the world our way, and the only thing missing is a president with ''will.'' The only thing missing is a president who is ready to simultaneously confront Russia, bash China, tell Iraqis we're not leaving their country, snub the Muslim world by outsourcing our Arab-Israel policy to the prime minister of Israel, green light Israel to bomb Iran -- and raise the defense budget while cutting taxes and eliminating the deficit.
It's all ''attitude'' -- without a hint at how we could possibly do all these contradictory things at once, or the simplest acknowledgment that two wars and a giant tax cut under George W. Bush has limited our ability to do even half of them.
Let's look at the world we're actually living in. It is a world that has become much more interdependent so that our friends failing (like Greece) can now harm us as much as our enemies threatening, and our rivals (like China) collapsing can hurt us as much as their rising. It's a world where a cheap YouTube video made by a superempowered individual can cause us more trouble than the million-dollar propaganda campaign of a superpower competitor. It is a globalized economy in which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, America's largest business lobby, has opposed Romney's pledge to designate China as a currency manipulator and is pressing Congress to lift cold war trade restrictions on Russia, a country Romney has labeled America's ''No. 1 geopolitical foe.'' It is a world where, at times, pulling back -- and focusing on rebuilding our strength at home -- is the most meaningful foreign policy initiative we can undertake because when America is at its best -- its institutions, schools and values -- it can inspire emulation, whereas Russia and China still have to rely on transactions or bullying to get others to follow. It is still a world where the use of force, or the threat of force, against implacable foes (Iran) is required, but a world where a nudge at the right time and place can also be effective.
Add it all up and it's a world in which America will have greater responsibility (because our European and Japanese allies are now economically enfeebled) and fewer resources (because we have to cut the defense budget) to manage a more complex set of actors (because so many of the states we have to deal with now are new democracies with power emanating from their people not just one man -- like Egypt -- or failing states like Pakistan) where our leverage on other major powers is limited (because Russia's massive oil and gas income gives it great independence and any war we'd want to fight in Asia we'd have to borrow the money from China).
This complexity doesn't argue for isolationism. It argues for using our power judiciously and in a nuanced fashion. For instance, if you had listened to Romney criticizing Obama for weakness after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, you'd have thought that, had Romney been president, he would have immediately ordered some counterstrike. But, had we done so, it would have aborted what was a much more meaningful response: Libyans themselves taking to the streets under the banner ''Our Revolution Will Not Be Stolen'' and storming the headquarters of the Islamist militias who killed the U.S. ambassador. It shows you how much this complexity can surprise you.
The one area where Romney could have really challenged Obama on foreign policy was on the president's bad decision to double-down on Afghanistan. But Romney can't, because the Republican Party wanted to triple down. So we're having no debate about how to extricate ourselves from our biggest foreign policy mess and a cartoon debate -- ''I'm tough; he's not'' -- about everything else. In that sense, foreign policy is a lot like domestic policy. The morning after the election, we will face a huge ''cliff'': how to deal with Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, without guidance from the candidates or a mandate from voters. Voters will have to go with their gut about which guy has the best gut feel for navigating this world. Obama has demonstrated that he has something there. Romney has not.

HEADLINE: Eugene D. Genovese, 82, Historian of South, Dies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Eugene D. Genovese, a prizewinning historian who challenged conventional thinking on slavery in the American South by stressing its paternalism as he traveled a personal intellectual journey from Marxism to conservative Catholicism, died on Wednesday at his home in Atlanta. He was 82.
His friend William J. Hungeling confirmed the death without giving a cause. 
Mr. Genovese enthusiastically melded politics and academia even as his politics changed. A member of the Communist Party at 15, he had remained firmly on the left when, in 1965, speaking to students, he inflamed politicians by saying he would welcome a Vietcong victory in the Vietnam War.
By the 1980s, however, he had rejected Communism and liberal politics. In 1998 he helped form the Historical Society to combat what he saw as the ''totalitarian assault'' of political correctness and ideologically tinged research. He also came to support conservative Republicans like Pat Buchanan.
''I never gave a damn what people thought of me,'' he said in an interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark in 1996. ''And I still don't.''
Mr. Genovese's greatest influence, however, was quieter, devolving from his insights into the politics and culture of the antebellum South, expressed in more than a dozen books. Several were written with his wife, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, a noted scholar of women's studies whose own political transformation, from Marxist-leaning feminist to social conservative, paralleled her husband's.
Praised for his meticulous research, Mr. Genovese argued that slave life in the pre-Civil War South was not one of continuous cruelty and degradation. Rather, he described a system of ''paternalism'' in which slaves had compelled their owners to recognize their humanity. This, he said, allowed the slaves to preserve their self-respect as well as their aspirations for freedom while enabling their owners to continue to profit from their labor.
The book in which he articulated this view most completely was ''Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made,'' which in 1975 won the Bancroft Prize for American history writing. The historian Edward L. Ayers, writing in The New Republic in 1994, called it ''the best book ever written about American slavery.''
But others criticized the book as being weak in its analysis of the economics of the period and took issue with its view that a paternalistic relationship was peculiar to slavery in the United States. Some said that the buying and selling of slaves could hardly be considered paternalistic; parents do not normally sell their children, the historian Eric Foner wrote in 1982.
More broadly, Mr. Genovese was accused of playing down the truth that slavery, by definition, demonstrates the cruelest kind of racism. Mr. Genovese repeatedly felt compelled to assert that his books were not an apology for slavery. In subsequent books, Mr. Genovese praised intellectual life in the antebellum South, particularly its tradition of cooperative conservatism, which he saw as kinder than capitalism in the North. He cited statistics showing Southern whites, even those from disadvantaged families, were more apt to go to college than Northern whites. He argued Southerners preferred broader ownership on property and more constraints on the marketplace.
He called the Civil War the War for Southern Independence. He castigated those who saw the slaveholding South ''as the citadel of the Devil.''
''The fact is the South embodies much that's at the core of Western civilization,'' Mr. Genovese said in an interview with The New York Times in 1998. ''If it has become at times the embodiment of the worst of that tradition, it has also embodied the best.''
The son of a dockworker, Eugene Dominick Genovese was born on May 19, 1930, in Brooklyn and never lost the accent. His membership in the Communist Party lasted five years, ending when he was expelled at 20 for ''having zigged when I was supposed to zag,'' he said. He earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, then served 10 months in the Army before being discharged because of his Communist past.
In his 20s, he earned a master's and Ph.D. from Columbia (and started pronouncing his name the Italian way, ''jen-o-VAY-zay''). He then began a professorial career that took him to more than a dozen colleges, including the University of Rochester, the University of Cambridge in England and four universities in Georgia: Emory University, Georgia State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia. He was president of the Organization of American Historians from 1978 to 1979.
In April 1965, as a professor at Rutgers in New Jersey, Mr. Genovese spoke at a ''teach-in'' against the escalating violence in Vietnam. Saying he was a Marxist (but no longer a member of the Communist Party), he proclaimed: ''I do not fear or regret the impending Vietcong victory in Vietnam. I welcome it.''
His remarks created a firestorm. Richard M. Nixon, then out of office and living in New York, denounced him, and the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, Wayne Dumont, demanded his dismissal. Bumper stickers saying ''Rid Rutgers of Reds'' popped up.
Mr. Genovese insisted that he did not mean to say that he hoped American servicemen would be killed, and the state educational authorities defended him. But he soon left Rutgers to teach at Sir George Williams University in Montreal (since merged into Concordia University).
In the 1990s, he and Ms. Fox-Genovese converted to Roman Catholicism and were remarried in the church 26 years after their first wedding. She died in 2007. Mr. Genovese left no immediate survivors.
Mr. Genovese came to believe that religion should be taught in public schools, and opposed abortion on demand and special laws to protect homosexuals. He believed pornography should be banned. But Mr. Genovese did not affiliate himself with any segment of the political right. He said he felt uncomfortable around conservatives who believed that unfettered markets solve all problems.
''if somebody wants to disorder the world and give me political power,'' he said, ''they'll find out how conservative I'm not.''

HEADLINE: Inside the Mind of Worry

BYLINE: By DAVID ROPEIK. 
David Ropeik is an instructor at the Harvard Extension School and the author of ''How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don't Always Match the Facts.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
WE make all sorts of ostensibly conscious and seemingly rational choices when we are aware of a potential risk. We eat organic food, max out on multivitamins and quickly forswear some products (even whole technologies) at the slightest hint of danger. We carry guns and vote for the candidate we think will keep us safe. Yet these choices are far from carefully considered -- and, surprisingly often, they contravene reason. What's more, while our choices about risk invariably feel right when we make them, many of these decisions end up putting us in greater peril.
Researchers in neuroscience, psychology, economics and other disciplines have made a range of discoveries about why human beings sometimes fear more than the evidence warrants, and sometimes less than the evidence warns. That science is worth reviewing at length. But one current issue offers a crash course in the most significant of these findings: the fear of vaccines, particularly vaccines for children.
In a 2011 Thomson Reuters/NPR poll, nearly one parent in three with a child under 18 was worried about vaccines, and roughly one American in four was concerned about the value and safety of vaccines in general. In the same poll, roughly one out of every five college-educated respondents worried that childhood vaccination was connected with autism; 7 percent said they feared a link with Type 1 diabetes. 
Based on the evidence, these and most other concerns about vaccines are unfounded. A comprehensive report last year from the Institute of Medicine is just one of many studies to report that vaccines do not cause autism, diabetes, asthma or other major afflictions listed by the anti-vaccination movement.
Yet these fears, fierce and visceral, persist. To frustrated doctors and health officials, vaccine-phobia seems an irrational denial of the facts that puts both the unvaccinated child and the community at greater risk (as herd immunity goes down, disease spread rises). But the more we learn about how risk perception works, the more understandable -- if still quite dangerous -- the fear of vaccines becomes.
Along with many others, the cognitive psychologists Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon and Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon University have identified several reasons something might feel more or less scary than mere reason might suppose. Humans subconsciously weigh the risks and benefits of any choice or course of action -- and if taking a particular action seems to afford little or no benefit, the risk automatically feels bigger. Vaccinations are a striking example. As the subconscious mind might view it, vaccines protect children from diseases like measles and pertussis, or whooping cough, that are no longer common, so the benefit to vaccination feels small -- and smaller still, perhaps, compared to even the minuscule risk of a serious side effect. (In actuality, outbreaks of both of these infections have been more common in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Contrast this with how people felt in the 1950s, in the frightening days of polio, when parents lined their kids up for vaccines that carried much greater risk than do the modern ones. The risk felt smaller, because the benefit was abundantly clear.
Professor Slovic and Professor Fischhoff and others have found that a risk imposed upon a person, like mandatory vaccination programs (nearly all of which allow people to opt out), feels scarier than the same risk if taken voluntarily. Risk perception also depends on trust. A risk created by a source you don't trust will feel scarier. The anti-vaccination movement is thick with mistrust of government and the drug industry. Finally, risks that are human-made, like vaccines, evoke more worry than risks that are natural. Some parents who refuse to have their kids vaccinated say they are willing to accept the risk of the disease, because the disease is ''natural.''
Still, shouldn't our wonderful powers of reason be able to overcome these instinctive impediments to clear thinking? The neuroscience of fear makes clear that such hope is hubris. Work on the neural roots of fear by the neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux of New York University, and others, has found that in the complex interplay of slower, conscious reason and quicker, subconscious emotion and instinct, the basic architecture of the brain ensures that we feel first and think second. The part of the brain where the instinctive ''fight or flight'' signal is first triggered -- the amygdala -- is situated such that it receives incoming stimuli before the parts of the brain that think things over. Then, in our ongoing response to potential peril, the way the brain is built and operates assures that we are likely to feel more and think less. As Professor LeDoux puts it in ''The Emotional Brain'': ''the wiring of the brain at this point in our evolutionary history is such that connections from the emotional systems to the cognitive systems are stronger than connections from the cognitive systems to the emotional systems.''
And so we have excessive fear of vaccines. But just as we are too afraid of some things, this same ''feelings and facts'' system works the other way too, sometimes leaving us inadequately concerned about bigger risks. A risky behavior you engage in voluntarily and that seems to afford plenty of benefit -- think sun-tanning for that ''nice, healthy glow'' -- feels less dangerous. A societal risk, well off in the future, tends not to trigger the same instinctive alarm -- in part, because the hazard isn't singling any one of us out, individually. This helps explain why concern over climate change is broad, but thin.
Though it may be prone to occasional errors, our risk-perception system isn't all bad. After all, it has gotten us this far through evolution's gantlet. But a system that relies so heavily on emotion and instinct sometimes produces risk perceptions that don't match the evidence, a ''risk perception gap'' that can be a risk in itself. We do have to fear the dangers of fear itself.
In this remarkable era of discovery about how our brains operate, we have discovered a great deal about why the gap occurs, and we can -- and should -- put our detailed knowledge of risk perception to use in narrowing the risk-perception gap and reducing its dangers. As the Italian philosopher Nicola Abbagnano advised, ''Reason itself is fallible, and this fallibility must find a place in our logic.'' Accepting that risk perception is not so much a process of pure reason, but rather a subjective combination of the facts and how those facts feel, might be just the step in the human learning curve we need to make. Then, maybe, we'll start making smarter decisions about vaccines and other health matters.

HEADLINE: New Mexico Gives Look Into Politics Of Future

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS, N.M. -- The volunteers fanned out in pairs last week, swarming the heart of this old settlers' outpost in the north central part of the nation's most Hispanic state.
Julio Maestas, 25, whose ancestors were among the area's original residents, and Anayeli Rivera, 22, whose mother was born in Mexico, knocked on doors along Valencia Street, taking the Obama campaign's message to veterans and retirees whose speech is a mix of English and Spanish.
New Mexico Democrats are intensifying their efforts to increase Hispanic voter turnout, a perennial quest here and across the country for a rapidly growing ethnic group that tends to vote in significantly lower percentages than other groups.
The results are being closely watched by national party leaders. The theory is that, with the Hispanic population growing in many states, the way New Mexico looks today is the way many states will look in elections down the road. 
''The work we do in New Mexico will inform campaigns in the future, not only about how we go out and register Hispanics, but also from a messaging standpoint -- what is it that Hispanic-Americans care about,'' said Adrian Saenz, the Obama campaign's national Latino vote director, in a telephone interview.
When the Obama campaign first planted a flag here five years ago, the landscape presented both challenge and opportunity. Outreach strategies of proven value in other states -- like Spanish-language advertising, or even the notion of advertising in the Spanish-language news media -- seemed to have minimal impact on New Mexico's Hispanics, who are more likely to speak English.
Voter-registration efforts were not as crucial; Hispanics, who are 47 percent of the state's population, make up nearly 40 percent of its electorate, the highest rate in the country. Get-out-the-vote efforts could not be discarded, but had to be tweaked: Hispanics still lagged in participation, but had deep political roots, influence and familiarity with the electoral process.
''We're well beyond the 'we're happy to be here' stage, well beyond 'Sí se puede,' '' Hector Balderas, the state auditor and a Democrat, said over a breakfast of beans and scrambled eggs in Albuquerque, referring to the Latino rallying cry ''Yes, we can'' during immigration law protests.
New Mexico might be the least contested among the battleground states, even though a poll by The Albuquerque Journal from early September showed the race as close. Still, its unique demographics hold weighty significance for both campaigns, which have been on the ground trying, proving, improving and disproving strategies to engage Latino voters -- eyeing both the November elections and the future.
The Obama campaign will open its 13th office here next Sunday, more than doubling its presence in the state over the previous month even as New Mexico leans toward Mr. Obama. Eight of them are strategically positioned in areas with large numbers of Hispanics. On the ground, organizers have been given more latitude to experiment.
A meeting among volunteers and the campaign's national political director, Katherine Archuleta, happened around a kitchen table, as the women sat making tamales. To draw multiple generations to the same event, volunteers in Albuquerque's Westside neighborhood put together a car show; hundreds of people showed up. Mobilization efforts do not necessarily carry the ''Votemos Todos'' label -- ''Everyone Vote'' -- carried by events in other states that are specifically geared toward Latinos.
According to Census Bureau projections, by 2030 the Hispanic share of the country's population will nearly double, to 23 percent from 13 percent, while the non-Hispanic white population is likely to drop by 16 points, to 53 percent.
The number of school-age Hispanics has already increased by more than five million nationwide since 2000, while non-Hispanic whites dropped by three million. Over the coming decade, aging alone is poised to increase the number of Hispanics who are eligible to vote by 25 percent, according to the Census Bureau, stirring a profound transformation of the American electorate regardless of the size or consistency of the flow of new immigrants into the country.
''The trajectory is that places outside of New Mexico will start looking more and more like New Mexico, not just because of the number of third- and fourth-generation families or English-language preference, but because of the inevitable political power that, even if slowly, Hispanics are bound to acquire,'' said Gabriel R. Sánchez, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico and the director of research at Latino Decisions, which studies Latino voting trends.
The state's secretary for economic development, Jon Barela, a Republican, said that ''New Mexico can offer a lot of clues as to where the country is moving,'' as well as ''validate the notion'' that there is nothing incongruous about being Hispanic and being Republican. (Like many Hispanic elected officials here, Mr. Barela traces his roots to the settlers who were granted plots of land by Mexico before New Mexico became part of the United States.)
Just a little over a week ago, though, the Republican National Committee, which has been leading Mitt Romney's efforts here, pulled the campaign's Hispanic-outreach and communications directors out of the state. One Republican legislator complained, in private, that Mr. Romney ''has given up'' on New Mexico, while conceding that it may just not make sense to spend resources in a state that can deliver only five electoral votes.
Gov. Susana Martinez, also a Republican, criticized Mr. Romney's comment that 47 percent of Americans are government ''dependents'' who will vote for Mr. Obama, saying the poor ''count just as much as anybody else.'' Already, she had declined to join him for his energy policy speech last month in Hobbs, a conservative enclave in New Mexico's oil country.
She is, however, going to campaign for him in Florida and Nevada, states where the Latino vote could tip the scale in November.
Bettina Inclán, Mr. Romney's director of Hispanic outreach, said the campaign still had a robust presence in the state, holding house parties, volunteer training sessions and round-table discussions for small-business owners.
The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has been here since 2009, when some of the same staff members who had led the efforts in the state ahead of the 2008 elections started making the rounds.
They have met Democratic ward leaders in Albuquerque, which has a mix of well-established Hispanics and more recent immigrants. They have heard from community organizers in southern New Mexico, where illegal immigration is still a relevant issue because of the area's proximity to the border.
And they have drafted local officials to make introductions and help the campaign make inroads in well-established Hispanic redoubts like Las Vegas and the South Valley of Albuquerque, where connections matter more than credentials, State Senator Linda M. Lopez said recently, before the weekly phone bank she attends to make calls for the Obama campaign.
In Las Vegas, Mr. Maestas and Ms. Rivera, students at New Mexico Highlands University, talked to voters about the reasons they support Mr. Obama. For him, it is the president's plan to improve the economy; for her, it is his focus on health care.
At the field office, Lillian Salazar, 68, a retired federal employee volunteering for a political campaign for the first time, said her choice was not partisan.
''I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat,'' said Mrs. Salazar, whose ancestors settled in the area hundreds of years ago. ''I care if you listen. It matters what I have to say.''

HEADLINE: Compromise in N.F.L.; Is Congress Next?

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''N.F.L. Reaches Labor Accord with Referees,'' Sept. 27: The N.F.L. officials lockout and the outrage it wrought were exactly what the N.F.L. needed. Far from a national embarrassment, it might just be what saved football.
Recall the state of the N.F.L. before the replacements took the field. The New Orleans Saints' bounty scandal revealed the bloodthirsty culture of professional football at the same time as Junior Seau's suicide called attention to the mounting evidence that players risk severe brain trauma through repeated concussions. The effect of the bounty scandal was mitigated only by the N.F.L.'s arbitrary and capricious justice system, which made a mockery of our belief that sports represent the highest of our ideals. 
During the lockout, while commentators and fans criticized poor officiating, no one talked about concussions or bounties. When the officials retake the field, football will appear to return to normal. The integrity of the game will have been restored. That's what the N.F.L. wanted.
Jack Neubauer

To the Sports Editor:
Isn't it amazing that the N.F.L. realized it was in the best interest of its fans to compromise with its officials? Yes, the N.F.L. found a way to compromise.
I wonder if Congress is paying attention. After all, our country has much more at stake than the results of any football game.

Re ''At Racetrack, Economic Pressures Overpower Veterinarians' Oath,'' Sept. 22: Speaking as a fairly typical thoroughbred racehorse owner, I hope people understand the lack of influence we have to prevent the abuse of performance-enhancing medications. The average owner has two horses and thus represents a small fraction of most trainers' operations.
Any limitations we place on trainers are seen as a handicap to their ability to win races, in that way limiting their income potential and their statistical win percentages. Our perspectives on this matter are often scoffed at as uninformed; if we become insistent, many trainers will simply not train our horses. The best hope for the welfare of the horses and the legitimacy of the industry lies in new federal regulations like the pending Interstate Horse Racing Improvement Act that would ban all race-day medication, similar to most other developed-country practices.

To the Sports Editor:
It is easy to vilify veterinarians, who have taken an oath to promote animal health, but the entire racetrack culture is fueled by unique mores, superstitions and pressure to perform. Absentee owners claim ignorance of standard practices, yet blindly pressure trainers for a monetary return on their investment in a racehorse, which in the vast majority of cases is a financial investment, not a labor of love.
Trainers are performing on a razor's edge of profit versus loss, working with unpredictable and complex animals, much different from most other forms of investment.
Veterinarians should not be the only ones derided in this situation. The whole industry stinks.

'Unless You Get Caught'
To the Sports Editor:
Re: ''Reversal on Cabrera Doesn't Change the Facts,'' Sept. 21: Commissioner Bud Selig would have been better off adding a rule that says any player in violation of league drug policy vacates anything accomplished in the concurrent season.
Rewriting history is one thing, but the current season is not history, and Melky Cabrera was caught red-handed.
How are we expected to bring up our children in a ''nothing is illegal unless you get caught'' environment? It's amazing that we accept people who flagrantly violate the law and are allowed to keep the spoils of their misdeeds.

HEADLINE: The Conservative Case for Obamacare

BYLINE: By J. D. KLEINKE. 
A resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a former health care executive and the author of the novel ''Catching Babies.''

 BODY:
Washington
IF Mitt Romney's pivots on President's Obama's health care reform act have accelerated to a blur -- from repealing on Day 1, to preserving this or that piece, to punting the decision to the states -- it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations: the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative, not liberal, ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces.
This fundamental ideological paradox, drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan's passage in 2010, explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals, who wanted a real, not imagined, ''government takeover of health care.'' It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better. And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor. 
The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists, designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system -- principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s. The president's program extends the current health care system -- mostly employer-based coverage, administered by commercial health insurers, with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals -- by removing the biggest obstacles to that system's functioning like a competitive marketplace.
Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance, which requires that younger, healthier people subsidize older, sicker ones. Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary, millions have simply opted out, a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street. The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers, along with those who cannot afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway, when they get sick and show up in that E.R. And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but cannot because of their medical histories. Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act, and its aim is clear: to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace.
This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along. It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers.
The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law: the mandate that we all carry health insurance, an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation. The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to, because it requires trading away today's wants for tomorrow's needs. The mandate is about personal responsibility -- a hallmark of conservative thought.
IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election, Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years. The only thing wrong with the mandate? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea.
The same goes for health insurance exchanges, another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years. An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come: free up buyers and sellers, standardize the products, add pricing transparency, and watch what happens. Market Economics 101.
In the shouting match over the health care law, most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues: it enshrines accountability -- yes, another conservative idea. Under today's system, most health insurers (and providers) are accountable to the wrong people, often for the wrong reasons, with the needs of patients coming last. With the transparency, mobility and choice of the exchanges, businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers (and, embedded in their networks, which providers) deserve their dollars. They can see, thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act, what they are actually buying. They can shop around. And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out, paying into funds that subsidize individuals' coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping, with what is, in essence, their own compensation, relocated to the exchanges.
Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans -- with their own money on an exchange -- first floated around Washington, advocates called them ''association health plans.'' They, too, would have corrected for the lack of transparency, mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines. They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration's reform plan (had the administration not been distracted by other matters). After the rejection of ''Hillarycare'' in the mid-'90s, association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market, Republican thinking about health reform -- essentially what would become Romneycare, extended via federal law to cover the entire country. So much for Mr. Romney's argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states' rights. His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country, and they looked a lot like Obamacare.
But perhaps the clearest indication of the conservative economic values underlying the act is its reception by many Democrats. The plan has few champions on the left precisely because it is not a government takeover of health care. It is not a single-payer system, nor ''Medicare for all''; it does not include a ''public option,'' a health plan offered by a federal insurer. It is a ratification of market ideas, modified to address problems unique to health insurance.
Mr. Obama's plan, which should be a darling of the right for these principles, was abandoned not for its content, but rather for politics. Neither side is blameless here. The White House could not have been more ham-fisted in the way it rammed the bill through Congress. The Republicans in the House and Senate lashed back with a vengeance, sifting through the legislative colossus for boogeymen like ''death panels,'' and when they could not find things sufficiently alarmist, they simply invented them.
Clear away all the demagogy and scare tactics, and Obamacare is, at its core, Romneycare across state lines. But today's Republicans dare not own anything built on principles of economic conservatism, if it also protects one of the four horsemen of the social conservatives' apocalypse: coverage for the full spectrum of women's reproductive health, from birth control to abortion.
Social conservatives' hostility to the health care act is a natural corollary to their broader agenda of controlling women's bodies. These are not the objections of traditional ''conservatives,'' but of agitators for prying, invasive government -- the very things they project, erroneously, onto the workings of the president's plan. Decrying the legislation for interfering in the doctor-patient relationship, while seeking to pass grossly intrusive laws involving the OB-GYN-patient relationship, is one of the more bizarre disconnects in American politics.
Obamacare draws fire from this segment of ''conservatives'' because it fortifies the other side in their holy war. Coverage for birth control and abortion has not been introduced by the law; but it has been neutralized economically across all health plans, as part of the plan's systemic effort to streamline fragmented health insurance markets and coverage.
The real problem with the health care plan -- for Mr. Romney and the Republicans in general -- is that political credit for it goes to Mr. Obama. Now, Mr. Romney is in a terrible fix trying to spin his way out of this paradox and tear down something he knows is right -- something for which he ought to be taking great political credit of his own.

HEADLINE: Women Hurting Women

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
ARE female leaders better for the world's women?
It would be nice to think that women who achieve power would want to help women at the bottom. But one continuing global drama underscores that women in power can be every bit as contemptible as men.
Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, is mounting a scorched-earth offensive against Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank and champion of the economic empowerment of women around the world. Yunus, 72, won a Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in microfinance, focused on helping women lift their families out of poverty. 
Yet Sheikh Hasina's government has already driven Yunus from his job as managing director of Grameen Bank. Worse, since last month, her government has tried to seize control of the bank from its 5.5 million small-time shareholders, almost all of them women, who collectively own more than 95 percent of the bank.
What a topsy-turvy picture: We see a woman who has benefited from evolving gender norms using her government powers to destroy the life's work of a man who has done as much for the world's most vulnerable women as anybody on earth.
The government has also started various investigations of Yunus and his finances and taxes, and his supporters fear that he might be arrested on some pretext or another.
''It's an insane situation,'' Yunus told me a few days ago at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, sounding subdued instead of his normally exuberant self. ''I just don't know how to deal with it.''
If the government succeeds in turning Grameen Bank into a government bank, Yunus said, ''it is finished.''
Sheikh Hasina, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, initially agreed to be interviewed by me in a suite at the Grand Hyatt. At the last minute she canceled and refused to reschedule.
Perhaps none of this should be surprising. Metrics like girls' education and maternal mortality don't improve more when a nation is led by a woman. There is evidence that women matter as local leaders and on corporate boards, but that doesn't seem to have been true at the national level, at least not for the first cohort of female leaders around the world.
Bangladesh is actually a prime example of the returns from investing in women. When it separated from Pakistan in 1971, it was a wreck. But it invested in girls' education, and today more than half of its high school students are female -- an astonishing achievement for an impoverished Muslim country.
All those educated women formed the basis for Bangladesh's garment industry. They also had fewer births: the average Bangladeshi woman now has 2.2 children, down from 6 in 1980. Bringing women into the mainstream also seems to have soothed extremism, which is much less of a concern than in Pakistan (where female literacy in the tribal areas is only 3 percent).
To her credit, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spoken up for Yunus: ''I highly respect Muhammad Yunus, and I highly respect the work that he has done, and I am hoping to see it continue without being in any way undermined or affected by any government action,'' she said earlier this year. Two former secretaries of state, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright, have also called on Sheikh Hasina to back off.
She shows no sign of doing so. One theory is that she is paranoid and sees Yunus as a threat, especially since he made an abortive effort to enter politics in 2007. Another theory is that she is envious of his Nobel Peace Prize and resentful of his global renown.
Sheikh Hasina is disappointing in other ways. She has turned a blind eye to murders widely attributed to the security services. My Times colleague Jim Yardley wrote just this month about a labor leader, Aminul Islam, who had been threatened by security officers and whose tortured body was found in a pauper's grave.
Yunus fans are signing a Change.org petition on his behalf, but I'd like to see more American officials and politicians speak up for him. President Obama, how about another photo op with Yunus?
I still strongly believe that we need more women in leadership posts at home and around the world, from presidential palaces to corporate boards. The evidence suggests that diverse leadership leads to better decision making, and I think future generations of female leaders may be more attentive to women's issues than the first.
In any case, this painful episode in Bangladesh is a reminder that the struggle to achieve gender equality isn't simply a battle between the sexes.
It is far more subtle. Misogyny and indifference remain obstacles for women globally, but those are values that can be absorbed and transmitted by women as well as by men.

HEADLINE: Obamanomics: A Counterhistory

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Washington
WORKING out of cramped, bare offices in a downtown building here in Washington, President-elect Obama's economic team spent the final weeks of 2008 trying to assess how bad the economy was. It was during those weeks, according to several members of the team, when they first discussed academic research by the economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff that would soon become well known.
Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff were about to publish a book based on earlier academic papers, arguing that financial crises led to slumps that were longer and deeper than other recessions. Almost inevitably, the economists wrote, policy makers battling a crisis made the mistake of thinking that their crisis would not be as bad as previous ones. The wry title of the book is ''This Time Is Different.''
In my interviews with Obama advisers during that time, they emphasized that they knew the history and were determined to avoid repeating it. Yet of course they did repeat it. After successfully preventing another depression, in 2009, they have spent much of the last three years underestimating the economy's weakness. That weakness, in turn, has become Mr. Obama's biggest vulnerability, helping cost Democrats control of the House in 2010 and endangering his accomplishments elsewhere. 
Entire books and countless articles have taken Mr. Obama to task on the economy, and administration officials have a rebuttal that makes a couple of important points. The Federal Reserve and many private-sector economists were also too optimistic, Obama aides note. And they argue that the Senate would not have passed a much larger stimulus in 2009, given Republican opposition, regardless of the White House's wishes.
But from these reasonable points, the Obama team then jumps to a larger and more dubious conclusion: that their failure to grasp the severity of the slump has had no real consequences. Even if they had seen the slow recovery coming, they say, they couldn't have done much about it. When Mr. Obama has been asked about his biggest mistake, he talks about messaging, not policy.
''The mistake of my first term -- couple of years -- was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right,'' he has said. ''The nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times.''
We can never know for sure what the past four years would have been like if the administration and the Fed had been more worried about the economy. But my reading of the evidence -- and some former Obama aides agree -- points strongly to the idea that the misjudging of the downturn did affect policy and ultimately the economy.
Mr. Obama's biggest mistake as president has not been the story he told the country about the economy. It's the story he and his advisers told themselves.
The notion of insurance is useful here. Suggesting that Mr. Obama and his aides should have bucked the consensus forecast and decided that a long slump was the most likely outcome smacks of 20/20 hindsight. Yet that wasn't their only option. They also could have decided that there was a substantial risk of a weak recovery and looked for ways to take out insurance.
By late 2008, the full depth of the crisis was not clear, but enough of it was. A few prominent liberal economists were publicly predicting a long slump, as was Mr. Rogoff, a Republican. The Obama team openly compared its transition to Franklin D. Roosevelt's and, in private, discussed the Reinhart-Rogoff work.
So why didn't that work do more to affect the team's decisions?
There are two main answers. First, the situation was unlike anything any living policy maker had previously experienced, and it was deteriorating quickly. Although officials talked about the Depression, they struggled to treat the downturn as fundamentally different from a big, relatively brief recession.
''The numbers got ramped up,'' one former White House official told me, referring to the planned size of the stimulus in late 2008. ''But the basic frame did not get altered.'' In particular, the administration did not imagine that the economy would still need major help well beyond 2009 and that Congress would not comply.
The second problem was that Mr. Obama and his advisers believed -- correctly -- that they and the Fed were already responding more aggressively than governments had in past crises. Even before the election, President George W. Bush signed the financial bailout, a decidedly un-Hooveresque policy. The Fed began flooding the economy with money. The Obama administration pushed for the stimulus and, with the Fed, conducted successful stress tests on banks.
Whatever the political debate over these measures, the economic evidence suggests they made a large difference. Analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and other nonpartisan economists have come to this conclusion. Europe, which was less aggressive, has fared worse. And the chronology of the crisis tells the same story.
In 2008 and early 2009, the global economy was deteriorating even more rapidly than in 1929, according to research by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. O'Rourke. Global stock prices and trade dropped more sharply. But the policy response this time was vastly different, and by the spring of 2009 -- just as the measures were taking effect -- the economy stabilized.
In this success came the seeds of future failures. Knowing in late 2008 how much policy help was on the way, Mr. Obama and his economic advisers decided that the disturbing pattern of financial crises was not directly relevant. ''In a way, they fell into a 'This Time Is Different' trap,'' another former White House official said.
A banner headline in The Financial Times in June 2009 pronounced the White House ''Upbeat on Economy.'' Nine months later, after the recovery had run into new problems, the administration said the economy was on the verge of ''escape velocity.''
Even now, the Obama team sometimes suggests that the weak recovery isn't related to the financial crisis. Some problems, like the rise in oil prices, are not in fact related. Many others, like Europe's troubles and this country's still-depressed consumer spending, are.
Imagine if the transition team had instead placed, say, 25 percent odds on a protracted slump. Political advisers like David Axelrod would have immediately understood the consequences. Mr. Obama's policies would look like a failure during the midterm campaign, and the prospects of winning additional stimulus would dwindle. Which is exactly what happened.
Contemplating this outcome, the new administration would have had urgent reasons to take out insurance policies. For starters, Mr. Obama would indeed have told a different story about the economy. Rather than promising a ''recovery summer'' in 2010, he and his aides would have cautioned patience. Bill Clinton's recent Democratic convention speech was a model.
More concretely, the administration would have looked for every possible lever to lift the economy. Despite Republican opposition, such levers existed.
Upon taking office, Mr. Obama could have immediately nominated people to fill the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, rather than leaving two openings. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, works hard to achieve consensus on the Fed's policy committee, and in 2010 and 2011 the committee was skewed toward officials predicting -- wrongly, we now know -- that inflation was a bigger threat than unemployment.
TWO more appointees may well have shifted the debate and caused the Fed to have been less cautious. After the vacancies were finally filled this year, the Fed took further action.
The administration also could have added provisions to the stimulus bill that depended on the economy's condition. So long as job growth remained below a certain benchmark, federal aid to states and unemployment benefits could have continued flowing. Crucially, these provisions would not have added much to the bill's price tag. Because the Congressional Budget Office's forecast was also too optimistic, the official budget scoring would have assumed that the provisions would have been unlikely to take effect. They would have been insurance.
Perhaps most important, the administration might have taken a different path on housing. With the auto industry and Wall Street, Mr. Obama accepted the political costs that come with bailouts. He rescued arguably undeserving people in exchange for helping the larger economy. With housing, he went the other way, even leaving some available rescue money unspent -- at least until last year, when the policy became more aggressive and began to have a bigger effect.
No one of these steps, or several other plausible ones, would have fixed the economy. But just as the rescue programs of early 2009 made a big difference, a more aggressive program stretching beyond 2009 almost certainly would have made a bigger difference. It would have had the potential to smooth out the stop-and-start nature of the recovery, which has sapped consumer and business confidence and become a problem in its own right.
By any measure, Mr. Obama and his team faced a tremendously difficult task. They inherited the worst economy in 70 years, as well as an opposition party that was dedicated to limiting the administration to one term and that fought attempts at additional action in 2010 and 2011. And the administration can rightly claim to have performed better than many other governments around the world.
But their claim on having done as well as could reasonably have been expected -- to have avoided major mistakes -- is hard to accept. They considered the possibility of a long, slow recovery and rejected it.
In the early months of the crisis, Mr. Obama and his aides made clear that they would try to learn from the errors of the Great Depression and do better. They achieved that goal. They also left a whole lot of lessons for the people who will have to battle the next financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Main Street's Landlord

BYLINE: By BERT STRATTON. 
The author of the blog Klezmer Guy: Real Music and Real Estate.

 BODY:
Cleveland Heights, Ohio
FOR all the attention it's getting from our presidential contenders, Main Street has it tough right now.
I own 30 storefronts -- mostly prewar retail shops, with apartments upstairs -- in a suburb near Cleveland. Along Detroit Avenue, from West 117th to West Clifton, more and more of my small commercial tenants are going out of business. CoStar, a real estate information firm, reports the national retail vacancy rate at 6.9 percent, but much of that is malls, ''lifestyle'' centers and strip centers with supermarkets. There aren't specific numbers for the mom and pops, for Main Street.
Since 2000, median household income in Ohio plunged from 19th to 39th among the states. If no one is earning, no one is buying, and then who can afford to rent my storefronts? The Internet knocked out several flower shops in town. One of my tenants resold children's toys. When her shop went out of business, she left me a basement of Fisher-Price: broken schoolhouses, gas stations and school buses. Also, Little Tikes picnic tables and Big Wheels. I wish she had left me a Fisher-Price dump truck. 
There are some new businesses in town. Quaker Steak and Lube moved in down the street from my properties. So did Five Guys, a national burger chain, and Eddie 'N Eddie, a local burger place.
Beer, fries, burgers, apple pie and bourbon: those are the key words on the latest awnings.
I'll tell you what won't work: I had a prospective tenant ask me if he could put in a terrarium store. ''Customers design their own mini-terrariums,'' he said. You can rent 1,000 square feet -- basically an enormous shoe box -- for $675 per month in Cleveland, but the terrarium man never called back.
Another prospect called and said two words: ''Astrology, botanics.''
No thanks.
A prospect asked about a hookah and tobacco shop. I thought about that for a few seconds. I said, ''Take another look at the store.'' I stalled. I wanted a hardware store or a dry cleaner, a bar, a restaurant. Something that might survive.
The hookah man asked for a couple of months' free rent. I said, ''Sorry, I don't want to rent to a hookah bar.''
One former tenant -- an Eastern healing arts therapist -- installed a shower in the basement; he moved in downstairs after a divorce. Coincidentally, a prospect recently called and asked if he could put a shower in the store.
''There is a shower! What kind of business do you have in mind?'' I asked.
''A participatory art gallery.''
''Why the shower?''
''The artists cover themselves in paint.''
''Kind of like Jackson Pollock. People rolling on the floor?''
''You got it.''
That didn't happen either.
I've gotten off-kilter inquiries for years. The difference is now I listen to the callers, at least for a few minutes. But terrariums, body painting and astrology are tough ways to go, particularly in a down market. Burgers, fries and beer. That's the ticket.
I rent to the police. They have a neighborhood police office, a mini-station in a storefront. The neighborhood cop, Rick, rides a bike. Hometown America. The police chief just wrote, ''Due to economic conditions we are no longer able to rent your storefront.'' Special government discount -- $625 a month -- and that's too much?
Yes.
Burgers, fries and beer.
Don't tell the nutritionists.

At rest beneath a looming row of gantry cranes, the ship had come to port on a half-day call to discharge a load of South American cargo: 421 containers' worth, each one weighing as much as a family of elephants -- or slightly more than 40,000 pounds.
Fifty feet above the deck, crane trolleys flew through the air, their jawlike spreaders plucking boxes from the giant vessel's hold. As the boxes were lowered onto the wharf, they were gobbled up by a waiting fleet of straddle carriers, busy arachnid vehicles that alerted a computer to the cargo's arrival, and hauled it off to preordained locations in the yard.
From the asphalt dock, the scene looked a little like the launching pad at Cape Canaveral: a sprawling techno-space dominated by Jurassic-size, seemingly autonomous machines. One astonishing thing about the longshore business these days is how its vast scope -- tons of roses from Costa Rica, sneakers from South Korea and children's clothes from Malaysia are moved each year -- requires so few visible human bodies. 
Much of the work takes place indoors. Up in a control room, sitting among some peers, a superintendent monitored a digital schematic of the ship, tracking the operation, step by step, in real time. His blinking, changing screen showed the number of containers already unloaded and the number still aboard. It showed how many crane lifts and straddle-carrier moves had been accomplished and, moreover, whether the ratio of moves-per-15-minute-increment was faster, or slower, than the terminal had planned.
Sitting in an office nearby was James Pelliccio, the president of the terminal, one of six such outfits that make up the Port of New York and New Jersey and lie in a loose semicircle south of Manhattan from Newark Bay through the Kill Van Kull to Upper New York Bay. ''The way I see it, we're not really in the transportation business anymore,'' Mr. Pelliccio said. ''We're in the information business.''
It was a striking thing to say about the classic New York task of handling seaborne cargo, an activity that, if only in the collective imagination, still remains connected to the grueling leg-and-shoulder work immortalized on film by Marlon Brando. The truth, of course, is that today's port is driven more by brains than by brawn. Terminal workers speak a florid corporate language of ''space optimization'' and ''key performance indicators.'' Longshoremen click computer mice and complain about Microsoft Windows as everyone else in the white-collar world does.
It is partly because of these mechanical and technological advances that the New York area ports are now booming, after the last few difficult years. In 2011, the six terminals in Brooklyn and New Jersey and on Staten Island handled the equivalent of 5.5 million container loads of cargo, more than at any point since New York was founded by the Dutch. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimates that this year will be just as busy, leading one former Port Authority economist to write in August that the city is in ''striking distance'' of reclaiming from Los Angeles the title of the country's busiest trade zone.
The history of the region's port has always been marked by transformation, whether in 1825, when the Erie Canal was opened, allowing trade with the flourishing Midwest; or in 1956, when standardized containers began ushering out the era of winching unevenly shaped break-bulk cargo out of holds.
Those at the port today agree that this is another moment ripe with change, even if they disagree about what that change will bring. The Panama Canal is scheduled to be widened in a few years, and the Port Authority will, by then, have spent the better portion of a $3.8 billion capital investment plan to attract its massive freighters, which will have nearly double the capacity of current cargo ships. Terminal executives, like Mr. Pelliccio, have spent an additional $1 billion on infrastructure improvements, eagerly joining the ''arms race'' for business out of Panama against rival ports in Long Beach, Calif.; Norfolk, Va.; and Savannah, Ga.
While all this money and frenzied preparation have lent the port an atmosphere of energy, it has also destabilized its inherent balance of forces, as a small group of stakeholders -- shipping companies, terminal owners, the Port Authority, the longshoremen's union -- jockeys to promote specific visions of the future. Not surprisingly, these conflicting visions have become a central issue in the bitter contract talks between the union and its local negotiating partner, the New York Shipping Association. The talks fell apart last month and would have resulted in a strike on Oct. 1, right before the Christmas inventory season, if a federal mediator hadn't gotten both sides to agree to a three-month extension.
Beyond the specifics -- the shippers' frustration, say, with antiquated work rules or the union's concern with protecting jobs against advancing automation -- the debate has pitted self-professed visionary capitalists, who have spent a fortune hoping to seize the next big thing, against a shrinking working class that sees itself as besieged not only by management and an unsympathetic news media, but also by potential obsolescence.
''The longshore community is worried that the next phase of evolution will render them irrelevant,'' said Jim Devine, the president of Global Container Terminals on Staten Island, which recently began a $350 million automation project. ''In my opinion, that's not true. While jobs will be lost, new jobs will be created.''
Officials from the International Longshoremen's Association turned down repeated requests to answer questions for this article. Then again, the facts speak for themselves.
Thirty years ago, there would have been 40 or 50 longshoremen -- lashers, hustlers, checkers -- working on the CSAV Pyrenees. Now, there were fewer than half that.
ONE of the things heard around the port is that people there, particularly powerful people, believe that they are working in obscurity. New York is -- and has always been -- a port town, they say, but few people think of it that way. One former terminal executive recalled seeing an advertisement for a recent public event celebrating the city's waterfront. Ferryboats and kayakers were mentioned, but not the port.
The omission was shocking, not least because the port is gigantic: the largest on the East Coast, the third-largest in the country, an industrial leviathan that supports nearly 280,000 jobs, including truckers, security guards and maintenance workers. (In comparison, Wall Street supports about 160,000.)
The port is also extremely busy. For the past 10 years, the Port Authority has been deepening the channels of New York Harbor in one of the largest dredging projects in American history and has more recently improved the port's railroad system; it will soon spend more than $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge. Shipping lines have invested in larger, faster vessels, and terminal owners have expanded wharf space, bought bigger cranes and installed sophisticated ''in-gates'' -- tollboothlike plazas where cameras automatically record the ID numbers of trucks and containers.
All of this is to prepare for the expected increase in materials passing through the Panama Canal on the ''all water route'' from Asia they hope will replace the practice of shipping containers to the West Coast and then moving them by rail to profitable markets in the heartland.
''New York is perfectly positioned to capture the future,'' said Joseph C. Curto, president of the shipping association, an industry trade group. ''It's cheaper to send Ikea lawn furniture here on the proverbial slow boat from China than to send it to the West Coast and train it across.
''The goods will come here,'' Mr. Curto added, ''if we remain the most economical way to get them here.''
Getting so-called discretionary cargo -- destined for locations beyond the region's borders -- means competing with larger ports in California and with smaller, leaner, often non-unionized ports along the mid-Atlantic Coast. Labor accounts for nearly half the cost of doing business in New York, which remains the most expensive port in the world to shippers, the shipping association says.
It is not just the shipping lines, searching for the best deal in a kind of port arbitrage, that are putting pressure on New York to become more efficient. In the past half-dozen years, four of the region's six container terminals, which used to be privately held businesses, have been bought by pension funds and investment firms, including financial giants like A.I.G. and Deutsche Bank. Looking for returns in the short term, they have focused much of their attention on labor costs.
The union, Mr. Curto said, perceives a threat in these developments, and ''its natural reaction is to hunker down and protect what it has.''
While longshoremen at other ports have traditionally worked in shifts, those in New York have always been organized into clannish gangs that work around the clock until a job is done. Imagine a ship that takes a full day to unload. At ports in Los Angeles or Seattle, the work is divided into segments, and the gangs are rotated in and out. In New York, however, the gang that starts the job works continuously until it is finished. This requires extra workers in relief in each gang, all of whom receive full pay, even when they are resting.
''The way we work,'' Mr. Curto said, ''we're paying people for 24 hours each, even if they're only really working seven or eight.''
This spring, the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, a state agency meant to combat corruption, published a report saying that up to 40 percent of all workers at the port were there to accommodate breaks and relief. The report also described a core of union supervisors who were paid, in an idiosyncrasy unique to the waterfront, for every hour that workers under their care were on the clock, even if they themselves were at home barbecuing or mowing their grass.
There was, for instance, Paul Buglioli, a union timekeeper responsible for overseeing work hours, who earned $474,947 last year because of this contractual quirk -- and despite his testimony to the commission that he didn't ''physically check to see that someone who is signed in is actually present on the pier.'' There was also Ralph Gigante, a union shop steward, who earned $406,659 in 2011 because he was allowed to bill for hours that other people worked. Even though Mr. Gigante -- a nephew of Vincent Gigante, the former boss of the Genovese crime family -- was a union representative, he admitted under oath that he didn't know that the letters C.B.A. stood for collective bargaining agreement.
Mr. Curto recalled that when he began working at the port in 1970, as a junior terminal manager, straddle carriers hauling containers to the storage yard would pass beneath a tower and a man would shout down directions, telling the driver where to place the box. Now, it is done electronically. Technology has changed, he said, and so must ''certain work practices that make the port noncompetitive.''
''But change is tough,'' he added. ''People resist change.''
THE list of longshore jobs that technology has rendered obsolete is long and poignant. Mr. Curto's tower workers are gone. The cube workers, who calculated the cubic volume of loose cargo, are gone. The coopers, who sewed torn sacks and repaired broken pallets, are gone. The water boys, working in the steamy reaches of the hold, are gone, as well.
In the 1960s, when New York was the world's busiest port, there were more than 35,000 longshoremen on the city's docks. Today, there are 3,500.
This thinning of the ranks has stiffened the necks of the New York chapters of the longshoremen's union, which have been among the most successful in the country at preserving benefits for their members. The coveted remaining jobs, usually secured through referrals from other union members, pay well. According to the United States Maritime Alliance, rank-and-file longshoremen earn an average of $124,000 a year in wages and benefits, with specialists like crane operators receiving a premium. The Alliance, the union's national negotiating partner, also said that one in three longshoremen in the New York area takes home more than $208,000 annually.
In 1964, in the wake of containerization, Thomas Gleason, the union's president and scion of a New York longshore family, managed to establish a now-defunct guaranteed annual income for his members, which allowed longshoremen to collect as much as $32,000 a year for doing no work at all after they lost their jobs. Mr. Gleason's predecessor, Capt. William V. Bradley, fought successfully in 1960 for what are known as container royalties -- year-end payments to longshoremen based on the weight of cargo moving through their ports. Last year, the royalties for East Coast ports were, on average, $15,500 for every worker.
These days, the staunchness of the New York union sometimes reads like defensiveness. Last month, after The New York Post published an article condemning greedy ''wrong-shoremen'' for scuttling the contract talks, one member of Local 1814 in Brooklyn wrote a bitter, personal response to the reporter describing ''the difference between us.''
''I didn't have connections to get the right job like you did,'' the union member wrote. ''I took a dangerous job so I could be responsible and pay my bills, the American way. I am not sitting at a desk every day, or any day for that matter. I am not wearing a cardigan because the air-conditioner may be set on low today in the office.''
But some longshoremen do sit at desks each day. And if they are not wearing cardigans, they may, like Twiggy Richardson, a 47-year veteran, have brought in a space heater to guard against the air-conditioned cold.
Mr. Richardson was working the 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. shift in the control room a couple of weeks ago when the CSAV Pyrenees returned to the terminal in Newark to take on a load of 1,500 boxes bound for Germany. Working as a checker, his job that night was to electronically track the movement of containers from storage yard to straddle carrier to ship.
He prepared his work space with the punctiliousness of a surgeon: wiped his keyboard and his radio with a Handi Wipe, laid a folded towel across his chair and taped to the wall beside him a handmade sign reading, ''7'' -- he would be working until dawn with crane No. 7. Booting up his computer, he logged into the terminal's Navis information system. Doughnuts and a fresh pot of coffee waited on a refreshment table. Out the window, the great halved-orange of the sun was setting behind the tower at Newark Liberty International Airport.
It was a far cry from the early days, when Mr. Richardson, 68, was a marine carpenter working, as he put it, ''among the rats and the roaches.'' He joined the checkers just in time. The entire carpenter's local ''went the way of the buffalo,'' he said.
As the crane trolleys glided back and forth, and the ship, in its berth, was illuminated like a stage set by the wharf lights, Mr. Richardson became contemplative. ''Eventually there'll only be one guy up here, with cables in his ears and nose, and wires in his behind, running the whole thing,'' he said. ''Sounds crazy, I know, but that's where it's headed.''

HEADLINE: Lightening the Load for Manufacturers

BYLINE: By NICOLE LaPORTE

 BODY:
SHIPPING pallets, those slatted platforms that fill warehouses, are intended to move heavy loads, not people.
But innovations in their design and manufacture may play an important role in creating a fleet of more environmentally sustainable cars and trucks.
Taylor Hopkins, 24, was part of a five-student research team at Ohio State University that recently created three novel designs for shipping pallets. Ordinary pallets are made of wood; the students' prototypes are made of aluminum, which lasts longer.
The aluminum pallets are also much lighter than wood pallets, which saves fuel during shipping. 
''We were presented with the problem of, try and come up with a new pallet that we thought could make an impact environmentally,'' Mr. Hopkins said. ''We ended up going with aluminum just because it's very widely used and it's lightweight.''
Aluminum is also significantly more expensive than wood, which means that the students' designs are unlikely to become the industry norm soon. But the technology behind them could be useful to carmakers, which have started to embrace aluminum as a means of building lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles.
''This project is such an interesting microcosm of the challenges that the transportation industry in total is facing, in moving from heavy steel to lightweight aluminum,'' said Randall Scheps, automotive marketing director of Alcoa, and chairman of the aluminum transportation group at the Aluminum Association. Mr. Scheps said the student team looked at various methods of joining, or bonding, metals. It also looked at forming, or bending, metals, and at recycling. ''These are all issues that the auto industry is facing,'' he said.
Companies and foundations have been looking to young innovators for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective solutions to real-world problems. In the case of the shipping pallets, the project was funded with a grant from the Alcoa Foundation, which wants future engineers to think about use of lightweight materials. (Although the use of aluminum clearly benefits Alcoa, an aluminum company, it did not have to be used in the project.)
It's an issue that has taken on urgency in Detroit in anticipation of Obama administration fuel-economy regulations that will require American vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Ford, for instance, that producer of macho, all-terrain trucks, is working on an aluminum version of its popular F-150 pickup.
Dr. Glenn Daehn, a professor of materials science and engineering at Ohio State and the students' research adviser, says the aluminum shipping pallets are an example of ''using simple projects to inject ideas into how we might make lighter-weight door systems or seats'' -- research that Ohio State is working on with companies like Honda and General Motors.
Mr. Hopkins said welding is an issue in dealing with aluminum. ''There's just a certain property of aluminum that if you heat it up too much, or for too long, it loses a lot of its strength,'' he said.
To get around that, the students relied on ''conformal interference joining technology,'' a method of joining metals through a process involving electromagnetism, as opposed to heat.
Then there was the question of how to make the pallets cost-effective. Aluminum pallets on the market can cost more than $200 each, in part because they are welded by hand. Aluminum pallets are used to ship materials that must be kept sterile, or that will be stored for long periods.
But the students' models are all estimated to cost less than $75 each. That was achieved by making the designs simple enough so they could be mass-produced.
''They weren't some crazy designs that would take 20 hours to produce, where you'd have to do it one at a time,'' Mr. Hopkins said. ''Our designs can be automated. They only have two, separate pieces in a couple of them.'' That makes it possible to ''knock them out in a short amount of time,'' he said.
WHILE the project could eventually affect how cars are manufactured, it may not change the world's shipping pallets. According to Edgar Deomano, technical director of the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association, wood pallets, which account for 90 percent of the domestic market, are not going away, mainly because of cost.
''A recycled, or repaired, wood pallet could go for as low as $3 each,'' Mr. Deomano said.
As for the argument that wooden shipping pallets are responsible for deforestation, he said: ''That's a false impression. Our industry is able to recycle pallets again and again. You don't have to cut down more trees, you just have to repair existing pallets.''
Dr. Daehn says he remains hopeful, however, that a company will ''step forward and commercialize'' the new aluminum shipping pallets.
''We need more than a student project to do that, but I think we've shown them the promise is there.''
In the meantime, the project has already served Mr. Hopkins well. After graduating from Ohio State in June, he was hired as a metallurgist at Valbruna Slater Stainless in Fort Wayne, Ind.
''It was definitely one of my résumé highlights,'' he said.

My wife and I were eating dinner with our 2-year-old son when the Kalamazoo Promise scholarship was announced on the local news. We just looked across the table at each other dumbfounded. I know f rsthand what it was like to work as many as three dismal jobs while taking a full-time classload. Our son is a fourth grader now. Having the Promise for him is priceless. He knows exactly what it means, because we talk about college all the time, as if it is mandatory rather than an option. Bless those who made this possible. It is making a dif erence. This is a great city full of great people. 
DAVE BURNHAM, Kalamazoo, Mich., posted on nytimes.com
This is not a new experiment. The small lumber town Philomath, Ore., has had a similar foundation for many years, funded by a lumber-company owner, that provides four-year scholarships to every graduate of Philomath High School. The program did seem to help the local economy, but it was no bulwark against the general decline of the timber industry. Younger families began to move in, bringing more liberal ideas and a general distaste for the timber industry. The clash between old and new residents resulted in the foundation's restricting scholarships to graduates whose families have lived there for two or more generations, who are connected to timber, mining or agriculture and who are studying one of those areas. Free college might look like a way to broaden opportunities for children in an economically depressed area, but, it can also be used to entrench the values of those handing out the money.

I was a recipient of this scholarship when it was in its infancy. Neither of my parents worked, so there wasn't much of a plan for me to go to college; I've now graduated with an engineering degree and work happily in the auto industry in Michigan. This scholarship will change lives and provide so many amazing opportunities for its recipients for many years to come. I'll be forever thankful for it.

HEADLINE: Justices Facing Weighty Rulings and New Dynamic

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court returns to the bench on Monday to confront not only a docket studded with momentous issues but also a new dynamic among the justices.
The coming term will probably include major decisions on affirmative action in higher education admissions, same-sex marriage and a challenge to the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Those rulings could easily rival the last term's as the most consequential in recent memory.
The theme this term is the nature of equality, and it will play out over issues that have bedeviled the nation for decades. ''Last term will be remembered for one case,'' said Kannon K. Shanmugam, a lawyer with Williams & Connolly. ''This term will be remembered for several.''
The term will also provide signals about the repercussions of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s surprise decision in June to join the court's four more liberal members and supply the decisive fifth vote in the landmark decision to uphold President Obama's health care law. Every decision of the new term will be scrutinized for signs of whether Chief Justice Roberts, who had been a reliable member of the court's conservative wing, has moved toward the ideological center of the court. 
''The salient question is: Is it a little bit, or is it a lot?'' said Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the 26 states on the losing side of the core of the health care decision.
The term could clarify whether the health care ruling will come to be seen as the case that helped Chief Justice Roberts protect the authority of his court against charges of partisanship while accruing a mountain of political capital in the process. He and his fellow conservative justices might then run the table on the causes that engage him more than the limits of federal power ever have: cutting back on racial preferences, on campaign finance restrictions and on procedural protections for people accused of crimes.
It is also possible that the chief justice will become yet another disappointment to conservatives, who are used to them from the Supreme Court, and that he will join Justice Anthony M. Kennedy as a swing vote at the court's center. There is already some early evidence of this trend: in each of the last three terms, only Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy were in the majority more than 90 percent of the time.
''We all start with the conventional wisdom that Justice Kennedy is going to decide the close cases,'' said Mr. Clement, who served as United States solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ''We've all been reminded that that's not always the case.''
The texture of the new term will be different, as the court's attention shifts from federalism and the economy to questions involving race and sexual orientation. The new issues before the court are concrete and consequential: Who gets to go to college? To get married? To vote?
On Oct. 10, the court will hear Fisher v. University of Texas, No. 11-345, a major challenge to affirmative action in higher education. The case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who says she was denied admission to the University of Texas based on her race. The university selects part of its class by taking race into account, as one factor among many, in an effort to ensure educational diversity.
Just nine years ago, the Supreme Court endorsed that approach in a 5-to-4 vote. The majority opinion in the case, Grutter v. Bollinger, was written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said she expected it to last for a quarter of a century.
But Justice O'Connor retired in 2006. She was succeeded by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who was appointed by Mr. Bush and who has consistently voted to limit race-conscious decision making by the government. Chief Justice Roberts, another Bush appointee, has made no secret of his distaste for what he has called ''a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.''
Justices Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas all dissented in the Grutter case, and simple math suggests that there may now be five votes to limit or overturn it.
The reach of such a decision could be limited by the idiosyncrasies of the admissions system in Texas. The university provides automatic admission to students in Texas who graduate in roughly the top 10 percent of their high school classes. That approach generates substantial diversity, partly because many Texas high schools remain racially homogeneous.
Ms. Fisher narrowly missed the cutoff at a high school whose students have above-average test scores for the state. She was rejected for one of the remaining spots under the part of the admissions program that considers applicants' race.
The court may uphold the Texas system under Grutter, or it may rule against it on narrow grounds by saying, for instance, that race-conscious admissions are forbidden where a race-neutral method -- like the 10 percent program -- can be said to be working.
But the court may also follow the health care ruling with a second landmark decision, this one barring racial preferences in admissions decisions altogether. Given persistent achievement gaps, even after controlling for family income, such a ruling would make the student bodies of many colleges less black and Hispanic and more white and Asian.
The court will probably also take on same-sex marriage. ''I think it's most likely that we will have that issue before the court toward the end of the current term,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said at the University of Colorado on Sept. 19.
She was referring to challenges to an aspect of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the federal government from providing benefits to same-sex couples married in states that allow such unions. The federal appeals court in Boston struck down that part of the law, and both sides have urged the court to hear the case. More than 1,000 federal laws deny tax breaks, medical coverage and burial services, among other benefits, to spouses in same-sex marriages.
The justices will also soon decide whether to hear a more ambitious marriage case filed in California by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies. It seeks to establish a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
Chief Justice Roberts has not yet voted in a major gay rights case. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinions in both Lawrence v. Texas, a 2003 decision that struck down a Texas law making gay sex a crime, and Romer v. Evans, a 1996 decision that struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment that banned the passage of laws protecting gay men and lesbians. Most observers see him as the decisive vote in same-sex marriage cases.
The justices are also quite likely to take another look at the constitutionality of a signature legacy of the civil rights era, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 2009, the court signaled that it had reservations about the part of the law that requires the federal review of changes in election procedures in parts of the country with a history of discrimination, mostly the South.
''We are now a very different nation'' than the one that first enacted the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice Roberts wrote for himself and seven other justices. ''Whether conditions continue to justify such legislation is a difficult constitutional question we do not answer today.''
The chief justice seemed to invite Congress to revise the law, but lawmakers have taken no action.
Challenges to the law have arisen in several lawsuits in the current election season, including ones concerning redistricting and voter identification requirements.
''It will be interesting to see if the justices worry half as much about the emerging restrictions on voting as they worried about restrictions on political spending,'' said Pamela S. Karlan, a law professor at Stanford.
On Monday, the new term will start with a case of great interest to business groups, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, No. 10-1491. The case was brought by 12 Nigerian plaintiffs who said the defendants, foreign oil companies, had been complicit in human rights violations committed against them by the Abacha dictatorship in Nigeria. The question in the case is whether American courts have jurisdiction over such suits, and business groups are hoping the answer is no.
In the last term, business groups achieved a series of victories, often by lopsided majorities. In cases with an individual on one side and business interests on the other, the court ruled for the business side 12 out of 14 times, according to calculations by Lauren R. Goldman, a lawyer with the firm Mayer Brown. In the two previous terms, the number of business cases was comparable, but individuals won at least half of the time.
Introducing himself to the nation at his confirmation hearings in 2005, Chief Justice Roberts said that ''judges are like umpires'' in that they do not make the rules but merely apply them.
''Nobody ever went to a ballgame to see the umpire,'' he said.
But the calls Chief Justice Roberts made in the health care case were surprising enough that it will be hard to look away. He voted with the court's conservatives to say that the law was not authorized by Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce and then joined the court's liberals to say it was authorized by Congress's power to levy taxes. No other justice joined every part of his controlling opinion.
Charles Fried, who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration and filed a brief in support of the law, said the reasoning in the health care decision was mystifying enough to foreclose predictions about the future of the Roberts court.
''This is a court that under Chief Justice Roberts called a ball a strike, a strike a ball, but got the batter to base where he belonged,'' said Professor Fried, who teaches at Harvard Law School. ''So who knows what to expect.''

HEADLINE: As Money Pours Down, It's No Wonder That Stocks Are Up

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE markets are getting plenty of help from the world's big central banks. Will it be enough to keep the current rally going?
The overall economy is sluggish at best, and unemployment has remained above 8 percent since early 2009. Yet despite a decline last week, stock investors have been on a roll. In the three months ended on Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.8 percent. In Europe, stocks fared even better for the quarter, with the Euro Stoxx 50 index up 8.4 percent. Japan was a laggard, as the Nikkei index dropped 1.5 percent, but in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index rose 7.2 percent.
During much of this period, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been flooding the planet with money. Cause and effect is hard to prove, but it seems reasonable to assume that the central banks have had something to do with the markets' buoyancy. ''Clearly central bank actions have been a major factor in the market rally,'' Ethan Harris, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a recent report. News reports of ''super dovish'' announcements by the Fed and the European Central Bank correlated neatly with stock market climbs, he found. 
On Sept. 6, for example, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said that under certain conditions it would buy unlimited amounts of government bonds, a move that could lower borrowing costs for Spain and other troubled countries in the euro zone. Stocks immediately rose around the world.
The next week, the Fed met the market's expectations, and then some. It extended its plans for maintaining near-zero short-term interest rates into the middle of 2015. And it announced that it would increase its bond-buying to a total of $85 billion a month for the rest of the year, with a focus on mortgage-backed securities, a program aimed at giving the housing market another lift. What's more, the Fed linked the duration of its loose policies to the state of the job market. As long as the unemployment rate remained unacceptably high, the Fed planned to maintain its expansionary monetary policy, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said in a news conference.
''We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
Last week, however, the markets gave up ground. The central banks aside, it's easy to see why the bullish mood might darken quickly. A partial list of dangers includes rising tensions in the Mideast, a contentious election campaign and a looming ''fiscal cliff'' in the United States, an unresolved and multifaceted financial crisis in Europe, and a global economy that is far from robust.
Little of this would appear to augur well for stocks, except that the central banks have tilted the odds on the bullish side, at least for now, some analysts say.
''A modestly growing economy with the cyclically sensitive sectors at still-depressed levels is a relatively stable and safe, if not exciting, environment,'' said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays, in a recent report. ''When this is combined with a central bank committed to aggressively supporting growth through higher asset prices, it amounts to a very attractive environment for taking risk.''
In fact, Barclays calls the current version of its flagship quarterly research publication ''Global Outlook: Don't Fight the Fed.''
OF course, no one knows where the markets are going day to day. After their recent run upward, and even without the emergence of any nasty news, stocks could easily ''consolidate,'' that is, decline for a while before moving upward again. And because the global economy is already rather weak, an external shock -- a disruptive geopolitical event -- could alter perceptions abruptly.
Some analysts are not upbeat even now. The Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent forecasting organization with an excellent record, says it believes that the United States is already in recession, and that action by the Fed won't change that. ''Unfortunately, the economy is just going to have to ride out the business cycle,'' Lakshman Achuthan, chief operations officer of the institute, said recently. ''The Fed's actions have been increasingly ineffective.'' The relationship between the economy and the stock market is complex, he said, and it's not always clear whether the market is predicting the direction of the economy, reacting to it or responding to other factors.
Robert Rodriguez, managing partner and chief executive of FPA, an asset management firm in Los Angeles, says it's possible that fund managers, seeking to bolster their returns, will ''continue to pile into stocks in the remainder of this year and push them to even higher levels.'' But he says he believes that the market is already overextended, and his firm has begun to reduce its stock exposure.
Mr. Rodriguez anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial crisis. But, as he acknowledged ruefully in an interview, he ''was early, and got out of the market too soon, and could well be doing so again.'' Still, he says he fears what he calls ''the unintended consequences of the expansionary activities of the central banks.''
Another credit bubble is likely if the banks persist in trying to prop up the global economy, he said. As he sees it, the fundamental problem in the United States can't be solved by the Fed. ''We must get our fiscal house in order,'' he said, ''and we have only a limited amount of time to do it.''
For the next several months, though, he suspects that Wall Street's fascination with the Fed may well keep stocks rising.

HEADLINE: A Spanish SoHo Springs Up in Seville

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TULIPAN

 BODY:
WITH many shops in Seville struggling in the wake of the economic crisis, one group of merchants and artists banded together last November to reinvent their neighborhood. Taking inspiration from the revitalization of nearby Plaza de la Encarnación and the opening of the giant mushroom-like Metropol Parasol, they adopted a moniker associated with fashionable districts in London and New York, founding Soho Benita. Almost overnight, this forgotten barrio off the tourist path was spruced up with flower arrangements and evolved into a shopping destination that balances art and culture with handmade artisanal goods by local designers.

HEADLINE: Half-Shell Heroes Return to Action

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
JIM FARRELLY is a pop culture expert at the University of Dayton, where he teaches courses titled ''Fantasy and Magic'' and ''Apocalyptic Films.'' So, as a person who thinks seriously about silly topics, he would seem like an ideal candidate to field this question: What was it about ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' back in the 1980s that made boys go gaga?
His answer: ''There's no accounting for taste.'' All right then!
Nickelodeon, however, not only thinks the answer is much more complex, it believes the question should be asked in the present tense. What young viewers first found charming in the '80s worked again in the 1990s, and, most important, Nickelodeon thinks the magic remains: ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' a slick new computer-animated series, arrives on the children's cable network this weekend with a one-hour special. Nickelodeon has been trying to lay down expectations, but Viacom, which owns the channel, last week trumpeted the series to Wall Street analysts, calling the remake ''tremendous'' and noting that related merchandise is selling out in stores. A second season is already in the works. 
Nickelodeon sees the Turtles -- Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo -- as potential heart paddles for its schedule. Over the last year, the channel's audience has dropped by more than 20 percent, creating a code blue for its executives and corporate overlords. Moreover, Nickelodeon has not minted a blockbuster new toy franchise in years. So while it continues to experiment with fresh concepts, the channel is making a big bet on familiar, time-tested material (that fits the core Nickelodeon brand). Draw eyeballs to the schedule, the thinking goes, and viewers will sample other shows. The Turtles also come with immediate toy sales; it typically takes years for a new cartoon hit to grow into a consumer products juggernaut.
But for people who never understood the appeal of these characters, and I am definitely in that camp, despite being a child of the '80s, it seems like a long shot.
Ninja turtles? With Renaissance names? Who live in sewers?
The first thing cartoon historians would point out is that a talking rectangle doesn't sound like much of a cartoon colossus either, but ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' hasn't done too badly for himself. Moreover, people have long puzzled over the Turtles. '''What kind of drugs are you on?' was a question we heard a lot,'' said Kevin Eastman, one of the creators of the 1984 comic book that sparked the entire Turtles phenomenon. ''Dude, we couldn't afford drugs in those days. We just thought they looked cool.''
The franchise, just to jog your memory, centers on four humanoid turtles and their sensei, a rat named Master Splinter. Splinter was once human and the turtles were just pet turtles until they were transformed by a weird green ooze. Splinter retreated to the sewers, raising the four turtles and training them as ninjas.
The concept was a mash-up and parody of various comics, but it also turned the superhero formula on its head: Instead of starting out as humans and taking on animal powers -- Spider-Man, Wolverine -- the reverse happened. Comic geeks found that interesting, but there were other reasons the comic took off, said Brad Ricca, the author of a forthcoming book called ''Super Boys'' and a member of the English faculty at Case Western Reserve University.
Independently published and distributed, the first Turtles comics had a do-it-yourself look that made them stand out on shelves, and, because the Turtles were mutants, X-Men fans gave the comic an immediate look, helping the books to catch fire, he said. The ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' title was also an asset; what struck outsiders as ridiculous and unwieldy was proof to comic fans that they were in the know about something.
The first TV series hit the air in 1987, when cartoons mostly consisted of derivative concepts (''Star Wars: Ewoks,'' ''The California Raisin Show'') or serious fantasy shows (''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe''). Super-sugary cartoons like ''Care Bears'' also reigned. Although children's TV executives watered down the Turtles comic books, which were quite violent, the smart-mouthed prankster characters still came across as a slap in the face from some underground counterculture.
Boys in particular -- to the chagrin of many a mother -- responded to this reptilian rowdiness. The Turtles wielded weird weapons like nunchuks, had a street style (they're all dressed like break dancers in early episodes), and used a colorful argot: ''Cowabunga!'' It didn't hurt that the cartoon had a stick-in-your-ears theme song. (Fun fact: Chuck Lorre, the force behind ''Two and a Half Men,'' co-composed the ''heroes in a half shell'' tune.)
Children typically find anthropomorphic animals captivating -- Disney's entire empire rests on that foundation -- but the Turtles also connected on a psychological level for little viewers, according to Rebekah Richert, an associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside who studies children's entertainment. Cartoons become smash hits when children form parasocial, or one-sided, relationships with specific characters, she said. The Turtles -- outsiders who were misunderstood, competitive with one another yet loyal, smart but not preachy -- were at once relatable and aspirational.
''Children learn a lot emotionally by interacting with or role-playing characteristics of people slightly older than them to, in essence, 'try on' different personalities,'' Ms. Richert said in an e-mail.
The teenage Turtles offered the chance to do just that. There are four heroes, all equally strong and broadly drawn: the smart one (Donatello), the wild one (Michelangelo), the brawler (Raphael) and the leader (Leonardo). Experts note that none had a specific racial background, which tends to narrow appeal.
''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' ran for 10 seasons. Four subsequent movies took in more than $650 million at the global box office, after adjusting for inflation. A live-action series, ''The Next Mutation,'' came in 1997, followed by a second animated series in 2003. All the while, fans around the world spent billions on related merchandise: action figures, stuffed animals, play sets, bandannas, swords, strap-on-your-back turtle shells.
''The source material is extremely toyetic, to use the industry term,'' said Karl Aaronian, senior vice president of marketing for Playmates Toys. ''They're visually appealing -- tough yet huggable -- and there are enough characters to drive collecting over time.''
Now comes Nickelodeon's back-to-basics remake. The theme song is still there (albeit slightly more urban sounding). A plan to have Splinter die was scrapped. April, the Turtles' human friend, will not suddenly be African-American, as envisioned at one point. Early on, Nickelodeon nixed a drastic proposal to send the Turtles to a Hogwarts-type school.
The same DNA may still be there, but the franchise has been reworked -- ''updated'' -- in ways large and small. For starters, the Turtles spend a lot more time above ground. Cowabunga? No longer cool. The new catch phrase is ''booyakasha,'' described by the show's creator, Ciro Nieli, as Jamaican patois meaning ''to give praise.'' (The term, popularized on ''Da Ali G Show,'' has a darker alternative meaning as the verbal approximation of a gunshot, according to UrbanDictionary.com.) April is no longer a busty 20-something in distress; now, she's a feisty teenager, an attempt to deepen the show's appeal to girls.
Quirky humor remains a hallmark of the franchise, but some of the silliness is gone. For instance, the Turtles eat pizza, but at least in early episodes it is plain old pepperoni -- not pepperoni and ice cream or anchovy and peanut butter as in the old days. Mr. Nieli's lavishly animated, cinematic series is aggressive, action-packed and dark. The Turtles can look menacing and the villains are creepier; one episode features a mutant cockroach with explosive egg sacs. (City dwellers everywhere shudder.)
''It reflects the time we're living in -- paranoid, polluted, overcrowded and overstimulated,'' Mr. Nieli said, adding that the story lines are constructed to be relevant to modern children. One episode, for instance, hinges on a bad guy who uses his phone to make a Web video of the Turtles. The production design reflects the influence of graffiti artists like Banksy and Shepard Fairey. Actors like Sean Astin and Jason Biggs voice characters.
Nickelodeon, which spent about $800,000 to $1 million on each episode, slightly higher than normal for cartoons, says that most viewers will be seeing the Turtles on screen for the first time. But there is always concern about how longtime fans will react, and there has been some blogger consternation. Mr. Nieli said the fretful should take comfort in his presence. ''There is nobody alive who loves the Turtles more than I do,'' he said.
Judging from his quarters at Nickelodeon's Burbank animation studio, that may be true. Mr. Nieli, whose résumé includes ''Family Guy'' and ''Teen Titans,'' has decorated his space with hundreds of Turtles action figures, Turtles artwork bought on eBay and his own sketches. All of the Turtles comics he collected as a boy in Philadelphia are kept in a musty-smelling cardboard box.
Back in the '80s, Mr. Eastman was very accessible to fans, even handing out his home number. A young Mr. Nieli was one of the most frequent callers. What would Mr. Eastman, who has no involvement with the new series, say to Mr. Nieli if he called today?
''Buckle up,'' he said, ''and hold on for dear life.''

HEADLINE: For the Wealthy, a 28 Percent Solution

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows that America's tax code is a mess, yet despite considerable talk when elections come around, we've done nothing substantial to fix it. What is odd is that there is broad agreement on what should be done. We should strive to get the ''lowest possible tax rates on the broadest base,'' as five well-known conservative economists put it recently.
In a nutshell, the fewer deductions and other ''tax expenditures'' we have, the lower the rates can be. That part is simple. 
The problem is that cutting rates is more popular than closing loopholes, especially those like the mortgage-interest deduction that are used by millions of taxpayers. But there is a possible solution.
I call it the modified Reagan 28 plan, or just the ''28 plan'' for short. It is a simple framework for thinking about tax policy. Though I've named it in honor of Ronald Reagan, it is similar in many ways to the ideas proposed by the Bowles-Simpson commission, which is a good starting point for any serious discussion of tax reform.
My first premise is that we should devise tax policy from the top down. As everyone now knows, nearly half of American households do not pay any income tax, though they do pay Social Security taxes, sales taxes and so forth. And many households that earn enough to start paying some income tax are essentially on a flat-tax system, because few itemize their deductions. That means they mostly just pay a percentage of their income above the threshold where taxes kick in. So let's think about how to tax the rich, then work our way down the income ladder.
For this discussion, let's define a household as rich if its income exceeds $1 million a year. In fact, my plan applies only to the income such households earn above that threshold. And I can state my idea in just one sentence: All income above $1 million a year for a household will be taxed at 28 percent. There are no deductions, and all income, including capital gains and dividends, is included. President Reagan favored something like this approach. His 1986 tax plan also taxed dividends and capital gains at the same 28 percent rate, as would the Bowles-Simpson proposal.
While we're at it, let's make the corporate tax rate 28 percent, too, because our current rate is high by international standards. Oh, and the estate tax exemption? On amounts above $3.5 million for individuals, the rate would be, of course, 28 percent.
What would this plan accomplish? First, by establishing the same marginal rate on all income sources, the incentives disappear for shifting from one source of income to another. Although there is much discussion about how taxes affect people's willingness to work, most people don't have much flexibility about how many hours they're employed. For the rich, however, it can be relatively easy to switch income from a highly taxed category to one that is taxed at a lower rate. One reason that Mitt Romney's taxes have been so low -- he paid an effective federal income tax rate of only 14 percent in the two years for which he has disclosed his returns -- is that venture capitalists have figured out a legal way for the incentive fees they receive to be treated as capital gains income, currently taxed at a rate of only 15 percent. If we tax all income at the same rate, these games will end.
But what about the argument that taxing capital gains and dividends at the same rate as ordinary income will discourage investment? I don't find this claim convincing. People are willing to buy bonds issued by corporations even though the interest is taxed as ordinary income, and I don't see why investors need a special tax break to induce them to put money in the stock market, which has historically paid high returns. One bonus from adopting this plan would be a short-term windfall to the Treasury from investors realizing their capital gains now, in order to pay the current, lower rate. (Also, I do think that capital gains taxes should be adjusted for inflation.)
Wouldn't nonprofit organizations suffer if we eliminated the charitable deduction for the wealthy? There might be some effect, but notice that by reducing the marginal rate to 28 percent, the tax incentive to donate would already be quite a bit lower than at current rates of 35 percent or more. And if this political season has taught us anything, it's that rich people don't need a tax deduction to contribute to causes they believe in. (Political contributions are not deductible.)
We could pay for the reduction in the corporation income tax by broadening that base as well. There are many special deals -- like subsidies to oil companies -- that could be eliminated.
OF course, I haven't said what would happen to the households in the middle, or what the taxes would be on the first $1 million for the rich, but the Bowles-Simpson commission offers a comprehensive plan that is in the spirit of my suggestion. One possibility is to scale back deductions smoothly, starting at household incomes above $250,000, and completely eliminate them for incomes above $1 million. That would leave the popular deductions fully in place for those earning less than $250,000. A more radical plan, curtailing deductions for this large group, is probably politically infeasible, at least for now.
And what if the resulting revenue falls a bit short of what we need to start trimming the deficit? I suggest that we get our gasoline tax more in line with those of the rest of the world. Gradually raising it to something like $1 a gallon would both bring in revenue and help reduce emissions. In the long term, we could set the rate as a percentage of the price at the pump. Maybe 28 percent?

HEADLINE: The Myth of Male Decline

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE COONTZ. 
A teacher of family history at Evergreen State College and author of ''A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s.''

 BODY:
SCROLL through the titles and subtitles of recent books, and you will read that women have become ''The Richer Sex,'' that ''The Rise of Women Has Turned Men Into Boys,'' and that we may even be seeing ''The End of Men.'' Several of the authors of these books posit that we are on the verge of a ''new majority of female breadwinners,'' where middle-class wives lord over their husbands while demoralized single men take refuge in perpetual adolescence.
How is it, then, that men still control the most important industries, especially technology, occupy most of the positions on the lists of the richest Americans, and continue to make more money than women who have similar skills and education? And why do women make up only 17 percent of Congress?
These books and the cultural anxiety they represent reflect, but exaggerate, a transformation in the distribution of power over the past half-century. Fifty years ago, every male American was entitled to what the sociologist R. W. Connell called a ''patriarchal dividend'' -- a lifelong affirmative-action program for men. 
The size of that dividend varied according to race and class, but all men could count on women's being excluded from the most desirable jobs and promotions in their line of work, so the average male high school graduate earned more than the average female college graduate working the same hours. At home, the patriarchal dividend gave husbands the right to decide where the family would live and to make unilateral financial decisions. Male privilege even trumped female consent to sex, so marital rape was not a crime.
The curtailment of such male entitlements and the expansion of women's legal and economic rights have transformed American life, but they have hardly produced a matriarchy. Indeed, in many arenas the progress of women has actually stalled over the past 15 years.
Let's begin by determining which is ''the richer sex.''
Women's real wages have been rising for decades, while the real wages of most men have stagnated or fallen. But women's wages started from a much lower base, artificially held down by discrimination. Despite their relative improvement, women's average earnings are still lower than men's and women remain more likely to be poor.
Today women make up almost 40 percent of full-time workers in management. But the median wages of female managers are just 73 percent of what male managers earn. And although women have significantly increased their representation among high earners in America over the past half-century, only 4 percent of the C.E.O.'s in Fortune's top 1,000 companies are female.
What we are seeing is a convergence in economic fortunes, not female ascendance. Between 2010 and 2011, men and women working full time year-round both experienced a 2.5 percent decline in income. Men suffered roughly 80 percent of the job losses at the beginning of the 2007 recession. But the ripple effect of the recession then led to cutbacks in government jobs that hit women disproportionately. As of June 2012, men had regained 46.2 percent of the jobs they lost in the recession, while women had regained 38.7 percent of their lost jobs.
The 1970s and 1980s brought an impressive reduction in job segregation by gender, especially in middle-class occupations. But the sociologists David Cotter, Joan Hermsen and Reeve Vanneman report that progress slowed in the 1990s and has all but stopped since 2000. For example, the percentage of female electrical engineers doubled in each decade in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. But in the two decades since 1990 it has increased by only a single percentage point, leaving women at just 10 percent of the total.
Some fields have become even more gender-segregated. In 1980, 75 percent of primary school teachers and 64 percent of social workers were women. Today women make up 80 and 81 percent of those fields. Studies show that as occupations gain a higher percentage of female workers, the pay for those jobs goes down relative to wages in similarly skilled jobs that remain bastions of male employment.
Proponents of the ''women as the richer sex'' scenario often note that in several metropolitan areas, never-married childless women in their 20s now earn more, on average, than their male age-mates.
But this is because of the demographic anomaly that such areas have exceptionally large percentages of highly educated single white women and young, poorly educated, low-wage Latino men. Earning more than a man with less education is not the same as earning as much as an equally educated man.
Among never-married, childless 22- to 30-year-old metropolitan-area workers with the same educational credentials, males out-earn females in every category, according to a reanalysis of census data to be presented next month at Boston University by Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. Similarly, a 2010 Catalyst survey found that female M.B.A.'s were paid an average of $4,600 less than men in starting salaries and continue to be outpaced by men in rank and salary growth throughout their careers, even if they remain childless.
Among married couples when both partners are employed, wives earned an average of 38.5 percent of family income in 2010. In that year nearly 30 percent of working wives out-earned their working husbands, a huge increase from just 4 percent in 1970. But when we include all married-couple families, not just dual-earner ones, the economic clout of wives looks a lot weaker.
In only 20 percent of all married-couple families does the wife earn half or more of all family income, according to Professor Cohen, and in 35 percent of marriages, the wife earns less than 10 percent.
Once they have children, wives usually fall further behind their husbands in earnings, partly because they are more likely to temporarily quit work or cut back when workplace policies make it hard for both parents to work full time and still meet family obligations.
But this also reflects prejudice against working mothers. A few years ago, researchers at Cornell constructed fake résumés, identical in all respects except parental status. They asked college students to evaluate the fitness of candidates for employment or promotion. Mothers were much less likely to be hired. If hired, they were offered, on average, $11,000 less in starting salary and were much less likely to be deemed deserving of promotion.
The researchers also submitted similar résumés in response to more than 600 actual job advertisements. Applicants identified as childless received twice as many callbacks as the supposed mothers.
Much has been made of the gender gap in educational achievement. Girls have long done better in school than boys, and women have now pulled ahead of men in completing college. Today women earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, up from one-third in 1960.
The largest educational gender gap is among families in the top 25 percent of the earnings distribution, where women lead men by 13 percent in graduation rates, compared to just a 2 percent advantage for women from the lowest income families.
But at all income levels, women are still concentrated in traditionally female areas of study. Gender integration of college majors has stalled since the mid-1990s, and in some fields, women have even lost ground. Between 1970 and 1985, women's share of computer and information sciences degrees rose from 14 percent to 37 percent. But by 2008 women had fallen back to 18 percent.
According to the N.Y.U. sociologist Paula England, a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, most women, despite earning higher grades, seem to be educating themselves for occupations that systematically pay less.
Even women's greater educational achievement stems partly from continuing gender inequities. Women get a smaller payoff than men for earning a high school degree, but a bigger payoff for completing college. This is not because of their higher grade point averages, the economist Christopher Dougherty concludes, but because women seem to need more education simply to counteract the impact of traditional job discrimination and traditional female career choices.
If the ascent of women has been much exaggerated, so has the descent of men. Men's irresponsibility and bad behavior is now a stock theme in popular culture. But there has always been a subset of men who engage in crude, coercive and exploitative behavior. What's different today is that it's harder for men to get away with such behavior in long-term relationships. Women no longer feel compelled to put up with it and the legal system no longer condones it. The result is that many guys who would have been obnoxious husbands, behaving badly behind closed doors, are now obnoxious singles, trumpeting their bad behavior on YouTube.
Their boorishness may be pathetic, but it's much less destructive than the masculine misbehavior of yore. Most men are in fact behaving better than ever. Domestic violence rates have been halved since 1993, while rapes and sexual assaults against women have fallen by 70 percent in that time. In recent decades, husbands have doubled their share of housework and tripled their share of child care. And this change is not confined to highly educated men.
Among dual-earner couples, husbands with the least education do as much or more housework than their more educated counterparts. Men who have made these adjustments report happier marriages -- and better sex lives.
ONE thing standing in the way of further progress for many men is the same obstacle that held women back for so long: overinvestment in their gender identity instead of their individual personhood. Men are now experiencing a set of limits -- externally enforced as well as self-imposed -- strikingly similar to the ones Betty Friedan set out to combat in 1963, when she identified a ''feminine mystique'' that constrained women's self-image and options.
Although men don't face the same discriminatory laws as women did 50 years ago, they do face an equally restrictive gender mystique.
Just as the feminine mystique discouraged women in the 1950s and 1960s from improving their education or job prospects, on the assumption that a man would always provide for them, the masculine mystique encourages men to neglect their own self-improvement on the assumption that sooner or later their ''manliness'' will be rewarded.
According to a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of Americans now believe that a college education is necessary for a woman to get ahead in life today, but only 68 percent think that is true for men. And just as the feminine mystique exposed girls to ridicule and harassment if they excelled at ''unladylike'' activities like math or sports, the masculine mystique leads to bullying and ostracism of boys who engage in ''girlie'' activities like studying hard and behaving well in school. One result is that men account for only 2 percent of kindergarten and preschool teachers, 3 percent of dental assistants and 9 percent of registered nurses.
The masculine mystique is institutionalized in work structures, according to three new studies forthcoming in the Journal of Social Issues. Just as women who display ''masculine'' ambitions or behaviors on the job are often penalized, so are men who engage in traditionally female behaviors, like prioritizing family involvement. Men who take an active role in child care and housework at home are more likely than other men to be harassed at work.
Men who request family leave are often viewed as weak or uncompetitive and face a greater risk of being demoted or downsized. And men who have ever quit work for family reasons end up earning significantly less than other male employees, even when controlling for the effects of age, race, education, occupation, seniority and work hours. Now men need to liberate themselves from the pressure to prove their masculinity. Contrary to the fears of some pundits, the ascent of women does not portend the end of men. It offers a new beginning for both. But women's progress by itself is not a panacea for America's inequities. The closer we get to achieving equality of opportunity between the sexes, the more clearly we can see that the next major obstacle to improving the well-being of most men and women is the growing socioeconomic inequality within each sex.

HEADLINE: Potus v. Scotus

BYLINE: By GARRETT EPPS. 
Garrett Epps is a professor of law at the University of Baltimore and a legal correspondent for TheAtlantic.com. His new book, ''Wrong and Dangerous: Ten Right Wing Myths About Our Constitution,'' has just been published.

 BODY:
The Obama White House and the Supreme CourtBy Jeffrey Toobin
325 pp. Doubleday. $28.95
The Oct. 22, 2007, cover of Time magazine displayed a portrait of Chief Justice John Roberts above the line does the supreme court still matter? ''As the dust rises and the opinions, concurrences and dissents pile up, the court turns its attention to ever smaller cases related to ever narrower points of law,'' David Von Drehle lamented in the accompanying article. ''The court's ideology is playing a dwindling role in the lives of Americans.''
Less than five years later, not even the boldest contrarian would write those words. With Congress and the executive branch all but paralyzed, the Supreme Court today sits firmly in the center of American public life; its decisions crucially affect matters of race, sex, economics, political power and even national security. And in official Washington this fall, the most intriguing personality is neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney but John Glover Roberts Jr.
Roberts cemented his central position last June when, in a stunning separate opinion, he broke with his four conservative allies to affirm -- even though on narrow grounds -- the constitutionality of President Obama's health care program. The decision left conservatives fuming, liberals grateful, and everyone confused. 
In ''The Oath,'' Jeffrey Toobin recounts the last four years of the court as a duel between the chief justice and the president. As Toobin notes, they make near-perfect antagonists: ''Both were products of Chicago and its environs, and both were graduates of Harvard Law School. Both even served on the Harvard Law Review, the student-run scholarly magazine.'' Needless to say, their political philosophies differ. Toobin calls Roberts an ''apostle of change,'' seeking to move the law dramatically to the right, and Obama a ''conservative'' who wants the courts to leave politics alone.
From the moment Obama took office, the two men stumbled into conflict. Roberts delivered a garbled version of the presidential oath at Obama's inauguration, leading to a hurried do-over in the White House Map Room the next day. Precisely a year later, with Roberts in the majority, the court, in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, declared all-out war on a key Democratic goal, campaign finance regulation. A few days later, Obama looked down at six of the nine justices, seated in the House chamber for the State of the Union address, and gave them an extraordinary public scolding. The decision, he said, had opened ''the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections.'' Then Obama's signature initiative, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, came under legal assault. When the justices walked into the courtroom on the last day of the 2011-12 term, it seemed that fate had delivered Obama into Roberts's hands.
But the conflict narrative faltered. Instead of destroying ''Obamacare,'' the chief justice single-handedly saved his rival. The much-reviled ''individual mandate'' was not valid as a regulation of commerce among the states, he concluded, but it was valid as an exercise of Congress's power ''to lay and collect taxes.'' In addition, Congress can offer states new funding to expand the Medicaid program, but can't cut off all Medicaid funding to states that choose not to accept it. Roberts's opinion did include some strong conservative rhetoric; but for all that, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointedly noted from the bench, the act survived ''largely unscathed.''
Toobin is one of the most talented reporters covering American law. Where else but in ''The Oath'' would we learn that Franklin Pierce was the only American president ever to ''affirm'' rather than ''swear'' the required oath of office -- or that the only full audio file of Obama's second swearing-in was captured by Wes Allison of The St. Petersburg Times, using his ''Panasonic RR-US361 digital recorder''? The book opens with an absorbing explanation of how the oath went wrong. In Toobin's account, the two men did not know where each planned to pause during the recitation, so Roberts was startled when Obama jumped in after the first phrase and both, off balance, then mixed up the words.
But the rest of the book is devoted to drama inside the court, which is harder to report. When oral arguments ended on March 28, most observers (including, as he gamely admits, Toobin himself) predicted that the act would be savaged. By the end of June, however, Roberts had apparently left his four conservative allies in the lurch. ''The Oath'' adds little to what is already known of these events, nor does Toobin tell us who was responsible for the surprising wave of leaks, mostly critical of Roberts, coming from the court before and after the decision (which could be traced, he speculates, to ''petulant law clerks,'' not disappointed justices).
''The Oath'' does not pretend to be an inside account of the health care case. Toobin's goal instead is to explain the evolution of the Roberts court, and to do so he must weave together an almost overwhelming number of subjects -- the rise of the personal ''right to bear arms''; the assault on campaign finance regulation; the administration's inept handling of lower-court judicial nominations; the unquiet afterlives of the retired justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter and John Paul Stevens; the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan; Virginia Thomas's bizarre quest for an apology from Anita Hill; and Justice Antonin Scalia's ''transition from conservative intellectual to right-wing crank.'' He must also summarize prodigious amounts of legal doctrine and procedural complexity to place the court's decisions in context. At times, the reader may be daunted by it all.
Knowledgeable observers will also find much to debate in Toobin's account of the court's turn to the right. He entitles one chapter ''The Thomas Court,'' but there are two sharply divergent schools of thought about whether Clarence Thomas is actually the ''intellectual pathbreaker'' behind the court's Second Amendment and campaign finance jurisprudence. And although Toobin sees Citizens United as a triumph of Roberts's partisan agenda, the facts related in ''The Oath'' can be read differently -- to depict a rookie chief justice, nervous about moving doctrine too fast, reluctantly hustled along by an impatient conservative bloc.
None of the above should discourage readers from plunging into ''The Oath.'' Not until scholars a generation hence gain access to the justices' papers are we likely to have a more useful, or more readable, picture of this oddly assorted group of judges at this moment in history. But at the end of ''The Oath,'' both the court and its chief justice remain enigmas. That's not a failure of reporting. The decision in June was not the end but the beginning of a story. The meaning of Roberts's opinion in the health care case will be clear only when we know the next few appointees to the court. A stronger conservative majority will widen the libertarian trail he blazed in his health care opinion. A new liberal majority will have little trouble limiting his words to the vanishing point.
In either case, I suspect we won't see much more scoffing at the court's importance, at least during the quarter-century or so John Roberts is likely to remain its chief. He has shown himself to be comfortable with power, independent of both enemies and friends, and capable of leading the kind of long-term legal campaign that made historic figures of chief justices like John Marshall and Earl Warren. As Toobin writes at the end of ''The Oath,'' ''it's John Roberts's court now.''

WHERE THEY STANDThe American Presidents in the Eyes of Voters and Historians
By Robert W. Merry298 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28
One night a few months ago, my 7-year-old son -- who during the Republican primaries developed a mildly obsessional interest in presidential history -- asked me to rank the American chief executives in order of greatness. With bedtime looming, I resolved to make it quick. Rattling off the successes (George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt) proved easy, as did listing the failures (James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon). But filling in the middle drove me crazy. Should William McKinley place higher or lower than Gerald Ford? Martin Van Buren above or below Rutherford B. Hayes? Yawning, and under pressure from my eager son, I randomly plugged in Millard Fillmore, Chester A. Arthur and the Harrisons and called it a night. 
Maddening as this experience was, it was infinitely more pleasurable than a similar task I had undertaken some years ago. The impresarios at C-Span deemed a single numerical figure too crude a measure for capturing something as complex as executive performance. I had to assign a score from 1 to 10 to every president in a profusion of different categories. How did I rate John Quincy Adams in ''administrative skills'' and ''relations with Congress''? Where would James Garfield stand on ''economic management'' and ''pursued equal justice for all''? (We were permitted to claim insufficient expertise in any category, but what would be the fun in that?) I finished the survey as hastily as I had my son's -- plugging in more 4s, 5s and 6s than the historical record
surely warranted.
Why is there such a robust appetite for something so silly? '' 'Ranking the Presidents' has always been a favorite indoor sport of history-minded Americans,'' the political scientist Clinton Rossiter wrote in his classic 1956 work, ''The American Presidency'' -- a line Robert W. Merry quotes in his diverting new book, ''Where They Stand: The American Presidents in the Eyes of Voters and Historians.'' The exercise plays to the 7-year-old within each of us, the part of our psyche that delights in making Top 25 lists, ticking off our desert-island discs and thumbing through ''The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.'' We have a primal need to impose order on theinchoate, to quantify theunquantifiable.
Merry, theauthor of several books including ''Taking On the World,'' an excellent joint biography of the political columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop, approaches the ratings game in an unpretentious spirit -- and wisely so. Maintaining a puckish tone may be the best hope for anyone seeking to spin a whole book out of what, the writer confesses, is a mere ''parlor game.'' He ends his chatty prologue with an impish invitation: ''Wanna play?''
With well-wrought thumbnails of various presidencies and a keen sense of pacing, Merry tries to impose order upon and extract meaning from the ratings game. He doesn't claim too much. The one insight he says may have value is the notion that when it comes to assessing the presidential record, historians and the contemporaries usually agree. Two-termers and popular presidents stand the test of time, Merry notes, while those turned out of office (William Howard Taft, Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush) shuffle through the ages with the loser label pinned to their backs. Public opinion and
expert opinion, he argues, ultimately
converge on the proper
ratings.
One
problem
with this prin- ciple, as Merry admits, is that there are a lot of exceptions. Calvin Coolidge, supremely popular in his time, is now judged for his policies that contributed to the Great Depression. Harry Truman, widely considered a distinguished leader today, left Washington a beaten man. Another glitch that Merry acknowledges is that the lens with which we view a president's achievements changes with the times. He notes that James Polk, who provoked a military conflict with Mexico, has lost favor in the aftermath of Vietnam and Iraq, as some historians find in Polk's adventurism the imperialist tendencies they see in the supporters of our more recent, unpopular wars. Andrew Jackson's legacy has also lost luster as his anti-Indian policies loom large in evaluating his tenure. If fashioning a rule of thumb for ranking presidents proves difficult, so does distilling meaning from the whole business. There's something to be said for Merry's insistence that the opinions rendered in a president's own day can't be easily dismissed; but he demonstrates this point quickly, and in the book's five-page conclusion he says nothing at all about ratings, concentrating instead on the powers and limitations of the office of the presidency and his expectation that a ''Leader of Destiny'' will soon emerge to guide America through this time of ''turmoil and trouble, of economic threat and global challenge, of high rancor and rhetorical abuse.'' (He says that Barack Obama once possessed this potential but is now unlikely to ''shape a new era for America.'')
By the end, the reader is tempted to agree with the historian Thomas Bailey, who, in 1966, rejected the ratings enterprise as a futile effort ''to measure the immeasurable.'' Indeed, the elusiveness of Merry's quarry can remind hubristic scholars who imagine, as one political scientist told a New York Times reporter earlier this year, that ''the march of quantification . . . will sweep through academia, business and government.'' Ignorant of history, such prophets fail to realize that the vogue for quantification has come and gone many times before. There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in their regression analyses.
If ''Where They Stand'' doesn't realize Merry's announced aim of bringing order to the rankings, it does provide a pleasing romp through the annals of American politics. Knowledgeable about the past, well read in the scholarly literature, Merry is given to moderate and sensible judgments, patiently argued in straightforward prose. At heart, one senses, he is not really a quantifier or systematizer at all and perhaps not even convinced of his own statement that the ratings game is ''more than just a beguiling diversion.'' He simply wants the reader to join him in what is, after all, a favorite indoor sport of history-minded Americans, one that ''forever runs parallel to American history.''

OUR DIVIDED POLITICAL HEARTThe Battle for the American Idea in an Age of Discontent
By E. J. Dionne Jr.325 pp. Bloomsbury. $27
The Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne Jr. has ascended to a sufficiently elevated plane of the Higher Punditry that his author's biography no longer mentions he received a doctorate from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar. Even so, he still comes across as a precocious student, bubbling with boyish charm and enthusiasm for ideas, though sometimes a bit glib and preening. His books are clever, upbeat and interesting, particularly when he examines current political concerns through the lens of history, religion and philosophy. But while readers will admire Dionne's intellectual dexterity in diagnosing the historical origins of our present political problem of division and dysfunction, they may also wish he could make a more substantive case for how we might move beyond it. 
The topic Dionne has set for himself in ''Our Divided Political Heart'' seems to be something like this: ''Pundits predicted that Barack Obama's 2008 election would trigger a new cycle of progressivism and prosperity, yet instead it has brought political gridlock, Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests, and continued public unhappiness. Discuss.'' Dionne offers familiar explanations, including the severity of the financial crisis; widespread fears of national decline; Republican obstruction; and Obama's mishandling of the economic stimulus program and health care reform. But far more ambitiously, he situates our current divisions in the full sweep of American history, going back to the founders -- since, as he observes, ''Americans disagree about who we are because we can't agree about who we've been.''
Dionne posits that American history has always been characterized by tension between the core values of individualism and community. Americans have cherished liberty, individual opportunity and self-expression while also upholding the importance of community obligation and civic virtue. The founders referred to these values as liberalism and republicanism, and the effort to balance and reconcile them has shaped the American character. Neither value is reducible to liberalism or conservatism as we now understand them, although communitarianism presumes a belief that government is at least potentially a constructive force. Dionne, a self-described ''communitarian liberal,'' acknowledges that he has much in common with conservative intellectuals like Robert Nisbet and the ''compassionate conservatives'' around George W. Bush. But Dionne argues that today's Tea Party-influenced conservatives have broken with their communitarian traditions and become zealots for radical individualism. He pleads for a return to the balance between individual and community values that characterized most of American history.
Dionne takes a long-term historical approach partly in response to the revisionism of Tea Partyers and conservatives like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose poorly informed assertions about American history and government make him a useful foil. The author draws on a wide body of historical scholarship, and the quarrels over that scholarship, in the course of revisiting past episodes and developments that bear on present controversies.
Conservatives' contentions that the founders believed in minimal government and maximal individualism, for example, are countered by the findings of scholars like Gordon Wood that the American revolutionaries sought to create a strong federal government and conceived of a highly communal and at times anticapitalistic version of liberty. Dionne points out that conservative justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas who claim to be able to discern the ''original intent'' of the Constitution are deluded, since the founders held conflicting views and some provisions of the Constitution ''embody not timeless truths but sensitive compromises aimed at resolving (or getting around) pressing disagreements of the moment.'' He scolds Republicans for abandoning the tradition of active government involvement in national economic development that was promoted by Alexander Hamilton and the Whig Party of Henry Clay, and continued with the Republicans through Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. He cites historians like Brian Balogh to bolster his view that the laissez-faire doctrine of the Gilded Age was an aberration, and that ''conservative individualists are thus trying to convert a 35-year interlude into the norm for 235 years of American history.''
Dionne also deploys history as a goad to modern liberalism, particularly in his treatment of the Populist and Progressive movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He believes that liberals need to take the populist label away from conservative movements like the Tea Party and reclaim it as their own. He welcomes Occupy Wall Street as a populist force pushing Obama in a more communitarian direction, much like the mass movements that pushed Franklin Roosevelt leftward in the 1930s. At the same time, he hopes that Occupy Wall Street will find expression in traditional politics, just as the Progressives fulfilled many Populist goals by joining them with the aspirations of the middle class. The merger of Populism and Progressivism, in Dionne's view, laid the groundwork for ''the Long Consensus'': the active-government commitment to prosperity that expanded both individual opportunity and collective security in the century after Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency in 1901. It is this consensus, along with the balance and moderation it embodied, that is threatened by a Republican Party newly converted to the cause of radical individualism.
Dionne has paid careful attention to historians' conflicting interpretations of the American past as well as to the history itself, and he's obviously wary of the criticism that he has written a book that votes for Obama on every page, to paraphrase a charge that has been leveled against other scholars. He shouldn't be accused of political favoritism for diagnosing the current moment of ''asymmetric polarization,'' in which Republicans seek to overturn the Long Consensus while Democrats defend it. ''If describing developments in American political life candidly is dismissed as a form of partisanship,'' he warns, ''then honest speech becomes impossible.''
Still, Dionne covers such vast swaths of history and historiography that at times his approach resembles that of a water bug skittering across a pond, and this leaves him vulnerable to the charge that he's engaging in historical cheerleading. It may be, for example, that the New Dealers ''saved the freedoms and the republican institutions that were at the heart of the founders' achievement,'' but Dionne doesn't begin to prove it. And while he is justly critical of ideologically compromised right-wing history, he calls ideological left-wing revisionism ''important,'' ''debunking'' and thought-provoking.
Dionne declares that ''the country confronts a time of decision,'' one that demands more than ''musty bromides'' about moderation or mere procedural reforms. But it's not clear how he wants Americans to respond other than to vote Democratic. He hopes Republicans will recover their abandoned communitarian traditions -- but how will this happen? He insists that we restore enthusiasm for public service by attracting talented people to government and transforming it into a forum for citizen debate -- but how exactly? The book ends with Dionne's valentine to the Millennials, whom he finds to be the most passionately individualistic and communitarian generation, more practical than the baby boomers and more idealistic than Generation X, indeed a veritable reincarnation of the Greatest Generation (aside from the part about overcoming a depression and fighting a world war). But it's a bit early to turn the country over to the Millennials, and even they will require concrete programs around which a new consensus can cohere. The history Dionne tells can provide inspiration and guidance, but Americans will have to find new ways of thinking and acting if they are to restore the political balance that once enabled American greatness.

I AM THE CHANGEBarack Obama and the Crisis of Liberalism
By Charles R. Kesler276 pp. Broadside Books/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99
Once upon a time there was a radical president who tried to remake American society through government action. In his first term he created a vast network of federal grants to state and local governments for social programs that cost billions. He set up an imposing agency to regulate air and water emissions, and another to regulate workers' health and safety. Had Congress not stood in his way he would have gone much further. He tried to establish a guaranteed minimum income for all working families and, to top it off, proposed a national health plan that would have provided government insurance for low-income families, required employers to cover all their workers and set standards for private insurance. Thankfully for the country, his second term was cut short and his collectivist dreams were never realized.
His name was Richard Nixon. 
Whenever conservatives talk to me about Barack Obama, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else. But what exactly? The anger, the suspicion, the freestyle fantasizing have no perceptible object in the space-time continuum that centrist Democrats like me inhabit. What are we missing? Seen from our perspective, the country elected a moderate and cautious straight shooter committed to getting things right and giving the United States its self-respect back after the Bush-Cheney years. Unlike the crybabies at MSNBC and Harper's Magazine, we never bought into the campaign's hollow ''hope and change'' rhetoric, so aren't crushed that, well, life got in the way. At most we hoped for a sensible health care program to end the scandal of America's uninsured, and were relieved that Obama proposed no other grand schemes of Nixonian scale. We liked him for his political liberalism and instinctual conservatism. And we still like him.
But more than a few of our fellow citizens are loathing themselves blind over Barack Obama. Why? I need a level-headed conservative to explain this to me, and Charles R. Kesler seems an excellent candidate. An amiable Harvard-educated disciple of the conservative philosopher Leo Strauss, an admirer of Cicero and the founding fathers and Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. and Ronald Reagan, he teaches at Claremont McKenna College and is the editor of The Claremont Review of Books, one of the better conservative publications. It is put out by the Claremont Institute for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy, an increasingly influential research group that also runs educational programs for young conservatives of a Tea Party bent. The Claremont Review doesn't like Obama one bit. But it has usually taken the slightly higher road in criticizing him, and when Kesler begins his book by dismissing those who portray the president as ''a third-world daddy's boy, Alinskyist agitator, deep-cover Muslim or undocumented alien'' the reader is relieved to know that ''I Am the Change'' won't be another cheap, deflationary takedown.
Instead, it is that rarest of things, a cheap inflationary takedown -- a book that so exaggerates the historical significance of this four-year senator from Illinois, who's been at his new job even less time, that he becomes both Alien and Predator. Granted, there is something about Obama that invites psychological projection, notably by Scandinavians bearing gifts. But Kesler outdoes the Nobel Prize committee by raising the Obama presidency to world-historical significance, constructing a fanciful genealogy of modern liberalism that begins just after the French Revolution in the works of the German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel; passes through Karl Marx and Charles Darwin and Oswald Spengler; and culminates in . . . ''The Audacity of Hope'' and 2,000-plus pages of technical jargon in the Affordable Care Act.
It's some performance, and actually quite helpful. A sense of proportion, once the conservative virtue, is considered treasonous on the right today, and Kesler cannot be accused of harboring one. But his systematic exaggerations demonstrate that the right's rage against Obama, which has seeped out into the general public, has very little to do with anything the president has or hasn't done. It's really directed against the historical process they believe has made America what it is today. The conservative mind, a repository of fresh ideas just two decades ago, is now little more than a click-click slide projector holding a tray of apocalyptic images of modern life that keeps spinning around, raising the viewer's fever with every rotation. If you want to experience what it's like to be within that mind on a better day, then you need to visit ''I Am the Change.''
Let's start the slide show. The Obama story begins with Professor Hegel, who had this new idea back in old Berlin. Looking down at history from an Olympian distance, and with Olympian heartlessness, he believed it showed the progressive development of human nature toward absolute freedom. This freedom, he thought, developed through the State, though, not against it. This meant that history's task would be complete only when the State coordinated the basic machinery of life, from the economy to politics, through a professional bureaucracy staffed by specialized experts trained at modern universities. Though all the bad stuff in 20th-century European history derives from Hegel's idea, according to Kesler, servile Europeans still hold to it.
America is different, or used to be. It was founded on the older idea that human beings have a fixed set of natural rights and that the fixed role of government is simply to secure those rights, otherwise leaving people to take care of themselves. This is not to say that young America was some libertarian Eden. It was bound together by common ideas of the best (Christian) life, the public good, democratic duty and good manners. It was also bound together by Abraham Lincoln -- the great hero of Claremont conservatism -- who preserved the Union by defending the inflexible moral idealism of the Declaration of Independence. Abe bequeathed to us a nation like none other, not a State like every other.
Then it all went to hell. The steps were small, as they always are on the road to serfdom. That's why the first one is so decisive. The person who enticed us along this path has a lot to answer for, and his name was. . . .
Intermission: Conservatives have always been great storytellers; it is their fatal weakness. They love casting their eyes back to the past to avoid seeing what lies right under their noses. The story always involves some expulsion from Eden, whether by the hippies of the 1960s, or the suffragists, or the wretched refuse of the shtetls, or the French Revolution, or the Enlightenment, or Luther, or Machiavelli or the sack of Rome. Next thing you know they'll be repeating Mallarmé's judgment that ''all poetry has gone wrong since the great Homeric deviation.'' (He was only half joking.) The point is, the conservative apocalypse has always been a movable one. So the suspense builds as the reader asks himself: Whom will Charles Kesler blame? Back to the show.
His name was . . . Woodrow Wilson. For some years now the Claremont Institute has been promoting the idea that Wilson was a kind of double agent, whipping the Huns in World War I while surreptitiously introducing the Hegelian bacillus into the American water supply and turning us into zombie-slaves of an elite-run progressivist State. Glenn Beck popularized the notion among grass-roots conservatives by placing Wilson at the center of his Jackson Pollock blackboards, with spokes running out to Bill Ayers, Angela Davis, Saul Alinsky, Acorn, George Soros, Cass Sunstein and now I'm forgetting who else. Kesler gives us a more sober account of what Wilson wrought.
The history books tell us that the Progressive Era began in the 1890s, when all sorts of little reform and good-government groups began popping up to fight corruption, clean up the slums and rein in the banks and trusts. Kesler, though, sees two opposing tendencies at work back then. One was populist, like the Tea Party; it distrusted business and government equally and wanted to return power to the people by adhering to strict constitutional principles. The other was an elite, paternalistic movement led by self-appointed reformers who ran roughshod over the Constitution in order to ''modernize'' the state as they saw fit. The Populists loved America, the Progressives not so much. ''Before the left's avant-garde became captivated by the Soviet Union,'' Kesler informs us, ''it fell in love with Germany.''
Woodrow Wilson, who openly confessed to reading German, was a sterling example of this type. While Progressive activists were preaching the Social Gospel and building settlement houses, Professor Wilson of Princeton University was engaged in genuine revolutionary activity -- writing books. He wondered out loud whether American political institutions, based on the framers' 18th-century mechanistic ideas, were adapted to the modern age; he also had some nice things to say about German notions of public administration. In fact one of his books, ominously titled ''The State,'' was, according to Kesler, ''designed to assist students who lacked German and Germanic attention spans.''
Kesler is an accomplished player of two conservative parlor games: Cherchez le Kraut and Whac-a-Prof. But he, too, is a professor; and as a follower of Leo Strauss, he has also absorbed a lot of German assumptions about how Big Ideas get born in the mind of a single thinker and march their way through history. So it's pretty amusing to see how, after railing against Hegel's myth of fated historical progress, he proceeds to construct an inverted myth of fated historical decline once Wilson bore Hegel's love-child. Kesler's history of Progressivism doesn't involve real public figures making real choices about real policies under real constraints in real time. It follows the determined historical journey of the Progressive Idea in words, from the New Freedom platform of Wilson's first campaign, down through the New Deal speeches of Franklin Roosevelt (who spoke German as a child), then to Lyndon Johnson's announcements of the War on Poverty and the Great Society. Once that rhetorical lineage is established, he then tries to show how the Idea spread out into American culture at large, bringing with it existentialist self-absorption, moral relativism and passivity in the face of the new administrative state, so that by the midcentury we nearly became Europeans (only fatter). That is when ''it fell to Ronald Reagan to help restore Americans' confidence in themselves, which he did in the name not of liberalism but of conservatism.''
There is, of course, a real story here, but also a much simpler, Idea-Frei way of telling it. Yes, the hydra-headed Progressive movement, resisting varied but real economic threats to democratic self-government, did extend the jurisprudential limits of government activity in ways that were wise and sometimes not so wise. Yes, the New Deal did convince Americans that citizens are not road kill and that government can legitimately protect public welfare and basic human dignity. And yes, the Great Society's liberal architects vastly overreached and overpromised, destroying the public's confidence in active government and threatening the solid achievements of the New Deal and the Progressive Era.
This more modest narrative used to convince conservatives, and still does convince centrist liberals like me who cringe at the name McGovern. And Ronald Reagan plays a big role in it. Reagan did in fact restore (then overinflate) America's self-confidence, and he did bequeath to Republicans a clear ideological alternative to Progressivism. But he also transformed American liberalism. As an author named Barack Obama once wrote, Reagan ''put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it.'' By delegitimizing Great Society liberalism and emphasizing growth, he forced the Democratic Party back toward the center, making the more moderate presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama possible. Reagan won the war of ideas, as everyone knows.
Except conservatives. The most important thing I learned from Kesler's book is just how large a stake conservatives have in convincing themselves and voters that Reagan failed. Think about it: if they conceded ideological victory they would have to confront the more prosaic reasons that entitlements, deficits and regulations continue to grow in Republican and Democratic administrations alike. They would be forced to devise a new, forward-looking agenda to benefit even their own constituencies, like ensuring that American business can draw on an educated, healthy work force; can rely on modern public infrastructure; and can count on stable, transparent financial markets. And they would have to articulate a conservative vision for those welfare state programs that are likely to remain with us, like disability insurance, food stamps and Head Start.
George W. Bush's ''compassionate conservatism'' looked like a step in this direction, but it proved to be an empty slogan once the Republican establishment returned to power in 2001. The same will surely happen to Paul Ryan's more sensible budget ideas if he and Mitt Romney are elected in November. By now conservative intellectuals and media hacks have realized that it's much easier to run a permanent counterrevolution out of their plush think-tank offices and television studios than to reflect seriously, do homework and cut a deal. All they have to do is spook their troops into believing that the Progressive Idea is still on the march and that they are setting out to meet it at Armageddon. Until then, keep those checks and votes coming in.
The thing is, the conservatives have also spooked themselves. They now really believe the apocalyptic tale they've spun, and have placed mild-mannered Barack Obama at the center of it. It hasn't been easy. Kesler admits that ''Obama is at pains to be, and to be seen as, a strong family man, a responsible husband and father urging responsibility on others, a patriot, a model of pre-'60s, subliminally anti-'60s, sobriety.'' But that's just a disguise. In fact, he's the ''latest embodiment of the visionary prophet-statesman'' of the Progressives, someone who ''sees himself engaged in an epic struggle'' whose success will mean ''the Swedenization of America.'' Or maybe its Harlemization, given that ''the black church replaces the Puritans in Obama's chronicle of American spirituality.'' In any case, Barack Obama is, without doubt, the ''most left-wing liberal to be elected to national executive office since Henry Wallace.'' (Take that, Hubert Humphrey!)
And what is Kesler's evidence for these extravagant claims? He hasn't any. Early in the book he writes that Obama came to office planning ''bold, systemic changes to energy policy, environmental regulation, taxation, foreign policy'' -- though he never describes these plans and in fact never mentions them again. He carefully avoids Obama's moderate record, preferring instead to parse ''The Audacity of Hope'' for signs of Germanic statism and to cite liberal journalists gushing over the Black Messiah as proof that Obama sees himself that way. It amounts to nothing. By the final chapter, it becomes apparent that Kesler's whole case against Obama and the liberalism whose ''crisis'' he quintessences rests on a single piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act of 2010. From Hegel to health care: what could be clearer?
Now, there are many reasons to be worried about the health care act, especially if the system it puts in place proves unmanageable and sours the public further on assertive government action when needed. But it is no reason to pull the fire alarm and declare, as Kesler does, that it is the ''latest installment in modern liberalism's long-running project to change America by changing Americans' relation to their government'' and marks ''a new stage in the decline of constitutional government in America.'' The Supreme Court has settled the constitutional issue, so now we have to make the thing work. Today's conservatives, though, are too absorbed with their imaginary world-historical struggle even to change a light bulb. ''If Communism, armed with millions of troops and thousands of megatons of nuclear weapons, could collapse, . . . why not American liberalism?'' Kesler muses in his final pages. Those are the stakes.
What role does Barack Obama play in that struggle? A rather small one, as this book unintentionally shows. Had the Supreme Court overturned the Affordable Care Act, the right's fever would not have dropped one degree, nor, I predict, will the patient come to its senses if the president is defeated in November. Is there a doctor in the house? Conservatives need a psychological specialist, someone at the level of the great Jewish sage and sometime physician Maimonides. In the late 12th century Maimonides received a letter from a group of rabbis in Marseille who had worked themselves into a frenzy over astrological predictions of the End Times. His prescription -- I translate loosely from the Hebrew -- was, Get a grip! ''A man should never cast his reason behind him,'' he warned, ''for the eyes are set in front, not behind.'' Excellent advice then, excellent advice now. And it sounds even better in German.

THE BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN DREAMBy Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele
289 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.99
There are two major flaws in ''The Betrayal of the American Dream,'' a new book about the dismantling of the middle class. The first is its diagnosis of what's causing the country's economic troubles. The second is its prescriptions.
At least it got the symptoms right. 
The authors, Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, investigative reporters for Vanity Fair, are angry about unemployment, offshoring, pension underfunding, tax loopholes, financial fraud and many other legitimately infuriating issues. In their rage, they see conspiracies everywhere, usually led by the Montgomery Burnses and Henry F. Potters of the world and their minions in Washington. The country's economic malaise is due to the malevolent machinations of the ''ruling class,'' they suggest, which wants nothing more than to snuff out the proletariat with their ''rapacious job-killing strategies.''
To be sure, lots of financiers, executives and politicians have done lots of unethical and greedy things in recent years, from buying influence to committing outright fraud. Yet they did so not because they're mustache-twirling sadists, as the book implies, but to improve their bottom line. And the black-and-white moralism also fails to capture the whole story. The authors impugn evil capitalists for sending work abroad to chase lower prices, for example, but they mostly let American consumers off the hook for demanding those lower prices in the first place.
Oddly, despite the complaints about the outsize influence of the wealthy, there is no mention of campaign finance reform. Instead, the book's main solution for just about every ailment is to erect new trade barriers and essentially freeze economic and employment arrangements as they are. But that's not a sustainable strategy for keeping (let alone creating) American jobs, as demonstrated by the wretched trade wars wrought by the Smoot-Hawley tariff in the 1930s.
Barlett and Steele want to turn back the clock to a time when American workers were the most competitive in the world, rather than find new ways to make American workers more competitive -- through, for example, a more functional education system. In fact, the authors write off the role of education, calling it a ''shopworn'' theory for addressing the needs of displaced workers. They complain about the recent fall in wages in entry-level jobs for college graduates, and argue that rising student debt proves higher education often isn't worthwhile.
Yet throughout the book, some of their key anecdotes involve displaced workers who got back on their feet after retraining. And a closer look at the recent jobs numbers shows that unemployment rates for college graduates are still quite low: 4.1 percent, less than half the rate for workers with only a high school diploma. The wage premium conferred by postsecondary education has been rising, not falling, in the last few decades.
A better education system would also address another major force behind the displacement of the working class, particularly those in manufacturing: automation. That's a force protectionism unquestionably cannot address, which is perhaps why the authors ignore it.
Barlett and Steele do have some intelligent things to say about the unfairness and impenetrability of the American tax code, which favors the wealthy and allows dangerous accounting for corporate pension liabilities. But the book is strongest, and most useful, when it recounts poignant stories of workers left out in the cold, chilling examples of exactly how far members of the middle class have fallen. The book will undoubtedly make you angry, even if it doesn't help you put that anger to good use.

BYLINE: By THE EDITORS

 BODY:
In this week's Book Review, Mark Lilla considers Charles R. Kesler's ''I Am the Change: Barack Obama and the Crisis of Liberalism.'' In a recent e-mail interview, he talked about America's current political landscape and discussed why grappling with the ''new nature of capitalism'' is the most pressing intellectual and political task facing us:
Do you think the level of political discourse has changed in the United States since the time of, say, Nixon's presidency? 
Yes, the level of political discourse has dropped. Just go to YouTube and find videos of broadcast news shows of the 1960s, or press conferences, and you'll hear journalists and politicians alike using complex, clause-packed sentences to express relatively complex, idea-packed thoughts about current affairs. What happened? Partisan politics aside, we're obviously becoming a less articulate country, as serious reading declines and automatic writing on the Internet spreads.
But there's another factor, I think, and that is the centrality of economic policy to our politics today, and its inherent complexity. Though wars are complicated things, it's not hard to develop a defensible position about their legitimacy or illegitimacy. But you need to know a fair amount about finance to make any sense, for example, of the bank collapses and bailouts of 2008-9 and the stimulus that followed. Very few people have that, but in a democracy everyone is supposed to have an opinion about everything. Everyone's opinion is supposed to matter; you shouldn't need higher education to chime in. But on economic policy you do. This opens the field to charlatans who demonize educated elites and reassure people that ''it's really all very simple.''
Does this show up in Kesler's book?
In a way, yes. One thing that struck me in reading it is how unwilling conservatives are to confront the real, existing economic system we live in today, with all its advantages and disadvantages. They cling to a nostalgic picture of the America of small business, when America's destiny will be determined by how we cope with global capitalism in the future. Kesler sees the welfare state as the biggest threat to democratic self-government, but that's nothing compared with the threat posed by world financial markets. Because modern democracies hold so much debt, and must finance it within a system where capital is instantaneously mobile, zipping across the world at the click of a mouse, they are rapidly losing their sovereignty. It's already happening to Europe, which is now largely run by technocratic governments, not because of welfare-state encroachment but because of the new nature of capitalism.
The only people who talk about this are paleoconservative protectionists and left-wing anarchists -- and they are right to. Not that liberals, let alone ''progressives,'' have come up with any answers. What all of us across the political spectrum really need now is insight into how 21st-century capitalism actually operates and how democratic self-government can be preserved in the face of it.
You spent time as an editor at The Public Interest, which was a neoconservative journal, and now are an Obama-supporting Democrat. What changed?
The environment. I'm allergic to political hysteria, detest demagogues and prefer the company of grown-ups who know what they are talking about. That made me a neocon in the Carter and Reagan years, and a centrist Democrat ever since. I feel I've changed very little.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Rethinking Self-Reliance

 BODY:
Why do some tout individualism yet depend on public money?
To the Editor:
To a room full of millionaires, Mitt Romney said he will never get the votes of the 47 percent of Americans he sees as ''dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.'' Programs that provide food, medical care or shelter are, to him, drugs that turn users into Democratic-addicted voters, their individual initiative hollowed out.
Mr. Romney has the politics backward. Evidence suggests that regions most dependent on government payments -- places like eastern Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and northern Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho and Montana -- reliably vote Republican. It is one of the great puzzles of modern politics, best expressed by the cry ''Keep your government hands off my Medicare!''
Democrats too quickly dismiss this paradox as hypocrisy or denial. It stems instead, I suspect, from the contradictions between old American ideologies and modern economic forces. From 19th-century Horatio Alger tales to modern conservatism's up-by-your-bootstraps-ism, Americans have long cherished self-reliance. 
This idea now finds itself at odds -- as it did in the Progressive Era and the Great Depression -- with the vicissitudes of modern capitalism. As more people rely on government programs, from tax credits to school lunches to mortgage relief, some respond not with gratitude but resentment, focusing their ire not on the economic forces that brought them low but on the government programs that lift them up. Do they take Mr. Romney's words seriously, and really believe themselves unable to ''take personal responsibility''?
Responding to this paradox requires an alternative to modern conservatism's individualist ideologies. For too long, liberals have sought to persuade Americans, in the face of growing evidence to the contrary, that self-sufficiency and a middle-class life are compatible.
It is time we abandon our obsession with an individualism that was always more fiction than fact. Until Americans learn once and for all to hang together, we will assuredly continue, as Benjamin Franklin once put it, to hang separately.
FRANÇOIS FURSTENBERG Montreal, Sept. 24, 2012
The writer, who is American, is a professor of history at the University of Montreal.
Readers React
Asking Americans to get over their obsession with rugged individualism is like asking the French to stop caring about food -- pointless and counterproductive. Myth or not, the frontier mentality is alive and well and shows no sign of ebbing any time soon.
If Democrats and liberals want to educate the American people about the very real role of government in their lives, and in the lives of their friends and neighbors and family, then they should do exactly that: talk about it.
All too often, liberal leaders seem reluctant to brag about their accomplishments or to try to set the agenda. Instead, they use right-wing rhetoric and talking points, even when trying to argue against them. As we have seen the political pendulum swing from left to right over the last 50 years, it is clear that failing to stand tall is not working for the American left.
TED RALL East Hampton, N.Y., Sept. 26, 2012
The writer is the political cartoonist.
Mr. Furstenberg describes Republican success in regions that depend heavily on government as ''one of the great puzzles of modern politics.'' I'm writing from eastern Kentucky, his first example. For what it's worth from a libertarian-leaning atheist, here's a guess about the puzzle: culture trumps economics.
Since the mid-20th century, urban liberals in the Democratic Party have made little secret of their disdain for rural culture. They've condemned gun ownership as a danger, angering people who regard it as security. They've worked to expel God from the public square, though the good works of the faithful extend far beyond church walls.
The left's antagonism toward these values strikes many Americans as threatening, and Democrats will struggle to change their minds. Mr. Furstenberg's idea -- an ideological assault on individualism -- won't do. The word is too closely associated with liberty, which has an even larger following than God or guns.
MICHAEL SMITH Cynthiana, Ky., Sept. 26, 2012
Mr. Furstenberg highlights a seldom acknowledged but often decried fact of politics -- it is more ideological than logical. Attempts to persuade ideologues of the virtues of opposing points of view are rarely met with success, because our modern partisan politics, contrary to Aristotle's claim, is characterized not by reason devoid of passion, but by passion devoid of reason. This is especially true of the modern conservative party, and its Tea Party contingent.
Politics is driven by ''sound bites'' designed to appeal specifically to the lowest common denominator of fear -- fear of ''big government'' wielding ''death panels,'' fear of an ''axis of evil'' threatening our very existence, or, most recently, fear of the 47 percent of ''takers'' who are siphoning the country's wealth to support their ''entitlement'' lifestyle.
It is no wonder that Republicans vote in large numbers against their own financial self-interest. They are driven by a politics of passion, not reason. They are bound together by their rejection of a moral consciousness that embraces the liberal claim of our ''inescapable network of mutuality,'' that ''whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.''
These words remain as true today as in 1963, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. transcribed them in his ''Letter From Birmingham Jail.'' However, their ability to persuade ideologues to shift their moral consensus has been sadly muted today.
STACY HAWKINS Camden, N.J., Sept. 26, 2012
The writer is an assistant professor at Rutgers School of Law -- Camden.
Democrats have excelled at misrepresenting the Republican belief in personal accountability as a threat to community and our call to care for one another. In Bill Clinton's gauzy recollection of our nation's past at the Democratic National Convention, life was all wagon trains and barn raisings, whereas the credo of today's G.O.P. is every man for himself.
This is false. Republicans believe passionately in the collective. They believe that market wisdom is the truest consensus of the largest number of people. They are extravagantly generous to those who have little. One could argue that they feel a greater responsibility for their fellows because their urgent goal is to revitalize our financial condition so there will still be a safety net in 50 years.
The difference between the parties is that Republicans think that citizens, not government, should lead the wagon train and design the barn.
MARGARET McGIRR Greenwich, Conn., Sept. 26, 2012
The power of misleading paid advertising should be added to Mr. Furstenberg's valid analysis of the ''American paradox.'' An illustration of this power is the defeat of a Massachusetts ballot question to replace the flat income tax, currently 5.3 percent, with a graduated tax, to increase taxes on higher incomes.
The proposed change would have benefited lower-income earners, the majority of voters in the state. As a result of intense advertising, financed generously by wealthy individuals, the ballot question was defeated several times.
Large numbers of low-income earners voted against their real economic interest to benefit the economic interests of affluent voters who had financed the misleading advertising campaign.
DAVID G. GIL Lexington, Mass., Sept. 26, 2012
The writer is emeritus professor of social policy at Brandeis University.
Mr. Furstenberg's point should be taken much more broadly. Modern technological, social and economic forces have altered American life in fundamental ways that require significant updating of the 18th-century ideologies that underlie our political and economic life -- and our Constitution.
Obviously, our bedrock principles of freedom, equality and justice are as vital to our lives, security and prosperity as they have ever been. But the modern state, with its huge industries, communications networks (including the Internet) and financial interdependence, doesn't comport well with 18th-century individualism and localism. It's time to question the originalism that has been a governing principle of constitutional jurisprudence.
We are no longer a small country of independent artisans and farmers. Most Americans are employees, vulnerable to economic forces they can't control.
We need to figure out how to preserve the essential virtues of our Constitution while making it compatible with today's realities. Originalism, which has been a factor in a number of decisions that have been harmful in their practical effects, has already failed.
RICHARD ARONSON Westfield, N.J., Sept. 26, 2012
Americans' romantic absorption with self-reliance is a fallacy that perpetuates the increasing difficulties that have plagued the middle and lower classes in our country. One need only look to Europe and Canada, where government support of the middle and lower classes is much more comprehensive, to see the difference. The middle and lower classes in these other countries are better educated and healthier over all, and have a higher standard of living than their cohorts in our society.
This American myth about self-reliance that much of the working middle class has supported by voting Republican in this century has helped to keep this population at a social and economic disadvantage.
JOSÉ SOTOLONGO Accord, N.Y., Sept. 26, 2012
Mr. Furstenberg touches upon several of the reasons for the seemingly incongruous action of voting Republican apparently against one's own self-interest.
Low-information voters often cast their ballots predicated on little or no facts. They tend to be, I believe, disproportionately white, working class and less educated. In a 2011 article in Truthout, ''Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a G.O.P. Operative Who Left the Cult,'' Mike Lofgren characterized these voters as ones whose mistrust of government, based on confusion and ignorance, ''has been stoked by Republican rhetoric at every turn.''
Another article, ''Why Working Americans Vote Against Their Own Interests'' (The Pilot, June 24, 2012), includes a quote from John Steinbeck that ''the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.''
Under this theory, disappointment at one's status is not directed at those of wealth and power who might otherwise be seen as the enemy. Mitt Romney is your friend, waiting to greet you at the front door when you soon arrive to share in his wealth and power.
In addition, the single-issue voter aligns himself or herself with a party that might not otherwise appear a logical bedfellow. For one who finds compelling the Republican Party's platform on a matter like gun control or abortion, the party's disregard for one's plight has virtually no relevance.
While Mr. Furstenberg might try to tie up all these disparate matters under the heading of hanging together rather than separately, I fear that it is a much more complex issue that defies easy explanation or resolution.
ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM Fort Lee, N.J., Sept. 26, 2012
The Writer Responds
Ms. Hawkins and Messrs. Sotolongo, Gil and Nussbaum offer wonderful insight into the oft-deplored tendency of many Americans to vote against their economic self-interest.
As someone who often has trouble discerning his own best interest -- and who, alas, too frequently acts against it even when he does -- I confess that I don't find this behavior odd. People willingly put religious beliefs, personal dignity or values ahead of a narrowly conceived economic self-interest. Only economists and bankers persist in believing otherwise. And look where they've delivered us.
While I agree with Mr. Rall that liberals should stop hiding from their accomplishments, I am less pessimistic that collective ideals will inevitably falter in the face of individualist mythology. Like even the best French food, some myths start to smell rotten when they get too old. What is more, contra Mr. Smith, rich nodes of communal values have always been embedded in the individualist bedrock of American politics. In many understandings of freedom, they are not an assault but a precondition. Here, I think, lies the signal failure of Barack Obama's presidency. Many believed that a person of such eloquence, charisma and intelligence, entering history amid the wreckage that conservative dogma had wrought, might mobilize those better angels of our nature to promote a new nationalist narrative. Here, after all, was a man who had openly avowed his skepticism of an American creed ''that rational, thoughtful people could shape their own destiny'' apart from the burdens of history.
I know that in a republic true solutions come from the people. Still, better leadership wouldn't hurt.

HEADLINE: Hey, Big Saver!

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
If you want to know what the future of the American economy looks like -- when the unemployment rate will return to below 6 percent, or when annual growth will climb back above 3 percent -- it's helpful to stop thinking for a moment about those families in serious financial distress. That's because the future of the U.S. economy relies, in large part, on another group of people living in fear: the millions of Americans who have a little disposable income.
The decisions that the twitchy class faces may not be the most challenging, but they are, from a purely economic perspective, perhaps the most important. Imagine a couple in their 30s, living in the starter home that they bought eight years ago. Their kids have outgrown that tiny shared bedroom, and the den is crowded with toys. The couple are eager to buy a bigger place -- they have paid down their debts and built up their savings -- but they're not quite over the terror of the financial crisis and sluggish recovery. Even though they can afford it, they worry that now isn't the best time to splurge. What if one of them loses a job? What if the other doesn't get a raise for years? The agita still comes easily. 
Though it doesn't always seem true, times actually have changed. During the worst of the recession, people were just plain broke. Their debts were at historic highs, and their savings were at record lows. That's no longer the case. American households have reduced much of that debt and built up some savings. They're just not spending it yet. So whereas the Federal Reserve was once tasked with performing life support on the financial sector, it's new challenge is more subtle but nearly as complicated. It needs to convince consumers that they can trust the economy again, that now really is the time to jump back into the stock market or buy that bigger house.
To that end, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, has announced a third round of what's called quantitative easing, the controversial strategy that the Japanese first experimented with in 2001. Then as now, quantitative easing has a fairly simple goal (to unstick a stagnant economy, that is), but like nearly everything that the Fed does, it's also shrouded in confusing language and technical details. And it's not exactly the most direct stimulus either.
As the only institution that can invent new dollars with a few keystrokes, the Fed has pledged to buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities every month. Its goal is to force banks and investors to take on more risk. Some mortgage-backed securities were among the worst financial products sold during the housing bubble, but most, now, are backed by the U.S. government and about as safe as an investment can get. And in the Fed's eyes, that's the problem. Banks -- much like a still-traumatized family -- are so terrified of taking any risks that they're helping keep the economy in this morass. Too much risk creates crises, but too little prevents economic growth. Quantitative easing allows the Fed to take away those mortgage-backed securities and force banks to do something riskier with their money, like offer competitive loans to riskier people. Once everyone is putting his money into slightly less safe, and slightly more productive, investments, the economy will take off. That's the theory, anyway.
Is $40 billion per month enough to transform the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market? Probably not on its own, but Q.E. 3, as it is commonly known (distinguishing it from two earlier, tamer efforts, Q.E. 1 and Q.E. 2), has an even more subtle and important mission. Its real goal, through indirect psychological pressure, is to kick-start the consumption and investment machine that makes up 85 percent of the U.S. economy. When Bernanke announced that the Fed would be investing in the mortgage market indefinitely, he signaled that he's had it with short-term fixes. His Fed is committed, he said, to taking extraordinary measures until unemployment goes down. In Fed-speak, Q.E. 3 is a clear message to banks, investors and private companies that the economy is going to grow, and the riskiest thing they can do is to hold on to their cash and riskless securities and watch their competitors profit.
It's hard to find unambiguous support for Ben Bernanke these days. Many economists who champion quantitative easing contend that he has waited far too long. Many politicians, economists and market players have argued that Q.E. 3 is fundamentally flawed and dangerous for numerous other reasons. The Fed's infusion won't be used for smart investments, they suggest, but will instead spark inflation, especially in crucial commodities like oil. This would slow the economy's mild recovery even further.
Part of the resistance is undoubtedly the fact that the policy's core idea is hard for many to embrace. Q.E. 3 is rooted in the theories of John Maynard Keynes, the loved/despised British economic giant of the early 20th century whose ideas are generally, though not exclusively, associated with Democrats. Keynes famously explained the Great Depression, in part, through an economic idea known as the paradox of thrift. In tough economic times, the notion goes, each person might be doing something that seems perfectly sensible, like saving money instead of buying a new house. But the cumulative impact of everyone's doing the right thing has a very bad outcome. When everyone saves, there's much less economic activity and much less growth. Oddly, Keynes argued, the best way to make an economy healthy again is to persuade people and businesses to be a bit more reckless with their money.
For many, this is just nuts. How can irresponsibility be the most responsible thing for a central bank to promote during a recovery? But quantitative easing's champions respond that they know the policy works because they've seen it happen. In 2001, Japan looked a bit like the U.S. does now. The bubble that burst in the 1990s was followed by years of slow, stumbling recovery. Desperate economists around the world -- including, notably, Ben Bernanke -- were pleading with the Bank of Japan to drop its cautious policies in favor of creating money and spending it. Finally, the bank did just that. Soon after, the bold risk-taking led to a recovery. Or it didn't. Many critics have countered that the economy was already recovering on its own, and that, if anything, the Bank of Japan's last-ditch efforts had little effect.
No matter when the unemployment rate drops to 6 percent, or annual growth returns to above 3 percent, it's going to be hard to know definitively whether quantitative easing ever sparked a family to buy a new house. I was thinking about this when New York City banned the sale of large sodas. Over the next few years, it's quite possible that the city's obesity rates will indeed drop. And it's also possible that the soda ban will play a role -- either directly by taking soda out of our hands or indirectly by reminding us that obesity is a serious problem. It's also possible that New Yorkers are losing weight for any number of other reasons too. After all, the ban is a result of lots of hand-wringing about overweight Americans. Maybe obesity was already subsiding. It's just too hard to say.
Public-health experts have tried for years to persuade us to exercise and eat right, and not much works. All the easy, fairly noncontroversial stuff -- nutrition labels, food pyramids -- have long since been tried and failed. All that's left is to ignore the problem or try some weird schemes. That's the position that Ben Bernanke has found himself in, too. He did the easy stuff years ago. He clearly knows that quantitative easing is filled with risks -- financial and political -- but he also feels that playing it safe and not doing anything radical may be the biggest risk of all. And he wants us all of us to feel exactly the same way.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Quantitative easing is very subtle.
2. The Fed wants businesses to invest.
3. And people to spend.
4. But mostly, it needs us all to be a bit more reckless.

HEADLINE: Ricky Roma Rides Again

BYLINE: Interviews by MICKEY RAPKIN

 BODY:
It's no surprise that ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' the 28-year-old Pulitzer winner by David Mamet, is returning to Broadway: what better time to remount a show about ruthless real estate agents off-loading bum property onto suckers as the nation claws its way out of a recession? At the play's center is Ricky Roma -- the salesman's salesman, a shark in a sharkskin suit. There have been three legendary takes on the role: Joe Mantegna, who originated it on Broadway in 1984 (and won a Tony); Al Pacino in the 1992 film (Oscar nomination); and Liev Schreiber, in the 2005 revival (also won a Tony). Next up: Bobby Cannavale, who'll play Roma opposite Pacino in a new Broadway production this fall. (No pressure.) In interviews conducted by phone or e-mail (and edited and condensed), Mickey Rapkin consulted each of them about inhabiting Roma -- and walking in one another's loafers.Joe Mantegna
Original Broadway production, 1984 
You were the first. What did you make of the script and of Roma? My parents never owned a house. I'd always lived in apartments. I'm reading this script -- about leads and all this stuff -- I didn't know what the hell Mamet was even talking about. But, you know, the guy's name is Ricky Roma. My name's Joe Mantegna. He's an Italian-American. He's from Chicago. I certainly knew hustlers. I just had to fill in the blanks. In our rehearsal process, Dave Mamet and our director brought in these salesmen. There was this very unassuming woman -- a brush lady. She asked us to try to let her sell us a hairbrush. And she was unbelievable. She hit your hot button. She made you feel comfortable. This woman is making 45 cents off each brush. But she made it feel like she was doing you a favor if you buy the brush.
What was your inspiration? Is Roma a bad guy or a product of his time? There's nothing sleazy about Ricky Roma. That used to kill me when I'd read that. You want to buy this land. You just don't know you want to buy it until I spell it out for you. You're fulfilling your dreams. I'm making a sale. Everybody wins. At night, I would dress in my costume like I was a matador putting on my suit of lights. This was 1984, and I was wearing a $2,500 Versace suit. And I'm wearing jewelry. I'd go to the tanning parlor and get a tan. When I walked on that stage, my feeling was: I am that matador. And I'm gonna kill every bull that comes into the arena.Al Pacino
Film adaptation, 1992
Had you seen Joe Mantegna in the role? Did that influence your portrayal? The actors Joe Mantegna in ''Glengarry,'' Robert Duvall in ''American Buffalo'' -- all great when I saw them, but fortunately I never thought I'd do those roles. I just enjoyed them at the time I saw them. Part of what I did when I played those roles was more than likely influenced by what I saw them do, sort of like a model that you paint from memory. When I saw Paul Muni in ''Scarface,'' all I wanted to do is imitate him if I could, that's how inspired I was by him. But if you see the two performances, they are so vastly different you couldn't possibly compare them.
Does playing an iconic role like that present its own challenges?I like the idea that you're doing something that's been done before. By having seen a performance of it -- it's almost like playing a character who really exists. It gives the actual part itself a kind of credibility and gives you a model. So many actors in companies throughout the world play minor roles like spear carriers in the Shakespeare plays; later on in their life, they play the main part in that very play. How could they have not been affected by that process? The secret is to make it personal to you, to give it your signature by your interpretation, which for the most part hopefully comes through your unconscious. In other words, it all works if you love the part.Liev Schreiber
Broadway revival, 2005
Had you always wanted to play this role? I thought it was a very poor casting choice. His name was Roma. He's supposed to be Italian. And here was this giant Ukrainian?
Had you seen it performed before? I'd seen Joe [Mantegna] do it. My father took me. I was 16 or 17. It was one of the first shows I ever went to where I thought: This is a legitimate job. I was a huge admirer. When a good artist does something, it stays with you on a subconscious level.
How do you find the character? Where do you start? It was the language. David's gonna love this, but it's like Shakespeare. With the great writers, the language defines the character. Mamet, Shakespeare, Pinter -- it's impossible to read a Mamet play and not see the character.
So who is Ricky Roma to you? On opening night, someone gave me a set of steak knives with a card that read, ''Kill them all!'' I thought that pretty much summed it up.Bobby Cannavale
Broadway revival, 2012
You're acting opposite Pacino, who played the role on-screen. Is that intimidating? I'm not looking at it that way. Everybody else can do that if they want. That guy is a beast onstage. He's not Al Pacino. He's the character he's supposed to be -- every time.
Had you always wanted to do this role? It seems like a natural fit. It was Al's idea. They sat me next to him at the Tonys. I was nominated for '' -- -- -- -- -- -- With the Hat.'' I introduced myself and said, ''Mr. Pacino, it would mean everything in the world to me if you could please come see our play.'' He said, ''I'm gonna see that, I promise you.'' And he came to the last show! A couple months later I got a phone call from my agent saying, ''Al wants to do 'Glengarry Glen Ross,' and he wants you to think about playing Roma.'' So, yeah. That's a great way to get asked to do a play, for sure.
Have you ever tried to sell someone something they didn't want? Yeah. I managed a tuxedo shop when I was 18 years old. At the Broward Mall in Florida. I used to dress in a different tuxedo every day. One day, I'd be in a full white tailcoat. My friends would get a kick out of it. But it worked. The manager is wearing the clothes? It must be good.
Where does your inspiration for Roma come from? I'm assuming you've seen the film. Every actor, or anybody who wanted to be an actor in 1992, went and saw that movie. I bought the VHS and the DVD. These are desperate guys and desperate times, and the language is so desperate and so competitive. I read the play every day. That's my process. Delving into the words -- I get off on that. And that's where I get my inspiration from. There's a line in the play that says, ''I gotta eat.'' For me, that's the whole play. ''I gotta eat.''

Having taught at four universities in the past 35 years, I believe that UVA's business-based board is characteristic of those at most other, particularly private, colleges and universities. This orientation confuses the objectives of businesses and those of educational institutions. Businesses are obligated to return a monetary profit to their shareholders, while colleges are obligated to search for truth. Obviously it takes financial support to search for truth, but the desire for profit should not be the overriding objective of universities or their boards.
DAN CALDWELL, Distinguished Professor of Political Science, Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif. 
As a Charlottesville resident, a UVA alum and a community-college educator, I know it wasn't just faculty members who were outraged by Teresa Sullivan's ouster -- it was the entire university community. A decision of such enormity involving so many stakeholders should never be made via private phone calls. Sullivan has handled this with grace and humility. I have much more faith in her ability to lead UVA through a crisis than in Helen Dragas and other corporate execs, many of whom inherited, rather than earned, their success. For the good of the university, Dragas needs to resign.
JENNIFER KOSTER, Charlottesville, Va., posted on nytimes.com
The article raises two important issues about the future of higher education: whether the college business model is sustainable over the long term and what roles the faculty and the board should play in governance. But you would hope those issues would be resolved through the lens of student outcomes. Just because UVA's students are successful today doesn't mean they always will be or that the university can't do even better. How will new institutional models and leadership improve student learning? How will they lead to stronger outcomes once students enter graduate programs and the job market? And how will they serve the community and the state, including the growing number of low-income and Latino students in Virginia?

The Tuition Jackpot
My wife and I were eating dinner with our 2-year-old son when the Kalamazoo Promise scholarship was announced on the local news. We just looked across the table at each other dumbfounded. I know firsthand what it was like to work as many as three dismal jobs while taking a full-time classload. Our son is a fourth grader now. Having the Promise for him is priceless. He knows exactly what it means, because we talk about college all the time, as if it is mandatory rather than an option. Bless those who made this possible. It is making a difference. This is a great city full of great people.
DAVE BURNHAM, Kalamazoo, Mich.,posted on nytimes.com
This is not a new experiment. The small lumber town Philomath, Ore., has had a similar foundation for many years, funded by a lumber-company owner, that provides four-year scholarships to every graduate of Philomath High School. The program did seem to help the local economy, but it was no bulwark against the general decline of the timber industry. Younger families began to move in, bringing more liberal ideas and a general distaste for the timber industry. The clash between old and new residents resulted in the foundation's restricting scholarships to graduates whose families have lived there for two or more generations, who are connected to timber, mining or agriculture and who are studying one of those areas. Free college might look like a way to broaden opportunities for children in an economically depressed area, but, it can also be used to entrench the values of those handing out the money.
DON ROGERSON, Red Oak, Iowa, posted on nytimes.com
I was a recipient of this scholarship when it was in its infancy. Neither of my parents worked, so there wasn't much of a plan for me to go to college; I've now graduated with an engineering degree and work happily in the auto industry in Michigan. This scholarship will change lives and provide so many amazing opportunities for its recipients for many years to come. I'll be forever thankful for it.

HEADLINE: John Sununu's a Teddy Bear

BYLINE: Interview by ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
You recently described the vaguely Southern accent the president uses in speeches as ''phony as his jaunt when he runs up and down Marine One.'' What exactly is a phony jaunt? Every time you see him climbing up or down stairs, he elevates his arms and does this pumping, trying to look like a well-trained and trim dynamic individual. It's something he does all the time, particularly when he's climbing up to a podium to speak or address a crowd. This president understands that he got elected on the basis of style and not substance, and I think he's trying to preserve style.
Every time I see you on TV for Romney, I think back to 1988 when, as governor, you helped George H. W. Bush win the New Hampshire primary and then became his first chief of staff. Should Romney win this thing, what do you want to do? Retire, play golf and ski. Really and truly. I'm 73 years old, I got into this because I was scared to death for my kids and my grandkids and I want to get Mitt Romney elected president so he can fix America. 
What if President-elect Romney calls you and says, ''I know that you know a great deal about nuclear energy, and I'd love for you to be secretary of energy.'' I'd say, thank you, Mr. President. I got you this far, don't blow it. I'm going to play golf.
During the Democratic convention, did you feel as if there was a lot of football spiking over Osama bin Laden? The president is trying to take credit for following the strategy and the tactics put into place by George W. Bush. At some point the president is going to have to explain why he was timid on the first two or three opportunities that we had. Thank goodness Hillary Clinton was there was to convince him to do the right thing.
You seem to be referring to Richard Miniter's book that claimed the president skipped three earlier opportunities to kill Bin Laden. The White House called those claims ''an utter fabrication.'' The gripe should be with the author. Based on the description in that book, this has some validity.
So the complaint is that the president didn't kill Bin Laden fast enough? His trying to take credit for having been decisive belies the fact that he wasn't decisive until pressed by others.
Didn't Biden and Robert Gates advise against the mission? I have no idea what happened in that White House. I do find it unseemly to see the intelligence leaks coming out of there trying to boost this president's image.
You resigned from Bush's cabinet before his 1992 re-election campaign. Do you think the result would have been different had you been around? People have said it, but we'll never know. Ross Perot cost President Bush his re-election. I would have urged the campaign to be tougher on Perot from the beginning. But I don't say it, others do.
Like who? People while they're sipping their second wine, and I'm sipping my second Diet Coke, reminisce and are kind enough to make that point.
You called the Obama administration ''losers who have run this country into the ground'' because it ''failed so miserably'' creating jobs. George H. W. Bush ran for re-election with a 7.4 percent unemployment rate, while Obama has 8.1 coming out of a much deeper recession. Aren't they pretty much equivalent? This one is 8.1, but if you included all the people who have lost hope and stopped looking for work, it would be around 11 percent. George Bush may have had a peak in unemployment on Election Day, but the period of the slowdown that he was dealing with was shorter.
I am a little disappointed that you haven't jumped down my throat. Part of me was hoping this would devolve into the cable-news-style screaming I've seen you have with Lawrence O'Donnell and Soledad O'Brien. I only jump down people's throats when they come across as merely reading the talking points that were sent out by the White House the day before. They assume that I can't read the same blogs they read. I'm really warm and gentle and kind.

HEADLINE: Battered and Beautiful: His Bronx

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
AFTERNOON sunlight splashed down into the main reading room of the Bronx Community College's new library, where nearly every desk was occupied, the enthusiasm of the semester still as fresh as the paint.
Most students were too busy to look up at the 20 friezes on the third-floor balcony in the recently opened North Hall and Library, at least until Daniel Hauben started talking about Yankee Stadium, depicted in the panel above him. Under a cloud-streaked sky, the old and new ballparks stood side by side during construction and before demolition -- a rare moment revealing the vivid layers of Bronx history.
''Are you the architect?'' asked a student, Alondra Felipe, 25, who overheard Mr. Hauben from her study table.
''No, I'm the painter,'' Mr. Hauben replied, black hat in hand, gold earring in left ear, gray goatee neatly trimmed. 
''It's so awesome,'' Ms. Felipe said, gazing around the library. ''It makes you feel like you're in a good school.''
Ms. Felipe's friend Danel Salicrup, 24, said the paintings depicting familiar Bronx scenes were what he noticed first. ''They bring life here,'' he said.
This has always been Mr. Hauben's aim as a native son and artist of an oft-maligned borough. ''It's not Giverny -- it's the Bronx,'' he said. ''But still, there's beauty in the world.''
A familiar figure with his easel in the borough's streets, Mr. Hauben, 56, has spent his career illuminating the surrounding lush landscapes and working people, infusing them with a touch of whimsy.
He is, in deference to his favorite painter, a kind of ''Bruegel of the Bronx.''
The design committee from Bronx Community College selected Mr. Hauben in 2008 because its members saw how his scenes would enrich the new $80 million library by Robert A. M. Stern Architects.
The building opened last month on the campus, perched on a hill, replacing the dingy 1960s basement space with a double-vaulted ceiling, classical columns, soft colors and intricate details highlighted by Mr. Hauben's 22 oil paintings.
The panels, 16 inches high and 48 inches wide, feature Bronx views from different heights: rooftops at dusk, mango sellers under the elevated tracks, students strolling on campus. The two larger paintings in the library's entrance stairwells offer sprawling views of the Harlem River. Mr. Hauben saturates his paintings with color: Wedgewood blues, hazels and walnuts that purposely match the library.
''There was a warmth that emanated from his work,'' said David A. Taylor, the college's dean of administration and finance, who sat on the selection committee. ''The way he captured the landscapes and the people, it was vibrant and it spoke to us -- more so than if we went with an abstract artist.''
Still, said Mr. Taylor, an amateur photographer, Mr. Hauben's paintings are not strictly realistic. His store signs have generic names or made-up words. He placed people into paintings and played with the balance of foreground and background. ''It's always his interpretive feel of what something looks like,'' Mr. Taylor said.
This commission, the most visible showing of Mr. Hauben's work, has made him reflect on his role as an artist in permanent residence.
''Art, it's not a separate thing; it's part of your life; it is your life,'' he said. ''To be at least acknowledged or have as much of a presence in the community as a plumber or a bus driver after 20-some-odd years I painted in the Bronx, I didn't think that would ever be possible.''
In October, the college will have an exhibition of Mr. Hauben's work from the commission, ''A Sense of Place.''
He has been trying to create that feeling since he was 10 years old in his bedroom in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, in the same apartment where he lives now. He and his friend David Schwartz spent six years designing an elaborate model of Utopia, with concrete buildings, running water and futuristic design. Calling it Edge City, Mr. Hauben arranged the shapes and the colors while his friend made the concrete and paint. ''It was a grand collaboration of science and art and sociology and economics,'' his friend, now Professor Schwartz, said in a phone interview.
''We would have lively debates over which is better, science or art,'' said Professor Schwartz, the director of the Laboratory for Molecular and Computational Genomics at the University of Wisconsin. ''Looking back on it, we were just two weird kids.''
In recent e-mails, the two friends have talked about how Edge City influenced their careers. ''What I'm most interested in is creating a world that invites you into it, that reflects the world in some ways, but then creates its own logic,'' Mr. Hauben said.
He admitted that at times during the commission he felt constrained by outside logic. Working with a large public institution and more than a dozen entities involved in construction raised the age-old conflict between art and commerce, between patronage and independence. Mr. Hauben said he felt as if he had lost his ''connection to the inspiration'' while arranging bureaucratic details like insurance and installation.
Still, he said, he was thrilled with the $219,000 from the college, and the exposure, especially now as the arts are gaining momentum in the Bronx.
Until the library, he had enjoyed a ''very alternative'' career, with solo shows in medium-size galleries and museums in this country and in Germany. ''The El,'' which hangs in the Freeman Street subway stop in the Bronx, was made with fabricated stained glass and was named one of the country's 45 best public arts commissions in 2008 by Americans for the Arts, an advocacy group.
Mr. Hauben painted a mural, which still remains in the entrance hall to his apartment building, in exchange for a painting studio there in 1990. (He has since moved his studio to Riverdale.) He lives with his wife, Judy Lane, a librettist he met at an artists' colony 21 years ago. They have two cats: a 19-year-old white one named Canvas (seen in two panels) and Bindi, a 4-year-old brown-flecked companion.
Their compact three-bedroom apartment is itself a gallery, with his art hanging on walls painted in rich reds, blues and apricots. Mr. Hauben's latest work, scenes from the ninth-floor terrace overlooking Riverdale, sits in the living room.
''If he doesn't paint, he gets grumpy,'' Ms. Lane said, laughing. ''On our honeymoon in India, he brought pastels and his easel. Our luggage got lost but the easel didn't. If something had to be lost, better the clothes.''
As always, Mr. Hauben returns to the Bronx, intrigued by its textures. ''You have the Art Deco period, the burnt-out period, the rural kind of story, and then you have, superimposed, the culture of the people, Caribbean, people playing dominoes on the street; it is surreal,'' Mr. Hauben said. ''Then throw them together in this haphazard environment, the first reaction is, it's an eyesore.''
But Mr. Hauben tries to unearth beauty from urban chaos, and make those who view his art more aware of their environment.
''To me, they feel like little windows; they're like little worlds,'' he said, talking exuberantly of his panels in the library. Until a student ''ssshed'' him.
''It's a library,'' Mr. Hauben said, remembering his own world. ''Not a gallery.''

HEADLINE: Romney Shifted Right on Energy As Presidential Politics Beckoned

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney, true to his roots as the son of an auto executive, was talking about cars.
It was May 2006. Mr. Romney, the Massachusetts governor, was chatting up his Montana counterpart about his vision for an energy-efficient car of the future -- lightweight and narrow, with tandem-style seating, so that two vehicles could drive side by side in one highway lane.
''He was getting animated about all these little cars that would be driving around in these lanes,'' Brian Schweitzer, the Montana governor, recalled in an interview. Mr. Schweitzer, a Democrat, laughed, thinking about how Republicans might react. ''I said, 'Mitt, if you ever run for president, don't ever talk about that again.' ''
Today, as the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Romney is far more apt to talk about oil drilling than energy-efficient cars. He has presented a plan to open up more land and coastline to oil and gas drilling, grant speedy approval to the Keystone pipeline to transport crude oil from Canada to the United States, end wind and solar power subsidies and curb regulations that discourage burning coal for electricity. It is an agenda far different from the one he outlined in his early days as governor. 
He populated his Massachusetts administration with environmentalists, including one, Gina McCarthy, who now runs the clean air division of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama. He railed against the ''Filthy Five,'' high-polluting power plants in the state. He issued a ''climate protection plan'' and lauded it as ''among the strongest in our nation.'' Under his direction, Massachusetts helped create a regional cap-and-trade program -- anathema to most Republicans -- intended to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists believe cause global warming.
But at the last minute, Mr. Romney refused to sign the greenhouse gas pact that his aides had spent more than two years negotiating; industry opposed it, and some former Romney policy advisers say his political team feared that it would doom his chances for the presidency. A current campaign policy adviser, Oren Cass, said Mr. Romney simply evaluated the proposal and ''concluded the costs imposed on the economy would be too high.''
Today in Massachusetts, environmentalists credit Mr. Romney with helping to promote smart growth and reducing air pollution by putting in place tough regulations curbing certain toxic emissions from power plants. They also praise him for signing into law a bill embracing oil spill prevention measures. But many feel betrayed by his surprise reversal on the climate change pact.
''He was ahead of his time and very progressive,'' said Jack Clarke, who was appointed to an ocean management task force by Mr. Romney and now directs public policy at Mass Audubon, a conservation group. ''But by the end of his administration, he seemed to have gotten Potomac fever. The conservation agenda he had didn't seem to be a core conviction.''
A Policy Develops
Mr. Romney got an up-close lesson in conservation growing up in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where his father, George, ran the American Motors Corporation. The car company, which like its competitors marketed big, gas-hungry cars, was struggling. George Romney turned the company around by marketing the Rambler -- a boxy, no-frills but fuel-efficient vehicle. Time Magazine put him on its cover.
''One of the most anticipated announcements at our house every year was the winner of the Mobil Economy Run, and Rambler often won because it achieved 30 miles a gallon or more -- not bad even by today's standards,'' Mr. Romney wrote in his book, ''No Apology.'' ''Dad called his competitors' cars 'gas guzzling dinosaurs,' a term that he helped make popular.''
Decades later, when he was governor, Mr. Romney remarked to an adviser, Rob Gray, that ''we'd be a lot better off in this country if we had European gas prices'' because Americans would buy more energy-efficient cars. He also invited Amory B. Lovins, the head of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit research organization devoted to energy efficiency, to meet with him in Boston. While Mr. Lovins ''shared his vision of a 75 m.p.g. hybrid automobile built with high strength steel and composites,'' Mr. Romney wrote, ''I shared my own dream for a super-efficient commuter vehicle.''
When Mr. Romney ran for governor in 2002, he fashioned himself ''in the tradition of New England Yankee Republicans,'' Mr. Clarke said -- a tradition in which ''the environment is a nonpartisan issue.''
He was animated by ideas like smart growth and sustainable development, former aides say. He wanted high-density housing clustered near public transportation, pedestrian-friendly urban areas and parks. To carry out his vision, he created an Office for Commonwealth Development, headed by an über-secretary who would integrate policy in housing, transportation, energy and the environment.
The man Mr. Romney installed in that job was Doug Foy, who had spent 25 years at the helm of the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group that had sued Massachusetts numerous times on matters ranging from air pollution to cleaning up Boston Harbor. Mr. Foy says he found Mr. Romney ''intellectually struck'' by environmental concerns, though he filtered them through a business-friendly lens.
He would ask, ''Is there a role for government, or do you just let the market rip?'' Mr. Foy recalled.
Mr. Foy's hiring rankled business executives. Environmentalists, though, were thrilled.
''It was like Nixon to China,'' said Ian Bowles, a Democrat who later served as energy secretary to Deval Patrick, the current Massachusetts governor. ''Here was a left-leaning Republican who was going to be able to accomplish things on the environment that Democrats had not been able to do. Here's the C.E.O. of the most powerful environmental group, going to take on a super-secretariat with the governor saying all the right things on greenhouse gases, smart growth and the clean tech industry.''
One of the first issues Mr. Romney and Mr. Foy tackled involved an aging coal plant in Salem that was spewing dirty particulates and was required by state regulations to clean up by 2004. The plant's owner wanted extra time. The governor said no; three weeks into his administration, he denounced the company at a news conference.
''He strongly wanted to clean up the air,'' said Eric Kriss, who founded the private equity firm Bain Capital with Mr. Romney and followed him to the Statehouse to become finance secretary. The governor and his entourage drove to Salem, where Mr. Romney confronted angry pickets -- coal workers who said he was costing them their jobs.
''I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people,'' Mr. Romney thundered. ''And that plant, that plant kills people.''
'No Regrets' Strategy
By the time Mr. Romney took office in January 2003, Massachusetts was already developing a ''climate protection plan'' focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Back then Mr. Romney -- who has said he believes that ''climate change is occurring'' and that ''human activity is a contributing factor,'' though he is not certain how much -- simply avoided the question of the scientific evidence, which prompts skepticism from some conservatives. ''We didn't have a big conversation about the science,'' said Sonia Hamel, who advised Mr. Romney on climate change.
The resulting 53-page document, released in 2004, laid out a blueprint for what Mr. Romney called his ''no regrets'' strategy. It called for, among other things, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 -- a pledge adopted in 2001 by a bipartisan group of New England governors -- and it promoted hybrid cars and ''clean, fuel-efficient vehicles for the state fleet.'' Mr. Romney argued that no matter what people believed about climate change, the measures would be good for the economy.
In New York, another Republican governor, George E. Pataki, wanted to do even more. In the summer of 2003, Mr. Pataki invited Mr. Romney to participate in regional negotiations to develop a cap-and-trade program -- a market-based trading system to regulate emissions from power plants, in which businesses would buy and sell pollution credits -- for states in the Northeast. Mr. Romney said he was open to the idea.
Power companies and other businesses lobbied against the plan, saying it would drive up electricity costs. At a clean energy conference in November 2005, though, Mr. Romney spoke favorably of it. ''This is a great thing for the commonwealth,'' he said, according to The Boston Globe, arguing that the pact would prompt businesses to develop clean and renewable energy technology.
But the following month, after more than two years of intense negotiations among Massachusetts and eight other states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont -- Mr. Romney started getting cold feet. Ms. Hamel, who was leading the negotiations for Massachusetts, said Mr. Romney's chief of staff, Beth Myers, insisted that Mr. Romney would sign on only if the deal included a limit on what power plants would have to pay to emit pollution -- a condition that New York and several other states opposed.
Ms. Myers declined to be interviewed. Ms. Hamel saw Ms. Myers's involvement as a sign that Mr. Romney's political team was concerned about how the plan would affect his presidential ambitions. Franz Litz, the chief negotiator for New York, said he viewed Mr. Romney's new conditions as ''a ruse.''
But Mr. Kriss, the Bain co-founder, said the process simply reflected Mr. Romney's decision-making style.
''I think he just didn't get comfortable at the very end, but he didn't want to stop a creative activity,'' Mr. Kriss said. ''It was like that at Bain Capital. He would let some partner pursue some deal, and at the end he would say, 'I know you worked on this for six months, but we're not going to do it.' ''
The other states eventually went ahead without Massachusetts (and Rhode Island, which also dropped out), and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as ''Reggie,'' became the first market-based regulatory program in the nation focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Massachusetts has since joined under Mr. Patrick, but in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has announced his intention to drop out.
On Dec. 12, 2005, in an interview on national television, Mr. Romney embraced drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- a position that, like his withdrawal from the cap-and-trade negotiations, aligned him more closely with the right wing of his party.
A few days later, the governor informed the people of Massachusetts that he would not be seeking re-election -- a sign, many residents believed, that he had set his sights on the presidency.

HEADLINE: Aiming To Stay Plugged In

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
IN 1948, a radio repairman named Leo Fender took a piece of ash, bolted on a length of maple and attached an electronic transducer.
You know the rest, even if you don't know you know the rest.
You've heard it -- in the guitar riffs of Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, George Harrison, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Bruce Springsteen, Mark Knopfler, Kurt Cobain and on and on.
It's the sound of a Fender electric guitar. Mr. Fender's company, now known as the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, is the world's largest maker of guitars. Its Stratocaster, which made its debut in 1954, is still a top seller. For many, the Strat's cutting tone and sexy, double-cutaway curves mean rock 'n' roll.
But this heart of rock isn't beating quite the way it once did. Like many other American manufacturers, Fender is struggling to hold on to what it's got in a tight economy. Sales and profits are down this year. A Strat, after all, is what economists call a consumer discretionary item -- a nonessential. 
More than macroeconomics, however, is at work here. Fender, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is also being buffeted by powerful forces on Wall Street.
A private investment firm, Weston Presidio, controls nearly half of the company and has been looking for an exit. It pushed to take Fender public in March, to howls in the guitar-o-sphere that Fender was selling out. But, to Fender's embarrassment, investors balked. They were worried about the lofty price and, even more, about how Fender can keep growing.
And that, really, is the crux of the matter. Times have changed, and so has music. In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, electric guitars powered rock and pop. Today, turntable rigs, drum machines and sampler synthesizers drive music like hip-hop. Electric guitars, huge as they are, have lost some of their old magic in this era of Jay-Z, Kanye West and ''The Voice.''
Games like Guitar Hero have helped underpin sales, but teenagers who once might have hankered after guitars now get by making music on laptops. It's worth remembering that the accordion was once the most popular instrument in America.
Granted, Fender is such a powerful brand that it can ride out the lean times. But sales of all kinds of musical instruments plunged during the recession, and they still haven't recovered fully. Sales of all instruments in the United States totaled $6.5 billion last year, down roughly 13 percent from their peak in 2005, according to Music Trades, which tracks the industry.
Many of the guitars that are selling these days are cheap ones made in places like China -- ones that cost a small fraction of, say, a $1,599 Fender Artist ''Eric Clapton'' Strat. Fender has been making its own lines of inexpensive guitars overseas for years, but the question is how the company can keep growing and compete profitably in a fast-moving, global marketplace. Its margins are already under pressure.
''What possible niche is left unexploited by Fender?'' asks Jeffrey Bronchick, founder of Cove Street Capital, an investment advisory firm in El Segundo, Calif., and the owner of some 40 guitars, including four Fenders.
Another big player on the American music scene, Guitar Center, has already had financial strains. Like Fender, Guitar Center, the world's largest chain of instrument retailers, is also involved with private equity. It's controlled by Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's old firm.
Analysts say Guitar Center is crucial to Fender, accounting for roughly a sixth of Fender's sales -- and the ties between the two run deep. Fender's chief executive, Larry Thomas, used to be the chief of Guitar Center. He sold the company to Bain at the top of the market in 2007 for $2.1 billion, including debt.
Guitar Center has been losing money since. Moody's issued a junk rating of B2 on Guitar Center's debt in October 2007, and has since downgraded the company two more times, most recently in November 2010, to Caa1.
THE change in American music is evident on West 48th Street -- the ''Music Row'' of Manhattan. The block just east of Times Square was once home to dozens of music stores, practice studios and instrument repair shops. It was the place to go to buy a Fender in New York.
Now Music Row is being hollowed out by high rents and competition on the Web. Even Sam Ash, which has been there since the 1920s, is moving to West 34th Street.
Fender, too, has had to contend with changing tastes and markets. Once it looked like the Pan Am of guitars, a storied name that might simply vanish. Leo Fender sold his company to CBS for $13 million in 1965, but Fender struggled in the ensuing years to maintain its identity inside a big corporation. Analysts said that Fender, under pressure to meet quarterly earnings numbers, made a series of cost cuts that caused quality to suffer and sales to nosedive.
Yamaha of Japan, meanwhile, began grabbing market share with inexpensive, high-quality guitars. In 1980, the problems came to a head when Fender posted a $10 million loss on only $40 million in sales.
''In 1970, nobody wanted a Yamaha musical instrument, but by 1980 they were beginning to dominate, along with many other Japanese companies,'' says Bill Mendello, the former chief of Fender and today a member of its board. ''And they were, frankly, better made and a lot cheaper than U.S. manufacturing.''
In the 1980s, Mr. Mendello, then a top executive in CBS's musical instruments division, and Bill Shultz, then president of Fender, developed a plan to save Fender. To make it happen, they had to take on William S. Paley, the feared head of CBS. Their plan called for CBS to invest heavily -- about $50 million over five years -- in Fender and to revamp marketing. Mr. Paley signed off.
But three years into the plan, Mr. Paley was out and new management decided to sell the music division. With Fender losing money, there were few buyers. CBS considered liquidating the company. Instead, Mr. Schultz and Mr. Mendello engineered a $12.5 million leveraged buyout. Before long, Fender was back in the black.
Fender gradually clawed its way back up in the '80s and '90s, beefing up quality, training and oversight, and, for the first time, starting to manufacture guitars internationally, especially in Japan and South Korea. Restoring quality was crucial, Mr. Mendello says. Artists like Mr. Clapton, who had modified his Strat ''Blackie,'' were impressed with Fender's craftsmanship. Leo Fender died in 1991 at the age of 82; in 2001, Weston swooped in, buying a 43 percent stake of Fender for $58 million.
Mr. Mendello says the recent recession was tougher on Fender than past downturns.
''Fender and the whole music industry got hit pretty hard,'' he says. ''People were afraid to buy anything or do anything. They didn't know if they'd have a job.''
Many in the industry praise Fender for branching out into other areas, including making and selling steel-string acoustic guitars and cutting deals with various other brands like Gretsch guitars and drums and Sabian cymbals. But one of the biggest competitors for new Fender guitars is old Fender guitars. Many players believe -- rightly or wrongly -- that the Fenders of the 1950s, the '60s and even the '70s, when analysts say quality suffered, have a special something. A vintage Fender won't make a novice sound like a Hendrix. But many pros say that at their level, the equipment matters. Prices of vintage Fenders have soared accordingly.
Rick Barrio Dill, the bassist for the soul and rock band Vintage Trouble, was frantic when his customized Fender Reissue Precision bass guitar was stolen while his group was touring with the Cranberries last May. Playing another brand was out of the question.
''It put a feeling in my stomach like someone had just died -- I was a complete wreck,'' Mr. Dill remembers.
He alerted his fans via Twitter, and before long the story reached the Gibson Guitar Corporation, Fender's big competitor, which offered a replacement. Mr. Dill turned it down. Then Fender made a similar offer -- and Mr. Dill pounced.
''I kind of bleed Fender,'' he says.
He, too, is chasing vintage Fenders. He bought a 1969 Tobacco Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass in 1999 for $1,200 and sold it four years later for $2,500. ''I'm trying to buy the exact bass now, and it's selling for $6,500 or $7,000,'' he says.
DUFF McKAGAN, the former bassist for Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, grew up listening to Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and the Clash. He used to drop by the Guitar Center branch on Hollywood's Sunset Strip, when that company was independent, and dream about buying a Fender bass.
''I'm sure they got sick and tired of me coming in,'' Mr. McKagan says. He still plays the 1985 Fender Jazz Special he bought after Guns N' Roses landed its first record deal.
He can attest to the durability of Fenders. Once he tried to imitate Paul Simonon of the Clash by smashing his bass at the end of a show.
''I took a full swing and brought it down on this metal grate stage -- and nothing happened,'' Mr. McKagan recalls. After 20 or so tries, one shard of wood came loose. ''That was enough for me,'' he says, adding that he never tried to smash a Fender again.
Such testimonials aside, the question is where Fender will go from here. It has been hurt by the economic slump in Europe, a region that accounts for 27 percent of net sales, and the situation there could hang over Fender for years.
The company has also been criticized by Wall Street analysts for acquiring the Kaman Music Corporation, a distributor of musical instruments and accessories, in 2008 for $117 million. The company, which it renamed KMC Music, is a low-margin business and has squeezed Fender's overall profit margins.
Fender filed to go public in an initial stock offering in March, in a deal that would have valued the company at as much as $396 million. That is a pittance by Facebook standards. But the price was high for a company of Fender's size.
Bankers and investors scoffed. Fender, they said, was trying to go public as a ''growth'' company when its sales were declining.
''It made no sense,'' says Arnold Ursaner, president of CJS Securities in White Plains.
The talk on Wall Street was that Weston Presidio was pushing to sell at a high price. Weston executives declined to comment.
''They saw a window and said let's try to hit it and maybe no one will pay attention to the negative sales trends,'' Mr. Ursaner says. ''It was banking at its worst.''
In documents filed in connection with the proposed initial public offering, Fender outlined avenues that it contended would bolster growth, such as sales to emerging markets like China and India, the addition of more licensing and co-branding deals, and strategic acquisitions.
Mr. Bronchick, the analyst, speculates that investment bankers didn't wanted to take the offer at such a high valuation.
''Nobody wants to be embarrassed like Facebook,'' he says.
AT Fender, Mr. Mendello doesn't rule out a future public offering. Fender might try again sooner rather than later, because about $237 million of its $246 million in long-term debt will be due in 2014.
Mr. Mendello, who owns 4.8 percent of Fender, says he isn't looking to cash out personally. Neither are the company's other shareholders, he says.
''I love Fender -- it's the greatest company in the world,'' he says. ''We're here for the long-term, and we're going to do what's right for Fender.''

HEADLINE: Publisher Who Transformed The Times for New Era

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who guided The New York Times and its parent company through a long, sometimes turbulent period of expansion and change on a scale not seen since the newspaper's founding in 1851, died early Saturday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. He was 86.
His death, after a long illness, was announced by his family.
Mr. Sulzberger's tenure, as publisher of the newspaper and as chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company, reached across 34 years, from the heyday of postwar America to the twilight of the 20th century, from the era of hot lead and Linotype machines to the birth of the digital world.
The paper he took over as publisher in 1963 was the paper it had been for decades: respected and influential, often setting the national agenda. But it was also in precarious financial condition and somewhat insular, having been a tightly held family operation since 1896, when it was bought by his grandfather Adolph S. Ochs. 
By the 1990s, when Mr. Sulzberger passed the reins to his son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., first as publisher in 1992 and then as chairman in 1997, the enterprise had been transformed. The Times was now national in scope, distributed from coast to coast, and it had become the heart of a diversified, multibillion-dollar media operation that came to encompass newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations and online ventures.
The expansion reflected Mr. Sulzberger's belief that a news organization, above all, had to be profitable if it hoped to maintain a vibrant, independent voice. As John F. Akers, a retired chairman of I.B.M. and for many years a Times Company board member, put it, ''Making money so that you could continue to do good journalism was always a fundamental part of the thinking.''
On Saturday, President Obama praised Mr. Sulzberger as ''a firm believer in the importance of a free and independent press, one that isn't afraid to seek the truth, hold those in power accountable and tell the stories that need to be told.''
Mr. Sulzberger's insistence on independence was shown in his decision in 1971 to publish a secret government history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. It was a defining moment for him and, in the view of many journalists and historians, his finest.
In thousands of pages, this highly classified archive detailed Washington's legacy of deceit and evasion as it stumbled through an unpopular war. When the Pentagon Papers were divulged in a series of articles in June 1971, an embarrassed Nixon administration demanded that the series be stopped immediately, citing national security considerations. The Times refused, on First Amendment grounds, and won its case in the United States Supreme Court in a landmark ruling on press freedom.
Mr. Sulzberger reshaped The Times. In the mid-1970s, another financially difficult period in which he might have chosen to retrench, he expanded the paper to four sections from two, creating separate sections for metropolitan and business news and introducing new ones oriented toward consumers.
They were a gamble, begun in the hope of attracting new readers, especially women, and advertisers.
Some critics dismissed the feature sections as unworthy of a serious newspaper. But the sections -- SportsMonday, Science Times, Living, Home and Weekend -- were an instant success, without compromising the paper's hard-news core. They were widely imitated.
Over the next two decades, a billion-dollar investment in new printing facilities made still more innovations possible, among them a national edition, special regional editions and the daily use of color photos and graphics.
''Adolph Ochs is remembered as the one who founded this great enterprise,'' Richard L. Gelb, a longtime member of the Times board, said in 1997, when Mr. Sulzberger stepped down as chairman. ''Arthur Ochs Sulzberger will be remembered as the one who secured it, renewed it and lifted it to ever-higher levels of achievement.''
Even while the enterprise was put on a secure financial footing, ultimate control never passed from the Sulzberger family. It managed to avoid the internal strife and jealousies that tore apart other newspaper dynasties and traumatized their companies.
At Mr. Sulzberger's death, The Times was being run by a fourth generation of his family, a rarity in an age when the management of most American newspapers is determined by distant corporate boards. A family trust, unaffected by his death, guarantees continued control by Adolph Ochs's descendants.
It was no coincidence, Mr. Sulzberger believed, that some of the country's finest newspapers were family-owned. ''My conclusion is simple,'' he once said with characteristic humor. ''Nepotism works.''
Pentagon Papers Champion
A newspaper publisher may be a business executive, but the head of an institution like The Times is also inevitably cast as a leader in legal defenses of the First Amendment. It was a role Mr. Sulzberger embraced, never with more enduring results than in his decision to publish the Pentagon Papers.
''This was not a breach of the national security,'' Mr. Sulzberger said at the time. ''We gave away no national secrets. We didn't jeopardize any American soldiers or Marines overseas.'' Of the government, he added, ''It's a wonderful way if you've got egg on your face to prevent anybody from knowing it, stamp it secret and put it away.''
The government obtained a temporary restraining order from a federal judge in Manhattan. It was the first time in United States history that a court, on national security grounds, had stopped a newspaper in advance from publishing a specific article. The Washington Post soon began running its own articles based on the same documents, and both papers took their case to the Supreme Court. In late June, the court issued its decision rejecting the administration's national-security arguments and upholding a newspaper's right to publish in the face of efforts to impose ''prior restraint.''
The significance of that ruling for the future of government-press relations has been debated, but this much was certain: It established the primacy of a free press in the face of a government's insistence on secrecy. In the 40 years since the court handed down its ruling, there has not been another instance of officially sanctioned prior restraint to keep an American newspaper from printing secret information on national security grounds.
In a 1996 speech to a group of journalists, Mr. Sulzberger said of the documents that he ''had no doubt but that the American people had a right to read them and that we at The Times had an obligation to publish them.'' But typically -- he had an unpretentious manner and could not resist a good joke or, for that matter, a bad pun -- he tried to keep even a matter this weighty from becoming too ponderous.
The fact is, Mr. Sulzberger said, the documents were tough sledding. ''Until I read the Pentagon Papers,'' he said, ''I did not know that it was possible to read and sleep at the same time.''
Nor did he understand why President Richard M. Nixon had fought so hard ''to squelch these papers,'' he added.
''I would have thought that he would bemoan their publication, joyfully blame the mess on Lyndon Johnson and move on to Watergate,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. ''But then I never understood Washington.''
He did, however, understand the stakes in publishing the Pentagon Papers, he said in 1998. He was risking heavy fines and a sullied reputation for the newspaper, and perhaps even jail for him and his top editors. No editor could solely make a decision of that magnitude, Mr. Sulzberger said. The buck stopped with the publisher.
An Adjudicator, Not an Editor
But more commonly, indeed nearly all the time, Mr. Sulzberger left the task of putting out The Times to the people hired for the job: the managers on the business side and the editors in the newsroom.
''His confidence in the people he chose to trust was almost total,'' said Max Frankel, one of five executive editors during Mr. Sulzberger's time as chairman. ''He did not want to edit the paper, plain and simple. He was there to adjudicate disputes and to set standards and values.''
Most afternoons he attended the meeting at which the editors determined what would be on the next day's front page. But he was there mainly to keep himself informed, not to join the discussion. He generally kept his hands off the editorial page, too. Except perhaps for the most hotly disputed issues and political endorsements, he often did not learn of the page's opinions until the paper was delivered to his Manhattan home, an apartment on Fifth Avenue.
There were, to be sure, departures from this self-imposed restraint.
A notable one came in 1976, when Mr. Sulzberger insisted that The Times endorse Daniel Patrick Moynihan over Bella S. Abzug in the New York Democratic primary election for United States senator. This brought strong objections from John B. Oakes, who was editor of the editorial page and the publisher's first cousin once removed. Mr. Oakes received permission to register his disapproval in a most unusual fashion. He wrote a 40-word letter to the editor -- in effect, a letter to himself.
Long after his retirement, the episode continued to rankle Mr. Oakes. But he acknowledged that such intervention from the 14th floor -- where the publisher had his office in the Times building on West 43rd Street -- was rare.
Mr. Sulzberger did not always appreciate the content or the tenor of the editorial page. He thought it was anti-business, especially in the 1960s and '70s. ''If you were a corporation, you were wrong, whatever you were doing,'' he said. But he almost never imposed his views. Though he did nudge Mr. Oakes into retirement a year or two early, Mr. Oakes said, ''I literally can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times that I had to go to bat for an editorial.'' Mr. Oakes died in 2001.
When Mr. Sulzberger wanted to exercise his prerogative and make his likes and dislikes known, he usually did so through interoffice memorandums, signing them with the nickname he had carried since childhood, Punch.
The topics might be of national importance, like the structure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military being a subject he cared about as a former Marine who had served in World War II and the Korean War. When he felt the boundaries of good taste had been crossed, he let the editors know it. But the notes could also be about mundane matters. In one, in 1976, he complained to A. M. Rosenthal, the executive editor, about a published recipe for cooked eel.
''Why can't our food pages have something on them that most people like?'' Mr. Sulzberger asked.
Sincerely, A. Sock
Quality-of-life issues in New York were dear to him. He never pretended to have a solution for America's balance-of-payments problems, but he had ideas about crime and grime in his hometown. In 1989, they led to a series of editorials that ran under the rubric ''New Calcutta.''
Once in a while he wrote brief letters to the editor using the name A. Sock, a wordplay on Punch. Mr. Sock was always as pleased as punch with puns. ''The nationalist Chinese seem extremely apprehensive when Mr. Nixon drinks with Premier Chou,'' he wrote in 1972. ''Are they scared he'll Taiwan on?''
One A. Sock letter, an unflattering take in 1979 on the National Organization for Women, brought a sharp rebuttal letter. ''Mr. Sock deserves a punch,'' it concluded. It was signed Gail Gregg, the publisher's daughter-in-law at the time. Convinced his cover was blown, Mr. Sulzberger wrote almost no A. Sock letters again.
His suggestions to editors and his criticisms tended to be delivered in a velvet glove, not with a mailed fist. ''He didn't have to be obeyed; he just wanted to be heard,'' said Jack Rosenthal, a former editor of the editorial page. Arthur Gelb, a former managing editor, put it this way:
''He never said forcefully, 'This is what I believe and this is what I want.' It was always mild and often with a little humor. He listened to what others had to say. Some people saw that as weakness. But it was the nature of a true gentleman.''
Mr. Sulzberger involved himself far less with the content of the news columns than with the large business decisions that had to be made. It had been that way from the moment he was named publisher, on June 20, 1963, succeeding his brother-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, who had died of heart trouble a month earlier at age 50.
The line of Times publishers, from Adolph Ochs in 1896 to Arthur Sulzberger Jr. a century later, has run through the men in the family.
Mr. Ochs had a daughter, Iphigene, but no sons. When he died in 1935, authority passed to Iphigene Ochs's husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Iphigene and Arthur had three daughters: Marian, Ruth and Judith, called Judy.
Then came a son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, born on Feb. 5, 1926. The father enjoyed composing light verse, and he celebrated this birth with an illustrated book describing the boy as having ''come to play the Punch to Judy's endless show.'' The nickname stuck.
In 1961, his health deteriorating, the elder Sulzberger considered it time to step aside. His son was not even considered as a possible successor -- not then, anyway. Many Times executives and close relatives felt Arthur was too young and not up to the challenge. The family turned to Mr. Dryfoos, who was married to the oldest Sulzberger daughter, Marian, and who had been a senior Times executive for years.
Unexpected Promotion
But a mere two years into the job, Mr. Dryfoos was dead, and the family looked to the young Mr. Sulzberger. At 37, he became the youngest publisher in Times history.
His mother, the paper's guiding spirit until her death at 97 in 1990, wrote in her memoir, ''Iphigene,'' that tapping her son amounted to ''something of a gamble.'' Until then he had held only lower-level company positions. In one, assistant treasurer, he had been given little to do except sign payroll checks.
''It's impossible to be an assistant to your father,'' he said years later.
Mr. Sulzberger himself -- square-shouldered, pipe-smoking, affable, unaffected -- knew how lightly he was regarded. ''I've made my first executive decision,'' he told his sister Ruth after his first day on the job. ''I've decided not to throw up.''
It did not take him long to prove the doubters wrong. ''It was remarkable how quickly Punch began to demonstrate initiative and decisiveness,'' his mother wrote. Years later, A. M. Rosenthal would call Mr. Sulzberger ''the most insufficiently estimated publisher in modern American journalism.''
It would have been hard to dispute that The Times was America's premier paper in 1963. Its influence on national politics was even greater than it is in today's information-saturated age of round-the-clock cable news, social media and the Internet.
But the paper in 1963 was also a struggling operation with an uncertain future. It was reeling from low revenues and high labor costs. It had just emerged from a 114-day printers' strike, which had put a tremendous strain on Mr. Dryfoos.
The long walkout, over wages, automation and other issues, was also devastating to the once-boisterous world of New York newspapers. When the strike began in 1962, there were seven major dailies in the city, all of them already threatened by competition from television and burdened with high costs and low income. Within five years the field had shrunk to three: The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post.
The Times, a morning paper, toyed with the idea of creating an afternoon daily to go head-to-head with the afternoon Post. In 1967 it went so far as to create prototypes for two possible papers. But in the end it dropped the project, deciding it would be too much of a drain on the company's resources.
At The Times, 1963 was the first year it had lost money since 1898. But even in good years, profits were precariously small. It hardly helped that the paper was based in a city that was in economic decline and unable to stop the flight of many affluent New Yorkers -- newspaper readers and advertisers included -- to the suburbs.
''I personally never had the concern that the paper was going to go out of business,'' Mr. Sulzberger later recalled. ''But it was obvious to me that we had a problem on the business side, the problem being structural: the way we worked together or, more accurately, the way we didn't work together.''
Business as Usual Won't Do
Mr. Sulzberger moved swiftly to bring financial order, and to show skeptics that he was in charge. Some of his early actions were the sort that any struggling businessman might take. But for The Times of that era, they bordered on revolutionary. Mr. Sulzberger insisted that the news department operate on a budget -- unheard-of at the time. He strived to reduce the company's payroll, then about 5,400 strong, a work force appreciably larger than today's. He tried to get the advertising and circulation departments, each jealous of the other's powers and privileges, to coordinate their efforts.
By nature, he was fastidiously neat. The habitual clutter on reporters' desks drove him to distraction. And he felt no better about untidy organizational charts.
It made no sense to Mr. Sulzberger that the daily Times and the Sunday paper were separate and sometimes competing fiefs. In 1964 he ordered that they both report to a single executive editor, Turner Catledge, who had become something of a father figure to the new publisher.
The plan was not executed so easily. The Sunday department had been run for 40 years by the brilliant but imperious Lester Markel, an editor who brooked no interference from anyone, including a young publisher, who still called him ''Mr. Markel.'' Mr. Sulzberger chose to spring the daily-Sunday merger without telling Mr. Markel. ''Young men can be cruel, sometimes without knowing it,'' Mr. Catledge concluded in a 1971 memoir.
The two branches of the paper did not truly merge for 12 more years, but the episode was considered an early sign that one underestimated Punch Sulzberger at one's peril.
''Punch soon proved to be a more aggressive publisher than either Sulzberger or Dryfoos had been,'' Mr. Catledge wrote. ''Those two, having married into the newspaper, saw themselves as trustees, but Punch had a sense of proprietorship that they had lacked.''
He continued: ''Adolph Ochs used to say, 'I always question the obvious,' and Punch was like his grandfather in that regard. He liked to ask questions and challenge assumptions.''
One assumption he challenged was that the paper would return to business as usual after the strike. ''Our obvious trouble'' at the end of the walkout ''was that we had no muscle whatsoever,'' Mr. Sulzberger recalled, ''and that all our financial eggs were in one basket.''
In January 1964 he summarily closed The Times's Western edition, a slender version of the newspaper that had been started only 15 months earlier under Mr. Dryfoos. Printed in Los Angeles and distributed in 13 Western states, the edition suffered from anemic advertising and plummeting circulation.
Mr. Sulzberger's decision left scars in the newsroom, for it involved rare layoffs of staff members. Mr. Sulzberger later acknowledged the trauma. ''It was the first time that we kind of threw in the sponge and said, 'We can't do it,' '' he said. ''That wasn't the usual way we did things.''
But The Times did so again in 1967, when it folded its money-losing international edition, which was founded in 1949 and based in Paris. In a merger with the Paris edition of the recently closed New York Herald Tribune, a new entity was formed, The International Herald Tribune. It is now owned solely by The Times after a long partnership with The Washington Post Company.
The Times Company in 1963 consisted of the newspaper, the New York radio stations WQXR-AM and FM, and a share of the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company in Ontario. Mr. Sulzberger concluded that The Times needed new ventures to generate profits that could insulate it from future strikes, crises in the New York economy or declines in retail advertising as department stores failed.
But expansion required cash, lots of it, far more than could be raised by a small, fusty company with marginal profits at best. ''We were privately held,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. ''Once a year, at the annual meeting of the board, the salaries were passed around on a single sheet of paper. But it wasn't proper to look.''
All that changed in 1969, when millions of Times shares began to be traded on the American Stock Exchange. (Since 1997 they have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange.) That opened the newspaper to outside investors, as well as to outside scrutiny.
The Family Trust
Significantly, the shares put into play in 1969, Class A shares, were kept separate from a Class B category of stock that controlled the company. Holders of those strategic B shares elected 70 percent of the company's directors. And nearly all the B stock -- more than 87 percent when Mr. Sulzberger stepped down in 1997, and 91 percent today -- was held by a family trust established by Adolph Ochs and passed on to his heirs. (Family members also own Class A shares, bringing their total holdings to 15 percent.)
The terms of the trust were revised from time to time, most recently in 1997. But its purpose was unvarying: to ensure that control of The Times would remain with Ochs descendants deep into the 21st century unless they agreed that the only way to save the paper was to sell it.
The importance of keeping the family in charge cannot be overstated, said Walter E. Mattson, a former Times Company president. ''The commitment to the quality of the paper and the correctness of the paper -- the willingness to suffer the criticism of Wall Street, for example -- is best dealt with by a member of the family,'' he said.
With money in hand from the public sale of Class A stock, The Times began looking for properties to buy.
It made its first major purchases in 1971, from Cowles Communications. For $52 million in Times stock and the assumption of $15 million in Cowles debt, The Times acquired Family Circle magazine, a group of medical magazines, three Florida newspapers, a textbook publishing house and a Memphis television station. Those businesses are no longer in The Times's hands, but they were the foundation for a future diversified company.
In October 1997, when Mr. Sulzberger passed on the chairmanship to his son and assumed the title of chairman emeritus, the company included 21 regional newspapers, 9 magazines focused on golf and other outdoor pastimes, 8 television stations, 2 radio stations, a news service, a features syndicate and The Boston Globe, which was bought in 1993 for $1.1 billion, a record price for a newspaper, paid largely in Times Company stock.
The Times Company's holdings have varied since then and today they are principally confined to The Globe, The International Herald Tribune and its flagship paper.
Not every acquisition under Mr. Sulzberger was a success. Nor did investors applaud every move. Times stock was often an underachiever on Wall Street, as it was in the first years after The Globe was bought. Many thought the company had paid too much for the paper. Mr. Sulzberger disagreed. ''It was a business that we understood,'' he said. ''We know how to run newspapers.''
That philosophy -- focus on what you do well -- guided his business decisions. Ignoring it would only land the company in trouble, he believed. The Times got into the book business in the 1970s, then got out when it realized it could not apply to books the same rigorous standards of accuracy that it insisted on for its own newspaper. (The Times Books imprint was licensed to Random House for many years. It returned to The Times in 2000 in partnership with Henry Holt & Company.)
A big mistake, Mr. Sulzberger said, was Us magazine, a weekly The Times started in the 1970s, patterned on People magazine but without its verve or circulation.
''That's when I came up with a cardinal rule,'' he said. ''Never acquire a company that you're embarrassed to tell your mother about. Or start a publication, in this case. It really isn't our line of work, and we weren't very good at it.''
Us Weekly was sold within three years and is now published by Wenner Media.
Unions and Women's Issues
The Times Company Mr. Sulzberger passed along in 1997 was light years from the one he had inherited. Revenue in 1963 was $101 million, with The Times newspaper accounting for almost all of it. By 1997, the total was $2.6 billion, with the newspaper accounting for about half. In 2011, The New York Times Media Group, made up of The Times, The International Herald Tribune and their Web sites, accounted for 66 percent of the Times Company's total revenues of $2.4 billion.
The Times eventually had less reason to worry about the sort of labor strife that plagued New York papers through the 1960s and '70s. Its newfound strength was shown when it bounced back quickly from an 88-day press worker's strike in 1978, the last time it endured a significant walkout.
In Mr. Sulzberger's early years as publisher, his attitude toward the dozen or so newspaper unions in New York ranged from annoyance to hostility. More than a few workers considered him less than generous when it came to salaries and health benefits.
He was also challenged on other grounds. In the 1970s, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit accusing the paper of practicing systematic discrimination against women in hiring, promotions and pay. The Times reluctantly settled the suit in 1978 by agreeing to pay $350,000 in back wages and lawyers' fees and committing itself to an affirmative-action program for women in both the news and business departments.
In later years, labor relations at the paper became far more conciliatory. Long-term no-strike contracts were signed, offering productivity incentives for some employees, like press workers. But the 1960s and '70s were a confrontational era.
The Times, like newspapers across the country, had embraced automated typesetting and high-speed printing operations as a way to shrink the work force and cut costs. Mr. Sulzberger believed that New York's powerful craft unions, seeking to protect jobs and maintain their memberships, stood in the way of the new money-saving technologies.
The problem went beyond the strikes called every few years. His paper, he felt, was bleeding from a thousand cuts in the form of repeated slowdowns, whether by typesetters, press workers or truck drivers.
Still, Mr. Sulzberger did not confront the unions head-on until the 1970s. A turning point came in 1974, when The Times and The Daily News reached an agreement with Local 6 of the International Typographical Union, the same printers' union that had struck in 1963.
In return for substantial bonuses and guarantees of lifetime employment, ''Big Six'' agreed, finally, to let the newspapers bring computers and electronic typesetting into composing rooms, which were still being run much as they had been for 90 years, with clanking machines that cast type in hot lead, one line at a time. The old composing room -- big, burly, noisy and, yes, romantic -- would disappear in a few years, followed over the next 20 years, through attrition, by some 800 jobs.
While it was a breakthrough, the agreement did not improve the paper's finances right away. Circulation and advertising were stagnant, and so were profits. A national recession in 1975 hit New York especially hard, and the city teetered toward bankruptcy. For The Times, the solution was to make striking changes in both its content and appearance.
Profitable Innovations
One move, in 1976, was to adopt a six-column format, replacing the denser eight-column configuration that the paper had used since 1913. This put The Times in line with other newspapers that were standardizing their formats as a convenience to many advertisers.
The same year, the daily paper expanded to four sections from two, adding stand-alone business and metropolitan news reports and a daily mini-magazine devoted to consumer-oriented subjects. The paper also introduced four Sunday regional sections in 1976, aiming them at New York's affluent suburbs.
These innovations were followed in 1980 by a new national edition, which Mr. Sulzberger began with some trepidation, remembering the Western edition's failure two decades earlier. But it had become less costly to print a version of the newspaper at satellite plants around the country than to distribute copies of the New York edition nationally by airplane. The national edition gained circulation steadily and eventually drew its own advertising. It now accounts for more than half of the print newspaper's 779,731 daily readership.
Photos and graphics began appearing in color in Sunday sections in 1993. A Times Web site was introduced in 1996. The next year, special editions for New England and the Washington area were started. And despite some head-shaking on Wall Street, the paper invested nearly $1 billion in new printing plants in Edison, N.J., and College Point, Queens. (The Edison plant was later sold.) In September 1997, the daily Times began to be printed in color, its news report now spread across as many as six sections.
When these changes started in the mid-1970s, there was no mystery to them. Mr. Mattson, who was general manager at the time, saw the consumer-oriented sections as a way to lure new advertisers and readers. It was up to the newsroom, under Mr. Rosenthal, to figure out how to create the sections with taste and intelligence so that they offered more than tips on how to get chocolate stains out of the carpet.
The Weekend section on Friday came first, in April 1976. It was followed by Living on Wednesday, Home on Thursday and SportsMonday.
What to do with Tuesday became an issue. It turned into a tug of war. The business staff wanted a fashion section, seeing it as a sure way to bring in advertising. The newsroom preferred a science section, seeing it as more in tune with The Times's traditional mandate.
As arbiter, Mr. Sulzberger sided with the news department.
His decision paid an unforeseen dividend when the new Tuesday section, Science Times, began generating advertising, thanks to the advent of the personal computer.
Science Times was the publisher's way of reinforcing a conviction that the editors, not the business staff, ultimately determined what went into The New York Times.
There would be skirmishes over containing costs, as when advertising declined after Wall Street's Black Monday in October 1987 and belts were tightened.
But The Times continued to pour money into news gathering when many American papers were pulling back.
''Punch was a very staunch advocate for the editor; it wasn't even a close call,'' Arthur Gelb said in 1998. Mr. Mattson said, ''There was never an issue as to the business people involving themselves in the news side of the newspaper.''
Living, Home and the other feature sections did not draw unanimous raves, however. The main complaint was that the sections were unbefitting the serious-minded newspaper that had published the Pentagon Papers and pioneered formats like the Op-Ed page, created in 1970 as a forum for outside voices.
''Did you hear about the latest Times section?'' one joke went. ''They're calling it News.''
But the skeptics were soon silenced. Not only were the sections imitated; they also brought The Times tens of thousands of new readers.
Mr. Sulzberger was not inclined to apologize for turning a profit.
''A financially sound Times is good for our readers, our advertisers, our shareholders and our employees,'' he wrote to The Wall Street Journal, responding to criticisms there, in 1978. ''A financially sound Times also is good newspapering. A newspaper that is broke is not going to be able to spend the money necessary to support thorough and aggressive reporting.''
Passing the Torch
As the years passed, Mr. Sulzberger turned his attention toward handing over leadership to the next generation. In 1992, his son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., took over as Times publisher. The question then became whether the younger Sulzberger would also inherit his father's corporate titles. Some board members wanted to see someone from outside the family assume those posts.
In 1997, Mr. Sulzberger rallied family members around his son as chairman. But his sisters, he later said, wanted roles for their own branches of the family. ''So we came up with compromises and things that worked wonderfully well for the organization,'' he said. Arthur Sulzberger Jr. was made chairman. A cousin, Michael Golden, was named senior vice president and vice chairman. The chief executive was from outside the family, Russell T. Lewis.
Once again, the Times family had avoided the kind of internal strife that had battered newspaper clans like the Binghams of Kentucky and the Chandlers of Los Angeles.
The family sense of duty was strong. It was captured in a eulogy that Susan W. Dryfoos, Orvil Dryfoos's daughter and the director of the Times History Project, delivered in February 1990 for her grandmother, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger.
''We, your family, understand our birthright,'' Ms. Dryfoos said.
Siblings With a Mountain
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger's share of that birthright took shape in a town house in Manhattan on 80th Street, off Fifth Avenue, where Arthur Hays and Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger had settled a few years before Arthur's birth.
Family members remember a boy with a sunny disposition, doted on by relatives, including his three sisters, although, he said, ''Judy and I fought like cats and dogs when we were little.''
He liked games requiring manual dexterity. He was fascinated by gadgets, a passion that became lifelong, though it did not extend to computers. Forced to install a desktop computer, he was not known to have used it. He preferred his old Underwood manual typewriter.
Growing up in The Times's guiding family meant a life spent in the company of the famous and powerful. Young Punch played Chinese checkers with Wendell L. Willkie, the 1940 Republican presidential nominee. Adm. Richard E. Byrd, whose Antarctic expeditions were financed by The Times, named a peak in Antarctica for him and the other Sulzberger children. The name, Marujupu Peak, is a combination of Marian, Ruth, Judith and Punch. Mount Iphigene is nearby.
But it was also a family that shunned ostentation and put a premium on social obligation. When Arthur was 8, his mother sent this note to his father:
''Punch the other day said he would like to be king of the world. 'What would you do then?' I asked. 'Well,' said he, 'I would first make all the countries stop fighting and be friends and then I would fix up Germany.' 'How would you do that?' 'I would make Hitler into a plain man and make them get a good man as President (he thinks Hitler is President of Germany) and then I would go to Africa and kill all the bugs that make people sick.' ''
What struck Mrs. Sulzberger was that her son had talked about what he would do for others, not for himself.
Punch Sulzberger's qualities did not include a talent for studies. His boyhood was a succession of expensive private schools.
''Nearly every school in the vicinity of New York was graced with Punch's presence at one time or another,'' his sister Ruth wrote in 1963 for Times Talk, the newspaper's staff publication at the time. ''They were all delighted to have him, but wanted him as something other than a spectator.''
At one school, St. Bernard's, on the Upper East Side, there was a yearly Latin play, with roles assigned according to one's proficiency in the language. Punch played a mute slave.
It amused the self-effacing Mr. Sulzberger later in life to tell stories like that about himself. But back then, his academic failures were a source of pain. His mother thought he had dyslexia.
Whatever the problem, it drove him at age 17 to drop out of the Loomis School in Windsor, Conn., and join the Marines. It was 1944, and World War II was raging. His parents did not like the idea but finally gave written permission. ''My family didn't worry about me for a minute,'' he later said. ''They knew that if I got shot in the head, it wouldn't do me any harm.''
Buckling Down
The Marines turned him around.
''Before I entered the Marines, I was a lazy good-for-nothing,'' he once told his mother. ''The Marines woke me up.''
He would never forget the corps. Afterward, its commandants were invited to The Times for lunch, and tours by Marine information officers were a regular newsroom feature.
Trained as a radioman, Mr. Sulzberger went through the Leyte and Luzon campaigns in the Philippines, then landed in Japan as a jeep driver at Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters. He was discharged in 1946 as a corporal.
Five years later, with the Korean War on, he was called back to active duty. This time he received an officer's commission and served as a public information officer in Korea before being transferred to Washington. He was a captain when he returned to civilian life in December 1952.
Between the military tours, Mr. Sulzberger got serious about academic work. Armed with a high school equivalency degree and, he said, ''armed with the fact that my old man was on the board,'' he entered Columbia University and received a bachelor of arts degree in English and history in 1951. In 1967, he became a life trustee.
While in college, in 1948, Mr. Sulzberger married Barbara Winslow Grant, who lived near the Sulzbergers' estate in Stamford, Conn. They had two children, Arthur Jr., born in 1951, and Karen, born in 1952. Karen Sulzberger is a former arts administrator and board member of Facing History and Ourselves, an educational organization.
The Sulzberger marriage ended in divorce. Months later, in December 1956, Mr. Sulzberger married Carol Fox Fuhrman; they had met at a New York dinner party given by Orvil Dryfoos's brother, Hugh. The couple had a daughter, Cynthia, in 1964. She is an elementary school reading specialist.
By a previous marriage, Mrs. Sulzberger had a daughter, Cathy, who was born in 1949 and legally adopted by Mr. Sulzberger. Cathy Sulzberger is a real estate developer who serves on many philanthropic boards.
Carol Sulzberger died in 1995. In March 1996, Mr. Sulzberger married Allison S. Cowles, widow of William H. Cowles III, who had been president and publisher of newspapers in Spokane, Wash. The two families had a newspaper connection going back to the early 1900s, though Ms. Cowles was not from the branch of the family that directed Cowles Communications. Ms. Cowles died in 2010 in Spokane.
Besides his children, Mr. Sulzberger is survived by two of his three sisters, Marian S. Heiskell of New York and Ruth S. Holmberg of Chattanooga, Tenn., and nine grandchildren. The third sister, Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger -- the Judy to his Punch -- died in 2011.
A Publisher With Patience
Having decided to go into the family business, Mr. Sulzberger went off in 1954 for a year's apprenticeship at The Milwaukee Journal. Then it was back to The Times, first on the foreign copy desk, then stints in the London, Paris and Rome bureaus. He was not to make his mark as a foreign correspondent.
One day in 1955, he went to a car race in Le Mans, France -- as a spectator, not as a reporter. A driver lost control and jumped the track, his car spinning through the air and churning through the stands. The driver and 82 spectators were killed. It was a horrifying scene. But it never occurred to Mr. Sulzberger to notify The Times.
Some in journalism had the impression that Mr. Sulzberger was not cut out to be publisher, and his reputation was hardly bolstered by the relatively minor assignments given to him when he returned to The Times's main office. But after being named publisher, he quickly took charge.
One of Mr. Sulzberger's qualities as head of a high-tension operation was that ''he had a soothing personality,'' said James C. Goodale, a former Times senior executive and the newspaper's general counsel in the battle over the Pentagon Papers. John D. Pomfret, a former Times executive vice president who worked alongside Mr. Sulzberger at The Milwaukee Journal, said the publisher had remarkable patience.
''He could outwait a problem,'' Mr. Pomfret said. ''He was like an oyster almost. If something was irritating him, it's almost like he would cover it up.''
Not always, though. In the mid-1980s, his irritation turned to anger when Sydney H. Schanberg, who had won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in Cambodia, attacked some of Mr. Sulzberger's business friends and even The Times itself in a series of columns about proposals for a highway along the Hudson River called Westway. The publisher stripped Mr. Schanberg of his column.
In 1973, Mr. Sulzberger provoked howls of outrage, both inside and outside the Times building, when he hired William Safire, a speechwriter in the Nixon White House with no newspaper background, to be a columnist on the Op-Ed page. Mr. Sulzberger wanted a conservative voice to balance the paper's mostly liberal columnists. Mr. Safire, who died in 2009, won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978.
On Mr. Sulzberger's watch, The Times won the Pulitzer Prize, American journalism's highest award, 31 times.
His commitment to defending the First Amendment was unflagging. He was publisher in 1964 when the United States Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling, New York Times v. Sullivan, strengthening newspapers' protections against libel suits brought by public figures. (The case began before he took charge of the paper.)
Less successfully, Mr. Sulzberger supported Times reporters in federal and state cases in the 1970s in which they asserted that the First Amendment gave them the right to keep the names of confidential sources secret from grand juries and to refuse to surrender their notes in a murder trial.
In a 1972 speech, Mr. Sulzberger warned that there was a ''troubling lack of understanding of the importance of a free press to a free society and an absence of sensitivity to its fragility.''
No case during his career loomed larger than that of the Pentagon Papers.
Mr. Goodale said he had felt that Mr. Sulzberger, given his military background and centrist politics, was at first ''semi-committed not to publish'' a secret government history. Among the factors weighing on the publisher was pressure from The Times's outside law firm, Lord, Day & Lord. Its senior partner, Louis M. Loeb, warned that he would not defend the paper in court if it printed the documents.
''Lord, Day & Lord was a well-established firm numbering among its clients the Cunard Line,'' Mr. Sulzberger said at a 1996 dinner of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ''Whether they were traumatized by the loss of the Titanic, I really can't say. But they certainly were cautious.''
Lighthearted as that comment was -- and inaccurate; the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line, not Cunard -- Mr. Sulzberger acknowledged in interviews that he was ''scared to death'' that the Pentagon Papers could blow up in his face, that ''all sorts of terrible things would happen,'' from fines to ruined reputations. But he stood firm, published the documents, found another law firm and won.
Calls From the White House
Mr. Sulzberger was not unfamiliar with outside pressures on what he should or should not print. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy tried to get him to replace The Times's correspondent in South Vietnam, David Halberstam. Mr. Halberstam stayed put.
In 1967, with the war in Vietnam going strong, Secretary of State Dean Rusk called Mr. Sulzberger to express concern about the work of another Times reporter, Harrison E. Salisbury, who was writing from Hanoi.
But there were fewer calls like those than many might think, Mr. Sulzberger said after he retired. In general, he said, government leaders ''seemed loath to come directly to me.''
During the Reagan administration, he was invited to lunch in the Oval Office. ''When I got through,'' he recalled, ''I made a telephone call to my mother. I said, 'Mom, guess who I had lunch with?' She said, 'Who, darling?' I said, 'The president, the vice president and the secretary of state.' She said: 'Oh, that's wonderful. What did they want?' ''
Mr. Sulzberger added with a laugh, ''I never did find out what they wanted.''
More typically, complaints about news coverage came from social acquaintances, not that it did them much good. The publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg was so enraged by an article on a seamy side of his family's past that he kept advertising for his TV Guide out of The Times for months.
As Mr. Sulzberger neared retirement, outside activities, like his involvement with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, took up an increasing share of his time. Mr. Sulzberger was the museum's chairman from 1987 to 1998 and since 1968 had been a trustee, as his father had been years earlier.
His time as chairman was one of expansion: museum attendance and membership rose significantly, and the budget nearly doubled, to $116.6 million from $64 million. But fund-raising was a chore he preferred to leave to others. ''I'm expected to be prepared to go and rattle the cup, but luckily they don't call upon me too often,'' he said.
When he left as Times chairman in 1997, he remained convinced that newspapers -- at least good newspapers -- had a bright future.
''I think that paper and ink are here to stay for the kind of newspapers we print,'' he said in a post-retirement interview. ''There's no shortage of news in this world. If you want news, you can go to cyberspace and grab out all this junk. But I don't think most people are competent to become editors, or have the time or the interest.''
''You're not buying news when you buy The New York Times,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. ''You're buying judgment.''

HEADLINE: Meg Whitman's Toughest Campaign: Retooling H.P.

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif.
IT'S not as easy being Meg Whitman as Meg Whitman might have expected.
At 56, Ms. Whitman, the eBay billionaire who spent a fortune unsuccessfully trying to become the governor of California, has found her Act III. She has been chief executive of Hewlett-Packard for a little more than a year, and many people are still waiting for her to get her message out about the place.
Here it is:
Meg Whitman believes in H.P., and believes that this company matters to Silicon Valley, to California, to the world. She believes that Wall Street doesn't quite get it -- doesn't quite see the promise she sees. She believes that mobile devices, cloud computing and Big Data will re-energize H.P., a company that for a decade has grabbed more headlines for boardroom soap operas than for bold innovation.
''I believe in creative destruction,'' Ms. Whitman says in a conference room near her executive cubicle.
Even, it seems, when the stakes include her company and reputation. In all likelihood, this is Ms. Whitman's last great public performance. She became rich by building eBay, then spent more money than any candidate for public office in the nation's history trying to become California's governor. She was sometimes portrayed in that race as an aloof 1 percenter -- as someone who pushed around subordinates, once literally, and who was unkind to her housekeeper, an illegal immigrant. ''I left a little bruised,'' Ms. Whitman, a Republican, says of the 2010 race she lost to Jerry Brown. ''It was hard, it was personally very hard.''
So now Ms. Whitman is focusing her energy on H.P., the company founded by the tech legends William Hewlett and David Packard. Bill and Dave, as they are referred to at the company, spawned Silicon Valley. Last year, H.P. posted revenue of $127 billion. It employs 320,000 people directly, and easily that many again through a network of manufacturers and computer resellers across 170 countries.
Ms. Whitman has plenty of impressive-sounding stats at her fingertips. H.P., she says, employs thousands of people in Costa Rica, Houston and Boise, Idaho. ''In India, we have 60,000 people,'' she says. A new program for selling printer ink is in exactly 87 countries. Every 15 seconds, the company turns out 60 new printers, 30 personal computers and one powerful computer server. Still, she yearns for even more data, something closer to the command of the day-to-day process she had at eBay.
THE fact is, H.P. isn't what it used to be. Next to Apple or Google, it looks like a bit of a loser. In the most recent quarter, as Apple soared to new heights, H.P.'s revenue fell 5 percent and its operating margins dwindled. Profit margins at I.B.M. and Apple are several times that of H.P. And H.P.'s share price, at just over $17 on Friday, is about where it was in 1995.
''It's staggering,'' says A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ''This is now the cheapest big stock in the last 25 years. That reflects an industry belief that the company is going to decline.''
Ms. Whitman is impatient to move H.P. closer to a global computing explosion that is transforming the industry. Smartphones and tablets from Apple, Google and others are now flying into consumers' hands worldwide. Those computers are tied via the Internet to cloud computing data centers operated by Amazon, Microsoft, and hundreds of multinational companies. Information from all the consumer devices, in addition to data from billions of sensors and Web-crawling robots, is crunched in these supercomputing clouds, creating a Big Data revolution full of business opportunities and dangers.
From Ms. Whitman's high vantage, the trends of mobile, cloud and Big Data resolve into a single phenomenon: the creation and exploitation of Information Everywhere. H.P. makes consumer devices, in addition to servers for the cloud, sensor networks, and analysis software. Instead of standing at the confluence of the phenomenon, though, H.P. is on the sidelines, with most of the parts but none of the integration to make it a leader.
H.P. sometimes seems like a place of siloed relics, as quaint as the autographed picture of Herbert Hoover in the shrine that is Mr. Packard's office (along with Mr. Hewlett's, untouched since the day Mr. Packard left in 1993). The stock is down 24 percent since Ms. Whitman took over. H.P. spends $4 billion a year on marketing, and, according to an arm of the ad agency WPP, has one of the fastest-eroding brands among major companies.
So why did Ms. Whitman take the job? Part of the answer may be in her new slogan for the company: ''Make it matter.'' She plans to unveil her strategy to Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.
She envisions a more customer-focused, Information-Everywhere H.P., with restyled PCs whose screens break off into iPad-like tablet computers. H.P. will also get into mobile devices, she says. And H.P. printers, under attack from cheap competitors, are being revamped as cloud-connected devices capable of initiating Google-esque data searches through corporate information. Print cartridges will be sold by subscription, as well as in individual units, with automatic refills shipped when ink runs low.
In addition to selling regular computer servers, networking and data storage, H.P. is focusing on cloud-ready ''pods'' of servers, storage and networking, built in three days. Right now a comparable data center can take 18 months to construct.
As impressive a portfolio as it is, it's unclear if Wall Street will buy the idea of the company's renewal. Others have equal or greater products, though without H.P.'s broad corporate reach. Ms. Whitman herself is somewhat conflicted: in the same interview, she says that employees and key customers understand the new H.P., but ''I'm not sure the media and Wall Street do.'' Still, she says, H.P. needs four more years ''to have confidence in itself.''
The external threats are apparent. New consumer devices eat at H.P.'s PC business, the world's largest. The cloud computing data centers operated by so many companies have some H.P. servers, but those servers have lost ground to shrink-wrapped racks from cheap Asian competitors. The cloud also lowers demand for individual servers, a $10 billion H.P. business. The company also spent that amount last year for Autonomy, a Big Data company that has yet to earn its keep.
''It is a shift bigger than anything in our memory,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''We have to get ahead of the curve.''
And H.P. will need to do it, she says, during a period of slack economic growth in Europe, China and the United States.
Managing the decline, or, as Ms. Whitman prefers to call it, transformation, of old businesses is a tall order for any executive. At H.P., she has been going for the old Bill-and-Dave touch, standing in line for stir-fry in the cafeteria, hosting video conferences, asking if that seat is taken. She can't talk to everyone, but 10 minutes into a conversation she is apt to lightly touch someone's hand when making a point.
''On Day 1 when she came here, she said, 'Here's the deal: I'm team oriented,' '' says David Donatelli, the head of H.P.'s server, storage and networking business. Ms. Whitman kicked top executives out of their private offices, and into a warren of cubicles to get them talking. She also replaced people and merged businesses so that the 11-member executive council at the top of H.P. now has just one trained engineer. Counting Ms. Whitman, there are five M.B.A.'s.
Many of the company's new products were planned before she took over, but she has added a greater emphasis on software, design and customer focus. Server sales reps are compensated partly on how much software a customer buys, and how much of a customer's total computer budget, including data storage, software and networking H.P. can take.
So far, however, the new products don't bring in enough revenue to make up for the eroding older product lines. ''There is nothing wrong with being in charge of a declining business, as long as you are managing it,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''The whole business better not be declining.''
TWENTYyears ago, people like Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, Larry Ellison at Oracle, and John Chambers at Cisco Systems heard Kenneth Olsen, then the leader of Digital Equipment Corporation, deride the PC as unsuited for business. Within a few years, DEC had been gobbled up by Compaq Computer. Everyone knows viscerally how fast change can overtake a legacy business -- and how hard it is to change.
There's little glory in managing decline, particularly in an industry in love with what's next. Apple's tablets are taking share from PC makers like H.P., but only after Apple had a near-death corporate experience that ended with the return of Steve Jobs. He created a new reality for Apple with its retail stores, something that H.P. can't copy to sell PCs. I.B.M. also transitioned successfully after billions in losses and years of cuts. Most others ended like DEC.
Still, Ms. Whitman says her corporate campaign is less brutal than her failed electoral one. She doesn't like to talk about her $140 million-plus run for governor, and says only that it gave her a thicker skin. (At a recent companywide meeting, Ms. Whitman, who helped host a $25,000-a-plate fund-raising visit to Silicon Valley by Paul Ryan, said she would not take a government position if Mitt Romney -- who long ago hired her into the consulting firm Bain & Company -- is elected president.)
The recent legacy dogging H.P. is uniquely bipolar. Carly Fiorina, who was named chief executive in 1999, tried bringing H.P. somewhat belatedly into the Internet age with a mixture of self-promotion and big corporate acquisitions. She defended her acquisition of Compaq, only to be ousted amid uneven business execution and a corporate spying scandal.
Her successor, Mark Hurd, deployed hard-nosed, sharp-pencil cost-cutting. He resigned amid accusations of inappropriate conduct with a female contract employee. Like the fate of a totalitarian despot, Mr. Hurd's once-cheered reign is denounced in hindsight, with critics saying his cuts starved H.P. of products and talent. In August, Ms. Whitman wrote off $8 billion of Mr. Hurd's 2008 purchase of the outsourcer Electronic Data Systems for $13.9 billion, since hoped-for services contracts never materialized.
After Mr. Hurd came Léo Apotheker. He talked about new technology but agonized publicly over how H.P. would stay relevant. H.P. stock sank, and, before long, he was out, too.
And so H.P.'s board turned to Ms. Whitman.
''She understands customers, business,'' says Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor and an H.P. director who helped bring her on board. ''While she's not an engineer, at eBay she got schooled in how to talk to engineers.'' Besides, he says, there are not a lot of Bill and Daves out there: ''Engineers running companies with 50,000 people or more just aren't available.''
Remarkably, the shadow of Bill and Dave still hangs over H.P., for better and for worse. David Scott, who runs the storage business, was at H.P. from 1983 to 2001, then rejoined in 2010 when H.P. bought a company he ran. He has experienced four C.E.O.'s in two years (including an interim chief between Mr. Hurd and Mr. Apotheker) but says that the first day he returned, ''three of the first four people I met were people who were here when I left; there is a tremendous loyalty here.''
But employees say H.P. is desperate for leadership after so many changes in the executive suite.
''At our essence, we all want to build a great, enduring company,'' says Mr. Donatelli, the head of the server, storage and networking business. ''I do all-hands meetings where I award people for 40 years, 30 years of service, people who've given their lives here. It's a huge responsibility.''
MS. WHITMAN'S efforts to clear out the bad history include a ''bureaucracy buster,'' to register complaints about slow practices, on H.P.'s internal Web site. In the last six months, it garnered 10,000 items, describing problems as varied as overflowing e-mail accounts and lengthy internal procurement rules. Ms. Whitman cannot know, however, if this is even a significant fraction of what is slowing H.P., or whether all its impediments can be addressed.
She continues to hold conference calls every couple of weeks with several hundred employees. Recently she derided the fact that H.P. processes insisted on a credit check even for a sale on a customer the size of Disney. She quickly shut down any talk of selling off the PC business, figuring that H.P. could guarantee cheap supplies by being the world's biggest consumer of things like semiconductors and computer memory. One of her favorite updates involves talking about her top priorities, what she is doing about them and what she needs from her managers.
Last spring, in a move to a more consumer-focused business, Mr. Donatelli's job changed from sales of servers to sales to business customers, a consolidation of emphasis that also combined senior managers in every country. Todd Bradley, who has run the company's PC business, picked up printers as well; that move resulted in the retirement of a well-loved H.P. veteran. H.P. is counting on a spike in PC sales as soon as October, when Microsoft introduces its new operating system, and Mr. Bradley vows that H.P. will regain its brand.
''Despite the ill-informed commentary that the PC is dead, it is an ever-expanding category,'' he says. Unlike the consumer-focused iPad, he says, PCs are ''devices that are enterprise-ready, with security and Windows 8 compatibility'' that create content for the cloud as readily as they consume it. Since January, Ms. Whitman has doubled the size of Mr. Bradley's PC design team. Now at 60 people, it's still small compared with Apple's.
Ms. Whitman's consolidation of top executives was a small part of a companywide layoff of 28,000 people, and even that may pale against what happens next. At a former Compaq factory in Houston, cloud-computing containers may soon be produced at a rate of 20 a month. At about $25 million apiece, that could mean $6 billion a year in revenue, which is likely equal to the revenue that H.P. will shed in this fiscal year relative to 2011. It takes fewer people to make a cloud-computing pod, however, than an equal number of servers, and pods have profit margins well above H.P.'s average.
''I'm the first C.E.O. in a long time who is from the Valley,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''Carly, Mark and Leo weren't.''
She continues: ''I understand the speed you have to move.''

HEADLINE: Going Hollywood

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
WHEN Olivia Palermo sauntered down the red carpet at Lincoln Center a week ago, she seized the occasion, the gala opening of the New York City Ballet, as a glittering photo op, a chance to shine in her multitiered Dior gown -- and, oh, incidentally, to offer homage to Valentino Garavani, who stepped out of official retirement to create the costumes.
Her attendance lent Ms. Palermo, a social gadabout and former reality-television star, a welcome dose of culture cred, a debt she repaid by lending the evening a generous dollop of chic.
''This is my first gala,'' Ms. Palermo murmured before sailing past banks of bellowing paparazzi and into the David H. Koch Theater.
She was preceded on a runway (ahem, a red carpet) that bisected the Plaza and cascaded to the street, by the stylish likes of Daphne Guinness, Julia Koch, the beauty entrepreneur Lauren Remington Platt, the runway star Karolina Kurkova and scores of emphatically youthful guests whose combined wattage easily eclipsed that of the social stalwarts who customarily form the backbone of such affairs.
''I've never in 20 years at the ballet walked a red carpet like this,'' said Ms. Koch, who arrived on the arm of her husband.
Clearly this wasn't, or was not exclusively, Great-Aunt Tessa's ballet.
''There has long been a stigma attached to the ballet and the opera, that they're stuffy organizations that just don't appeal to a younger, cooler demographic,'' Andrew Saffir said. Mr. Saffir, whose Cinema Society screenings routinely draw the young fashion and Hollywood crowd, was engaged by the board of the Metropolitan Opera to zsoosh up its guest list for its opening gala on Monday.
The anointed successor to Peggy Siegal, the high-powered celebrity wrangler, he was determined to let in some air. ''It behooves us,'' he said, ''to attract a younger, more dynamic, name-driven crowd.''
Indeed, at a time when even the most august cultural institutions are being challenged by an ailing economy, some beset by union troubles, a program or guest list larded with the names of celebrity designers, runway models, pop stars, rockers and athletes, the younger the better, can be a powerful draw, one clearly intended to fatten company coffers and raise cachet.
For Sarah Jessica Parker, a member of the City Ballet board of trustees, turning dance into a must-attend event for Manhattan's bright young things was something of a grail.
''I was always thinking about Anna Wintour and all that she did to raise funds for the Metropolitan Museum,'' Ms. Parker said unabashedly. ''In planning this event, I tried to think, What would Anna do?''
Her vision was fittingly grand. ''I wanted to wrap Lincoln Center in red like Christo,'' she said. When that proved unfeasible, she had the red carpet transferred from its formerly discreet position at the adjacent Koch theater, to center stage, a move intended to turn the evening into the autumn equivalent of the Met's Costume Institute gala, the jewel of the spring social season.
Minus the red carpet, but rivaling the ballet for star power, the opera on Monday boasted as its chief attraction the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, who would perform Adina that night in the Donizetti opera ''L'Elisir d'Amore.'' So it was telling that when Ms. Netrebko, her opulent frame encased in a Zac Posen gown, whooshed past photographers, her arrival was nearly overshadowed by Mr. Posen himself and his highly lacquered armpieces, the models Erin O'Connor and Crystal Renn.
Such aggregate star power turned both events, which traditionally usher in the fall social season, into unabashed style fests, proof positive that, in this town at least, high culture has attained the kind of sizzle that more commonly heats up Hollywood awards extravaganzas or the Fashion Week tents.
''It's not just a ballet, it's a great celebration and quite a fashion event,'' the artist Anh Duong said, as she glided into the Koch theater in a dusky number by Giambattista Valli.
At the Met on Monday, the pop singer Sia, showing off a brazenly blond variation on Ms. Wintour's signature bob, took in the scene with a mingled irony and awe.
''Oh, my God,'' she drawled, ''I'm just going to basically squat on the floor and watch it all file past. I want to cop all the plastic surgery, and all the best dresses.''
She certainly got an eyeful. Courtney Love, the club impresario Amy Sacco, the Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire, Patti Smith and the actress Maggie Grace, her features partly concealed by a fascinator, were among those who dressed to thrill.
But that, after all, was the point. ''Fashion at these events,'' Mr. Saffir said, ''is a very important element. It brings allure and sex appeal.''
Fashion also plays a role in lending such otherwise intimidating cultural events a degree of mass appeal. When it comes to raising awareness, Ms. Parker remarked, ''fashion tends to be easier for people to hook into.''
Such observations are not lost on the administration of the Metropolitan Opera. Its opening gala last spring was sponsored by Yves Saint Laurent. Such names lend clout and the kind of excitement that brings in ticket buyers. ''It ensures that a generation of future moguls will be giving us donations in years to come,'' said Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met.
Of the company's $340 million annual operating budget, Mr. Gelb said that more than half is covered through donations, a significant portion from corporate sponsors (among them, Rolex and Jaguar), which helped to underwrite the Monday night festivities. Securing future alliances with other luxury brands ''can't hurt,'' he said. ''The fashion sector would certainly add cachet,'' he added, and by extension, a welcome influx of cash.
The evening drew 1,200 guests and raised $6.2 million, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Additionally, sometimes controversially, Mr. Gelb has sought to dust off the opera's crusty image by updating the repertory and signing new stars. He has wooed a wider public with movie-theater screenings. (The Monday night opera performance was shown simultaneously on giant screens at Lincoln Center and in Times Square.)
Still, in a star-struck society, such efforts scarcely compete with a celebrity-paved red carpet. At the City Ballet this spring the choreographers Peter Martins and Benjamin Millepied enlisted designers like Gilles Mendel and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, the designing sisters of Rodarte, to create costumes. A year ago, the company collaborated with Sir Paul McCartney on a performance choreographed by Peter Martins, the company's ballet master. Stella McCartney designed the costumes for the event, which raised $4 million.
Mr. Garavani received no fee for his designs, a spokesman for the ballet company said. In exchange for his services, he demanded a degree of artistic control, stipulating, Ms. Parker said, that he create the costumes for three of the pieces performed, a departure for the company. Nor was he paid to pull his weight in other ways. With Giancarlo Giammetti, a co-chairman with Ms. Parker (and Maria Bartiromo and Pamela Joyner) and the designer's business partner, he purchased several tables for the event and persuaded others to buy, at $150,000 each.
As expected, Mr. Garavani drew a bevy of loyalists, glamorinas who dressed in his signature red. Tamara Mellon wore crimson in his honor, as did the model Jessica Hart, who arrived on the arm of the shipping heir Stavros Niarchos. Ms. Platt complied with the unstated dress code, turning out in a lipstick red Valentino jumpsuit. ''I knew everyone would be coming in huge ball gowns,'' she offered, ''so I wanted to change things up.''
Peacocking on the carpet before her handlers spirited her away, Anne Hathaway, another star attraction and Mr. Garavani's dinner partner, eschewed the requisite scarlet for an autumnal floral by the couturier. Zani Gugelmann, the jewelry designer and raven-maned girl about town, chose buttercup lace (''Valentino, of course,'' she announced).
The spectacle that poured $3 million into the company's coffers, a jump of $1 million over projected earnings for the night. Those donations, along with revenues from the spring gala in May, accounted for some 20 percent of the company's annual contributed income, a company spokesman said.
Such impressive contributions ought to have been reward enough, but Ms. Parker remains intent on spreading the high-culture gospel. Many of the guests last week had never attended a ballet performance, much less an opening night. For some, like Amy Sedaris, Ms. Parker's dinner partner, it was an eye opener, literally. ''I can't believe what I've seen,'' several rushed to tell her afterward. ''I can't wait to come back.''
All good. Certainly Ms. Parker could be forgiven for injecting a mild note of self congratulation. ''Aha,'' she recalled musing on hearing such enthusiasm. ''I'm on to something here. ''

HEADLINE: Sept. 29: As Iowa Goes, So Go Romney's Chances?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The national tracking polls were published on Saturday, and continued to show President Obama in a fairly strong position. 

 BODY:
Saturday, not Sunday, is the news media's traditional day of rest -- and so it is the slowest day of the week for polling.
But the national tracking polls were published on Saturday, and continued to show President Obama in a fairly strong position. He held at a six-point lead in the Gallup national tracking poll, although his approval rating dipped. He also maintained a rough seven-point advantage in the RAND Corporation's online tracking poll. Mr. Obama also pulled ahead to take a two-point lead in the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, which had differed from other polling firms by previously showing a tie. (Another national tracking poll, from Ipsos, is not regularly published on the weekends.)
We're getting to the point in the campaign where a day on which the polls are in line with expectations is a winning one for Mr. Obama, since Mr. Romney trails in the race and now has just five full weeks to make the deficit up. Mr. Obama's forecast rose slightly, to an 83.8 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, from 82.7 percent on Friday.
The Des Moines Register also published its highly regarded Iowa Poll on Saturday, which showed Mr. Obama with a four-point lead, 49 to 45. This result is quite consistent with other polls of Iowa published since the conventions, which also have shown Mr. Obama ahead by four points on average.
The only prior Des Moines Register poll this year, which was conducted in February, showed Mitt Romney up by two points instead. So this represents a favorable trend for Mr. Obama. 
On the other hand, the same polling firm, Selzer & Co., conducted a national poll for Bloomberg recently, which gave Mr. Obama a six-point advantage. So they have Mr. Obama polling slightly worse in Iowa than he is nationally.
The FiveThirtyEight forecast concurs: we have Mr. Obama projected to win Iowa by 3.6 percentage points on Nov. 6, smaller than his 4.1-point advantage in the national race.
These are marginal differences, obviously, but they matter some in terms of the electoral math since any hope that Mr. Romney has of winning the Electoral College without Ohio probably requires him to win Iowa. In the simulations that we ran on Saturday, Mr. Romney won the election only 2 percent of the time that he lost Iowa.
This isn't a good poll for Mr. Romney, but it does suggest that Iowa hasn't gotten out of hand, and that it could trend back toward him if the national race does.
Iowa ranks seventh on our list of tipping-point states, but it packs a lot of bang for the buck because its television markets are fairly small and cheap to advertise in. We estimate that a dollar spent there will do twice as much to sway the Electoral College outcome as one spent in Florida.

HEADLINE: Romney's Faith May Help in Idaho, Where He Doesn't Need It

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Idaho hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, and it will probably be one of the states where Mitt Romney improves on Senator John McCain's 2008 performance by the largest margin. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is a look at Idaho, the Gem State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with David Adler, director of the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University. 
Idaho is a red state. It's a really red state. It is rural, socially conservative and overwhelmingly white. Its electorate is mostly anti-abortion, anti-union and anti-federal government, Mr. Adler said.
Idaho hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, and it is about twice as Republican-leaning in presidential elections as Mississippi.
"Idaho has been a dark, grim landscape politically for Democrats for some time," Mr. Adler said.
And this year's presidential election is likely to be even worse for Democrats.
According to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, Idaho will be one of the states where Mr. Romney improves on Senator John McCain's 2008 performance by the largest margin. Utah tops that list, followed by Wisconsin, Nevada, Connecticut, Michigan and then Idaho.
What's special about those states? Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, is from Wisconsin. Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, was governor of Michigan. And the Wall Street-connected community in Connecticut will Mr. Romney's numbers there.
In Utah, Idaho and Nevada, however, it's religion. Mr. Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and those three states have the three highest percentages of Mormons.
In Utah, 67 percent of residents are L.D.S. members, according to a Gallup survey. Idaho is second with 21 percent, and Nevada is tied for third with 9 percent.
The evidence is circumstantial, but it suggests that Mr. Romney's faith has helped him in states (Idaho and Utah) that he was never going to lose, and a state (Nevada) where he was going to lose by too much to make a difference. Although if the race tightens up nationally, Mr. Obama's lead in Nevada is likely to narrow as well. And if the race were closer in Nevada, an increase in the Mormon vote could be enough to tip the state in his favor. (We'll have more on Nevada later in this series).
One might expect Mr. Romney's faith to have more of an impact in states with large L.D.S. communities. But Mormons have always been among the most Republican-leaning religious groups, according to the Pew-Forum on Religion & Public Life. In 2010, Mormon voters identified as Republicans over Democrats by about 3 to 1.
The conservatism of L.D.S. voters is evident in southeastern Idaho, which borders Utah and is the most heavily Mormon part of the state. Mr. Romney won by large margins there in Idaho's Republican caucuses this year.
Most of southeastern Idaho is incredibly conservative. "Democrats hope to keep Republican numbers down to 65 percent in the southeast," Mr. Adler said.
The southwest, known as the Treasure Valley, is centered on Boise, the state's main population hub. Boise has been a high-tech center ever since Micron Technology started there in the 1970s. Micron is still the largest employer in the state, Mr. Adler said, although it laid workers off during the recession.
Treasure Valley has attracted an influx of left-leaning migrants from the East and West coasts, as well as migrants from Latin America. The demographic changes have made Boise's Ada County more competitive politically.
"The Treasure Valley is the best opportunity that Democrats have," Mr. Adler said.
But the rapid population growth in Idaho over the last two decades - the state grew from one to 1.57 million residents from 1990 to 2010 - has been mixed politically. While Ada County is more competitive, Boise is still a conservative city as far as cities go; Senator John McCain won a slim majority in Ada County in 2008. Conservative migrants from places like Orange County, Calif., have moved to Idaho, too, drawn to the state's clean air, lax business regulations and family-friendly ethos.
While Democrats are slowly making gains in the southwest, they have lost ground in northern Idaho, known as the Panhandle. The Panhandle - once a major mining region - was traditionally Democratic-leaning. Unions were powerful. But over the last three decades, mining has receded as an economic driver in Idaho, and Idaho became a "right to work" state in 1985.
The Panhandle is now mostly Republican, except for Latah County, home to the University of Idaho in Moscow. Latah County is one of just three counties Mr. Obama won in 2008.
The only truly blue county in Idaho is Blaine County in the Magic Valley. Blaine County includes the ski-resort city of Sun Valley and next-door Ketchum. Both towns have attracted affluent, liberal transplants from other states.
 The Bellwether: Kootenai County 
Kootenai County, anchored by Coeur d'Alene, is an emerging bellwether in Idaho. Historically the center of a region with a natural resources-based economy, Coeur d'Alene is now also a tourist destination, Mr. Adler said. And Kootenai County has reflected the political shift in Northern Idaho generally - once Democratic, now Republican.
In the 2000 presidential election, Kootenai County was three percentage points more Democratic than the state. In 2004, it was two percentage points more Democratic. And in 2008, it was almost perfect.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Romney is a 100 percent favorite to carry Idaho, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. It's hard to overstate just how Republican Idaho is. The state has had Democrats in office, notably Cecil D. Andrus, the governor from 1971 to 1977 and again from 1987 to 1995, and Frank Church, who was a United States senator from Idaho from 1957 to 1981.
But those days seem largely over. Idaho is now thoroughly Republican.
The one trend in Idaho that Democrats can pin their hopes to, Mr. Adler said, is the state's growing Hispanic population, which is nearing 12 percent, according to the Census Bureau. Agriculture is a dominant industry in Idaho; the state produces about a third of the nation's potatoes (about 60 percent of Idaho potatoes go to making french fries).
Those agricultural jobs have attracted Hispanic workers, and will likely continue to. But it may be a long time before that has any real effect on the politics of the state.

HEADLINE: Now Entering the Month of Surprise

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As President Obama and Mitt Romney make their final appeals to voters, it remains to be seen whether October will offer an unexpected pivotal moment as in past campaigns. 

 BODY:
 Surprise! 
 October has arrived, and with it, the specter of an "October Surprise" that might alter the political trajectory of the presidential campaign at the last minute. 
 In 1972,Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state underPresident Nixon,announced that "peace is at hand" in the Vietnam War just days before the election. In 1992,Caspar Weinberger, the defense secretary during the Reagan administration whenGeorge H. W. Bush was vice president, was implicated in the Iran-contra arms scandal four days before Mr. Bush lost the election toBill Clinton. In 2004, Osama bin Laden released a video statement on Oct. 29. 
 Will such a surprise happen again? In 1980, the nation held its collective breath waiting for an October release of the Iranian hostages; it did not happen until hours afterRonald Reagan's inauguration. It is possible that October comes and goes this year without a pivotal moment. 
 But if it does come, here are five possibilities: 
 A DEBATE MOMENTPresident Obama andMitt Romney will stand next to each other on a stage three times during October. Each one of those debates will provide an opportunity for an October Surprise that might change the trajectory of the 2012 campaign.
That surprise might come in the form of a gaffe that raises new questions about one of the men. Or it could be a surprise policy proposal offered as a Hail Mary pass to alter the political discussion. Or it could be a striking stylistic observation that changes the way voters assess the two candidates.
 FOREIGN POLICY The events in Benghazi, Libya, in September were a vivid reminder of how quickly an event overseas can hijack the political news cycle in America - and often rightly so. The Libyan situation is important in its own right, but so are the reactions to it by Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
What else could pop up on the world stage in October? More re-evaluations of the terrorist attack that killed the ambassador to Libya? Developments in the Iranian nuclear drama? Dramatic economic collapses in European nations already weakened and teetering? Something totally unexpected?
 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Here at home, there will be one more opportunity in October for the government to report the jobless rate and other economic data. That will come at the end of this week, on Friday, Oct. 5. Will the unemployment rate go up again, hold steady, or tick down a bit? A slight change in either direction might not matter much, but a dramatic shift would definitely qualify as a potentially critical October Surprise.
There will be one more jobs report, on Nov. 2. But throughout October, the economy will be the single most important subject on the minds of voters. That means that a big gain or loss in the stock market could affect the election. So could big financial news affecting some of the country's largest institutions.
 INVESTIGATIVE NEWS Journalists have already spent years delving into the backgrounds of Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama. But the digging continues, and there is still plenty of room for new revelations that could affect the outcome of the election.
In 2000, just days before the election,George W. Bush was forced to acknowledge that he had a drunken driving conviction in his past. That kind of personal information could yet emerge about one of the two current candidates. If it does, it could affect the small number of truly undecided voters.
For the two campaigns, both of which have elaborate opposition research departments, October is the last hope to peddle damaging information about the opponent.
 UNRELATED INCIDENT Finally, there is always the possibility that something happens in October that has no particular relevance to the election, but steals the spotlight, an event on par with July's shooting in Aurora, Colo., or a natural disaster like the Japanese earthquake.
Both campaigns expect to have the month of October to make their final appeals to voters. If an unrelated event consumes the attention of the news media and the American public, the campaigns will find it harder to break through with their closing messages.

HEADLINE: A Conversation with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: A transcript of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's meeting with editors and reporters of The New York Times, September 26. 

 BODY:
 Following is a transcript of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's meeting with editors and reporters of The New York Times, Sept. 26. 
Q: A year ago, if someone had said Burma would be where it is today, they'd have been locked in a lunatic asylum. What do you think convinced the old regime that it was time for change? 
A: I think these things take on their own momentum. I think they had not expected to move so quickly. But, particularly after the NDL [her party, the National League for Democracy] agreed to take part in the elections, this together with the desire of the government to institute economic reforms, these went together. And then of course there was the legislature. The legislature has turned out to be more workable than I would have imagined, in a democratic way. All these things took on their own momentum, I don't think anyone decided that they're going to go at this particular speed. 
Q: Is it fair to say the sanctions worked? 
A: Yes, I always say that sanctions work. Not in the way people think it did. Now the emphasis is on the economic effect of the sanctions, but I always quote the IMF by saying that for years IMF reports have consistently made the point that the sanctions have affected Burma's economy very little and it was mismanagement that put us in a terrible mess. But partly, the regime started believing their own propaganda that sanctions are responsible for the ills of the country. This always happens. I think the eagerness to go ahead economically, I think the perception was that if you improve the economy, everything else would improve. I don't subscribe to that view, I think you need political reforms as well as economic reforms. So the sanctions needed to be removed, because a lot of people saw them as an obstacle to progress. 
Q: So the sanctions hurt ordinary Burmese but they helped evoke change? 
A: I do not think sanctions hurt ordinary Burmese, as much as the IMF has gone into this and they have concluded that they did not hurt ordinary Burmese. If you remember, the garment industry had a setback after 2007 [when the U.S. prohibited imports] but it picked up very quickly I think it had picked up within a little over a year. 
Q: How quickly do you think the administration is going to move to lift other sanctions? 
A: I think it's going to move quite quickly. I've said I think they're just waiting for the president to make his speech to the [U.N.] General Assembly before announcing that they would lift them. 
Q: Can you talk about China's role? Will there be conflict over Burma between China and the US? 
A: There does not have to be. I have to keep reminding people that before we had a military regime, when Burma was a practicing democracy, we had good relations with the US and with China. I don't see why we shouldn't continue to. 
Q: The Wethmay mine, what's your analysis of the situation? 
A: We have to go back a little, this is why I'm keen on transparency, especially with regard to the extractive industries, because of the opacity of contracts and the way business deals were made, people discovered too late what was going on and discovered they didn't like it. It leads to all kinds of problems. In the end it's transparency that will lead to economic harmony, not just political harmony. 
Q: Are you going to run for president? 
A: You don't run for president in Burma, it doesn't work like that. It's not directly elected. 
Q: Do you aspire to be president? 
A: I must say that the leader of every political party must aspire to be the head of state; otherwise he or she would be letting the party down.

Q: In the next round of elections will there still be spots reserved for the military? How do you bring them along? 
A: According to this constitution, the military must be given 25% of the seats in all assemblies, national and regional. We've been open about the fact that we want to amend the constitution to make it more democratic in spirit as well as in practice. We'd like to do this with the cooperation of the military. We can only do this with the cooperation of the army itself. So we have to work together. There are some that would say how could we do that; the army would make sure that it would have this influence in the legislature, why would they let go. But I think if they understand why it is not desirable for a democratic legislature to have so many seats reserved for a particular block, I think they'll start thinking again. And I don't think that's the most important thing that needs to be changed in the constitution. There are other provisions such as the right of the commander in chief to take over all areas of government. But these I think we'll have to change in consultation with the military. And we've been in the legislature a little over 2 months and we've met members of the military block. We've not been able to establish what we can call close relationships but we have a civilized relationship and I have great hopes that we will be able to understand one another better because as you get to know them you get on better terms. I find our relationship improves rather than deteriorates as we get to know one another. 
Q: Do you think the generals have had that point of view for a while and can speak up now, or did something change them? 
A: It's a little difficult to say because I think there are people who always go along with others whether or not they like the situation and I think those people will always go along with the rest of the crowd as it were. But if they're given the opportunity to bring about changes then they might start rethinking the whole situation for the better. Basically the problem is one of mind set. Even those who want to bring about reforms now, their mind set is very much that of military dictatorship so I don't think it's that they don't want reform, so those that don't seem so enthusiastic about it, perhaps they don't know how to do go about the reform process. 
Q: Talk about the Rohingya [Muslim minority in Rakhine state, in western Myanmar.] There's a sense of disappointment that you haven't been outspoken about human rights abuses against them. 
A: I've always spoken out against human rights abuses but not against a particular community. That I'm totally against and I know that people want me to, they want strong and colorful condemnation, which I won't do, because I don't think it helps. If you condemn one community that makes the other community more hostile towards that community, not towards to me. People forget that when they condemn one community that community gets very resentful. This has actually taken place in Rakhine. Some Buddhists there feel resentment because they feel so much sympathy has been given to the Muslim community when they too are poor and underprivileged. And of course in the recent troubles violence is committed by both sides. So how am I supposed to condemn one side when violence was committed by both? Basically I'm against all human rights abuses and I strongly stand by the principle that human rights must be protected by the rule of law. But I do not think that condemning one community is going to help the other or vice versa. 
Q: So how do you bring reconciliation? 
A: It's not going to happen quickly. I think you have to be practical. These communal problems have been going on for decades and we're not going to be able to reconcile them in one night. This is why I concentrate on rule of law. Because you have to bring down tensions. The present round of problems started with a case of rape as you may have heard. If action had been taken promptly, if justice had been shown to be done, I think it would not have escalated to this extent. Because it was perceived that justice was not done people wanted to take justice into their own hand, which is not justice at all. And this led to an escalation of violence, it was tit for tat. So we keep emphasizing the need for the rule of law. And once tensions have gone down, then we must think about how to proceed. It must be based on sound citizenship laws. There's a sense that these people do not belong to Burma. But then who, who are they? And of course Bangladesh says they don't belong to them either. And this ahs a lot to do with the fact that the border was not properly policed. And each side can claim that they have nothing to do with whichever community they don't want to have anything to do with. 
Q: Would you favor some kind of federalism or regional autonomy? 
A: The NLD has always favored a federal union. This would be supported by the majority of people in Burma because there were years of propaganda in which they equated federalism with the right to secession. We've been trying to make people understand that this is not what federalism means. It just means a system where the powers are divided between the federal and regional governments and right of secession may or may not be part of it. Our ethnic nationalities have said that they are not interested in secession. They do not want to secede. They only want their right to exist as an ethnic nationality with their traditions and customs preserved. This is something we have to work at hard. If we say we're in favor of federalism, which we said and we were attacked very hard by the federal regime, we were pushing for the union to fall apart. 
Q: Back to the mine project, are you saying that contract needs to be renegotiated? 
A: This is the difficulty, you can't just renegotiate a contract, it depends on what was in the original contract, what are the indemnity clauses etc. we know nothing about that. This is why I say transparency is so important for people who wish to do business in Burma; we suffer from lack of transparency. Suddenly something is sprung on us or we realize that things are not going well or are going too far for us to do something quickly. 
Q: There have been reports that Burma began a nuclear program. Can you tell us anything about that? 
A: I don't know more about it than you do; again it's a lack of transparency. What I know I've read about in newspapers and journals. The government has said it's not working on a nuclear project, they were working on a power station. That's the official explanation. I think you'd have to be in the inner circle to know. 
Q: What role would you like the US to play in assisting the transition? 
A: I think the political rule is just as important as the economic role. At the moment there's emphasis on investment, which is natural because Burma's a completely new investment possibility. And while I welcome investment I'd like to emphasize that we'd like the right kind of investment, the kind that would bring in new players, rather than make the privileged more privileged. We don't want to see the same faces getting all the economic advantages of the country. We also need investments in other places, particularly in education. Our education system needs to be overhauled, the whole system must be improved from preschool to university level. We'd like a lot of help there. And with regard to the political system, I'm not sure the US is the right place to come to when improving relations between the executive and the legislative branches. [Laughter] But they may engage in quite a lot of disagreement, but that doesn't mean the whole country's going to fall apart. We have to learn to agree to disagree but also to do so without fear that the whole country will collapse because we can't agree about something. I think there's still fear that if there's too much disagreement between the legislature and the executive and there were some who were worried that there was friction there in Burma and there were people who were afraid that this would result in a coup and the army would take over. This kind of fear is bad. I think we need to learn from other democracies that you can disagree, very badly, but that that doesn't mean the whole country has to fall apart or that there has to be an army takeover. 
Q: In a country like Egypt, part of the difficulty in the transition has been the military's role in the economy, their reluctance to give up their influence and wealth. How do you negotiate that? 
A: Nobody likes to give up what influence they have. It's not just the military, also civilians with power, they don't like to give it up. The army has not said anything specific about how it feels about its economic influences and power in the country. The important thing is that members should feel secure with regard to their future and if they feel secure, these economic institutions will become negotiable. The reason why the army took over such a part was to strengthen their position. Some wanted to get rich just to get rich, but on the whole I think it was to strengthen their position. 
Q: How do you make them feel secure? 
A: This is something we'll have to work out, won't we? We'll have to make them understand that a civilian government is not there to do them down and that they can work together to make the whole country better for themselves as well as for the rest of the people. 
Q: So you're not thinking of confiscating their wealth 
A: I don't think we can confiscate the wealth of anybody if we don't know what they have. In any case I don't think retribution and vengeance is the first thing on our books. What we want is to build up a society where we can achieve consensus through negotiated compromise. It's not going to be easy. But in some ways we can do this through shared experiences in the legislature.
Q: People have suggested that one issue in the minds of the generals and former generals was a threat of a war crimes tribunal-can you foresee that? 
A: I think some will want that, but I don't think all. 
Q: Would you want that?
A: I wouldn't but that's me. I can't speak for everybody. There would be some who would but I don't think they would be in the majority. Because the Burmese are pragmatic and we're not a particularly vengeful race. 
Q: Can we come back to China? What has been their advice to the generals on the easing? And is Burma just a pawn in a China-India rivalry?
A: I don't know whether the Chinese or any other country advised the government with regard to the easing of the situation, that I don't know. And as for Burma being a pawn, I don't think we're going to let our country be a pawn. We've been good friends with each country for decades. And despite the fact that there was a military takeover our relationship with neither country suffered too badly. There was a time when India was supportive of the democracy movement in Burma and then relations between the two governments were strained but later when India decided to take a more pragmatic approach and engage more with the government tensions seemed to ease. I think we can maintain relationships with both countries without being a pawn. 
Q: Doesn't China have listening posts on islands off shore? 
A: Not that we know of officially. I don't know if your intelligence is better than mine. 
Q: Why don't you have feelings of retribution? 
A: To put it simply, they didn't treat me badly. I'll be quite frank. If I'd been put in prison and tortured perhaps I would have feelings of revenge and hatred. But they only put me under house arrest and they didn't treat me badly at all. I was simply kept in the house. What's wrong with being kept in your house? 
Q: Why didn't they throw you in prison? 
A: I think because I'm my father's daughter. This is the reason. They did put me in prison for a short period of time. 
Q: You've said that you've been making the transition from icon to politician 
A: I really object to that, I always was a politician. I'm making the transition from politician to icon, I want to get back. I've always thought of myself as a politician. After all I went into politics, to party politics, which is about as political as you can get. And I work as a member of the NLD and I'm not somebody apart from it. I'm a politician. I'm here as a politician. 
Q: You mentioned some people want reform but don't know how. Are there any countries you look to as an example? South Africa? Latin America?
A: All of those, as well as Indonesia because that's close to us. And in Southeast Asia of course, they've had a military dictatorship and have had a successful transition, not too painful; all transitions are painful of course. In some ways I think the Burmese model is close to some of the Latin American ones. Although they're far from us geographically. The geopolitics were completely different in Latin America. We also look to the South African model because the anti apartheid movement success came to them at about the time that our movement started gathering force. Because of that we feel close to South Africa. When I was under house arrest it was in 1989, and soon after Nelson Mandela was released, and then they went onto the elections in 1994 and so on. Because of that I feel close to South Africa because this is what I kept hearing about for years. And many people in Burma feel the same way, because South Africa was working, as we were, for change. Of course there were also the eastern European countries as well but their change came very fast, it was not as drawn out as ours as has been and as South Africa's was. It's difficult to say we are like this country. There are things that we would like, like particular countries that we would like our country to be like, in some ways, not in all ways. 
Q: Have you had conversations with them, with the South Africans, about how this might work? 
A: Yes, and with Latin Americans. I've always found them particularly sympathetic starting with Secretary Pérez de Cuellar, they seem to have a feel for those who have suffered under military rule. 
Q: Do the military rulers also look to them? 
A: Yes I think so, if they look outwards they will see that change is not such a bad thing after all. 
Q: The nuclear issue-would Burma benefit from nuclear power and do you see North Korea as an ally in that? 
A: I would not like to see Burma in that position. If Burma is trying to develop nuclear energy for civilian purposes that's a different thing. 
Q: So there's a value in getting into nuclear energy. 
A: I do not see that now. I don't know how much research they did before they went into it because that's what we're told, that this was just an effort toward producing nuclear energy, but I can't say whether or not this is so. 
Q: But a relationship with North Korea, that's not something you would look towards? 
A: I would not look to developing a relationship with another authoritarian government after seeing how much we've suffered under such governments. 
Q: Can you talk about your impressions of this president? He's a former general, you're the son of a general 
A: There are generals and there are generals
Q: Yes. But you've spent some hours with him. Can you talk about him? 
A: I do not know him well personally; I've only met him in the line of work. I'd worked with him only once before, in 2001 when General Than Shwe was still at the helm and we were invited to dinner. I remember this general introduced, he used the term this is the new generation when he introduced us to them. They didn't speak much then, it was the older generation I only met [Thein Sein] after he became president. The first time I met him it was to do with the new registering of the NLD and taking part in the bi elections. He was very helpful and wanted us to be part of the system as it were. He wanted the party to be registered and to run for the elections. And we came to an agreement about how we could go about this. I've had a few more meetings with him which were not as important in some ways, at that meeting we decided it would be possible for the NLA to enter into the legal political process. He's a quiet sort of person and he weighs his words. He obviously thinks beforehand what he's going to say. 
Q: Can you describe the US role in nurturing the transition? 
A: Well first of all the sanctions. They start to assume a tremendous importance. It's a bit of a mystery to me actually. There was a time, I've said this several times, when the state television had a popular singer belting out a song about how they didn't care about sanctions, this was daily, for quite some time. Then suddenly they decided everything that went wrong in Burma was due to sanctions, I don't know how that came about. And then of course the United States became very important because without the removal of the sanctions the economy was not going to be able to move forward. I don't agree with that but this was how we came to have the perception, and then of course reengagement, I have to say I'm totally in favor of engagement, I don't think isolation helps in anyway, and when the United States started to help, it had a real good positive effect on our democratization process. I'm happy about it. 
Q: Should we have engaged earlier? 
A: I've always been in favor of engagement. I think earlier also the US did what had to be done. It was necessary for us to have the US strongly behind our movement for democracy. And I think if the engagement had gone with the US assuming a neutral position with regard to the movement for democracy I don't think we would have been happy about it. 
Q: Do you have a sense of why Thein Sein decided to take Burma in this direction? 
A: I think events took on their own momentum. The reason I think why the president and his advisors decided to change was the country was in such a bad state. The economy was a mess, education systems were nothing to speak of, the health system had broken down, nothing was going right. Even the most hardened military general would have known nothing was going well. And I think reform was needed. But then I think it took on its own momentum. And sometimes I think there is too much emphasis on speed. I think there should be emphasis on order and sequencing, rather than how quickly we can go ahead. 
Q: Did the hurricane exacerbate the structural problems? 
A: I don't think it exacerbated the structural problems, but I think it brought in a lot of international NGOs and it helped strengthen internal NGOs. People started to realize that they'd have to help themselves, they couldn't wait for the government to help them. And that strengthened the move to greater liberalization. And that was empowerment of the people, they learned to empower themselves. But certainly not enough. So I would like to emphasize that our view is that any kind of investment in Burma whether economic or political should be made with a view toward empowering the people and decreasing the dependency on the government. 
Q: What do you see as the main dangers facing this reform? 
A: Disagreements within the administration itself. I don't think it's a great danger by any means, but of course there's always a possibility, there's no such thing as an irreversible democratization because we went overnight from a democracy to a military dictatorship. So you can't say that we've reached a point where this process is irreversible. I like to emphasize that we've got to work toward a point where reversing would be too hard for people to contemplate. But we can't ever say we've reached a point that is irreversible. So we have to go forward. One step at a time. Of course there are those in the forces for democracy who are not happy with how things are going, those who would like a more militant approach or those who do not trust the present administration. You will have heard that there have been a lot of requests that the sanctions not be removed. I disagree because I think it's time that we stood on our own feet, and we can't depend on external pressure forever to take us towards democratization. We would like our friends to stand firmly with us and to keep up an awareness of what's happening in the country and not take it for granted that the reforms would continue. But I think it's time we stopped depending on sanctions to carry forward our democratization process. I'm sorry some people feel threatened that the sanctions are going to be removed. How long do we intend to go on depending on these sanctions? I wanted to give the people a chance to improve their economic situation. 
Q: Do you have a sense there are powerful conservative forces against this? 
A: I wouldn't say powerful but I'm sure there are. I think there are conservatives on the side of democracy as well. When it comes to movement like ours, the conservatives are the militants ones who think the only way you can bring about change is by bringing down the present regime. I consider that conservatism on the part of dissidents. But in the army as well I'm sure there are conservatives, there are conservatives everywhere. Aren't there in the US government? 
Q: Is there anyone who considers you to be a threat to their political survival? 
A: I hope not. I hope if they think I'm a threat they could always come and talk to me about it. 
Q: You ran into some opposition inside Burma when you went to Thailand [and urged investment.} Have you been persuaded to change your position? 
A: No I'm still advocating cautious optimism. The economists are not talking about a gold rush of investors. We don't want one like the Californian gold rush bringing in all kinds of investors. At the World Economic Forum I used the phrase "cautious optimism," and this is translated to Burmese as "good health of negativity"; I think this was a misunderstanding of the expression. Healthy is healthy. As for cautious optimism, one should always be optimistic with caution, especially in a situation like ours, because as you mentioned there are conservative forces, and there are things that could still go wrong, but I have confidence that even if things go wrong for a bit there is enough good will in the country to make the best of this transition. And I think enough good will in the world at large. 
Q: Do you worry about raising popular expectations and then people who are desperately poor realize they still are desperately poor? 
A: I've always realized the potential for this and my campaign; our policy was we don't make promises that we cannot be certain of keeping. I've been very open about this. Burmese people are open and they understand. People want to be treated with respect, which they deserve anyway. If you explain your position to them they understand. I say I can't promise more than our best; we'll try our best. And we're only contesting 44 seats out of the 641 for the national assembly. And with those 44 seats we're not going to be the government, we're not going to be able to bring about major changes. But we'll try our best. We'll try our best through the legislature to bring about the changes they would want. But I know that even when people say yes yes we understand they do hope and this is why we make a point of trying to implement small management projects that will bring about change in the lives of the people in the constituencies where we've won. In mine, we just bought a plot of land and we're building a vocational training center. And we've already started helping some of the free schools run by monks and in some villages we've been helping resettlement, in little ways, whatever we're capable of, because we're not a rich party and we're very particular about the money we get. We have to be a clean party if we're going to survive. So we're not very wealthy, but whatever we have we try to bring about noticeable change to our constituency. The whole country we can't do anything yet. The motions we take we don't usually get through because we are 44 out of 641. But at least people know what we're trying to do. And one of the positive effects of the NLD entering the legislature is people take a lot more interest in what's going on there. It's one of the most popular channels on local television. And there have been a lot of new subscriptions to the channels that show the legislature. So I'm satisfied with the progress we've made. And of course I have to say that the speakers of both houses, they're fair-minded and they don't treat the NLD as the enemy and that helps a great deal. 
Q: Could there be anything else behind the incentives for reform? 
A: It could be because of the constitution. The 2008 constitution assures them that they can remain in a position of power. They feel encouraged to go ahead. In accordance with the constitution, the military can take over all parts of governments whenever it feels it's necessary. So that's a big mandate. This has given them the confidence to go ahead with reforms because it's not going to shake their position of power. 
Q: The next president is chosen in 2014? 
A: 2015. Three candidates are nominated, one by the army, one by the house, one by the lower house. And of those 3 one will be chosen by the joint houses. And it's not direct, it's indirect. 
Q: You intend to be one of those? 
A: I don't' think I can be, under the present constitution, because if any members of a family have foreign nationality then you can't be eligible 
Q: So the constitution would need to be changed? 
A: Yes
Q: And how quickly can you do that? 
A: It depends on how quickly we come to an understanding with the military. In order to amend the constitution you have to get more than 75% of the votes. Since the army holds 25% at least all civilians and one soldier would need to agree. 
Q: You said earlier you don't know what's going on in the country 
A: I didn't say I didn't know what's going on in the country; I said I don't know that's going on in the minds of the government. Do you know what's going on in the mind of Obama? It's normal and natural not to know what's going on in the minds of those in government but that doesn't mean you're going to compromise your own agenda. 
Q: You've minimized the sacrifice you've made-did you ever consider just leaving? 
A: No and I never felt unfree. I liked staying in the house and reading. Many people don't see their families. And my colleagues in prison had it much worse because not only did they not see their families, sometimes they didn't see their families for years. It was the policy of the government to send prisoners far from their homes. And not only could they not see their families they always had to worry about their safety. I didn't have that worry. I may not have been able to see my family but I knew they were perfectly all right, not going to be thrown out of their jobs or their homes. I don't think about this in terms of personal sacrifice. I always say this is something I chose to do, nobody pushed me into it. And I do believe in responsible, the responsibility that citizens should take for their own country. If I believe in this I must do what I can, as others have done.

HEADLINE: Oracle's New Cloud Computing Bets

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Lawrence J. Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle, kicked off his annual show with the announcement of a new cloud database and a very fancy new machine for storing and processing lots of data. His claims will be disputed, but what is clear is how fast this industry, and a lot of other businesses, are about to change. 

 BODY:
When Lawrence J. Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle, is selling his products, the claims may need a little checking, but the tone is perfect for the times.
On Sunday evening in San Francisco, Mr. Ellison kicked off his Oracle OpenWorld gathering before an audience of 10,000 engineers and businesspeople, bathed in lights of Oracle red. Supposedly one million more people watched online.
He made several big product announcements for enterprise computing. Oracle is offering the cloud computing service it introduced last year as a separate entity, which can be leased by business and kept behind their own security firewalls. Oracle has a new cloud database, called 12c, which is a sharply different way of accessing a database in cloud computing. Oracle has a fancy and fast new piece of computing hardware, which will be available for as little as a list price of $200,000, with deep discounts beyond that.
Some of Mr. Ellison's claims that went with the announcements will doubtless be disputed by the competition. While this may indeed be "the first multi-tenant database in the world," as Mr. Ellison said, Amazon Web Services has for some time offered traditional relational database services in its cloud. He said the new hardware could shift data twice as fast as machines from EMC, and costs one-eighth as much as machines from I.B.M.
 Expect some pushback from those vendors.
Between the lines, however, Mr. Ellison delivered some important truths:
For one, the big incumbent Silicon Valley companies, like Hewlett-Packard and Oracle, are taking cloud computing for business very seriously. They plan to go up against cloud challenges from Amazon and Google by promising better security, reliable industry standard practices, and a higher quality of services. They are selling these aspects to the top levels of the company, while Amazon and Google have succeeded by reaching to individual engineers and department heads. In other words, the incumbents are using their existing business relationships, and their knowledge of how much big business values peace of mind.
For another, the companies are going further down the food chain than ever before. At these prices, Oracle sees its cloud offerings as good products for small and medium-sized businesses. That is probably true, and it means that thousands, perhaps millions, of businesses will soon be in the cloud in some form, generating and analyzing data in very large volumes. If that is so, a lot of now-exotic business practices, from mobile computing strategies to Big Data analysis, will soon be commonplace.
Lastly, it means that the fight among all players is going to reach a fever pitch a lot faster than most tech executives would have predicted a year or two ago. Companies that were onstage with Mr. Ellison a year ago, like EMC, got called out for a razzing. SAP, which has had a comeback with its fast data processing, will have to step up its game, now that Mr. Ellison has a machine that (he says) can process 52 times as much data as SAP's offering. 
And, quite possibly, we are about to head for another great hallmark of technology transitions, standards wars, where customers try to figure out which company is likely to survive, and which of those likely survivors wants to lock them into an expensive proprietary range of products.

HEADLINE: Aurora Victim Pushes Gun Issue With New Ad

BYLINE: ERICA GOODE


HIGHLIGHT: A victim in the Colorado massacre used a new ad to push the issue of gun control. 

 BODY:
Stephen Barton was supposed to spend the fall teaching English in Russia on a Fulbright fellowship. But shortly after midnight on July 20, a gunman in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., derailed those plans.
 Still recovering from the wounds he sustained when the gunman opened fire that night, killing 12 and injuring dozens more, Mr. Barton has decided to devote his energies this fall to something entirely different: Trying to get the presidential candidates to address the touchy issue of guns and gun violence.
 In a television advertisement to begin airing on Monday, Mr. Barton, seated in an empty movie theater, tells viewers that despite the injuries from 25 shotgun pellets that embedded themselves in his face and neck, he was lucky.
"In the next four years, 48,000 Americans won't be so lucky, because they'll be murdered with guns in the next president's term, enough to fill over 200 theaters," Mr. Barton, 22, says in the advertisement. "So when you watch the presidential debates, ask yourself, 'Who has a plan to stop gun violence?'"
The advertisement will appear in Colorado and on cable stations in Washington and other cities across the country, said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bipartisan coalition of more than 725 mayors that is sponsoring the ad as part of its "Demand a Plan" campaign.
 After the shooting spree in Aurora, both presidential candidates offered their condolences to the victims and their families. President Obama traveled to Aurora to visit the injured. Mitt Romney said, "Our hearts break with the sadness of this unspeakable tragedy." 
 But any discussion of how to prevent gun violence has been noticeably absent in presidential campaigns that have focused on the economy and foreign policy issues. 
 Both candidates have backed gun control measures in the past, Mr. Obama as a legislator and Mr. Romney as governor of Massachusetts, where he raised the fee for gun licenses and signed a ban on assault weapons.
 But at a time when national surveys show waning support among Americans for tougher gun laws and when politicians who broach the issue face swift attack by the National Rifle Association and other gun groups, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have instead stressed their support for Second Amendment rights.
 Mr. Barton, who graduated from Syracuse University in May and had stopped in Aurora for a few days while on a cross-country bicycle trip, said that before the shooting, he had followed the presidential campaign from a distance. 
 But what happened that night at the theater made it much more personal.
"I couldn't sit back and be just frustrated at the direction of the discourse or the lack of discourse," he said. "I guess I just felt some responsibility."
 He deferred his Fulbright fellowship and, through contacts in Washington, signed up with the mayors' coalition, where he will spend the year working on gun control issues.
"We have this giant shooting and it's really sad that we can't even have a discussion about it," he said. "Really, more than anything, we just want to candidates to start talking about it in a way that's beyond just condolences."
 And if the advertisement fails to convince the candidates, he added, "At least it might convince regular American citizens to think about it."

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid of Virginia?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The outcome of the senate race between Tim Kaine and George Allen will reverberate far beyond the state's borders. 

 BODY:
Manassas, Va.
Last December, toward the end of an early debate between the Senate candidates in Virginia, George Allen was clearly ill at ease. In one of the most competitive contests in the country, two former governors - Allen, a Republican, and Tim Kaine, a Democrat - are vying to replace Jim Webb, who is giving up the seat after just one term.
Kaine was in the midst of attacking proposed federal legislation of Allen's, which declares that life begins at conception. Kaine pointed out that it would make many forms of contraception illegal: 
The way a birth control pill works is often to stop a fertilized egg's embryo from implanting in a woman's uterus.
Allen's "personhood" legislation, Kaine said, would 
criminalize women's right to make their own reproductive decisions. That is an intrusive, big government way of coming at a problem that is just exactly the kind of problem that government really can't solve and shouldn't be trying to solve.
Kaine's line of argument appeared to catch Allen off guard. "Contraception," Allen said,
just by the word means "contra," means there is not conception. So I don't see a personhood amendment or the recognition of life beginning at conception as preventing contraception.
The moderator intervened: "About the contraception question, could you tell us how do you think birth control pills and intrauterine devices work?"
Allen: "I don't profess to be a doctor. I'm just using logic, maybe a little bit of Latin, that contraception means it stops conception. And so you do not have a fertilized egg."
Moderator: "Don't they work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg?"
Allen: "Well, if the egg is not fertilized there is not conception."
Fortunately for Allen, the conversation shifted to other subjects.
It's not often that a political debate gets down to this level of detail on the mechanics of conception, but all that has changed this year.
In February, the Virginia State Senate passed an informed consent law requiring that women seeking an abortion first undergo transvaginal ultrasound, a highly controversial procedure. The reaction in many quarters of Virginia and in the country at large was voiced in an editorial in the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot on Feb. 3:
Inserting something into the vagina of an unwilling woman is a violation in every sense of the word. But not to a majority of Virginia's Senate.
"In a scarcely veiled effort to make abortion impossible," the newspaper added, "21 senators used the power of government to do something grotesque."
Nearly half a century after the sexual revolution, the politics of that revolution have hit Virginia with a vengeance. Kaine, a social and cultural liberal, who in almost all public polls has now taken a modest lead, has benefitted from the actions of the Republican majority in the both houses of the General Assembly.
They are not the only Republicans unintentionally helping him. He has also profited from the behavior of Virginia's Republican governor, Bob McDonnell - who was about to sign the transvaginal probe legislation into law when it blew up into a national issue - and the rulings of Kenneth Thomas "Ken" Cuccinelli II, the Republican state Attorney General. We'll get to that in a minute.
The Senate race here has become a testing ground for how far social conservatives can push their agenda - and continue to win elections - in a rapidly changing southern state with a burgeoning population of college-educated voters as well as many more ethnically diverse voters. The controversies in Virginia reflect the potentially explosive political consequences when the more abstract anti-abortion (and anti-gay marriage) provisions of the 2012 Republican Party platform are translated into concrete policies at the state and local level. While Republicans have been successful in recent years across the South, cultural and demographic trends here in Virginia suggest they may be pushing the outer limits.
Cuccinelli, the Attorney General, has acted on two fronts to enforce conservative policies on reproductive and gay rights. In July, he pressured members of the state Board of Health to adopt tough new requirements forcing abortion clinics to meet health and safety standards, standards that liberals contend would force many such clinics to close.
"Should a board member choose to disregard the Attorney General's advice and subsequently be named in a lawsuit," Cucinelli wrote to the board, "it is within the discretion of the Attorney General to decline representation of the board member." Legal representation, that is.
In a separate opinion, Cuccinelli declared that public colleges and universities cannot adopt rules barring discrimination against gays:
It is my advice that the law and public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibit a college or university from including "sexual orientation," "gender identity," "gender expression," or like classification, as a protected class within its non-discrimination policy, absent specific authorization from the General Assembly.
In an interview, Kaine told me that the political repercussions of Republican initiatives on reproductive issues 
have been palpable. They have created a real awareness among people that we can't take for granted things like contraception and women being able to exercise a constitutional choice to make their own decisions about pregnancy. It's been very, very energizing.
There is a self-evident truth in contemporary politics: any constituency angered, threatened or fearful of the way the state exercises power is motivated to turn out to vote. The converse rule is: voter turnout declines among those groups whose goals and agendas are protected by those in power.
In Virginia, this means that social liberals are strongly motivated to go to the polls on Nov. 6 to express their opposition to policies supported by Republican state officials.
Anti-abortion and anti-gay rights initiatives in the state have translated into a gender gap favoring Kaine. A Sept. 19 Fox News poll gave Kaine a 4-point advantage, 47-43, due entirely to women, who favored Kaine 48-40, while men were split, 44-44. The same pattern emerged in a Sept. 19 Washington Post poll, which had Kaine ahead 51-43, with men split evenly, but women favoring Kaine by 14 points.
The running average of the six most recent Virginia Senate polls maintained by RealClearPolitics gives Kaine a 4.4 point advantage, ranging from 1 to 8 points.
Reproductive issues aside, Allen faces another quandary: the demographics of Virginia are passing him by. The regions of the state that are growing fastest are increasingly Democratic metropolitan counties.
A June 2011 article based on 2010 census data, "A Decade of Change in Virginia's Population," by demographer Qian Cai of the University of Virginia, found that:
Virginia's population continues to concentrate in three large metropolitan statistical areas: Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Hampton Roads. These three areas combined are home to 70 percent of the state's population and accounted for 82 percent of the state's total population growth. Northern Virginia alone composed more than half of the state's growth. Three of its counties (Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William), fueled by high birth rates and large net in-migration, generated 40 percent of the state population growth.
This map from the Cai paper shows the patterns of population gains and losses in the state:
The fastest growing counties have moved decisively in a Democratic direction. In another paper, "Demographic Change and Evolving Voting Patterns in Virginia," Craig Leonard Brians and Logan Vidal of Virginia Tech graphed the shifts in voting:
Even as partisanship has undergone a class and education inversion, with Democrats like Kaine doing better among more affluent and better educated voters, the percentage of Virginians with a college degree or more has grown from 29.5 percent to 33.8 percent in 2010, (nationally the figure was 27 percent). Median household income in Virginia in 2010 was $61,406, compared to $51,917 nationally.
Throughout most of this past year, Allen and allied groups like American Crossroads and the Chamber of Commerce have dominated the airwaves, hammering Kaine's ties to President Obama (Kaine served as chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2009 and 2010) and stressing Kaine's support for Obamacare. Kaine, in turn, did not launch his own television campaign until Aug. 23.
One ad aired by American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Karl Rove, accused Kaine of being more preoccupied with Obama and Washington than with Virginia. Another ad by Crossroads GPS (it stands for grassroots policy strategies), an affiliated 501(c)(4) issue advocacy organization, asked, "Does Tim Kaine actually want to destroy defense jobs in Virginia?"
An Allen ad described Kaine as running to be "President Obama's Senator." A recent Allen press release reiterates the Obamacare theme:
Kaine: ObamaCare Will Be Great For Virginia: As President Obama's Unabashed Supporter, Kaine Touted ObamaCare As A "Great Achievement" That Would Be Good For Virginia.
A Chamber of Commerce ad asks viewers to call Kaine and ask him why he supports "job killing" Obamacare.
Both the Kaine and Allen campaigns have received considerable outside financial support for TV and radio advertising, with Allen receiving significantly more ($6.7 million to Kaine's $4.3 million).
The Senate Majority PAC, a liberal tax-exempt independent expenditure committee, is the biggest outside spender on the Democratic side. It has run tough ads accusing Allen of voting for hundreds of earmarks when he was a senator (he lost his seat to Webb in 2006), for raising the debt ceiling, for tax breaks for the oil and gas industry and for legislation raising his own pay as a senator.
While most polls show Kaine pulling ahead, both campaigns are downplaying these trends, although for different reasons. Kaine's strategists are determined to portray the contest as dead even in order to make sure that supporters and organizers do not slack off before Election Day. Allen's backers worry that their loyalists will see downward poll trends and decide that the election is lost, making the effort of voting pointless.
Virginia is one of a handful of states that will determine which party controls the Senate in 2013, when Congress will face the most important fiscal issues in decades. These issues include the question of whether the Bush tax cuts should be kept or killed; whether Congress can again reach agreement on raising the debt ceiling; and whether the House and Senate can find an alternative to the threatened sequestration - across the board cuts - of $50 billion in defense spending and $50 billion in domestic programs that leaders of both parties view as a danger to the national interest, not to mention politically suicidal.
The Senate race here will play a significant role in determining the influence of the left and right on two central questions.
The first: Will Republicans enter 2013 strengthened in their adamant opposition to tax increases of all kinds, or will the results serve to chastise the party and intensify the pressure to compromise?
The second: Can the Republican Party maintain its fragile alliance between economic and social conservatives? The political costs to the Republican Party of rewarding social conservatives are beginning to outweigh the benefits in a state that is undergoing dramatic demographic transformation.
If Allen loses, it will be a national setback to the anti-tax wing of the Republican Party and a defeat for the Christian right. Both groups will be emboldened if he wins. In other words, the outcome of Kaine vs. Allen will reverberate far beyond Virginia's borders.
