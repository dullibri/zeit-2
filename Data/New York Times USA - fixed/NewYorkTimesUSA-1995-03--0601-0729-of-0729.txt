HEADLINE: The World;
Call It Aid or a Bribe, It's the Price of Peace

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT the height of the cold war, Hans Morgenthau, the political theorist and champion of Realpolitik, identified the three tools of the statesman as logic, bribes and threats.
 Those may have been the power tools of his time, but no more. And the consequences are enormous. The United States has been left with immense power, but it doesn't quite know how to use it. Again and again, it seems unable to focus its authority and lead others toward a solution for the problems of the day. 
 Logic is not an easy tool to use in foreign policy now, because a shared ideology no longer unites the United States and its allies against a common adversary. Even a realist like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger is at a loss to describe the world in a comprehensive way. He told a conference in Washington recently: "It's probably not possible to have one overarching concept."
 Threats of military intervention are less meaningful, too, because Americans have no stomach to sacrifice lives for what they think are lost causes rather than vital interests. And because the Pentagon resists mounting any military operation except with massive force, the price is usually too high.
 The 1991 gulf war aside (price tag: $61 billion), other figures prove the point. Saddam Hussein cost the United States and its Persian Gulf allies $500 million in a military buildup simply by moving some of his remaining troops and tanks to southern Iraq last fall. The Pentagon estimates that a NATO operation to protect a withdrawal of the 40,000 United Nations peacekeepers from Bosnia and Croatia would cost more than $1.5 billion, with the United States footing one-third to one-half of the bill.

 
 
Easy Bribes
 That leaves bribes as the easiest and most cost-effective way to change behavior and make peace. The irony is that at a time when peace is a bargain and a little money goes quite a long way, there is a global disinclination to spend. Budget constraints and the absence of a clearly identifiable threat make it harder to argue that investing in peace -- grants, loans and credits -- is an investment in security at a fraction of the price of war. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made that point in briefing President Clinton on this year's foreign aid budget request. His slide show included graphs that pointed out that it cost $215 million in 1993 to help pay for peacekeepers, elections and economic development in Cambodia, compared to $940 million for one week of war in Vietnam in 1968.

 
 
Bad Investments
 Of course, investing money in a place in hopes of peace doesn't always work. The United States spent $390 million in development investments in Somalia over three decades, only to be faced with almost $2 billion in costs for a 16-month emergency operation.
 Still, countries and movements that have taken risks for peace want the answer to a basic question: If peace is so much cheaper than war, where's the payoff?
 "There are neither the threats nor the ideology to mobilize people," said Stanley Hoffmann, chairman of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University. "So there are some bribes, but with very little money. That means there is no way you can assure a foreign leader, 'I have it in my pocket.' It limits your room for maneuver considerably."
 Take the case of Jordan. Had King Hussein followed Egypt's lead and made peace with Israel in 1979, he would not be in the humiliating position he finds himself in today. He is keenly aware that the United States, as part of the deal struck at Camp David, has since spent well over $75 billion in aid on Egypt and Israel; and even in today's slash-and-burn climate, their annual $5.1 billion in American aid -- nearly 40 percent of the entire aid budget -- is considered politically untouchable by the Congress (at least for now).
 So the King didn't seem to be asking for much in exchange for a peace treaty, just $488 million to pay off Jordan's debt from the United States. President Clinton promised he would, and delivered almost half last year. ("I'm not going to offer something that I can't deliver on," he told the King.) But Mr. Clinton did not push Congress to approve the remaining $275 million needed, and Congress approved only $50 million. Now the Administration may have to cut most other countries' aid by 20 percent if the President's promise to the Jordanians is to be fulfilled.
 Yasir Arafat is having similar money woes. The United States spent $100 million in 1994 and will spend another $100 million this year, hardly enough to build the housing, public service installations and administration that are sorely needed in Palestinian-run areas. Still, Washington has done better than many of its Arab allies. As punishment for Palestinian support for Iraq in the gulf war, Kuwait has paid Mr. Arafat only $10 million for his fledgling government. The United Arab Emirates has paid only $5 million and Qatar nothing. The result is that the World Bank-administered fund to cover Mr. Arafat's operating expenses is flat broke.

 
 
Who Cares?
 So what, say many of the Republicans who dominate Congress, where resistance to underwriting peace in the absence of a threat of war runs deep. Case in point: the recent decision in the House of Representatives to slash $110 million from the $160 million the Administration pledged for building housing for Russian soldiers in exchange for Moscow's troop withdrawal from the Baltics last year. Since $40 million has already been spent, it would end up costing the United States more than the remaining $10 million to break the contracts, pay the lawyers and come home.
 "I would invite you to come back to my district in Cincinnati some time, and perhaps justify paying for housing for former Soviet officers," Representative Steve Chabot, a freshman Republican from Ohio, snapped at Assistant Secretary Richard C. Holbrooke when he criticized the move during a recent hearing.
 Mr. Holbrooke replied that he would be happy to talk to the people of Cincinnati, wondering aloud why the Congressman could not understand that, after spending hundreds of billions of dollars during the cold war, $110 million was a small investment in peace.
 "We say that about everything, do we not?" Mr. Chabot replied. " 'It is only $110 million, you know.' "
 Granted, there are the exceptions. North Korea behaved badly by developing nuclear weapons; it was paid off with an American-brokered agreement creating an international consortium to give its government $4 billion in energy aid and light-water reactors in exchange for freezing and dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The agreement is in jeopardy not for lack of money, but because of North Korea's refusal to allow South Korea to build the reactors.
 But in most cases, the United States finds itself frustrated in trying to change the behavior of intractable leaders or reward those who take risks for peace when there is no possibility of a payoff.
 "For most of the postwar period the United States felt it had an obligation to create a system, and then to insure that it survives," said Charles William Maynes, the editor of Foreign Policy magazine, who predicted a decade ago that the ability to use logic, bribes and threats would diminish. "There was a sense of stewardship, that we had an obligation to protect the system, not just exploit it. Increasingly, we are exploiting it, and there is no steward left."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Still Looking to the Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
ANYONE tempted to think it will be easy to keep restricting Iran's and Iraq's access to the world's oil markets might consider these facts:
 The Middle East holds two-thirds of the world's oil reserves. At the rate the world is increasing its use of oil, it will need 10 million more barrels a day by the year 2000. Some analysts and economists say the Middle East is the only place where that extra 10 million barrels a day can be brought into production fast enough. 
 And if American companies don't help develop it, others are certain to try.
 That means the United States is in for a difficult balancing act in what little remains of the 20th century: it will be more reliant than ever on Middle Eastern oil as it tries to pick and choose which of the region's countries should be allowed to produce and sell it.

 
 
Watch Prices Rise
 So the outlook seems to be for a gradual rise in prices and a lot of political arguments about the impact of oil deals. That is the real meaning of what happened this month when Conoco backed off from its deal to help Iran develop a new oil field.
 Past Administrations, of course, have grappled with similar quandaries as they sought to balance support for Israel with a need to keep relations open with Arab oil suppliers. Twenty years ago, though, there was a difference: a much more unified Arab world could threaten to withhold its products from American gasoline pumps.
 Now, in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, with Arab unity shattered and with oil prices long depressed, a new oil embargo is no longer a threat. What appears more likely is a creeping price rise as oil companies and Arab lands jockey for the financial resources with which to develop new oil fields.
 "There is no other place but the Middle East to add significant production," said John H. Licht-blau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a consulting group.
The tens of billions of dollars that will be needed to bring proven fields into production can no longer be generated by the Middle East producers themselves. All of them, including Saudi Arabia, have been traumatized by the 1980's collapse of oil prices followed by the staggering cost of the gulf war itself, and they need what revenue remains to meet their own drives to modernize and satisfy social needs at home.
 How else could higher demand be met? Newly discovered fields in Colombia offer one hope, and Russia another.
 Western oil companies have shown particular interest in Russia's huge reserves, but efforts to make deals that will bring them into production have become mired in political infighting, even as Russian exports from existing fields decline. So while Western oil companies are in Russia for the long haul, it is uncertain when that country's exports will begin to recover.
 Meanwhile, even though oil companies have shown a surprising ability to squeeze more oil out of maturing fields (the North Sea is an example), American domestic production has been declining, as the output from fields in Alaska's North Slope declines and many other fields mature. Despite some new investment and exploration, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, there is little hope the decline can be reversed.
 That leaves the Middle East. Eventually, some analysts believe, the major American oil companies will have to be allowed to help countries that have been branded sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Iraq and Libya, bring more fields into production.

 
 
Indulgences
 The alternative, they argue, would be tighter supplies and significantly higher prices -- and the political vulnerability such conditions bring. The industrial world still needs a steady flow of cheap oil for its economic well-being, not to mention indulgences like sport utility vehicles that deliver about 16 miles to the gallon.
 In fact, the dependency of the United States on oil imports has been growing. Last year it averaged about 8.9 million barrels a day or 45 percent, compared with about 30 percent in 1984. Even at moderate oil prices the United States spent about $45 billion last year to pay for imported oil, making it a major contributor to the trade deficit.
 There is some breathing room. Iraq, which can produce 4 million barrels a day, could put off a squeeze if the international community finds its behavior acceptable enough to re-admit it to the world market. Saudi Arabia also has spare capacity, which it is now holding back to support the drive by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices by limiting production.
 None of this means that spiking the Conoco deal with Iran will have any immediate impact on oil supplies or prices, or, for that matter, on Iran's ability to expand production. Iran has already turned to a French oil company to pick up the deal that Conoco was shut out of, and American companies still have the option of turning increasingly to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for supplies.
 In other words, while oil prices remain low and supplies plentiful, each side can pursue its politics with little economic risk. Even a bill being sought by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican, that would prevent American companies from buying oil from Iran, would initially change little. Those companies can now buy Iranian oil but cannot sell it directly in the United States. It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Iran would find other companies to sell that oil to the foreigners.
 By the end of the decade, however, the picture could be different. If the predicted squeeze develops, there will probably be more pressure to find a way to allow deals like the one Conoco wanted.
 As prices rise, the need to find some accommodation may seem more compelling.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Leaning More on Middle Eastern Oil" Since 1973, U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East has risen. Analysts expect that oil from the Persian Gulf area, which makes up the bulk of U.S. imports from the Middle East, will be 26% of all U.S. oil imports in the year 2000. Graph shows U.S. imports of oil from the Middle East from 1973 to 2000. (Source: Energy Information Administration)

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Mexico Lives by Virtual Law

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
A KEY to understanding the social and political turmoil going on in Mexico these days is a terse phrase that President Ernesto Zedillo works into almost every one of his speeches. "Rules, clear rules" are what he asks for, telling the Mexican people that he wants to play by the rules in a country where the rules have long been ignored.
 The spectacular arrest several weeks ago of the elder brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on charges of planning a high-profile murder has become the symbol of Mr. Zedillo's vow to place no one above the law. His hard-line approach gained him immediate popularity in these tough economic times. 
 But is Mexican society and culture really ready for an end to impunity? Every nation has its scofflaws and criminals, but few have leaders who concede the way Mr. Zedillo has that the law has become a selective concept. Anyone who has lived in Mexico quickly learns that it has a kind of virtual legality.
 For instance, most streets in Mexico are lined with topes, or bone-jarring speed bumps. Most of those same streets also have traffic lights, stop signs and posted speed limits.
 But millions of Mexicans drivers know that hardly anyone pays attention to legal traffic controls. So they as a society have chosen to put up with the incessant stop-and-go traffic, damaged automobile front ends and rammed rear ends caused by the omnipresent speed bumps. To make it even more unreal, in some intersections the bumps are merely painted on the asphalt to give the impression they are there.

 
 
Timid Enforcer
 "The Mexican Government has become weaker and weaker, almost to the point of being shy, about imposing the rule of law," said Juan Zamora Pierce, president of the Mexican Bar Association. "Consequently, Mexicans realize that there is a rule of law, but that if you don't like it and if you don't obey it, nothing's going to happen."
 The bookshelves in Mr. Zamora Pierce's office are lined with law books filled with carefully written statutes based on Mexico's 1917 Constitution, considered one of the most enlightened in the world. In labor law, for example, Mexicans enjoy constitutionally guaranteed rights to dignified work and just salaries that even workers in the United States do not have. The problem is that the laws are almost never enforced -- one source of the fierce debate over whether the United States should sign the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada in 1993.
 The Constitution itself, while revered, is less than sacrosanct. It has been amended more than 400 times. If the United States Constitution had been tinkered with at the same rate, it would have more than 1,000 amendments instead of 27.

 
 
No More Mr. Nice Guy
 When he went on TV two weeks ago to give Mexicans a pep talk, Mr. Zedillo sounded like a Spanish-speaking Elliot Ness. "Nothing and no one will weaken my resolve to lead the construction of the true rule of law that the Mexican people deserve," he said.
 But which laws are to be applied? Santiago Creel, a lawyer who served as one of Mexico's first citizen watchdogs in last August's presidential election, says that Mr. Zedillo is playing a very dangerous game. He is pledging to enforce laws produced by Mexico's authoritarian Governments at a moment in which the country is trying to turn decisively toward democracy.
 Social needs often decide which laws get enforced and how. Huge and chaotic, Mexico City has laws preventing protesters from blocking streets or roads. But for much of the last decade the Government has allowed the poor to let off some steam by staging big demonstrations. Hardly a day goes by when one group or another hasn't backed up traffic for miles.
 It still takes a tip to get the garbage collected, or the telephone repaired. Less than half the homes in Mexico City pay their water bills. For a long time it was considered a sport to cheat on personal income taxes and from 1929 to 1988 the Government brought only two income tax evasion cases.
 Part of the problem is that those entrusted with enforcing the law are widely believed to be involved in breaking it, which Mr. Zedillo himself had to acknowledge recently when three state police officers stopped a jeep driven by his 19-year-old son Ernesto and, not knowing who he was, tried to rob him. Presidential bodyguards quickly stepped in. No wonder candidates here never promise to put more cops on the streets.
 Mexicans who have lived in the United States and then returned say they are amazed at how rigidly Americans follow the law. "They are like sheep," said a taxi driver, speeding through a red light. A merchant ridiculed Americans penchant for orderliness. "Where do they live? Disneyland?" he wanted to know.
 A middle-class couple in Mexico City neatly demonstrates how differently the law is viewed from both sides of the Rio Grande. He is a dentist, Mexican born, she is an artist, born in Texas. Recently they needed to fill out one of Mexico's innumerable legal forms, another false symbol of a state ruled by law. She tried first, standing on line for hours at a Government office until she ran out of patience. He took over, slipped the clerk 50 pesos, and was back home in 20 minutes.
 Mr. Zedillo has swept clean the Supreme Court and tried a legal route for ending the rebellion in Chiapas. But as he holds up a legal ideal, Mexico seems to have slipped into a pit of lawlessness. Two presidents, three federal prosecutors and three special investigators have, during the past two years, been unable to solve the murders of a cardinal, a president-to-be and a powerful politician.
 One of the investigators, Mario Ruiz Massieu, stands accused of falsifying files to remove the name of Raul Salinas in connection with the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, former secretary general of the ruling party and brother of Mario Ruiz Massieu.
 "Mexico has a solid legal system that is not working properly," Mr. Zedillo said last week in his office. "And that poses a problem." But a problem, it might now be asked, for whom?

HEADLINE: AMERICANS IN IRAQ GIVEN 8-YEAR TERM

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
An Iraqi court today sentenced two Americans to eight years in prison after convicting them on charges of entering the country illegally, the White House said. The Americans were arrested on March 13 near the Kuwaiti border.
The swiftness and severity of their punishment prompted strong condemnation from the Clinton Administration, which had warned only on Friday that Iraq could serve no purpose in holding the men. 
"There is no justification whatsoever for these sentences," the White House said in a terse statement this afternoon.
The Administration has said that the two men, William Barloon, 39, of New Hampton, Iowa, and David Daliberti, 41, of Jacksonville, Fla., civilian employees associated with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, strayed into Iraq by mistake while visiting friends in the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait. While the White House has urged that they be released as a humanitarian gesture, Iraq has shown no sign of forgiveness.
Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti were tried, convicted and sentenced today, according to the State Department, which said it had been so informed by the Polish Embassy in Baghdad, which represents American interests there.
The sentencing adds a major point of friction to the antagonistic relationship between Washington and Baghdad, which has become even more strained in recent weeks as the United States persuaded the United Nations to maintain economic sanctions first imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The timing of the sentencing perplexed French and Russian officials at the United Nations, who have been sympathetic to the Iraqis in their effort to get the sanctions overturned. Indeed, a major review of the sanctions is due in April.
They pointed out that the last time such a review was to take place, in October, the Iraqis began massing troops near the Kuwaiti border.
On Friday, even before the sentencing, American officials at the United Nations said they were determined not to allow the detention of the two men to affect their positions on various resolutions concerning Iraq. That included a resolution to be debated as early as the coming week allowing Iraq to sell up to a billion dollars worth of oil every 90 days to finance its emergency needs for food, medicine and other basic staples.
Only one American has been sentenced to prison in Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf war of 1991. He was released after serving about six months of an eight-year sentence for illegal entry. But Administration officials expressed renewed concern today that Iraq might prove less flexible in this case, in the hope of trading Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti for promises of more gentle treatment from the United Nations.
In a clear attempt to signal that the United States will not bargain, the State Department said today that it had made clear to Baghdad "that Iraq has nothing to gain through this obvious misguided attempt to take advantage of two Americans."
The State Department did not say which diplomatic channels it was using to communicate with Iraq. But Administration officials said that both the Polish Government and the United Nations had served as intermediaries since Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti were arrested, and that they hoped that both would continue to press for an Iraqi change of heart.
Exactly how Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti came to enter Iraq remains something of a mystery. No one has explained how they could have crossed a 10-foot-deep, 16-foot-wide trench built last year by Kuwait along the 130-mile-long border without realizing where they were.
But the Administration has said repeatedly that they acted by mistake, and the State Department repeated that declaration today. "They committed no offense justifying jail sentences," it said. "Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti should be released immediately."
Polish diplomats who were permitted to visit the two men on Thursday reported that both were in good health. But American officials said today that the report also spoke of poor sanitation and food where the two men are being held.
According to The Associated Press, no American officials were present during the one-day trial. Two Polish diplomats who represent American interests in Iraq attended as observers, and the men were represented by a lawyer appointed by the Iraqi Government, according to people close to the case in Iraq who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The A.P. said news organizations were not informed in advance of the hearing, and the state-run Iraq News Agency carried no reports about it. Trials in Iraq are conducted before a judge but without a jury. The maximum sentence for illegally entering Iraq is 20 years in jail.
Both men were employed by a McDonnell Douglas subsidiary that has a contract with the Kuwaiti Government. Their families live in the United States, and the Administration said it was keeping them informed of the situation.

HEADLINE: California Acting on Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 25

 BODY:
While the rest of the country mostly talks of doing something about affirmative action programs, opponents and proponents of such plans in California are moving rapidly to action.
Legislative bills have been drawn. Petitions are being readied. Fund-raising appeals have been mailed. Political consultants are being hired. Television advertisements are being filmed. Grass-roots coalitions are forming and holding rallies. 
 As a result, it now seems likely that by the fall of 1996, and maybe well before then, affirmative action will face an up-or-down vote in California, possibly at the legislative level, but more probably in a plebiscite.
And if polls mean anything, a plebiscite might very well make California the first state to outlaw programs that extend special economic and educational privileges on the basis of sex or race.
The latest surveys show that about 2 of every 3 of the state's voters favor a ban.
Sooner or later, Congress and the legislatures in some other states may get around to acting on the issue. In Washington on Friday, there was a hearing on affirmative action programs on Capitol Hill. On Thursday President Clinton reiterated that White House aides are reviewing programs for him.
But in California, action is superseding talk, meaning that once again the country's most populous and politically powerful state is forging to the fore on a major national issue, much as it did on changes on property taxes and term limits.
"There's a tremendous lot of serious stirring out there now," said Tom Wood, a conservative academic from Berkeley who, along with another San Francisco Bay area professor, Glynn Custred, inspired the drive. They gained instant prominence early this year when they proposed that California take the lead in a rollback of affirmative action programs by holding a voter-initiated referendum on the issue.
"We've got fund-raising letters out," Mr. Wood said. "We've got a political organizer on board. We're opening offices. Everything is go."
Opponents of the rollback are equally active, forming coalitions, drawing up strategies and hiring consultants.
"We're preparing for a fight to the death," said Elizabeth Toledo, the head of the California branch of the National Organization for Women. "We've just printed 40,000 fliers to mail out. We've just finished filming a commercial. We're lobbying like crazy. We're forming coalitions everywhere."
On Thursday, one coalition of a dozen organizations representing women, blacks, civil rights activists, unions and churches held a "No Retreat!" rally in downtown Los Angeles. Speakers warned the state's elected officials that a vote against affirmative action would be followed by political retribution.
"Angry white men -- please!" one demonstrator implored.
In the California capital, Sacramento, no fewer than 10 bills against affirmative action now await action by legislative committees in both the Senate and the Assembly. Hearings on several are set for April 4.
Some of the bills propose passage of laws that would forbid state and local officials from extending special employment and education privileges to anyone on the basis of race or sex. Others seek to have the Legislature put affirmative action on the next election ballot for a statewide vote of approval or disapproval.
From their office in Berkeley, Mr. Wood and Mr. Custred are working with several political consultants and a number of conservative groups, mostly Republican, to come up with a strategy to win passage of at least one of those bills.
Initially they plan to lobby the State Senate and Assembly to approve a statewide vote on the issue. But as the Senate leader, Bill Lockyer, put it the other day, that approach is "a real hard uphill climb" because ballot initiatives require approval by two-thirds of the membership of each house.
Of course, by simple majority votes the Senate and Assembly could pass a state law to ban affirmative action programs. But the Wood-Custred forces say they are wary of that approach because the law would be subject to various crippling amendments as it made its way through both houses.
So, if they fail to get the kind of action they want out of the California Legislature, Mr. Wood and Mr. Custred are prepared to gather enough petition signatures to put the affirmative action issue to a vote.
That approach -- they call it the California Civil Rights Initiative -- was actually what they initially had in mind before deciding to attempt instead the cheaper, less labor-intensive legislative approach.
Arnie Steinberg, a Los Angeles political consultant who is working with Mr. Wood and Mr. Custred, outlined the group's thinking this way: "We know it's iffy that we'll get the two-thirds vote we need to push a ballot initiative through both houses but we've got to try.
"It'll cost a million dollars to gather the 700,000 or so valid signatures needed to go the petition route. We can do that. After all, we've got the polls on our side and we can raise money not only in California but all over the country. So if we can pull it off, why not save our money and our organizing power for the campaign leading up to the vote?"
Presidential politics are adding to the confusion and heating up the debate. If the issue is decided by plebiscite, when should the vote occur?
California voters are next scheduled to go to the polls statewide on March 26, 1996, primary day. But some opponents of affirmative action are lobbying to have the issue placed on next year's November ballot.
They reason that it would then probably be a factor in the outcome of the Presidential race, causing particular trouble for the Democratic nominee.

HEADLINE: Countdown To Pataki Budget Threat

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 25

 BODY:
During almost two months of budget negotiations, Gov. George E. Pataki has sought to gain leverage with the Legislature by threatening to shut down state government if a budget is not enacted by April 1, the start of the fiscal year.
But a week before Mr. Pataki's doomsday deadline, the Republican Governor's warning seems to have created only modest pressure. And a tangle of legal, practical and political problems has led the Governor to reconsider his original plan, leaving it unclear whether he will act on his threat. 
 In an effort to force the first timely budget in 11 years, Mr. Pataki told legislators in January that if a budget was not in place by April 1, he would refuse to approve emergency appropriations to keep the government running, except for functions that "directly affect the health and safety of New Yorkers." Two weeks ago, budget officials raised the specter of widespread temporary layoffs by asking state agencies to determine which employees were essential and which were not.
But in the last week, as the prospects for a timely budget dwindled, the Governor has suggested he might limit his retribution to the more symbolic act of delaying paychecks for himself, the 211 legislators and their 4,462 aides.
That would still be a more strident move than any Governor has taken since 1981, when Hugh L. Carey, faced with a late budget, paid state workers in scrip. But a number of state officials said that Mr. Pataki's move would fall far short of his original threat and could undermine his credibility.
"I think it was unwise to propose it without having thought it through completely," said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat.
Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the Republican Assembly minority leader, said Mr. Pataki was "very cognizant of the fact that he made these statements, and so his first instinct is to do it. If he doesn't do it, I suppose there will be some credibility problem."
Mr. Pataki's original strategy borrowed from the theory of nuclear deterrence: threaten a cataclysm so that opponents would not risk allowing it to happen. But in many ways, the plan has backfired. Mr. Pataki's threat has alienated many of the state's 240,000 public employees, who have lived the last two weeks in fear of losing their paychecks. He has unified and mobilized their unions, which are busy devising legal strategies to fight him in court.
His threat has even dampened the already soggy Albany-area economy by prompting many state workers to defer major purchases, although there is evidence that restaurateurs and retailers have profited from the daily pilgrimages of anti-budget demonstrators to the capital.
Mr. Pataki's action has also invited public rebukes from prominent Republican legislators who represent the thousands of state workers in the Capital District, including the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, of nearby Rensselaer County, and Senator Michael Hoblock of Albany.
"It's most unfortunate that anybody has to resort to tactics like making threats on innocent bystanders," Mr. Hoblock said. "I don't think it applies pressure on anybody."
Democratic legislators have taken to mocking Mr. Pataki's threat, convinced that a government shutdown would hurt him more than them. "I hope he's dumb enough to do it," said one prominent Assemblyman. "I think it blows up in his face."
In the latest Capitol parlor game, lobbyists and legislators are spinning scenarios about the implications of a government shutdown.
For instance, would drivers whose licenses expired during this period have to pay fines for tickets issued by city police officers?
Would the Department of Taxation and Finance continue to require the payment of income taxes by April 15 while refusing to process refunds?
Would the state create a cash crisis by temporarily laying off thousands of workers who would each be owed three weeks of deferred salary and accrued vacation pay?
"Once they look at the practical consequences of their slogans, the roof falls in on them," Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said of the Governor's threat.
Mr. Pataki acknowledged in an interview this week that a shutdown would be fraught with complications. "It's not that simple when you actually have to be in position to do what you say you're going to do," he said.
The Governor said he definitely would not submit or sign the bills needed to pay employees of the Legislature and the Executive Chamber. Beyond that, he said, anything is possible.
"We are going to do ultimately not what is politically right but what we believe is in the best interest of the people of the state," he said.
One possibility is for Mr. Pataki to issue pink slips on April 3, the first work day after April 1, knowing that state law requires a 20-day notice to lay off workers. His gamble would be that the budget would be finished before the layoffs took effect.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is fighting with Mr. Pataki over deep spending cuts, said that a budget would be enacted "when it divides the pain evenly."
"Whether or not they get paid is not going to be a factor in when they think the budget is fair," Mr. Silver said.
Several lobbyists agreed with Mr. Silver that the impact of withholding legislative pay would be minimal, and possibly counterproductive.
"I don't think it will have a big impact, except that it's really going to tick off the Legislature," said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "Up here, politics is personal, and they'll dig in."
Others said that even a broader shutdown might be slow to generate pressure on the Legislature, and could provoke anger toward Mr. Pataki.
"Most direct services don't come from the state and so when you say you're going to shut down state government that's a big yawn," said Norman Adler, a lobbyist and political consultant. "All you do is anger state workers, and they'd be hard pressed to blame the Legislature."

HEADLINE: Special Interests' Special Weapon

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
They look like grass-roots movements but are actually campaigns manufactured by special interests. They are becoming an increasingly popular way to try to influence Congress -- so popular, in fact, that there is a new name for them in Washington. They are called "Astroturf."
Unlike traditional lobbying efforts, which seek to sway politicians directly through office visits, position papers and campaign contributions, Astroturf efforts seek to influence them indirectly by changing the climate of public opinion, largely through television advertising. At a time when there is growing distrust of anything emanating from official Washington, Astroturf campaigns have the advantage of offering at least a semblance of populism. 
 "Folks in Washington are so discredited that nowadays one needs the embrace of 'the public,' " said Thomas Mann, a Congressional specialist at the Brookings Institution.
Experts attribute the growth of synthetic grass-roots movements to the apparent success of last year's Harry and Louise campaign, in which actors played a yuppie couple worried about President Clinton's health care initiative. The campaign, sponsored by the insurance industry, was widely credited with helping to turn public opinion against the Administration's plan.
"It's the logical conclusion of the health care debate," said Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University who studied the effects of the health care ads. "Interest groups learned that the best way to get their message out is by putting an ad on TV. They're trying to frighten members of Congress into believing there's a groundswell of support out there."
To be sure, interest groups' attempts to drum up public support for their positions are not new; advocacy advertising has long been standard in newspapers, and almost all lobbying campaigns include efforts to shape news coverage and, through it, public opinion. What is new, experts say, is the alacrity with which groups now mount television advertising campaigns to influence opinion, often without the public's ever becoming aware of who is doing the influencing.
"The lesson that people drew from Harry and Louise's putative success is that television advertising is a surrogate form of lobbying," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. "You're going to see more of it, and on increasingly narrow issues."
One interest group clearly trying to match the success of Harry and Louise is made up of businesses favoring legislation that would discourage lawsuits by shareholders and consumers. When the House was debating the legislation, several groups backed by corporations launched television ad campaigns in support of the bills. The measures passed the House, although their fate in the Senate is uncertain.
In the last few weeks alone, several other groups have also mounted television campaigns to help stimulate grass-roots drives. They include the Republican National Committee, which ran commercials asking viewers to urge their Democratic senators to support the balanced-budget amendment, and U.S. Term Limits, a nonpartisan advocacy group that has run ads in several districts criticizing Republicans for backing away from the proposal to limit the tenure of Federal lawmakers.
In a particularly unusual campaign, former Representative Michael Huffington, the wealthy Republican businessman defeated by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California last year, is running television ads in her home state and in Washington, exhorting viewers to chastise her by telephone for her vote against the balanced-budget amendment.
The television campaigns are not restricted to national issues. In New York, for instance, a coalition of labor and health care groups has taken to the airwaves to criticize Gov. George E. Pataki's budget-cut proposals, while the state's Republican Party has mounted an ad campaign urging viewers to call Democratic legislators to voice support for the Governor's welfare plan. One union representing state workers, the Civil Service Employees Association, has been running a television ad explictly modeled on Harry and Louise; in it, a couple, Lou and Harriet, argue about Mr. Pataki's budget.
There is no way to quantify the amount of advocacy advertising on the air. Advertising is not an expense that lobbying groups are required to report, and most of the advocacy advertising appears on local stations rather than on the networks. The broadcast networks, in fact, generally do not accept advocacy ads, arguing that debates over public policy should be handled by their news departments, which can give a fair hearing to both sides.
But most people who follow the trends in political advertising -- politicians as well as political scientists -- say the amount of advertising on public policy issues is growing. "Twenty-five years ago national political campaigns were grass-roots efforts," said Carter Eskew, a Democratic political consultant. "Now national campaigns are 60 to 70 percent advertising. It may very well be that's where we're heading with issues, too."
Experts say one reason television advertising is so powerful a tool for shaping public opinion is that viewers become absorbed in the ads without knowing until the end the identity of the sponsor. Even then it is often unclear, because frequently the sponsor has formed a front group with an innocuous name. And no matter what the actual interests at stake, the ads are almost invariably cast in terms of just plain folks.
Last year's Harry and Louise ads, for instance, steered clear of any direct reference to the insurance industry's concerns, instead couching their opposition to the President's health care plan as a matter of consumer choice.
Similarly, this year's ads in favor of tort reform have avoided mention of corporate interests. Rather, they have framed the issue as one of ordinary citizens versus greedy lawyers and opportunistic plaintiffs.
An ad paid for by Citizens for a Sound Economy, for example -- a group that counts among its major donors companies like Cigna and R. J. Reynolds -- invoked the much-cited case of the Albuquerque woman who sued McDonald's for serving her scalding coffee. "Fewer people nowadays are willing to accept responsibility for their own doin's," an affable-looking old man says in the ad. "I tell you, the system is out of whack." At the end, the man urges viewers to call their Representative, who is mentioned by name according to the district in which the ad is appearing, and urge the legislator "to stand up to the lawyers."
Brent Bahler, a spokesman for Citizens for a Sound Economy, said the group had run the ad in 60 Congressional districts, at a cost "in the upper six figures."
"We've heard from people -- and I'm not going to name names -- that their phones were ringing off the hook," he said. "They asked us, 'Please stop the ads.' " Mr. Bahler said his group had complied only in districts where the Representatives agreed in writing to support the three-bill package. "Ten or eleven gave in," he said.
Lawmakers who were named in the group's ads acknowledged that the campaign had produced a significant number of calls. But they questioned whether the ads had really brought a shift in public opinion, or whether viewers even understood the message.
"The minute they started on television, we'd get up to 60 calls a day," said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Rochester Democrat. "But one-half to three-quarters of the people thought I was the one doing the ad."
Ms. Slaughter said the ads had not influenced her vote; she voted for two of the three bills but against the most sweeping one. Still, she said, she is concerned about the effect of such advertising campaigns on the political process. "There is a frenzy they whip up," she said. "And there's no countervailing message at all."
Political scientists who have studied advocacy advertising say the audience often takes away a message different from the one intended, or no message at all. Indeed, studies of the health care debate suggest that the Harry and Louise ads had little effect on the public; rather, it was the influence attributed to them by politicians and journalists that made them effective.
"The bottom line is we're not sure what the impact is," Ms. Jamieson, the dean at the Annenberg School, said of advocacy advertising in general. In the case of the Harry and Louise ads, she said, "members of Congress acted as if they were effective, so they were effective."

OVERHAULING THE LEGAL SYSTEM

HEADLINE: White House In an Appeal To Women

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The White House, in an effort to energize female voters, has unfurled a strategy to contrast the fate of women and children under the Republican Congress with that under President Clinton's programs.
Women voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Clinton in the 1992 Presidential election, and Administration officials view them as a natural constituency for his policies. And although his approval rating among women slipped last October, to 42 percent from 54 percent in January 1994, it has risen in the last several weeks to 48 percent. 
 "We think we have not done a very good job of getting our message out," said Alexis Herman, White House director of public liaison. "We did not spend enough time reinforcing the issues that resonate with working women."
At a meeting with a dozen female journalists this week, Ms. Herman and two other Clinton Administration officials, Karen Nussbaum, director of the women's bureau at the Department of Labor, and Nancy-Ann Min, an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, discussed how Republican budget cuts would affect poor and working women.
Like many Administration officials, the three insisted that the Republican move to balance the budget is taking money from programs like the Women, Infants and Children's program, the school lunch program and the rape crisis telephone line.
In addition, Ms. Min cited an amendment offered recently by Representative Ernest Jim Istook Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, that would gut a measure adopted in 1993 that allows Medicaid to pay for abortions for poor women whose lives are endangered or whose pregnancies are the result of rape or incest. Mr. Istook and his Republican supporters contend that the 1993 law contravenes state laws that prohibit the use of Federal money in such cases. The Istook amendment passed the House Appropriations Committee, 33 to 21.
In the debate over the amendment, Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester, called the Republican argument a "smokescreen."
"The amendment is about denying poor victims an abortion in certain instances," she said. "It is Draconian, and it is extremist."
The female officials also played down the debate on affirmative action. They said women and minorities, both beneficiaries of such programs, should not be arguing over which group benefited the most.
"Look at the glass ceiling report," Ms. Nussbaum said, referring to the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission, which found that women are still largely absent from the upper reaches of business. "Women are still most likely to be among those who earn minimum wage."
Ms. Herman conceded that affirmative action should be discussed, but said the debate should be "with real data, real facts."
"We can't allow it to become the scapegoat for the real issues in the economy," she said.
These issues, the officials said, were the lack of growth in real wage earnings over the last 20 years.
Ms. Min said that in her talks with female voters, they expressed concern about balancing work and home, becoming the sole income earner if their husbands lost their jobs, paying for child care and health care, and caring for an elderly parent. The officials conceded that the Administration had not capitalized on its actions to aid working women, from proposing an increase in the minimum wage to passage of the Family and Leave Act.
They discounted the assertion that many women had not voted in the election last November, which saw Republicans wrest control of both houses of Congress, because they were disillusioned with Mr. Clinton and Democrats.
"A lot of what we heard from the women who stayed home is that they didn't feel as though the issues that were being talked about and debated were issues that they felt personally involved in," Ms. Herman said.
She added: "We're going to spend more time speaking to the issues that women care about."
The strategy is one that some political observers think will work.
"Women are far less likely to see government as enemy," said Ann Lewis, vice president for public policy for Planned Parenthood. "They see that it has important responsibilities in terms of education, health care and personal safety."
Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, agreed.
"It's the job of the President to make clear what's at stake -- from school lunches to reproductive choice," she said. "Women would be inclined to support him again to the extent that they did in '92 and greater because we have a lot to lose."

HEADLINE: Farmland Tax Benefits May Widen

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 21

 BODY:
If you want a tax break, get a horse.
That's the advice that people with a few acres of land may soon be getting if proposed amendments to New Jersey's 1964 farmland assessment law are approved. Among other changes, tax breaks would be given for land used for boarding, training or rehabilitating livestock, including horses. 
 Sponsors of the changes say they are needed to rescue an ailing horse industry and bring uniformity to taxing practices. But opponents say that the farmland assessment program has done more to benefit the wealthy than it has to preserve farmland. Instead of taking a hard look at loopholes in the program, they complain, the Legislature is preparing to vote on a series of measures that would widen them.
The current law was intended to preserve farmland and discourage overdevelopment in the nation's most densely populated state. To qualify for lower assessments and taxes, a property owner needs only five acres devoted to agricultural or horticultural activities that produce $500 a year in income. Since the program began, more than 28,000 properties covering about a quarter of the state's land area have qualified for the tax break, which can be tens of thousands of dollars each year. Although the number of farms decreased to 8,500 in 1994 from 26,900 in 1950, and farmland to 860,000 acres from 1.7 million acres in the same period, the rate of decline slowed abruptly when the assessment program started 30 years ago.
Some of that money has gone to Christine Todd Whitman, a fact that Jim Florio tried to exploit when she was challenging him for the job of governor in 1993. The Florio campaign never suggested that the Whitmans did anything improper, but it did try to stir up resentment -- and headlines -- in a tax-sensitive state by releasing documents showing the tax breaks they earned on their two New Jersey properties, in part by selling firewood to relatives.
Mr. Florio had promised to create a commission to take another look at the law, but he never got the chance. Instead, the Senate Agriculture Committee, headed by Robert W. Singer, a Republican of Lakewood, took up the issue.
After public hearings, the committee released the bill that adds boarding livestock to the list of activities for which farmland assessments can be sought.
Mr. Singer said the change was essential if the state's horse industry is to survive. "We could lose thousands of small horse farms," he said. "Years ago, stud fees were the mainstay of the industry and boarding was secondary, but that has changed."
The amendment has the support of the New Jersey Horse Council, the Standard Breeders Association and the New Jersey Farm Bureau.
"We consider this bill a series of minor adjustments," said Peter J. Furey, the Farm Bureau's administrator. "And the farming community is watching very carefully to see if the changes and how they are administered are consistent with an overall agriculture policy."
The amendments proposed for the bill would make several changes:
*Property owners would be allowed to keep their tax breaks if the person working the farm is unable to make the required $500 because of illness, injury or death.
*The land would be inspected every three years, instead of every year, to make sure it is still being used for farming.
*Categories of property that qualify for lower assessments would be broadened to include the land under buildings like farm markets and housing for migrant laborers.
When New Jersey enacted its farmland assessment program in 1964, it was the second state to do so; Illinois began a farmland program in the 1930's. Today nearly every state has one.
Mr. Furey of the Farm Bureau said that, contrary to common belief, New Jersey farmers pay more in property taxes than farmers in any other state -- even with the break on assessments.
"New Jersey farmers paid $40.35 per acre in taxes in 1991, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, while the national average was $5.51," Mr. Furey said. "Farmland in Connecticut produced $26.71 an acre in taxes, while farm acreage in New York produced $20.51 and in Pennsylvania, $17.79."
Supporters of the assessment program and Mr. Singer's bill claim that the program is accomplishing its chief goal, to preserve open space. Mayor Ron Dancer of Plum sted Township, a member of a family well known for racing and training standardbred horses -- trotters and pacers -- argued that the law benefits nonfarm taxpayers by slowing development and the expensive police protection, roads and schools that come with it.
The opponents, including a number of assessors and homeowners, want to review the economics of the entire farmland assessment program. They are dismayed that Mr. Singer's bill, which was introduced in January, appears headed for a floor vote on March 30, several weeks before the release of a Rutgers University study of the program -- which they hope would support their view that it is not cost-effective.
Walter Kozul, the Marlboro Township Tax Assessor and a member of the Legislative Policy Committee of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, said the Singer bill would just make a bad situation worse.
"It will be opening that can of worms too wide," he said.
Mr. Kozul argued that the Singer bill, particularly the change favoring horse training and boarding, would extend a tax break to a commercial activity, not to farmland preservation.
"This is going to further erode the municipal tax base at a time when the state is pushing greater responsibility for providing services down to the local level," he said.
Beverly Scarano, a member of the Monmouth County Tax Board and president of the New Jersey Association of County Tax Board Commissioners and Administrators, said the Singer amendments "would liberalize the law so much it would lose its original intent, to preserve open space."
"This is a commercial bill and gets totally away from the law," she said. "It's going to shift the tax burden, and if you take it away from one column it has to go somewhere else."
In 1993, two residents in Upper Freehold Township, Richard D. Smith Jr. and Joseph D. Sarafin, charged that there was widespread abuse of the program, noting that 70 percent of the township's 21,000 acres were covered by farmland assessments. A subsequent state investigation found that only 81 of the first 160 properties examined actually qualified for the assessments they received.
Mr. Smith said that qualifying township farmers paid $9.29 per acre in property taxes in 1991, compared with the average $1,118 per acre for nonfarm property. The two men have begun a lobbying campaign to try to stop passage of the Singer bill. "It's an abomination," Mr. Smith said. "They can't think up ways fast enough to get more money to the rich and famous; they're tripping over each other on the way to the trough."
Mr. Sarafin called the program "welfare for the rich," and said if the state wants to preserve open space it should simply extend the program to everyone and be done with it. "The burden is now on so few, and nearly everyone has a lawn that grows grass, so why not make it all farmland?" Mr. Sarafin, a Democrat, said he would like to board a llama on his land to qualify for a tax break "and teach it to spit at Republicans."
The Rutgers study is headed by Adesoji Adelaja, associate director of the Ecopolicy Center at the university's Cook College. He said the State Department of Agriculture asked the center to determine what would happen if any of the elements of the program were changed -- the five-acre acreage minimum; the $500 in farm earnings for the first five acres with $5 for each additional acre and 50 cents an acre for woodland, and the extent of back taxes a property owner would have to pay if the farm activity on the land ceased. At present the "rollback" covers the two prior years.
"We have to come up a model that will show how many farms and acreage we would lose if any element or combination of elements of the program were changed," Mr. Adelaja said. "We also have to determine the impact on municipal revenues."
"If we make a change, we might lose farms but increase tax revenues to the towns," he said. "We would have to balance what is in the best interest of the state."

Only 88 More to Go

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So I've been thinking about this yen problem and I've got an idea. The dollar keeps falling against the Japanese yen, right? It started at 360 yen to the dollar after World War II and now it's down to 88 yen to the dollar. And each time the dollar falls we say, surely it can't go any further. But it does. So let's take the suspense out of this. I say we let the dollar go to zero right now. That's right. Let's make $1 be worth no yen.
Think about it. It will solve all our problems. We won't be able to buy anything from Japan, so our $60 billion trade deficit with Tokyo will disappear. Without that deficit, the dollar will again strengthen and be the darling of international markets. So forget this blather from the Treasury about how we don't want the dollar to weaken further against the yen. Our battle cry should be: "Only 88 Yen To Go Before Zero." 
 O.K., O.K., so it's not in the textbooks to do it that way. But Japan's behavior isn't either. I'm so tired of reading stories that say the dollar went down against the yen because of the fall of the peso, the storms in California, the earthquake in Kobe, the poison in the Tokyo subway or the fact that Japanese TV canceled reruns of "I Love Lucy."
It's not so complicated. The dollar is going down against the yen today for the same two basic reasons that it has been falling for years: because we buy too much from Japan and we sell it too little. Too many dollars chasing goods over there; too few yen chasing goods over here. Everything else is commentary.
We have finally started cutting back our spending and reducing the Federal deficit. We must do more. But so must Japan, which continues to resist U.S. imports. Hey, they wouldn't even use free Tylenol we shipped over to aid victims of the Kobe earthquake. They said it might not be right for Japanese bodies. (I'm not making this up.) I guess it's not surprising they don't buy U.S. cars -- even when the dollar becomes so cheap that a Chevy costs the same in Japan as a bicycle built for two.
We are talking about trade barriers that are deeply rooted in Japanese society. It will take more than a cheap dollar to open such a market. It's time for a new strategy.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor got China to cave into U.S. trade demands on textiles and intellectual property because he was empowered by the Administration with a very specific list of targets and an even more specific list of punishments if Beijing did not comply. When the U.S. has been equally focused with Japan, such as opening its cellular phone market, it has been successful.
But it would take decades to try to open up every Japanese industry, one at a time. We have tried a more broad-brush approach, called the "framework" negotiations. But they have largely failed to make a dent in the trade imbalance because we were not specific enough about what we wanted -- numerical increases in Japanese imports across a broad front -- and what would happen if we didn't get it. Instead, we danced around the issue, getting into endless Talmudic discussions with the Japanese about what constitutes an "indicator" of more open trade.
Any time we got even close to a specific numerical demand, the Japanese shouted that we were "managing trade" -- the economic equivalent of accusing someone of child molestation. So we backed off, even though we know Japan has the most managed economy in the world and the only way in is to be managed in.
We are being played for fools. Japan will only change when we use the full strategic and economic weight of the U.S. to make clear to Tokyo that a failure to open all its markets, with concrete results, will lead to a crisis in the U.S.-Japan strategic relationship -- not just the economic one -- and to specific retaliations against Japanese exports.
We have to decide: Do we want to do Talmud or do we want to do trade? If we want to debate about trade terminology with the Japanese, we will lose. They are the world champs. If we want to get serious about deploying all our assets toward a specific market-opening arrangement with Japan, we have a chance. But we have to be serious, and up to now we have been ambivalent. As the saying goes: How can I move forward when I don't know which way I'm facing? It's time to make up our minds. We've got 88 more yen to figure it out.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
King, at the Helm Again, Plans Smooth Road to Title

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

 BODY:
Mike Tyson's first fight in his comeback attempt will be in late June or early July, against a ranked fighter but probably not a blockbuster name, Don King's boxing director, Al Braverman, said yesterday.
"You don't know how much rust he's accumulated," explained Braverman, a longtime figure in boxing who is also King's matchmaker. "You don't go for a desperate shot to make a lot of money after being away for three years." 
 According to Braverman, King is back as Tyson's promoter, even though half a dozen interests continually visited Tyson in prison, hoping to replace King. Following Tyson's release from a prison outside Indianapolis yesterday, he and King returned together yesterday to the Cleveland suburbs where they are practically neighbors.
King seemed on the ropes following Tyson's rape conviction in 1992. King's pool of fighters had dried up, especially among the heavyweights. But now he is promoting 18 world champions and has 4 of the 10 ranking heavyweights. He is promoting Oliver McCall, the World Boxing Council titleholder, as well as Tony Tucker and Bruce Seldon, who meet on April 8 for the World Boxing Association title stripped from George Foreman for refusing to defend it against Tucker. It is the co-feature of McCall's defense against Larry Holmes.
In addition, King is involved with Frans Botha of South Africa, another ranked heavyweight. Thus, a Botha-Tyson match, or one against the loser of the Tucker-Seldon fight, or Lionel Butler (another King fighter) could be on the menu for Tyson.
Meanwhile, there is the matter of who will train the former champion. Tyson was a devastating, punishing, and frightful fighter when trained by Kevin Rooney on his rise to the title. But the pair fell out soon after King took over, and Tyson was not quite so overpowering after that. But it does not appear that Rooney remains in the picture.
Braverman suggested George Benton as a possible trainer. Benton already is McCall's trainer. He had been Pernell Whitaker's longtime co-trainer with Lou Duva until they disagreed on how to handle Whitaker, the W.B.C. welterweight champion. According to Braverman, Tyson likes Benton and is impressed with the fact that he is a former boxer and has seen many of the fighters that Tyson likes to read about as a student of the sport's history.
It is uncertain where Tyson will perform in his first fight. A municipal official in Buenos Aires has written to King seeking to hold the bout there. Just last week, Cedric Kushner, a former South African who now promotes boxing in the United States, met with Nelson Mandela, and they discussed boxing.
"I wouldn't be surprised if Tyson fought there in one of his comeback bouts," said Kushner. "But Mr. Mandela didn't say anything about Tyson. He did speak fondly about boxing."
But Kushner said he had spoken recently with a deputy minister in South Africa who suggested that the country had too many economic problems to underwrite a fight.
The fact that even after three years in prison, and having seemed to be on the downside when he was sentenced, Tyson emerges as an intriguing, mysterious figure indicates the state of the heavyweights.
Over the next three months, four different heavyweight titles will be at stake. In addition to the April 8 doubleheader, Foreman defends his International Boxing Federation crown on April 22 against Axel Schulz and Riddick Bowe makes his first World Boxing Organization defense on June 17 against Jorge Gonzalez .
Tyson unified the crown in 1987, but Bowe tossed it into chaos again when he symbolically, and actually, tossed his W.B.C. belt into a trash can in 1992.
The champion with the closest line of succession to Tyson actually is the 46-year-old Foreman, who won the I.B.F. and W.B.A. titles last year.
Bowe, as W.B.O. title-holder, gives that fledgling group a status it has not previously enjoyed. Bowe is the one nonchampion out there whose fights will have meaning to the public at large -- a public that, in Tyson's three years away, has increasingly turned to the world of tabloid TV journalism. Thus, Tyson gets out more of a celebrity than he was as world champion.
So it is not surprising that so many would-be promoters and members of various religions , visited Tyson over the years in prison. But it was his old confidant, Don King, who took him home.

A Shower for Rocky, Spot and Fluffy

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
"MAKE sure you dry the ears," said Glen Gaylinn, keeping a steady gaze on Rocky, a 170-pound Great Dane, who gamely stood for 40 minutes of sponging, spraying, blow-drying and brushing. "It prevents swimmer's ear." Mr. Gaylinn, who owns and operates the Dog Wash, was talking not to a groomer, but to Rocky's owner, Alice D'Ambros.
Ms. D'Ambros had driven in from Staten Island just so she could bathe Rocky at this self-service bathhouse for dogs, a sort of canine carwash in the lower level of a squat building at 177 McDougal Street, just a Frisbee's throw from the dog run at Washington Square Park. 
 Opened three months ago, the Dog Wash is the latest wrinkle in the city's growing pet service industry, and apparently is becoming the in place for pampered dogs and their human companions.
There are 120,000 licensed dogs in New York City, a fraction of the number actually believed to live here, once estimated at two to three million. Americans spent $93 million in pet grooming and boarding in 1994, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. The numbers aren't broken down for New York City, but industry watchers say the market is substantial, and growing.
"There are easily five times as many pet stores that offer grooming than there were when we opened in 1960," said Steve Kuper, dean of the New York School of Dog Grooming in Manhattan. Depending on the breed and size, groomers charge on average $40 to $100.
Mr. Gaylinn's Dog Wash is the answer for people who don't want to heave their Saint Bernard into their bathtub and those who are not willing to pay an exorbitant fee to have Beethoven bathed at a chic pet salon.
"I'm filling a niche," said Mr. Gaylinn. "What groomers charge just for doing a wash is outrageous."
At the Dog Wash, self-service is $14 and staff service $27, regardless of size. (Through the end of April, first-time visitors will be charged $7 for self-service.) Grooming tools are available at no charge, and young groomers will show owners how to demat, brush and trim their pooches for free. Staff grooming is also available at a moderate fee.
Mr. Gaylinn said he can offer rates at a fraction of what most pet salons charge because he is equipped to handle 100 dogs a day. But he admits he hasn't yet seen that many paws pad through his door in a single day. "I knew it would be a struggle at first," he said. "But once people try it, they rave about it to their friends."
Indeed, on a recent Saturday afternoon several barking Brahmans -- as well as two or three mixed breeds -- came in with owners who howled with delight about the shop. "I was thinking about renting the place for a night and having all my friends come and wash their dogs -- a dog-washing party!" said Robert Greene, an interior decorator and the proud owner of Gerard, a long-haired, tawny-hued briard. "There's such a good feeling here."
Dog owners touted everything from the salon's decor (walls festooned with illustrations of skateboarding and guitar-playing pooches) to its cleanliness (air ionizers zap dust particles and ozone generators kill mold and fungus). But the biggest advantage, they agreed, was psychological.
"It's a fun day for him," said Ms. D'Ambros, a personal fitness trainer. "It gets him out with other dogs. Plus, he likes it better when I handle him."
"It's a bonding experience," said David Faulkner, a West Villager, who lovingly lathered Limerick, a mixed breed found on St. Patrick's Day, two years ago.
"It's very interactive," added Mr. Greene, who has paid up to $200 for a shampoo and cut for Gerard.
Mr. Greene knows from interactive. Three years ago, Gerard leapt from the tub during a bath and dashed out of the apartment. Mr. Greene, who had pragmatically joined Gerard in the bath, was forced to give chase. "I ran stark naked down the hall after him," recalled Mr. Greene, a Chelsea resident, who lived on the Upper East Side at the time. "The elevator opened, and there stood the parents of the only other tenant of the building."
At the Dog Wash, Mr. Greene doesn't have to remove a stitch. Owners get plastic aprons and free instruction in bathing technique. Dog and owner enter one of seven stalls, or bath bays, designed by Mr. Gaylinn, equipped with a bench (for the dog), soap and water (already mixed) and clear water (kept between 86 and 90 degrees).
"You don't have to lift the dog into a tub," said Mr. Gaylinn, putting Jet, the shop's resident rambunctious German Shepard, behind the counter. "Most pet stores use tubs. When I designed the bath bays, I put myself in the position of a dog. If you were a dog, would you like to be picked up and thrown in a confining porcelain tub with no grip and have people pour water over you?"
A former commodities broker and lifelong dog lover, Mr. Gaylinn, 32, said he left the "backstabbing and politics" of the financial world two years ago. "I was living in Manhattan, and I thought about where all these dogs were being washed," he recalled. "Then I found out how much pet stores were charging."
Mr. Gaylinn originally planned to open on West Fourth Street over a year ago, but the deal fell through. He moved in with his parents in Connecticut and became a veterinary technician at Strawberry Hill Animal Hospital in Norwalk. He designed bath bays for the hospital (where a couple of pigs, as well as dogs and cats, came in for laundering). He sold those bays to the hospital's chief veterinarian so that he could return to the city.
With money from the sale and a $200,000 loan from friends, family and financial institutions, Mr. Gaylinn opened the Dog Wash shortly before Christmas, but only to friends' dogs. "I had to test the equipment," he explained. Shortly after New Year's, the public was invited in.
Though washing is focus, the shop also sells gourmet dog foods (both vegetarian and meat-based), bones, toys, sweaters, raincoats and other canine accouterment.
What do his friends from the pit-bullish canons of Wall Street think of his cute new venture? "Well, they definitely thought I was crazy at first," he said. "I mean, I have a degree in economics from Amherst. But when they walk in here and look at the store, they think I'm so successful, they want me to invest in their stock schemes."

HEADLINE: USAir Enters An Agreement With Its Pilots

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
USAir broke a yearlong deadlock with its pilots yesterday and reached an agreement that could help the financially beleaguered airline drastically cut costs.
USAir, the nation's sixth-largest carrier, did not disclose any details of the agreement, nor did its pilots union, the Air Line Pilots Association. The airline's statement suggested, however, that the agreement included wage and work rule concessions from the pilots in exchange for "financial returns and governance participation," most likely referring to stock in the company and representation on USAir's board. 
 Although the agreement is tentative and conditioned on other labor groups reaching separate deals with the airline, it is nevertheless significant.
USAir, based in Alexandria, Va., has been among the most chronically unprofitable United States airlines, having lost more than $2.5 billion since the late 1980's. It is trying to cut $1 billion in annual operating costs, and wants half of the savings to come from agreements with its labor groups, including unions representing mechanics and flight attendants.
USAir said discussions with those labor groups were continuing. A tape-recorded message for members of USAir's pilots union said only that the two sides had made "substantial progress."
The last publicized offer by pilots called for employees to contribute $500 million a year in savings in return for 20 percent of the company and seats on the board.
Kevin C. Murphy, an airline stock analyst at Morgan Stanley, said yesterday that the pilots and company were probably motivated to end their impasse by the airline's thinning cash reserves.
The airline had about $400 million in cash at the end of 1994, and Mr. Murphy said the company had indicated that its reserves had since fallen to about $250 million.
"The clock is clearly ticking," he said. "An accord must be reached at this level of liquidity, which is a minimal level for operating solvency."
Until details of the agreement are announced, it remains unclear whether investors will be enamored of the terms of the pilot agreement. One important USAir investor, Warren E. Buffett, recently signaled a no-confidence vote for the airline's prospects by saying that he no longer wanted to sit on USAir's board.
USAir was among the first airlines to cut expenses early in an economic downturn that has cost the airline industry more than $13 billion in losses since 1990. But those agreements were temporary and not deep enough, industry analysts have said.
As a result, USAir has been widely perceived as a laggard in the industry, and is now trying to follow other carriers' successful efforts to strike deals with their labor groups.
Over the last two years, for example, United Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines have granted their employees large equity stakes in return for concessions, both in the form of pay cuts and work rule changes that lead to greater productivity.
As a result of these deals, employees have typically gained a greater say in the strategy and operation of the company through newly acquired seats on their airlines' boards.
If USAir is successful in concluding the agreement with the pilots, it will mark an important success for Seth E. Schofield, USAir's chairman and chief executive, who has spent his entire 28-year industry career at the airline, rising from the rank of baggage handler.
Representatives of the airline's other unions could not be reached for comment yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.N. Proposal Would Let Iraq Sell Oil to Buy Relief Goods

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 23

 BODY:
A group of countries opposed to the lifting of any sanctions on Iraq has drafted a Security Council resolution that would allow the sale of some Iraqi oil to raise money for relief goods, diplomats said this week.
The new resolution -- written by Argentina, Britain and the United States -- is intended to reduce pressures for the broader lifting of sanctions while testing whether President Saddam Hussein is genuinely interested in alleviating the hardships caused by shortages. 
 The measure would allow Iraq to sell $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days. This would apply for six months, and would be renewable for similar periods if Iraqis complied with all the resolution's demands. Under earlier resolutions, now lapsed, Iraq would have been permitted to sell oil worth $1.6 billion.
The revenue is mostly intended for the purchase of medicines, food and other emergency supplies. In addition, some money would be reserved for the Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. Thirty percent would be set aside to compensate victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The resolution will ask the Secretary General to devise a system to monitor the application of the new plan. The Security Council will demand that Iraq sell its oil at a "reasonable price" determined by the world market. This is intended to prevent Iraq from undercutting other oil producers in the region.
Most of the oil that Iraq would be permitted to sell is expected to pass through a Turkish pipeline, but some would be allowed through the Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr.
Four years after the end of the Persian Gulf war, the Government of President Hussein says continued sanctions are causing hardship, illness and death because money, medicines and other materials are scarce.
As Iraq moves closer to meeting all the conditions for lifting sanctions, contained in a series of Security Council resolutions passed in 1990 and 1991, there have been pressures in the Council to begin easing embargoes in imports and exports a step at a time, based on Iraqi compliance.
The Clinton Administration has taken the position that Iraq's sole aim is to sell oil, and that there is no guarantee that money earned would not be spent on arms or on personal luxuries for the Iraqi leadership.
The countries working on the new resolution in effect rewrote two existing but dormant resolutions, 706 and 712, passed in August and September 1991. Those resolutions recognized the human costs of sanctions and made provisions for the sale of Iraqi oil under strict conditions and Security Council supervision to buy "foodstuffs, medicine or other items of a humanitarian character."
Iraq has opposed the use of those resolutions -- which were more intrusive than the one now being proposed -- holding out for a less restrictive list of sanctions under another resolution establishing a control commission to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
Iraqis say that they are nearing full compliance with these conditions and that a report next month by the commission's leader, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, will make it hard for the United States and others to ban selling oil indefinitely.
Some Iraqi oil is already reaching the world market in contravention of the ban. France, with business interests in Iraq, and Russia, which is owed millions of dollars by Mr. Hussein, back the easing of sanctions, noting that Iraq has also met another major test in recognizing Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Behind Collapse of a Building, An 80's Investment That Did, Too

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY and SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
During the boom of the 1980's, Marcus I. Lehmann and Morris Wolfson heard the siren call of real estate and followed it to Harlem.
Mr. Lehmann, 27 years old in April 1987, seemed to be brimming with confidence when he explained in an interview then his formula for success in the low-income housing market. A property purchased for less than four times its annual rent revenues "will show a bottom line," he said. "When you get above that, you've got to squeeze." 
 With banks footing most of the costs, Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson went on a buying spree in the mid- to late 1980's. And among the half-dozen properties they purchased was the six-story building on 140th Street in Harlem that partly collapsed last week, killing three tenants and injuring seven.
But well before that crash early Tuesday morning, the real estate business they had built with borrowed money and run-down buildings became mired in debt and poor management.
Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson declined to be interviewed last week. The story of their business was pieced together from interviews with associates and a review of government and court records.
Just as the enterprise of Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson floated on the euphoria of the 1980's, it was swept away in the economic downturn that followed. The bank that had been so generous to them collapsed in 1990, a victim of its own poor lending practices.
Unable to sell their devalued properties, Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson fell behind in tax and mortgage payments and began not paying suppliers of goods and services like heating oil and plumbing parts. They owe the city at least $400,000 in back taxes, a spokesman for the Department of Finance said.
They were either unable or unwilling to maintain their properties, and the buildings began attracting housing code violations from the city and lawsuits from tenants claiming injuries from unsafe conditions. In 1991, when the family of a boy sued, saying he had been injured in a run-down apartment, Mr. Lehmann said he had no insurance and offered to settle the case by giving the family free rent, said Maurice Sieradski, a lawyer who represented the boy's family.
Now, prosecutors are investigating whether the landlords should be charged with criminal negligence in the collapse of the building. Officials at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development have asked a judge to impose jail sentences and a $1 million fine because the men ignored a past court order on code violations unrelated to the collapse.
Lawyers for the two men say they have struggled against significant odds to be responsible landlords. They said the decline of the building is partly the fault of tenants involved in a rent strike and squatters who have taken over and torn up some of the 30 vacant apartments there.
"They did as good a job as humanly possible," Bernard Brafman, a lawyer for Mr. Wolfson, said in a court hearing last week. "Problems like these are recurrent in nature. It would be hard to find a building in a high crime area that is free of violations." Mr. Brafman also said that Mr. Wolfson recently sold his interest in the 140th Street building.
Mr. Brafman said that none of the violations at the building pertain to its structural integrity and therefore cannot be blamed for the collapse. He said city housing inspectors repeatedly visited the building and never reported any warning signs of the disaster to the Building Department.
"My strong feeling," said Mr. Brafman, "is that when the dust finally settles it will be seen as a terribly unfortunate tragedy that is no one's fault."
Although Mr. Wolfson is the step-son of a New York developer and philanthropist, Zev W. Wolfson, and Mr. Lehmann is the son of an engineer, Oscar Lehmann, associates of the men say they knew little about real estate when they formed the Mount Wilson partnership in 1986.
"They struck me as young, slightly arrogant, but not villainous," said a lawyer who represented tenants against them and spoke on the condition he not be identified. "Not too different from other landlords we deal with. When they first came into a building, they said they would be different, but they're not."
The pair bought six properties in Harlem in quick succession, beginning in 1986. Within two years their Harlem portfolio alone included the 70-unit building on 140th Street, for which they paid $525,000; three adjoining properties on 140th; a building on St. Nicholas Place, and a property at 112 West 138th Street named Invincible Court. That building, with 53 apartments, was acquired in 1988 for about $600,000. For all of those buildings, they spent $3 million.
With gentrification sweeping many parts of the city, investors and institutions were eager to lend to real estate buyers. "You had people fighting to give you money because the market was hot," said Ira Kellman, a property owner in Harlem. "There are very few people in the real estate industry disciplined enough not to take it when someone is throwing it at them. That's what was happening then -- uptown, downtown, everywhere."
Harlem looked like a good bet. There was talk that middle-class Manhattan might creep farther uptown. City and state renovation money for low-income housing was relatively plentiful.
For younger investors who did not have the deep personal resources of the older generation of developers, the lower prices of Harlem were particularly attractive. "Certainly below 96th Street had already been speculated up," said Harvey Wolinetz, a real estate investor who lent the two men money. "It didn't leave a lot of areas for speculation."
Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson joined a subculture of younger real estate investors, some of them the children of larger players, who were dealing in the low-income housing market.
Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson borrowed much of their money from Ensign Bank. When Mount Wilson Properties filed for bankruptcy in 1991, Ensign, which by then had been taken over by the Federal entity bailing out failed lenders, it claimed a debt of $12.7 million, bankruptcy court records show.
In August 1990, when the Federal officials in the Resolution Trust Corporation seized Ensign, they issued a statement saying the bank was "unsafe and unsound" because of its portfolio of real estate and construction loans. "Ensign's condition is due primarily to a high level of nonperforming assets caused by poor underwriting, inadequate appraisal policies and, to a lesser degree, the softening New York-area real estate market," the statement said.
One property owner who borrowed money from Ensign for property in Harlem said the bank was unusually loose. "The gave me money I didn't believe," said the owner, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. He said he was so surprised the bank backed him on one purchase that "I had to submerge a snicker when I went to the closing."
To buy the building on 140th Street, the Mount Wilson partnership obtained a $425,000 mortgage -- $100,000 less than the purchase price -- from a Scarsdale real estate company, Houlihan-Parnes, in 1987, according to records obtained through the Redi Property Data Company.
That same year, the records show, Mr. Wolinetz also gave the partnership a $175,000 mortgage, money that was intended to fix up the property, he said. Then in 1988, Ensign added another $450,000 to the men's mortgage on the building, according to the records.
It remains unclear how much of the money that Mount Wilson borrowed from Ensign went into work on the partnership's buildings. But tenants and city housing officials said conditions in the building on 140th Street steadily deteriorated.
In Housing Court last week, Roslyn Wiley, who lived there until the collapse, described the conditions in her home.
She told of having to go to neighbors' apartments in another building for a bath when hot and cold water stopped for weeks last February. She told of plugging holes in bathroom floors with plastic and paper, and she told of a rat bite that sent her husband to the hospital.
"The building was in shambles," said Ms. Wiley, who is now living in a city shelter with other refugees from the building.
Ms. Wiley's account put a human voice to the catalogue of complaints city housing officials compiled for years against the property. Last week, housing officials urged a judge to find the men in criminal contempt and sentence Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Lehmann to jail terms for violating the court's order that they correct 326 violations, none of which were related to structural problems that cased the collapse.
In addition to violations at the building on 140th Street, the housing agency has brought 51 different cases against Mount Wilson or its principals for problems at other buildings in the neighborhood including 25 and 35 St. Nicholas Terrace; 75 St. Nicholas Place; 4, 9 and 10 West 108th Street, and 406 West 129th Street, said Mara Neville, a spokeswoman for the housing agency. In some cases, Mount Wilson is the managing agent of the buildings.
Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Wolfson appeared in court after Judge Peter M. Wendt of Civil Court ordered them to do so. Once there, their lawyers persuaded the judge to allow them to sit anonymously among the crowd in the courtroom rather than at the defense table with their lawyers.
Their wish to remain out of view was apparently not new to at least some people who have done business with them. Candace Carponter, who has represented them in housing court for several years, claims to know her clients so little that she can not even say where they have their homes, if they are married or if they have children.
Even trying to determine the origin of their partnership's name, Mount Wilson, is difficult. One caller to The New York Times last week, who refused to give his last name, said he attended a Pikesville, Md., rabbinical college with Mr. Lehmann in the late 1970's. The school is located on Mount Wilson Lane, but someone who answered the telephone at the school late Friday said no one was available to confirm that Mr. Lehmann had studied there.
Answering questions about the 140th Street building in a January 1994 deposition, Mr. Lehmann said that he did not "recall' ever being at the building in 1991 and added that a company called Triangle Management was involved in managing the building. But when he was asked what that company did at the building, Mr. Lehmann answered: "I have no idea."
A reporter trying to locate Mr. Lehmann or the offices of Mount Wilson or Triangle Management at 25 Broadway, an address listed on some court documents, was directed by a security guard to a Delancy Street address. The commercial tenants at that address said they knew nothing of Mount Wilson Realty, Triangle Management or either of the men.
When Baruch Singer, a principal in Triangle Management, was reached by telephone on Friday he said, "I am not the listed manager of the building."
The question of who was in charge of the building is likely to be determined in court. But there is no question that the building on 140th Street was not the investment either Mr. Lehmann, Mr. Wolfson or their backers envisioned in the boom of the 1980's.
"What do you do with it?" said Mr. Wolinetz, one of Mount Wilson's original lenders. "It's not like an apple or an orange that you can eat. You make the most of it. I guess they realized the building wasn't very viable."

HEADLINE: Another Day Older and Running Out of Time

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
AMERICANS are scared. They are looking toward retirement not with the optimism of their parents, but with fear.
Three out of four working Americans expect people their age to face a financial crisis when they retire, according to a New York Times/CBS poll. Over half say they have not begun to save for retirement. And many see themselves reaching old age without the company-paid pensions and Social Security that allowed their parents to live so comfortably. 
 The new economics of retirement are forcing Americans who want to build a retirement nest egg to wade into the confusing world of stocks, bonds and mutual funds. They know they must somehow become smart investors to pay for old age. But the poll, and interviews later with those surveyed, show they are largely unprepared, psychologically and financially, to do what they know they should do. Even the well-off, as they go through life enjoying its comforts, are nagged by concern that their well-being will disappear when they retire.
"We have two beautiful cars and a lovely home and our kids get guitar lessons and dancing lessons and much more than we did," said Donna Cuevas, 39, whose husband, Hiram, a doctor in Tampa, Fla., earned $140,000 last year. "But we have saved only $30,000 and it is all in bank accounts, not invested for retirement. I had planned to do that last year, but I had kidney surgery and that set me back. Until we get something set up, I will not be at ease."
The old, disappearing world of prosperous old age had as its pillars company pensions and Social Security. Nearly non-existent before World War II, they mushroomed and flourished until the mid-1980's, and then began a slow decline, as cost cutting became a national obsession. People over 50 are still largely protected by the old system. But for everyone else, it is slipping away. And their nervousness, their growing realization of just how unprepared they are, is beginning to show up in public opinion polls.
"2010 is when the changes will really hit," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist.
Bracing themselves, 20 percent of working Americans have postponed their planned retirements, the Times/CBS poll found. Forty percent of those with savings -- a chief requirement of the new system -- say they started saving too late to adequately support themselves in old age. And while company pensions and Social Security are in decline, nearly 40 percent of the working population cling to them anyway as major sources of the income they hope to have when they stop working, the poll shows.
"Lurking in many of our minds is the idea that somehow the government will take care of us, if we can't take care of ourselves," said Alan Auerbach, an economist and tax specialist at the University of California at Berkeley. "The see retired people doing okay today, and they say I'll be that way too. But they won't."
THE change is especially hard on middle-income people earning $30,000 to $100,000 a year, said Diane Colasanto, president of Princeton Survey Research Associates. More than others, they still count on company paid pensions and Social Security for the bulk of their retirement income, she said. Most Americans earn less than $30,000 a year. And perhaps because these lower-income earners are already tight for money and cutting corners, they see themselves as less likely than middle-income people to be forced to reduce their living standards even further in retirement, the Times/CBS poll found.
Certainly Rick Gage, 43, is a man in the middle. He is counting on a standard pension, one financed mostly by his employer, the Lake County, Oregon, Road Department, which has specified in advance the amounts to be paid upon retirement -- a common feature of company pensions. Driving huge earth movers, Mr. Gage earns $31,000 today. If he does as well as older colleagues now in retirement, his pension will be almost as high as his final salary when he retires in the 21st Century.
But there will be no big pension unless he can keep his job, and there is a strong chance he cannot. If he is laid off, as some of his colleagues already have been, he has no savings fall back on in retirement.
The Lake County Road Department has already been reduced to 28 employees from 37 three years ago. Another dozen are scheduled for layoff soon, although Mr. Gage says his seniority -- 18 years on the job -- will protect him. Only two others have worked more years. If Mr. Gage were to lose his job, however, his future pension would be frozen far below his expectations, and that makes him rail against environmentalists.
A fee on logging finances the road department's budget, and pressure from environmentalists has greatly reduced logging in Lake County. "They are trying to take over out here," Mr. Gage said, "and they don't know what is going on."
ABSENT the promised pension, Mr. Gage and his wife, Gloria, who is 44, would be in trouble. She earns only $10,000 working part-time -- without benefits -- for a Head Start program, and they have only $750 saved. Like three-quarters of the nearly 1,200 people polled -- representing a cross-section of Americans -- the Gages have two priorities ahead of saving for retirement.
One is to pay their debts, and they are never quite out of debt, a condition that afflicts 60 percent of those polled. The other is to educate their children, and their 17-year-old daughter, the oldest of their three kids, will enter college in the fall to study nursing. "One reason my daughter has decided to go into nursing is that she feels she'll always have a job because people are always sick," Mr. Gage said.
Many young Americans, not harboring Mr. Gage's pension hopes, are indeed beginning to set up retirement accounts, bowing to the inevitable and lured by the tax breaks that these accounts enjoy. Many companies encourage this process, offering incentives to set up the accounts, even as they are freezing the amounts that company-funde pension plans are required to pay to retirees in the future.
But few actively manage their savings. Two-thirds of those who do have investments "rarely" buy or sell their stocks or shift savings from one mutual fund to another, the poll found. And this in a world in which rapid compounding of one's savings is considered essential to generate enough income for retirement.
These accounts, as a result, earn 2 to 3 percentage points less on average than company pension funds managed by professional investors, says Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center. Roughly 17 million Americans have the various types of retirement accounts, up from 11 million in 1985. The most popular is a 401(k) plan that exempts from taxes up to nearly $10,000 a year in salary deducted from payrolls.
Nearly 30 percent of working Americans with savings have such accounts, according to the poll, which was conducted March 9 to 12 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. But the median 401(k) account holds only $5,000. That is laughably below the $1 million or so that pension experts say a person should save to generate $50,000 a year in retirement income.
"So much is uncertain about how much the 401(k) plans will provide for retirees," said Paul Yakoboski, of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "Retirement is still 15 years away for people with the oldest of these plans."
MOST Americans despair of ever acquiring significant savings, according to the poll, which surveyed by telephone 1,156 people nationwide. Nearly half said they would have trouble if they had to pay a $1,000 bill right away, to repair the roof, for example, or replace the hot water heater. Most of those who do have savings earn $50,000 a year or more, the poll found, an income bracket occupied by the upper 40 percent of the work force. And many, like Eva Reilly, are trying to parlay their savings into big bucks.
Ms. Reilly, 47, a senior financial analyst, at Duracell USA in Bethel, Conn., talks of her growing skills as an investor. "My parents would have been more hesitant to make high-risk investments," she said. "But I will because I know the long-term returns justify the risk. I think people today are better educated about these matters."
MS. REILLY and her husband, who calculates production schedules for the Cannondale Bike Corporation in Georgetown, Conn., earn $125,000 a year between them and save more than 10 percent of this amount, mostly in 401(k) accounts. That sounds pretty good, but in 25 years such savings alone would come to less than $400,000. To get to $1 million, those savings would have to be shrewly invested.
Ms. Reilly, with 14 years at Duracell, also has a company-paid pension, but she resists counting on it. Instead she shifts the conversation to her investments in stocks and mutual funds and hopes for the best.
"A pension is a supplement for what you should provide for yourself," she insisted. "I don't bank on people providing for me; I suppose my father did, but times were different." (The father, a retired construction worker, has an employer-paid pension negotiated by his union.)
AFEW lucky Americans have found a way to turn back the clock to the days when substantial pensions were the norm. Dr. Steven Eshelman, a 42-year-old psychiatrist earning $120,000 a year, is one. Having spent eight years in the Army, where he completed his psychiatric training at Walter Reed Hospital, he stayed in the reserves after returning to civilian life a decade ago. And he needs only two more years of reserve duty, he says, to qualify for a $16,000 a year Army pension when he is 60.
"I stayed in for the pension, and the health insurance that the Army will give me at age 60, if the rules don't change," Dr. Eshelman said. "I want to retire at 60 and play golf."
Still, he has savings. As medical director of the Pawnee Mental Health Center in Manhattan, Kan., he built up $60,000 in a retirement account, which he split with his wife in their recent divorce. His goal is to rebuild the account, getting it to $500,000 by the year 2013, when he turns 60. But if that does not happen, he has another ace in the hole. Under his contract, the Pawnee will pay him $30,000 a year for the first decade of his retirement.
"I am actually pretty comfortable," Dr. Eshelman said.
THAT is a peace of mind not shared by Muriel Budde in Norfolk, Nebraska, the prairie town where the comedian Johnny Carson grew up. Her husband, Gary, a TV repairman, averages roughly $25,000 a year in salary and commissions -- more or less the norm for the American workforce. She is 49, he 52. The local company that employs him offers neither pension nor health insurance nor 401(k) savings account, and the Buddes have none of these on their own. Nor does Mrs. Budde work, other than volunteer service at her church.
"You expect the Lord to provide one way or another," Mrs. Budde said. They own their modest home and their four children are grown, and Mrs. Budde hopes that her husband will be as lucky her father, a farmer who became an electrician and handyman in later life, and got through old age without a pension, dying two years ago at age 75.
"He worked until he got sick, a month before he died," she said. "He was basically very healthy and he earned his own living. It was not the best. He never lived on easy street."
 
 
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted March 9 through 12 with 1,156 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for owners of stocks or mutual funds it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing and production errors, an article last Sunday about a New York Times/CBS News poll on the ways Americans save for retirement misstated some findings. Fifty-three percent of those asked, not 40 percent, said they expect company pensions or Social Security to be the major source of their retirement income. Three-fourths of those with investments, not two-thirds, said they rarely buy or sell their stocks or shift money between mutual funds. Sixty percent said they found it hard to keep up with their bills, not that they were never out of debt. People earning $50,000 a year or more are most likely to have savings; they do not constitute a majority of those with savings.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
European Cars: Renting for Less

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THIS week may be the time to rent a car for a European trip this summer. Two major companies, Hertz and the Kemwel Group, offer special rates that expire on Friday. Avis, Auto Europe and Europcar have no looming deadlines, but with the value of the dollar vacillating, the rates quoted here in mid-March may change.
All the companies here say they will guarantee dollar rates: Once the rental is reserved, the companies say, the price will not increase. 
 "A rental from a major company tends to cost much less if you negotiate it at home," according to Eric Bredesen, author of "Moto Europa" (Seren Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa), a recent book that covers the field.
When you shop by phone, whether through a travel agent or direct to the company, be aware of several factors. First, the value added tax, or V.A.T., varies by country but is usually steep: 18.6 percent in France, for example, and 19 percent in Italy. In comparison shopping, be sure that the prices quoted all do or do not include the V.A.T.
Second, rentals in Italy require theft coverage separate from any collision damage waiver. This relieves the renter of responsibility if all or part of the vehicle is stolen. The cost will vary -- one company charges $11.36 a day for midsized manual autos -- but be sure it is included in the quoted rate.
Third, be sure you find out from your insurance broker and credit card company what coverage you already have before you get into a dispute about a collision damage waiver.
Last, some of the least-expensive European cars are really small; they may have four seats, but they are better for two adults and two children. We rented a Renault Clio Fiji for four adults in Italy last year and the knee room was snug. For longer trips, the men sat in the front and the women in the back, with some luggage on the back seat as well. Tell the rental agent how many people and how much luggage you will carry.
Remember also that inexpensive rentals are likely to be manual shift. If you cannot operate a stick shift, driving lessons now may be cheaper than the added costs, say $90 a week, the differential quoted by Auto Europe for an Opel Vectra in Germany.
And one warning: Speeding fines can be serious, and the police are usually authorized to collect from foreigners on the spot. The Boots family of Oak Park, Ill., paid $750 -- 950 Swiss francs -- when they drove out of the 10-mile single-lane St. Gotthard Tunnel into the Canton of Uri, Switzerland. The charge was driving 123 kilometers an hour -- 72 miles an hour -- in a zone where the limit was 80 kilometers, or 49 m.p.h. Steven Boots paid on his Mastercard at a table set up for the purpose, his mother, Joanne Boots, wrote.
When asked about the incident, Evelyne Mock of the Swiss National Tourist Office said that 50 Swiss francs was a fee for the district attorney's office and 900 francs was a deposit until the court decided the fine. The Boots' car was tagged on Sept. 5, 1994, and the case was still pending on March 13, Ms. Mock said.
 
Paying the Toll
 Here are some guaranteed dollar rates for weekly rentals with unlimited mileage, reserved and paid in advance. The rate for the smallest model is quoted for comparison purposes.
Kemwel, which is a booking agency in the United States for various rental companies in 26 European countries, calls its program Super Saver. These prices, effective until Friday, do not include V.A.T. or collision damage waiver. Kemwel's "A" (or smallest) cars, a spokesman said, are manual-transmission two-door minicars useful for two passengers with limited luggage. In Britain, the weekly rate for such a car is $119; in France, $169; in Germany, $99; in Spain, for a rental between June 1 and Sept. 30 (Spain has a high season at Kemwel), $205, and in Italy, $157 with the theft waiver. Kemwel throws in a bonus of a $25 debit card for telephoning home.
Kemwel, 106 Calvert Street, Harrison, N.Y. 10528; (800) 678-0678.
Hertz's Affordable Europe Early Booking Special also requires payment by Friday. The price does not include V.A.T. or collision damage waiver. Hertz's smallest car is a Ford Fiesta or equivalent. In Britain, the weekly cost is $128; in France, $194; in Germany $161; in Spain, $179, and in Italy, $231 including the theft waiver.
Hertz International, (800) 654-3001.
Avis Europe's program is called Discover Europe. This company's "A" car is an Opel Corsa or Peugeot 106 or the equivalent with two doors. Weekly rates for this model, without V.A.T. or collision damage waiver: Britain, $142; France, $186; Germany, $149, and Spain, $180. In Italy, Avis's smallest car is a "B," a Lancia Y10 or the equivalent, another car better for two people than four. A rate for this model, quoted in mid-March for the week of May 2 to 9, was $201, including the theft waiver.
Avis Worldwide, (800) 331-1084.
Europcar, an affiliate of National, calls its guaranteed dollar rate Advansaver. Europcar's economy cars are the Renault Clio, Ford Fiesta, Opel Corsa or the equivalent. The weekly rate, without V.A.T. or collision damage waiver, in Britain is $143; in France, $212; in Germany, $128; in Spain, $198, and in Italy, $276 with theft protection.
National Europcar, (800) 227-3876.
Auto Europe, another booking agency for overseas companies, uses Avis, Europcar and independent operators in 26 European countries. The smallest cars are the Opel Corsa, Fiat Punto or the equivalent. The rate, without V.A.T. or collision damage waiver, in Britain is $135; in France, $185; in Germany, $109; in Spain, $167, and in Italy, $269 with the theft waiver.
Auto Europe, Post Office Box 7006, Portland, Me. 04112; (800) 223-5555.
 
One for the Road
 Some companies offer extras this year. Avis has special services for Britain, France, Germany or Italy. The first, Know Before You Go, is reached in the United States by calling (800) 297-4447, 24 hours a day. It answers questions about driving in these countries -- for instance the price of a gallon of fuel in dollars. This line also provides the number for a second service, On Call, which offers toll-free numbers in Britain, France, Germany or Italy for support services 24 hours a day. On Call is intended for such crises as finding an English-speaking doctor or a cash machine. The appropriate number must be obtained before departure. A number for getting or retrieving phone messages may also be obtained before departure.
Hertz offers Le Swap for renters using the train through the Channel Tunnel. Renters can leave left-hand-drive cars behind and get right-hand drive in Calais, France, to use in England, or do the reverse in the other direction. If a renter on this plan does not return the car to the original country, there is no drop-off fee. Prices for this program, Shuttle passage included, start at $259 a week for an economy rental that starts in Britain or $320 in France. Hertz also has a system for renting in one of 16 countries and dropping off in another for a lower drop-off fee: about $55, calculated in local currency.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on March 26, about renting a car in Europe, misstated the price of a Kemwel car rental in Europe booked before March 31. Kemwel's smallest model in Italy cost $205 a week, including the theft liability waiver.

HEADLINE: A Guru's Journey -- A special report.;
The Seer Among the Blind: Japanese Sect Leader's Rise

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF with SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 25

 BODY:
As a boy attending a school for the blind, Shoko Asahara was weak-sighted but had better vision than his classmates. So he emerged as a king of the school, the one who would lead his buddies off campus when they wanted a restaurant meal.
 In exchange, they would pay for the meal. 
Mr. Asahara, now 40, has come a long way since then: He rides a Rolls-Royce instead of a bicycle, and he has built a multinational religious sect, a business empire worth tens of millions of dollars and a stockpile of chemicals sufficient to create enough nerve gas to kill perhaps millions of people. The chemicals have been found during police searches since the gas attack on the Tokyo subway system last Monday, in which 10 people died and 5,500 were injured.
 The image of the teen-age Shoko Asahara as the manipulative guru of a boarding school -- where he is the one people must depend on, where he interprets the surrounding world, where he makes the money -- seems to hold true today. By some accounts, the communes of Mr. Asahara's religious sect, Aum Shinrikyo, are attempts to recreate the culture of his childhood school for the blind.
 International concern about terrorism has traditionally focused on political groups with machine guns, plastic explosives and the backing of a pariah government. But Mr. Asahara shows that it is also possible for a bizarre religious figure with no governmental support to acquire in a few years the capability to engage in something closer to war than terrorism.
 Japanese newspapers have estimated that Aum's chemical stockpile could create enough nerve gas to kill 4.2 million to 10 million people, though how they did their reckoning is not clear.
 There is no evidence that this was Mr. Asahara's intention, and he has denied it vigorously. But by some estimates he could have created 50 tons of the nerve gas sarin and then achieved the kind of urban Armageddon that he has been predicting.
 "As we move toward the year 2000, there will be a series of events of inexpressible ferocity and terror," reads one of Aum's booklets, picked up from its Tokyo offices a few days ago. "The lands of Japan will be transformed into a nuclear wasteland. Between 1996 and January 1998, America and its allies will attack Japan, and only 10 percent of the population of the major cities will survive."
 In his writings and speeches, Mr. Asahara seems to reserve a special animus for the United States Government, and he has accused American military planes of dropping sarin on Aum's communes. But Aum is also bitterly hostile to Japan's Government. Last June the group set up a shadow government with a "Ministry of Finance," "Ministry of Education" and "Ministry of Construction." It is said to have planned to become an independent nation by 1997.
 Intelligent, soft-spoken, married with six children, Mr. Asahara is a far more complex figure than the cardboard image of a cult leader would suggest. He may wear a long beard, shocking pink robes and a beatific smile, but what is striking about his sect is that it is not a one-man show. He has attracted a core of bright young university graduates and trained scientists to help him in his missions, whether those be attracting recruits or synthesizing chemicals.
 Mr. Asahara denies any involvement in the subway attack on Monday. The police have not made public any evidence that he was responsible, but the police raids and discovery of chemical ingredients of nerve gas suggest that Aum is a prime suspect.
 In any case, for a spiritual leader, Mr. Asahara has shown a remarkable fascination with the temporal and the chemical. And his speeches have often mentioned such nerve gases as sarin, which the police say was used in the subway attack.
 "It has become clear now that my first death will be caused by something like a poison gas such as sarin," Mr. Asahara said a year ago, without explaining what he meant by his "first death." At that time, almost nobody in Japan had heard of sarin.
 
The Beginnings
A Younger Son Of a Poor Family
 Mr. Asahara was born Chizuo Matsumoto in a village in the southern island of Kyushu. The son of a tatami-mat maker, he grew up as the sixth of seven children in a tiny house.
 One of his older brothers had almost no vision and attended a school for the blind. His parents apparently decided to send Mr. Asahara, who had weak but adequate vision, and his younger brother, who had normal eyesight, to the same school for economic reasons: The children would receive a Government subsidy and free meals.
 Shoko Egawa, author of a critical biography of Mr. Asahara, suggests that he was obsessed in school with acquiring money and power. Mr. Asahara had saved $30,000 by the time he graduated from high school, and he also ran unsuccessfully for student body president in elementary, junior high and senior high schools.
 Mr. Asahara did show the first signs of his later mastery of physical fitness and body control, earning a black belt in judo while still in school.
 Although he spoke of attending medical school, Mr. Asahara reportedly failed exams and never attended college. Instead he moved to a Tokyo suburb to work as an acupuncturist. It was at this time, in 1978, that he met a college student, Tomoko Ishii, and married her.
 Mrs. Asahara is said to have become a senior executive in Aum Shinrikyo, and one of their children, an 11-year-old girl, is also said to be prominent in the sect. But very little is known of his family life.
 Mr. Asahara has been accused by former sect members of making occasional sexual advances against female recruits.
 "At about midnight one evening, I was called to go to the room of the Venerated Teacher," recalled a woman who later left the sect. She wrote her account in a pamphlet prepared by a lawyers' group critical of Aum.
 "There were just the two of us in the room, and he asked me if I had had any experience with men," the woman wrote. "And he asked me how many men I knew, and then he asked me to take off my clothes. I didn't think he could do anything wrong, and I was nervous and didn't want to resist, so I did as he said."
 The woman said that Mr. Asahara told her not to tell anyone about the liaison.
 
Shift to Religion
From Fake Drugs To Marketing Yoga
 In the early 1980's Mr. Asahara opened up a shop selling Chinese medicine. He is said to have made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling potions like tangerine peel in alcohol, and in 1982 he was arrested and fined for selling fake drugs.
 Mr. Asahara became interested in yoga, and scholars say he became an excellent yoga practitioner, with very good control over his breathing technique. In 1984 he launched a company called Aum -- the name apparently is based on a Sanskrit word -- that ran a yoga school and sold health drinks.
 An expert in marketing, Mr. Asahara traveled to India and Nepal to study Hinduism and Buddhism, and he came back with photos of himself with senior Tibetan lamas, including the Dalai Lama. He used these photos to portray himself as an internationally respected religious authority, and his yoga school became extremely successful.
 In 1987, with just 10 followers, Mr. Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo as a religious sect. It emphasized some Tibetan Buddhist teachings and yoga practices, including meditation and breathing control. But one of the central points of Tibetan Buddhism is compassion -- some Tibetans have trouble digging foundations for buildings, for fear that they will inadvertently slice apart a worm -- and compassion did not play a big role in Aum's theology.
 Of Japan's 185,000 religious organizations, most are Buddhist or Shinto shrines, but since the 1970's there has also been a growing number of sects like Aum Shinrikyo. Young people turned off by Japan's materialism and searching for something to believe in found a home in such groups.
 Susuma Oda, a professor of psychopathology at the University of Tsukuba, suggests that one attraction of cults is that they offer young Japanese their first real father figure, because their own fathers were never home when they were growing up but instead were always at the office. Professor Oda also says that religious sects in Japan are to some extent the equivalent of the drug culture in America, offering people relief from stress and the opportunity to develop creative powers.
 In its pamphlets, Aum says that it can help people develop supernatural powers. It shows photographs of Mr. Asahara and others "levitating" in a yoga position, a few inches off the ground, but videotapes of the group indicate that this is achieved by bouncing energetically on the floor.
 Aum also emphasizes the use of computers and scientific experimentation, and it offers recruits special headgear of batteries and electrodes so that they can supposedly align their brain waves with Mr. Asuhara's. At each step of the way, followers are asked to donate large sums of money.
 Perhaps because of the emphasis on science, Mr. Asahara was able recruit bright but discontented university students from such top institutions as Tokyo University. Many were trained in the sciences.
 "There are many sophisticated people among the members," said Yoshiro Ito, a lawyer who has represented parents trying to recover their children from the sect. "They come from elite families."
 As a result, Aum is not a one-man operation. Mr. Asahara's deputies are subordinate but still powerful, and there is no doubt about their intellectual prowess.
 Aum's chief spokesman, for example, is a 35-year-old lawyer named Yoshinobu Aoyama, a graduate of prestigious Kyoto University. He passed the national exam for lawyers as a college junior, becoming the youngest person in his class to do so.
 Mr. Aoyama took yoga classes from Mr. Asahara and then in 1989 renounced his wife and daughter and became a monk in Aum.
 
Secrets of Success
A Mix of Charm And Intimidation
 Some scholars say Mr. Asahara was a third-rate theologian but a first-rate salesman and expert in mind control. Professor Oda says Mr. Asahara used methods like sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation and food deprivation, and perhaps drugs as well. There have been persistent reports of Aum using drugs, probably primarily as hallucinogens to evoke the supernatural.
 Practices in Aum emphasized control over natural impulses and the body. One man who said he was abducted into Aum, in part by his daughters, told the newspaper Asahi that he was given an infusion drip of some unknown medication for three months. The man said he was told to drink the equivalent of two and a half gallons of hot water a day and throw it up, apparently to purge his system. He was also forced to undergo a weekly bowel-cleansing procedure.
 The man was finally allowed to leave only when he pretended that he had been converted and was prepared to turn over his money to the sect, Asahi reported.
 Despite such experiences, it is clear that most members join Aum voluntarily and apparently believe in the sect with passion. Many find it fulfilling and liberating, and they are appalled by the critical news coverage.
 When the police raided Aum's training compound in the village of Kamiku Isshiki a few days ago, they found 50 people in an advanced state of malnutrition and dehydration, some barely conscious. The police were horrified and arrested four doctors who were present on charges of imprisoning the others.
 But instead of thanking the police for rescuing them, the malnourished followers have remained in the chapel and refused medical attention.
 Aum demanded that followers live in communes and cut off relations with their families, and this led to clashes and lawsuits with family members. There have also been repeated cases in which Aum has been accused of harassing, attacking, kidnapping or even killing its opponents.
 Earlier this year, according to Japanese newspaper reports, a woman trying to drop out of Aum was told she would be allowed to do so only if she signed over her property to the sect. She agreed, but her brother strongly opposed the idea. On Feb. 28, the deadline that Aum had set for the property transfer, he was kidnapped off the street.
 The police subsequently located the rented van used in the kidnapping and found blood matching the brother's, as well as the fingerprint of a senior Aum member. The brother has not been found.
 Mr. Asahara has denied any involvement in the kidnappings or killings. But the fact that many doubt his denials may offer him some protection, by making journalists afraid to write critical articles.
 Japanese journalists say that there was some reluctance to write about Aum, because some reporters who had done so received threatening letters at their homes. Telephone taps have been found at the homes of some critics of Aum, although the group denies placing the taps.
 In any case, Mr. Asahara can be charming as well as intimidating, and that perhaps is one of the secrets to his success. He has a knack for getting away with saying the strangest things.
 Two years ago, a group of Tokyo residents were furious about an Aum office next door that they said was emitting a stench they described as like that of "burning flesh." One evening, several hundred angry local residents converged outside the Aum office, when Mr. Asahara pulled up in his Mercedes-Benz limousine.
 He agreed to meet in a nearby park with a neighborhood representative, an electrical supply shop owner named Hirokazu Matsukawa. Mr. Matsukawa recalls that Mr. Asahara spoke politely and calmly and said with an expression of perfect seriousness that the odor came from "soybean oil and Chanel No. 5."
 "I couldn't smile or laugh when he said that," Mr. Matsukawa said. "But when Asahara left and I explained what he said to the neighbors, everyone laughed."
 
Hints of Mortality
As Health Slides, Apocalypse Looms
 In earlier years, Aum seemed to want to work within the system. In 1990 Mr. Asahara and many of his aides ran for Parliament, although all lost. More recently, Aum appears to have become more radical, and its theology more apocalyptic, and some people believe the reason has to do with Mr. Asahara's deteriorating health.
 He is said to have a liver ailment, perhaps cancer, but this is impossible to confirm. In public he sometimes seems tired, but he is not obviously ill. In any case, Mr. Asahara has been complaining publicly at least since early last year that his health is failing.
 "My body is considerably damaged now," Mr. Asahara said in a videotape recorded just a few days ago and broadcast on Japanese television.
 In the videotape he says he was infected with Q-fever, an obscure ailment first found in Australia, where he says airplanes sprayed his compound with the disease. Mr. Asahara compares Q-fever to the plague, but doctors in Tokyo said that its symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia and that it can be cured.
 Perhaps because of his declining health, Mr. Asahara may be giving increasing control over Aum to some of his lieutenants. But some people suggest that Mr. Asahara's own illness and his confrontation with his mortality -- if his ailment is that serious -- have encouraged him toward a more apocalyptic vision of the future, and perhaps even toward technologies of extermination such as nerve gas.
 Mr. Asahara increasingly has come to emphasize a Manichean vision of the world, in which good and evil are in a constant battle. He sometimes seems to see himself cast as the force that will rise up and destroy the evil --represented by the United States and Japanese Governments -- in order to save the world.
 Many of Mr. Asahara's teachings are drawn from Buddhism and the occult, but he also emphasizes a Hindu god, Lord Shiva, whose role in Hinduism may bear an eerie connection to Aum's present interest in poison gases. Shiva is a god of destruction and creation, and his job is to destroy so that life can be renewed.
 "Maybe he thinks of himself as a living Shiva," said Shinichi Nakazawa, a professor of religious studies who has met Mr. Asahara several times. "Shiva, you know, has two faces -- one is peaceful and one is destructive."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Ed Dombroskas;
Diversity Is the Draw for Tourism Industry

BYLINE: By MIMI G. SOMMER 

 BODY:
TOURISM, like travel, conjures up images of relaxation, seldom a picture of the bustling multibillion-dollar industry it represents, an industry that is growing rapidly and changing our social, technological, environmental and economic lives.
Tourists spent $3.9 billion in Connecticut in 1993 (the latest year for which figures are available), supporting 110,000 jobs in the state. And that is exclusive of the totals from the Foxwoods casino complex. 
 "Unlike other industries, tourism isn't an entity that you can put a circle around. It's hotels, restaurants, shopping, the marine trades, the arts," said Ed Dombroskas, executive director for tourism in Connecticut's Department of Economic Development. "It's a compilation of endeavors eager for one focus."
The First White House Conference on Travel and Tourism, scheduled for October in the nation's capitol, places an official spotlight on tourism. In January, six delegates were chosen to represent Connecticut at the conference and Mr. Dombroskas, in his capacity as tourism director, will also be going.
Mr. Dombroskas, a Connecticut native, was a vice president of Connecticut State University before joining the Department of Economic Development. In 1992, tourism, which had been a subdivision within the Department of Economic Development, became a division and Mr. Dombroskas was named to head it. He also serves on the Department of Environmental Protection's Connecticut River advisory committee, a group designed to protect and make accessible Connecticut waterways.
In a recent interview in his office in Rocky Hill, Mr. Dombroskas discussed tourism. Excerpts from that conversation follow.
 Q. Was 1992 a turning point for Connecticut tourism?
A. Yes. Legislated Public Act 92-184 moved tourism into a major departmental status. A Tourism Council was formed to provide policy direction and offer challenge grants to regional districts for projects that foster tourism goals. The Commissioner asked me to serve as chairman of a task force which was formed to develop a new basis for tourism to operate in the state. It reshaped tourism district regions. Eleven geographic tourism districts replaced 19.
 Q. What is the relationship between the tourism division and the regional tourism districts?
A. In the past, districts were without a statewide program, so they were not only responsible for promoting their particular attractions, but had to promote the state as well. With the new formulations, they can concentrate on promoting themselves.
Q. How do you promote the state as a special place to visit?
A. Our draw is diversity. You have the seashore, farm country, mountains and cities in a compact area. Two and a half hours is the longest distance you'd have to travel from, say, the northeastern corner to the far southwestern corner. Our function is to increase Connecticut's image and economic impact. We do this through advertising, education, information and public relations and public awareness, and by working with the regional districts and neighboring states.
We publish the yearly Vacation Guide, an official tourist map, a "Come to Connecticut" brochure, a "Connecticut Created" catalogue, a "Connecticut Grown" guide to pick-your-own farm operations, a craft brochure, a skiing leaflet -- and if you're a film maker, you can get the film and production manual. In 1993 we added a 24-hour reservation service to our 800-282-6863 number, and this year we're adding a calling option with information and lodging connected to the Special Olympics.
 Q. The Special Olympics?
A. It's a unique, historic, mega event to be held in New Haven the first week in July. The Special Olympics International Congress in Washington asked if we would provide the services of our celebration event specialist, Bob Gregson, to them for the Sights in the Sound event -- along I-95's New Haven waterfront, a week-long festival. Through our Tourism Council and our promotion fund, we're been providing funding and information services to them.
Q. Are there general information centers within the state?
A. This year we are improving our information centers with trained full-time employees. Key centers open yearround are Darien, North Stonington, Danbury, Willington and Bradley International Airport. We'll continue to operate either seasonal or self-service information centers in Westbrook, Southington, Windsor Locks, Middletown, Wallingford, Plainfield and on the Merritt Parkway in Greenwich.
Q. What informational link do you have with schools?
A. We get thousands of letters annually from schools across the country asking about the state. We send them our small brochure. It gives the key facts about Connecticut.
Q. How do you address the question of safety?
A. By confronting it and offering practical suggestions. The community is the best source of information on safety. Public, state and individual awareness is important.
You can call the region you're visiting and ask for information on hospitality tours or escorted services. There are uniformed guides for downtown Hartford, stationed at key points in town. One should call the Greater Hartford tourism district for details.
Q. What do you tell tourists about our environmental problems?
A. We have two major environmental resources that we need to focus on, Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River Valley and other rivers.
We are trying to develop a system sensitive to the travelers' needs and the environment. We don't want to make our natural resources completely preservation so no one will go near them.
Q. Do you receive help from the Federal Government?
A. I've worked with the Federal Government, and obtained a grant for promoting scenic highways in Connecticut. For the first time, the Federal Government has looked at its transportation dollars as being part of tourism. The Connecticut legislature created a scenic highway committee about 10 years ago. Roads can be nominated as scenic if they meet state criteria. With Connecticut's Department of Transportation, we were able to get Federal funding to help us promote these highways. So, there is a direct linkage.
We applied for funds from the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, part of the Department of Commerce, for the purpose of promoting New England as a destination for international travelers.
Q. What is the goal of the first White House Conference on Travel and Tourism?
A. The conference focuses on nine key issues, from technology and education to safety and the environment. The idea behind it is, each state would have the opportunity to bring to the table concerns for the growth of the tourism industry in each of those nine areas and, with that, be able to create a national visioning position that would help drive new legislation, a new focus as to how tourism is fostered in the United States
Q. 1993 was the year of a new Connecticut slogan, "Connecticut -- We're full of surprises." How did that come about and what are some of those surprises?
A. "Full of surprises" grew out of consumer groups we visited in New York and Philadelphia. There was a common theme. If we said the Steam Train-Valley Railroad was in Essex, the Goodspeed Opera House was in Haddam, or the Peabody Natural History Museum was at Yale, the Mark Twain House in Hartford, the Maritime Center in Norwalk, the naturally occurring dinosaur tracks in Rocky Hill or that famed Impressionists came here to paint and that their collections are in Hartford, they would say, "Gee that's a surprise"!
Q. What are some of Connecticut's newest surprises?
A. A consortium of museums that focus on Impressionism received a Challenge Grant from the state to develop a Connecticut Impressionist Trail. Mystic Seaport Museum and the Mystic Aquarium have received Department of Economic Development business assistance grants for research and exhibit expansion. Robert Ballard, a marine scientist from Woods Hole is an undersea exploration researcher who will come here to work in Mystic Aquarium's expanded plant.
"Reckless," starring Mia Farrow, finished filming in Georgetown about a month ago. We're excited about it, as it's our first major film since "Other People's Money," starring Danny DeVito.
Connecticut was just designated its first National Heritage Corridor, the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley of Northeastern Connecticut. Rte 169, a Connecticut Scenic Highway, is within that corridor. Now the effort is to make that area usable by visitors, tourist friendly with brochures and signs.

HEADLINE: When Whitman Comes Calling

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES 

 BODY:
AT 2 o'clock on the morning of Feb. 1, lights still burned in the new corporate headquarters of Dendrite International in Harding Township. Maintenance workers polished and cleaned. A photographer set up his lighting equipment. A red carpet was rolled out. Two hours later and 100 yards down the road at Monterey Gourmet, cooks were turning out tiny crepes and potato latkes for the big event. The Governor was coming.
For Lou Ares, Dendrite's manager of marketing communications, the planning for Christine Todd Whitman's visit to the company was a nightmare of large and small demands: guest lists, invitations, floral arrangements, flags (state and American). "The devil is in the details," he said. "I would wake up at 3 A.M. and think about another contingency to cover." 
 At precisely 9:30 A.M., as promised, Mrs. Whitman and her entourage rolled up to the door. The Governor cut a ribbon dedicating the headquarters site, using a pair of sheep shears from Australia, where Dendrite had its start. She spoke to guests and employees for 10 minutes, accepted an Australian bush hat, posed for photographs, toured the building and left. The visit lasted 45 minutes.
Other governors before Mrs. Whitman have attended their share of such events, of course, but officials say she has spent more than the usual amount of time out and about the state. "When I talk to people who have worked with previous governors," said Rita Manno, Mrs. Whitman's press secretary, "they find it incredible how many of these events she attends."
Aside from being the Governor, Mrs. Whitman has a special attraction as a bona fide national celebrity and media star. Just a week before her visit to Dendrite, she became the first Republican Governor to rebut a Presidential State of the Union address. Time, Newsweek and People were just a few of the national publications to carry major articles about her. She was included on Senator Bob Dole's short list of possible running mates in his bid for the Presidency.
As a result, her office has been inundated with hundreds of invitations to groundbreakings, keynote addresses, school programs and the like. Most decisions as to which ones are accepted are made by Peter Verniero, the Governor's chief of staff, and Jane M. Kenny, the director of policy and planning.
But Carl Golden, the administration's director of communications, added, "While the staff is aware of Mrs. Whitman's own priorities, many of her appearances result from requests made directly to her office."
The Governor's appearance at Dendrite had its genesis in a September letter to Mrs. Whitman from John Bailye, president of Dendrite. The company had leased a former AT&T site in Harding Township and hoped the Governor could preside over the ribbon-cutting.
Dendrite, which makes electronic management software for pharmaceutical companies, moved to New Jersey in 1987. It has been a model corporate import, a species the Governor has sought to encourage. Sales have soared from $3.2 million in 1988 to a projected $53 million this year. The company employs 450 people.
"Dendrite has expanded so much it is a boon to New Jersey," Ms. Manno said. "The Governor wanted to show her support for a company that has had such an impact on the state's economy."
On Dec. 16, Dendrite learned that the Governor would be coming, and the preparations began. Mr. Ares and Lyndall Bailye, the company president's wife, who heads the special projects division, lined up consultants to help design the invitations and handle the publicity. "The more we planned, the more meetings we would have," Mr. Ares said.
Problem: The company cafeteria, where the ceremony would take place, lacked a certain elegance. Solution: Black draperies and flowering trees to turn the area into a formal reception area.
Problem: The breakfast would be served in the executive dining room, but it would have to be eaten standing because of the crowd. It could be awkward, with food spilling on the floor. Solution: Monterey Gourmet provided special spillproof trays.
Meanwhile, the Governor's office wanted to know just how the event would be organized. Who would introduce Mrs. Whitman? Who else would be present?
On the day before the visit, a member of the Governor's staff drove to Harding Township to walk through and around the Dendrite building, determining the location of telephones and assuring that the Governor's party would have easy access to the site.
The Governor's visit, Mr. Ares said, went off pretty much as planned, from the arrival of her two-car convoy, the back-up driven by a state trooper, to the ribbon-cutting, recorded by still camera and video.
The only small hitch came when Mr. Bailye started to hand the sheep shears to Mrs. Whitman. That particular detail had not been known to her entourage in advance, and the state troopers started to move in before they realized that all was well.
Sometimes, in spite of all the planning that goes into a visit by the Governor, fate intrudes. That happened on Dec. 5, when the Governor was scheduled to show up at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. She was to be hoisted in a cage, suspended on a cable, to a steel fly tower atop the proscenium arch of the center's Great Hall, 85 feet above the ground. There she was to tighten the final bolt on the steel frame and sign her name on the grid.
The planning for her visit was elaborate. "When you cover every detail, a star, in this case the Governor, comes on the scene and doesn't have to worry about stepping in mud or the microphone not working," said Jerome Enis, a spokesman for the arts center. "All she has to do is to think about what she is going to say. She's free to project her personality."
Before the event, he said, "all the Governor asked was, 'Is it safe?,' and I answered, 'Honestly, yes.' " Mrs. Whitman agreed to go along.
Mr. Enis provided her with a one-piece blue coverall that had "Governor" stitched in red on the front and, on the back, "The New Jersey Performing Arts Center." There also was a hard hat.
The day before the ceremony, Mr. Enis recalled, the forecast was for rain early, then clearing. The Governor was to appear at 11 A.M., he said, "so that still gave us some time."
By 6 A.M. of the day of the visit, the construction site was a sea of mud. "It rained so hard it looked as if the ground was moving," he said. "The mud was so deep underfoot that planks put over it just sank into the ground." And the Governor's visit was canceled.
"When things run smoothly, no one thinks of the myriad of details that make it happen," Mr. Enis said. "It's like watching professional ball players. Everything they do looks easy. Try it; it will take a month of practice before the ball goes through the hoop the way the all-stars do it. That's if it doesn't rain."
Often the time that elapses between an invitation to the Governor and her arrival can dramatically change the circumstances. Last November the new commander at the Picatinny Arsenal, Brig. Gen. James W. Boddie, thought it would be a good idea to meet Mrs. Whitman and show her around the base.
But by the time of the visit on Feb. 1, rumors were flying that the base was scheduled to be closed as part of the Pentagon's base reduction program. Now, General Boddie said, "I wanted to thank the Governor for the state's lobbying in support of our facility." Her visit was also a morale booster for Picatinny's workers at an uncertain time, he said. Two weeks later, the Army announced that Picatinny would not be closed.
A radio talk show and a letter led to Governor Whitman's visit to Asbury Park last November. Patricia Lesinski was listening to the radio while driving to her job as a clerk in a law firm a year ago when she heard State Treasurer Brian Clymer say that Mrs. Whitman wanted residents to make their concerns known. Ms. Lesinski was fed up with the scandals and juvenile crime and drugs in Asbury Park, and together with her sister Barbara, a dispatcher with the Asbury Park Police Department, she wrote to Mr. Clymer.
Mr. Clymer, in turn, passed the letter to Harriet Derman, the State Commissioner of Community Affairs, who invited the sisters to Trenton last May.
Barbara Lesinski is a captain in the city's new Neighborhood Watch program. "We asked Ms. Derman could she bring the Governor to Asbury Park to see our problems first hand," Barbara Lesinski said. The sisters also reported on the Neighborhood Watch group.
The first tour, by Ms. Derman, took place the following month, and the sisters took advantage of the occasion to repeat their invitation to the Governor. It took a while, but their persistence paid off five months later. The Governor met with the Neighborhood Watch group at the St. Peter Claver Youth Center.
"The tables were arranged in a square," Barbara Lesinski said. "No one sat at the head. Mrs. Whitman listened and made some common sense suggestions. She made us feel there is hope."

HEADLINE: A Democrat's Contract With Meriden

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SINCE he took office in 1993, Meriden Mayor Joseph J. Marinan Jr. has tackled welfare reform, overhauled the Head Start program and a city dental clinic, and put more than 15 new police officers on the street.
His administration has privatized garbage collection and police and fire dispatch services, and cut its City Hall staff by 12 percent. When he took office, the city was providing $12,000 for legal fees of low-income tenants involved in a dispute with their landlords; he offset that with an equal amount for landlords. 
 For the first time, social service organizations seeking city funding have had to provide a breakdown of cost per unit of service provided, so city council members could make direct comparisons.
To outsiders Mr. Marinan might sound like one of the new "Contract with America" Republicans. But he's a lifelong Democrat -- a Democrat who has not lost touch with the middle class, he says. The G.O.P. win in the last election was not a defection of the middle class, he said, it was a defection of the party.
"It wasn't that the middle class left the Democrats; the Democrats left the middle class," Mr. Marinan said.
Across Connecticut, of course, hard-hit cities are trying to rein in expensive social programs. Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven are all trying to crack down on welfare fraud.
But among the experts it's generally agreed that few cities have gone as far as Meriden, a city of 59,000 where 42 percent of the population is on fixed incomes, either pensions or welfare.
Mr. Marinan has been accused of trying to drive the poor people out of the city, and the white-haired, blue-eyed, chain-smoking 46-year-old Meriden native offers no apologies.
"If you don't want to work and you don't want to go to school, if you want to sell drugs, we don't want you in Meriden anyway," Mr. Marinan said. "If I lose some poor people, it'll never match the number of middle class people we've lost. That may sound harsh, but there are always some casualties in any great effort, and I think this is a great effort, a noble effort to save a great city."
The council's minority leader, Walter Shamock, a Republican, said he often finds himself fighting on the same side as the Mayor. "We don't always see eye to eye, but when it comes to social services and welfare we generally agree," Mr. Shamock said. "He's a Republican at heart."
Not everyone thinks Mr. Marinan has drifted too far to the right, however. Frank J. Cirillo, Democratic Town Chairman, said the Mayor's views are widely held in Meriden at least.
"If you're talking what mainstream Democratic philosophy was 10 years ago, it might be different, but for 1995 it's what the public wants, and reflects what's happening in the city," Mr. Cirillo said.
In fact, he noted, Mr. Marinan's proposals would go nowhere if they were not implemented by the 12-member City Council, which has only two Republicans. "There are some who think he's taking it too quickly -- not necessarily too far, but too quickly," Mr. Cirillo said. "But you can't take two or three or four years to get where you've got to get in one year."
James F. Belote, 55, a city council member who was a Democrat until 1980, then switched to the G.O.P., said he understands Mr. Marinan's position. "The more social services you offer, the more the community becomes a magnet for people who need social services," Mr. Belote said. "It's time for other towns to pick up their fair share."
Some, however, are wary that the changes pushed by the Mayor could hurt people.
"I have a real concern that in all these reforms, people who really need help are going to be denied it, they're going to be lost in the shuffle," said Anna P. Neumon, a Democratic City Council member. "I don't want to just take an ax and start chopping."
Others are even more critical. "Joe Marinan has this enormous ego, he's trying to convince people he's Newt Gingrich," said Diane Tavegia, who participated in a protest on the steps of City Hall opposing Mr. Marinan's cuts. "He's got one child, going to a Catholic school, and he opposes the school budget every year and we've got school books dating back to the 1940's. He's ruining our town. He's going to make Meriden the object of national ridicule."
Leonard E. McCain, director of Health and Human Services in Meriden, said cuts to the AIDS program, a dental clinic, and other programs "have served to put the community's health at risk."
He said a three-month hiatus last year in the AIDS program and the associated sexual education programs was probably one reason the number of syphilis cases in Meriden doubled in 1994, from 10 to 20.
"An enlightened public policy should support things like school-based health clinics, and access to primary care and effective communicable disease programs," Mr. McCain said.
Mr. McCain also said his office prepared an application for a $62,000 grant that would have studied the gang problem in the city and tried to develop solutions.
"When it was rejected it left me wondering if anyone had read it," Mr. McCain said. "This year, the city has endorsed it, but it's a year later and for half the amount. How many kids would have been positively affected if this program had been in place a year ago?"
But social service organizers recognize that Mr. Marinan has tapped into a powerful political vein.
"In some regards he's in step with the political tenor of the times," said Matthew Melmed, the long-time director of the Connecticut Association for Human Services who recently took a job with a children's services organization in Washington, D.C.
"It's really disturbing that we're starting to see these politics of 'divide and conquer,' and that's what's happening in Meriden, the politicians are running on a platform that opposes poor people."
"Instead of trying to grapple with the issues in a reasoned manner, it's easy for the politicians to come up with slogans and people respond to it, because the system hasn't worked," Mr. Melmed said. "Politicians are capitalizing on the frustration that's out there."
Mr. Marinan seems unfazed by the criticism, though. "I know people call me Mayor Meany and worse things, but it isn't like I cut social service programs and put the money in my own pocket."
Instead, he said, he is diverting money to rebuild the city's infrastructure so it can attract economic development, without raising the city's already high tax rate.
"We've got 25 percent of the city population on some form of state assistance, and 22 percent on some form of Federal assistance. There's not enough people carrying the load. We've got to reverse that so we can care for people who legitimately need assistance.
"Some people have said, 'Why can't you go slower?' but we can't afford to go slow," Mr. Marinan said. "We need dramatic results to preserve the middle class."
Mr. Marinan was thrust into the spotlight early in his term, when the school board tried, with his support, to avoid a state order that Meriden offer breakfast in schools with high proportions of low-income families.
Mr. Marinan said he opposes the inconsistency in the welfare program. The state gives families money to make sure they can feed their children, then sets up a separate program to do it for the same families.
He also scrapped a $250,000 dental clinic the city operated, in favor of a private operation; he contends it serves as many people, but makes more of an effort to collect insurance money, to be self-supporting.
Mr. Marinan opposed expanding the counseling program for people with AIDS, and when social service advocates tried to do an end run around him, bringing more counselors in with Federal grant money, Mr. Marinan proposed scrapping the entire program. A compromise has an AIDS counselor working part-time in Meriden.
Mr. Marinan said if you have an AIDS program in Meriden, people who have AIDS will move to the city for the services it offers. Most of those people will end up on welfare as their health deteriorates, which means the city has to pay 20 percent of their medical bills.
"I don't have to tell anyone what 20 percent of the medical bill for an active AIDS patient could be," Mr. Marinan said.
Councilwoman Neumon flatly disagrees. "People with AIDS are going to stay close to their family and their support, they're not going to move into Meriden just because we've got an AIDS counselor," she said.
She also noted that since the disease has affected people in the community, it's important to educate people who don't have it how to avoid it.
"There are a lot of constituents in Meriden these days who are angry about the issue of the AIDS counselor, about food stamps and welfare, and other social service programs, but they don't have all the information about how these things work," Ms. Neumon said.
"Joe Marinan is a smart politician who listens to people and gives them what they want," she acknowledged, adding with a laugh that, "I'm not one of the popular Democrats these days."
Mr. Marinan has promoted a policy of tearing down abandoned, derelict houses. He has provided financial assistance to landlords who are trying to evict tenants, to break the cycle that leads to abandoned housing -- when the landlord is not being paid, the property is not maintained, he said.
And he has ordered city officials to inspect any house where there is a drug raid or violence associated with drugs, the result being that most are declared in violation of the building code, and shut down. He said he's not worried about the legal implications of such targeted enforcement.
"We pay our attorneys to get us out of trouble, not to give us opinions that prohibit us from doing what's best for the city of Meriden," Mr. Marinan said.
At the same time, in a partnership with the local vocational school, the city is constructing new multifamily houses on vacant lots and he has pushed tax breaks and other incentives for people to buy rental properties as owner-tenants.
If someone is living with their family on the first floor, he said, they won't tolerate drug dealing on the second floor. This year, he expects the city will provide 25 to 30 people with an opportunity to own their own home. "You've got to use the same common sense you do when you try to sell a house -- you fix it up, clean it so you make people want to move there," Mr. Marinan said.
Meriden also has one of the most ambitious welfare reform programs in the state. People on welfare must report to City Hall at least once a month to renew their benefits, instead of once every four months in other cities. This, it is said, reduces fraud.
People on welfare who are able to work are expected to be on workfare, or working toward a high school degree; those who have a substance abuse problem must seek counseling to continue their benefits.
"Last month we threw 136 people off welfare because they didn't comply with the program," Mr. Marinan said. "We've cut welfare costs 38 percent since I took office."
The Head Start program that was privately operated was taken over by the city when he discovered abuses like the use of Head Start buses to take people on grocery shopping trips. He said he also had a philosophical difference with the way it was run -- that it should emphasize scholastic preparedness rather than social services.
"We've got to be able to stand up and say, 'This program is not working, change it,' " Mr. Marinan said. "People do need some assistance, but it shouldn't be a free ride."
Mr. Marinan said while he scales back some of the things city government has done in the past, he also realizes there are many jobs it must do better.
"We've paved more roads in Meriden in the last year than we'd done in the last three years. We bought $400,000 worth of computers for our students. We put new police officers on our streets. We're going to spend more than $70 million rebuilding out schools. Those things are an investment in our future."
For Mr. Marinan and his opponents alike, the question now is whether the public will support, over the long term, the changes taking place in Meriden.
"We're starting to see people come back, they're taking advantage of the depressed real estate market to move into Meriden," Mr. Marinan said. "But more important, I've heard from people who didn't put their houses on the market, who were waiting to see what would happen, and so far they like what they see."
But Mr. Melmed said a poll a week before the 1994 elections, when Republicans dominated, showed that 84 percent of the American people agree spending money on children is a good investment, and 63 percent would pay more in taxes if it was used for that purpose.
"That tells me people are frustrated but they aren't ready to give up," Mr. Melmed said. "And politicians who don't recognize that are going to pay the price in the long run.
But Mrs. Tavegia said she was concerned that Mr. Marinan represents at least the near-term future of the city.
"I think the people of Meriden are stupid enough to re-elect him in a landslide, and it'll take another couple of years at least before people begin to wake up," she said.
Mr. Marinan said he's not sure he wants to run for a second term in the $12,000-a-year Mayor's post, but if he does he will continue his crusade.
"I'm here to do one thing, and that's to reverse the decline of my town," Mr. Marinan said. "For 30 years we've applied for every state and Federal program, bought into all the social services, and we became addicted to bureaucracies. Now it's time to stop.
"The fruits of our labor won't be seen in the next two years or three years, but if we can get our citizenry behind it I think it will carry forward no matter which way the political winds blow."

HEADLINE: Not All Colleges Bemoaning Albany Cuts

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
AT most private and public colleges in New York, the talk among administrators is mainly about cuts in state aid. To compensate for the proposed cuts, tuition at Iona College in New Rochelle could go up 6 percent next year and at Purchase College as much as 60 percent. Many colleges and universities are considering dropping courses, and some fear they might have to close.
But in the president's office at Mercy College, Jay Sexter is eschewing budget concerns for Far Eastern philosophy, and the only cutback he cares about is a recently announced reduction in tuition at the 40-acre campus fronting the Hudson River here. Moreover, enrollment is increasing, and the number of courses is growing. 
 "In China, the symbol for a problem is the same as for an opportunity," said the 59-year-old Dr. Sexter, an educator with a penchant for the nitty-gritty of the business world. Hired in 1989 to turn around the private college's flagging fortunes, Dr. Sexter said the question was not how to survive state budget cuts but how to turn them into an asset.
Dr. Sexter, called "the professor who brings home the bacon" in a 1977 Fortune magazine article, conceded that he is a maverick among college administrators because he "doesn't always follow the rules," especially when it comes to recruiting students. He conceded that Mercy College survives by attracting students that other colleges don't want. But he boasted about how the school, which recruits from inner-city neighborhoods and abroad, offers an education to people who might not otherwise go to college.
In Albany, Barbara W. Flynn, an assistant state education commissioner, said, "Obviously, Mercy is not a Cornell or a Columbia or an N.Y.U. It serves students with weaker academic preparation, but it still meets minimum standards." She said the college had cashed in on an overlooked population.
"I don't know how they are cutting tuition, especially in light of the proposed state cuts," she added, "but they are not breaking any rules."
Dr. Sexter described his tuition-reduction plan as simple and said, "It makes good business sense." Students pay a flat fee -- about $3,300 a semester -- instead of fees based on the number of credits involved -- for any course load over 12 credits. At $255 a credit, the saving under the new plan for a student carrying 16 credits would amount to $780. Those taking fewer than 12 credits will pay 7 percent more. The plan encourages students to finish in four years.
"The question for us was how to take a severe problem, that is, state cuts in the millions, and make it into an opportunity," Dr. Sexter said. "As other colleges raise tuition, students will begin looking around, and Mercy College will stick out."
Enrollment at Mercy College was 4,800 in 1990, a year after Dr. Sexter assumed the presidency; it was up by 46 percent last year to 7,000. A goal of 200 more students has already been met. By comparison, enrollment at Pace University in White Plains dropped 29 percent to 2,932 last year from 4,109 in 1990. At Purchase College, enrollment fell 19 percent over that time, to 3,732 from 4,619.
Nyack College in Rockland County and the College of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx are among the few colleges showing increased enrollment. Administrators at both colleges said their recruiters, like those at Mercy College, had singled out certain population segments.
At Nyack College, Dr. Betty J. Daughenbaugh, assistant dean, said the school recruits primarily in minority neighborhoods. At the College of Mount St. Vincent, Dr. Mary C. Stuart, the president, said that minority students and first-generation Americans contributed to a 31 percent increase in enrollment from 1990 to 1994.
Mercy College uses its diverse courses as an inducement in recruiting. It has developed a Korean bilingual program at the campus here and offers courses in Korean on a cable television station. It also offers courses in Spanish and encourages students in Ecuador and Colombia to take part in its international business exchange program.
Mercy College's Westchester Institute for the Study of English is intended for immigrants as is its English as a second language program.
The college also has extension centers in Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Port Chester, the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens, which often attract adults. One student, Lillian Morales, 35, a mother with two children, began her college studies on a part-time basis in Yonkers and is now a full-time student majoring in government.
David J. N. Juhren, 33, said that he and his wife, Ingrid, were discouraged by the young age of students at most colleges and chose to enroll at Mercy, where he said they fit in better. Mr. Juhren graduated last year with a major in government, and his wife is studying journalism.
In Queens and Brooklyn, the college works with recently arrived Russian immigrants, and Eva Spinelli, director of the college's extension centers, said that many of those students eventually come to the campus here to attend college full time.
Two years ago, the college began offering some courses by modem to computer users. One student, Sang Jun Choi from South Korea, started at the English Institute on the campus here, then became a full-time student, studying philosophy by computer. He graduated after four years with a bachelor's degree in computer science and is now the supervisor of the college's computer lab. Among other courses offered by computer are introduction to human genetics, economics and public policy and principles of management.
The college is also the only one in Westchester that offers master's degree programs in physical and occupational therapy.
Most of the students, however, are worried about proposed cuts in the state's Tuition Assistance Program, and the college sent 5,000 letters from both staff and students to Albany last month to protest the reductions.
Gov. George E. Pataki has refused to speak at Mercy College's commencement exercises this spring, and Dr. Sexter said, "that may have been for the best, because he could have been booed here."
In recent years Mercy has operated in the black on a yearly budget of $48 million, and Dr. Sexter complimented himself on that achievement.
"How many colleges can say they are balancing their budgets these days?" he asked rhetorically. "We haven't had a deficit in the last five years, and we won't again this year."
The college has benefited from state and Federal grants, which have risen 300 percent over the last five years to $1.9 million a year, not including tuition assistance. Grants from corporations, individuals and foundations have also risen during that period -- to $600,000 a year, a 50 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Who Put the Lid on gp120?

BYLINE: By Jesse Green; Jesse Green is a frequent contributor to the Magazine.

 BODY:
Some 15,000 vials of a colorless, odorless, waterlike liquid are lined up in trays in a room so cold, so remorselessly quiet, you can't help thinking of it as a tomb. In a way, it is. Each vial contains a one-milliliter dose of a product known as gp120, which has cost its manufacturer, Genentech, $100 million and untold grief. Is gp120, as some scientists believe, a crucial first approximation of the desperately needed vaccine to prevent AIDS? Or is it, as others say, nothing more than expensive dishwater? No one knows. Neither Genentech's product nor a similar vaccine made by Chiron Biocine has yet been tested enough to tell. So far, no vials have passed through the enormous steel doors to the loading dock beyond and from there into syringes and into the arms of the 10,000 volunteers whose bodies alone can answer the question. Instead, the vials sit and wait, with nothing to interrupt their silence but a workman's boom box, which suddenly sings out from the loading dock: "Who'll Stop the Rain?"
 
The Eureka Moment
"I was in Nigeria for cholera in 1970," Don Francis says fondly, as if recalling a world's fair. "The Sudan for Ebola virus, Phoenix for hepatitis B, just about everywhere for smallpox." The resume of his long career with the Centers for Disease Control reads like an itinerary of miracles. In Africa, India, Bangladesh, Francis helped eradicate terrible illnesses by the bold application of vaccine programs. But here in the United States, in his disheveled office at Genentech's headquarters on San Francisco Bay, miracles keep getting derailed. To Francis, the company's vaccine evangelist, gp120 represents the best hope yet of beating AIDS, and he is determined to test it and see. An equally determined army of opponents is arrayed against him. Perhaps that's why a ceramic figure of Sheetala Mata, the Indian goddess of smallpox, is sitting on his window ledge, embracing and supposedly blessing three vials of gp120. "They'll need all the help they can get," he says. 
 Francis has been at work on AIDS since before it had a name. In 1981, as the head of the C.D.C.'s successful vaccine effort against hepatitis B -- which relied on the cooperation of the gay community -- he was on hand when inexplicable outbreaks of Kaposi's sarcoma were first reported in the same population. What happened during the next 11 years still brings the bile of indignation to his voice. Scraping for money, pounding on tables, writing memos that were never answered, Francis spent as much time doing politics as science. Since he surmised that AIDS would prove to be transmissible through blood products, he begged the blood banks to screen donations; they did not believe him and infected thousands. Since he saw that gay bathhouses were a major route of sexual transmission, he begged local boards of health to shut them; an unlikely alliance of owners and activists kept them open. Francis's enemy, it turned out, wasn't so much the virus itself as the perverse intransigence of human nature that gave it room, and time, to maneuver.
Francis's fervor made him the most vivid character in Randy Shilts's book "And the Band Played On," but it also exaggerated the split in the public's perception of him. Some called him St. Francis for what they saw as his selfless crusade; others called him Don Quixote for what they saw as his demented arrogance. In fact he was becoming an AIDS Cassandra: doomed to be unheeded. In 1985, after his $37 million proposal to control the epidemic through education and blood testing was ignored in Washington, he transferred to California. In California, it seemed that scientists were doing something more about AIDS than just counting bodies. Francis worked briefly with Jonas Salk, who was developing an AIDS treatment vaccine in San Diego. Unlike traditional vaccines, which protect healthy people from becoming infected, a treatment vaccine would bolster the immune systems of people who are already infected, in hopes of slowing the course of their illness. But as exciting and important as such treatments were, Francis kept returning to his first love: prevention.
Francis had grown up in Marin County, the dyslexic, hippie child of two doctors; now, at 52, sitting behind a desk that's angled to catch a glimpse of the glittering bay, he seems to have come home. Sandy-haired and lanky, with a kind of rumpled charisma, he bears a very slight resemblance to Matthew Modine, the actor who played him in the television adaptation of Shilts's book. But the frivolity of Hollywood is nowhere in evidence. Even a bracelet on his left wrist turns out to be a moral statement: it has a tiny silver AIDS ribbon on it and is meant to be worn, like Vietnam bracelets, until the war is over. His face has arranged itself around his blue eyes in a permanent squint, like a driver looking for hours for the exit from a superhighway at night.
"It occurred to me to not do it any more," he says. "The family" -- he is married and has two sons -- "certainly would have said 'enough already.' But there's something about these dangerous viruses. . . ." He trails off, smiling. "I'd call it an addiction. On top of that there's the incredible joy that comes from defeating something -- a joy that I felt in a small way with hepatitis B. But with AIDS there's something else as well." He chooses his words carefully. "Almost everything I predicted all the way through has been correct, except for one manuscript from 1985 on how to use gp120 to make a prevention vaccine for AIDS. That one has yet to come to fruition."
By the time Francis joined Genentech in 1992 to run its vaccine clinical trials, gp120 had already suffered so many disasters -- and unlikely resuscitations -- that Phil Berman and Tim Gregory, the pair who led the team that developed the product, had chosen Indiana Jones as their mascot. The complete failure of their first attempt in 1986 had pushed the vaccine "out of development" and into the corporate equivalent of Siberia. To rescue the project, Berman and Gregory kept working, sub rosa and on their own time. Finally, on Jan. 3, 1989, in a Texas lab, Berman watched as two chimps were injected with a revamped version of gp120, two with a different product, called gp160, and two with a placebo to serve as controls. Nine months and three injections later, the "challenge" took place: all six were given intravenous injections of live H.I.V. -- the virus that causes AIDS in humans. By December, blood tests showed that the two control animals and the two given gp160 had been infected. The two chimps given gp120, though, were completely clear. "We waited longer and longer and longer and they still didn't break," Berman says. "Finally we knew it was true."
Chimpanzees are not an ideal model for AIDS in human beings. Though they get infected, they never show clinical signs of disease. And humans do not get "challenged" with H.I.V. through single massive injections in laboratories: they have sex without condoms repeatedly or share dirty needles. But the team had demonstrated, for the first time, that such a vaccine at least was possible -- changing the mood among scientists from bleak to hopeful. It would prove to be the high point in the strange life of gp120.
"Ah yes, the eureka moment," Francis says wistfully. "In science, you sit for a long time above the fog. You know the landing strip's down there somewhere, but you don't know where and you want to keep all your options open. Then suddenly the fog clears, the sun blazes through, you see the landing strip and you know your direction. And that's what I knew when the chimps were protected: we were on our way to an AIDS vaccine."
The events of the intervening years haven't diminished his certainty. "It's very unscientific to say," he says, without a trace of irony, "but I know this vaccine will work. It will protect humans. What I don't know is: how long and how broad is the protection? If a person has sex four months -- or four years -- after vaccination, will he be protected? And will it protect against all strains of H.I.V.?" He shrugs and leans forward, twisting himself into the symbol of his profession, a question mark.
"But science isn't about knowing -- it's about not knowing," he says. "If you have the answer, then why do a trial? The story of gp120 is not a story of good and evil. It's the story of status quo versus movement, of doing nothing instead of something." He revises himself. "This is the story of learning not to be afraid to fail."
 
What the Milkmaids Knew
"If you have the cowpox, you cannot take the smallpox" -- that's what 18th-century milkmaids said. When Edward Jenner set out to test the hypothesis, he did not appeal to government grant panels before exposing an 8-year-old boy named James Phipps to one disease and then the other. Two centuries later, Jenner's arrogance shocks our sensibilities, but arrogance can be effective: except for two frozen keepsakes, one in Atlanta and one in Moscow, smallpox no longer exists on earth. The milkmaids were right. Jenner's vaccine worked because the cowpox virus is similar enough to smallpox that Phipps's immune system learned from one how to fight off the other. Modern vaccines employ the same trick but are all man-made. Some (like vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella) are made from live virus that's been artificially weakened; some (like Pasteur's for rabies and Salk's for polio) use virus that's been killed but left whole.
The advent of genetic engineering in the late 1970's opened up a new avenue for vaccine development; Francis's 1985 paper on gp120 outlined how that technique could be used to make an AIDS vaccine. Completely avoiding the core of the virus, where the disease-causing genetic instructions lurk, scientists could now synthesize only those portions of the virus's coat that would stimulate an immune response. In the case of H.I.V., the most promising portion was the "subunit" called gp120: a snaking chain of protein that sticks out from the virus like a fist. (The gp stands for glycoprotein; the 120, for its molecular weight.) Francis knew that a similar technique had proved successful in the new hepatitis B vaccine, which worked because the immune system recognized the copied proteins as if they were natural and responded with long-term protection. The key advantage to this approach was safety: like a toy gun with no bullets, the vaccine could scare you into defending yourself but it could not actually shoot.
It was the Genentech team that first strung together, in the right order, the 511 amino acids that form the protein and who figured out how to produce billions of copies in Chinese hamster ovary cells. For this work, Francis calls his colleagues "wizards" -- but Berman and Gregory deflect the praise. "It's not particularly cutting edge," says Gregory. Says Berman, "Compared to the space program, it's a lot easier." The three men, sitting around a conference table with a plate of M & M brownies, play off each other like college roommates: Berman the teddy bear, Gregory the ski bum, Francis the firebrand. "Phil and Tim say it's simple because they did it," Francis says. "It's done. It's very complicated, no doubt, but the obstructions to vaccine development -- assuming this is a vaccine that will have some success -- are not science."
Francis is announcing his leitmotif: the subversion of public health by politics. But others aren't as quick to gloss over the scientific challenges. H.I.V. has seven subtypes, mutates quickly, floats free in the blood but also infects immune system cells -- on and on. Quibbling with some of these, admitting others, Francis is nevertheless unfazed. "This is science. This is what you do! You develop the protein. You put it in rabbits. If they don't keel over, you try it in chimps. If it works there, you try it in humans." Berman and Gregory nod approvingly.
Genentech's version of gp120 was first injected into a human in March 1992. "Because of the way these vaccines are made, we didn't expect any problems in Phase I," Francis says. "And we didn't get any, except for a few sore arms here and there." The phased-trial process Francis is referring to was developed as a way to standardize the testing of treatment drugs like decongestants: Phase I to see if they're safe; Phase II to see if they might work; Phase III to see how well. In vaccine development, the phases overlap and safety is always the paramount concern. With H.I.V. especially, there were some serious unknowns. Could gp120 speed up the process of deterioration in those people whom it failed to protect? Could it cause nerve damage at the site of injection? "Happily," Francis says, "Phase I showed that gp120 appears to be as safe as any vaccine on the market. Also, we began to see very strong immunogenicity: almost 100 percent of volunteers produced antibodies to H.I.V. And, even better, the antibodies neutralized lab isolates" -- which means that when mixed in a test tube with H.I.V. that had been cultured in labs, the antibodies rendered the H.I.V. harmless.
For any product, promotion from one trial phase to the next is a major milestone; manufacturers proudly note the event in annual reports. But it's not entirely a scientific decision. The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or Niaid, which was financing the trials of gp120, could essentially terminate further testing by withholding funds. But Niaid's decision to promote gp120 to Phase II was enthusiastic. Of the 14 experimental vaccines tested since 1988 at Niaid's six AIDS vaccine evaluation units around the country, the two gp120 candidates were by far the most promising.
Soon after Phase II began, however, in December 1992, gp120 hit a snag. Volunteers continued to produce strong H.I.V. antibodies and those antibodies continued to knock out lab-cultured virus. But when put in a test tube with "field isolates" -- H.I.V. nearly fresh from the arms of infected people -- it looked as if the antibodies did nothing at all. Scientists still debate the implications: was the test inadequate or were the antibodies? Many think it may not matter. Few vaccines have ever been shown to work this way in a test tube; to public health scientists, the proof of a vaccine is in the testing. "I don't know how smallpox vaccine works," Francis says, "I just know it does." As if to vindicate him, gp120, in a new set of experiments performed by Genentech and Chiron Biocine, protected five chimps from "whopping doses" of H.I.V. (A year later, the animals remain healthy.) At least in chimps, under specific conditions, gp120 worked.
Would it now become the first AIDS vaccine to reach Phase III? On April 22, 1994, after a day and a half of presentations and arguments, a panel convened by Niaid made its recommendation. Some members favored a definitive trial with 10,000 volunteers; others a smaller version that would be easier to mount but less conclusive. Still others felt they'd been pushed into making a rash decision between doing nothing and doing too much. In the end, despite being unsure whether gp120 would work, they agreed overwhelmingly that expansion of the trials was the only way to find out. This being a bureaucracy, however, theirs was not the final word. Another panel, the AIDS Research Advisory Committee, scheduled to convene that June 17, would offer an official recommendation to Anthony Fauci, Niaid's director, who would then make the binding decision. But with this much going for gp120, and nothing going for anything else, it seemed that, nine years after Francis's paper, the United States was about to find out if it was on the path to a vaccine for AIDS.
 
Panic Time
Three weeks before the advisory committee meeting, on Sunday, May 29, 1994, The Chicago Tribune ran a front-page story by a staff writer, John Crewdson, under the headline "New Doubts on AIDS Vaccine; 5 Study Volunteers Infected; U.S. Debates Future of Trials." The article accurately reported that volunteers had become H.I.V.-positive during the first two phases of testing. But by the time the news wires and television networks picked up the story, Crewdson's narrow language had been hopelessly garbled. Even people who should have known better ended up drawing the wrong conclusion: a fund-raiser for a major AIDS organization told friends that gp120 had "made people sick" because it was "made of live H.I.V." In fact, gp120 contains no live H.I.V. and cannot cause infection -- a point Niaid tried to make. But by Monday, the vaccines, to the extent the public knew of them at all, were thought of as killers.
Few AIDS activists had been paying attention to the vaccine trials. These were people, mostly gay men, who had in many cases been fighting since the mid-1980's on behalf of their dying friends. But many were amazingly up to date on treatment advances, like protease inhibitors and combination therapies; to them, vaccines were irrelevant or worse. Every dollar spent on the "innocent," uninfected masses, they believed, would be a dollar less spent on treatments for the sick. The world had changed since then -- for one thing, the activists had finally fought their way into the system. But the habit of outsiderness dies hard: though no longer hostile to vaccines, they were ignorant of them. Soon the infected volunteers were transformed into martyrs and out came the boilerplate analogies: the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, performed on black sharecroppers; the Willowbrook hepatitis experiments, performed on institutionalized children.
These comparisons were far from apt, but they did express deep-seated fears -- fears not ameliorated by the Government's silence. Niaid, appropriately, had kept details of the infections confidential, for the sake of the volunteers themselves. But the silence reflected a deeper problem: the suspicion among many scientists that laymen cannot properly handle inside information. Indeed, a kind of paranoid mutism has become epidemic. Researchers who fear they may lose their grants if they say something critical, or who have manuscripts pending at prestigious journals, have learned that it's often safer to shut up than to share their knowledge. As a result, at vaccine meetings or in interviews with Government scientists, half the things said -- sometimes momentous things -- are said off the record. But can public science be off the record? And if it can, is it so surprising that the affected communities cannot process difficult news when it arises?
In fact, according to Niaid, the volunteers had all contracted H.I.V. as a result of "high-risk behaviors" -- that is, through unsafe sex or injection-drug use. The infections had long since been reported at conferences and scientists were hardly surprised. Indeed, there were more than five. Of the more than 1,600 volunteers who have participated in trials of gp120 and the other vaccine candidates through Niaid's evaluation units, 19 have now become infected, though only 4 are known to have done so after a full course of inoculations. If that small number proves anything, it's that the vaccines are less than 100 percent effective -- but no one expected them to be 100 percent effective anyway. Some said 60 percent, some said 30 percent, but these were just hunches. Until a vaccine enters Phase III, there's no way to know.
Designers of the vaccine trials are thus confronted with a paradox unique to AIDS: if safe-sex and safe-needle practices are not taught, volunteers who believe they are protected by the unproven vaccine (which may actually be a placebo) could take more risks and increase their chances of becoming infected. If such practices are taught -- and by modern ethical standards, they must be -- volunteers could cut their risk so effectively that they are never exposed to H.I.V., leaving the vaccine with nothing to fight. In a way, the trial depends on the failure of education: without what scientists unfortunately call "breakthrough" infections, there cannot be breakthroughs of the more desirable variety. To get around this potential conflict of interest, Phase III trials of an AIDS vaccine will have to rely on populations in which the number of infections remains high regardless of education, like young, high-risk gay men and injection-drug users -- precisely the groups most scared by the news.
For the people running the vaccine evaluation units, it was a nightmare. New recruits dried up; long-term volunteers needed calming; reporters were buzzing everywhere. Months later, Barney Graham, one of the two principal investigators at the Vanderbilt University unit, was still showing the strain of what he calls public science. Tall, dour and so soft-spoken it's hard to hear him, Graham has decorated his tiny office with a "No Whining" coffee mug and a 100-pack sample of antacids. "Scientists are supposed to be threadbare and genteel, not TV stars," he says. "And AIDS wears you out. Everything is done by faxes, Fed Ex and conference calls. And then the fact that people got infected is a personal tragedy, very upsetting to the investigators. The story of their infections is just like the story of the 40,000 other infections in the U.S. this year. It's the story of how hard it is to legislate behavior change -- even more difficult on an individual basis. Why did they engage in risky behavior? Why does anyone? Paul even refers to it. . . ."
Graham retrieves a slim, Wedgwood blue volume from between the massive immunology texts on his bookshelf and underlines with his finger some words from Chapter 7 of Romans:
Was then that which is good made death unto me? . . . For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind. . . . O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
"Vaccines don't even begin to touch the basic human problems," Graham says.
Though he favors expansion of the gp120 trials, Graham is addressing the same paradox that troubles the activists, whose real concern, beneath the hysteria, is that the current vaccines may cause more infections through false security than they would prevent through immunity. But one group with few doubts about the trials was the group of infected volunteers. Most agreed, despite their bad news, to give what a researcher called "buckets of blood" for further testing; one, a gay man known as BIS303, even flew to Washington for a lymph node biopsy that scientists thought might be revealing. Altruism like that of BIS303 -- slides of whose lymph node are still studied in labs and screened at conferences -- was the kind of community reaction Don Francis imagined when he thought of how a trial would work. As a result, he had no idea what he was up against when the fateful advisory committee meeting began.
 
In the Crystal Ballroom
It used to be that AIDS policy was made on the streets and in closed Government meetings -- or from the conflict between them. Now it gets forged, more often than not, in overcooled, chandeliered hotel conference centers like the so-called "N.I.H." Hyatt near National Institutes of Health headquarters in Bethesda, Md. The scene is always the same: hyperfloral carpets, gleaming urns marked caf and decaf, presenters worrying over their carousels of slides while eyeing the name tags of other participants. What has changed is who those participants are. Here in the Hyatt's Crystal Ballroom, panelists sit around the perimeter of four tables arranged in a large square with nothing in the middle. Pitchers of water sweat at each of the 40 or so places. Surrounding the official participants are supporters and contestants from the various camps. If you regard Anthony Fauci, Niaid's director, as north -- and who doesn't? -- then Government scientists are generally to the east; community activists are huddled to the south; Genentech and Chiron Biocine representatives, including a grimacing Don Francis, are stacked to the west. The media -- an extraordinary 55 reporters and 15 camera crews, hoping for scandal -- are kept to the back.
Try as they might to work together, the groups speak different languages. The scientists "present" their information while the community representatives "share" theirs. The basic researchers require "proof of concept" while the manufacturers speak of "empirical results." But the language conflict is trivial compared to the conflict of culture. Depending on who you talk to, the basic researchers, usually affiliated with academic institutions, are ivory-tower do-nothings, jealous of their paltry grants and remote from the world of suffering; the manufacturers' scientists are sell-outs and cowboys, grubbing after profit; Niaid staffers are cowardly paper-pushers who'd rather do nothing than fail; the community representatives represent no one but themselves, which they do at tiresome length. And everyone hates the press.
Still, it is no longer seemly to make decisions unilaterally. Fauci, in his opening remarks, explains that the advisory committee's job is not so much to evaluate the science -- the April panel has already done that -- as to evaluate the context in which the science may be tested. Will it be possible to get enough testing sites operational in time for a trial? Will gay men and injection-drug users volunteer in adequate numbers? If not, Fauci warns, the whole effort -- which would require the enthusiastic participation of all parties concerned -- may collapse, and with it any hope of mobilizing researchers and activists for a future trial. On the other hand, Fauci continues, "if a recommendation is made not to expand, there may be a chilling effect on our industrial partners, although this is, in and of itself, not an acceptable rationale for proceeding." Going back and forth, he makes it hard to imagine any satisfactory solution. In closing, he says merely, "Thank you and good luck to all of us."
Neat and small and tight as a mouse, Fauci does not utter another word until lunch, but watching the proceedings you can't help but feel he's somehow controlling them anyway. Or that nobody is. On the sidelines, Don Francis senses the "random, whipsaw motion" of the meeting and is reminded, unpleasantly, of the blood bank fights 10 years earlier, during which he used to imagine the thousands of people who would die from nothing more than inertia. In this strange, relativistic stupor, no one seems to pay much attention to the startlingly direct statement made by Ashley Haase, the meeting's chairman, that the vaccines "will probably work to some extent." He might just as well have said they will not.
Still, there is one subject that can always be relied on to get people's attention: money. It has been made clear to the academic researchers, many of whom depend on Niaid grants, that the funds for vaccine trials will have to come from somewhere. (Probably from treatment research, as it turns out.) A full-scale trial would cost between $9 million and $18 million per year for three and a half years; the smaller version suggested in April would cost about half that much per year, for two years only. What nobody says is that either version is a drop in the bucket. Niaid's H.I.V. research budget for fiscal year 1995 totals $558 million. And with AIDS care costing the country something like $13 million per day, according to Vanderbilt's Barney Graham, even the longer, more expensive trial would be cheaper than five days of treatment.
Slides are shown, feeble jokes are uttered and ignorant questions from panelists who should know better are answered politely. Hurriedly -- he's only been given 15 minutes -- Francis presents the latest chimp data, which, though promising, gets no response. It isn't until the half-hour set aside for "public comments" that things take a dramatic turn. One by one, community activists stand before the microphone and, with anguish in their voices, lash out at gp120. David Scondras, a former Boston city councilman, offers the baleful warning that people won't want to volunteer for a test of a vaccine that is already considered ineffective, especially since this would prohibit them from enrolling in tests of better products later. A letter read by Luis Santiago of Act Up/New York states that going ahead with the trials would be "extremely unethical" because the products "are very unlikely to work at all." Only Bill Snow of Act Up/Golden Gate takes a middle view, saying politely, "I don't envy you this decision" -- surprising words from an activist. But then, the activists are the most conservative voices in the room.
"Part of the negativism you hear is healthy scientific debate and part of it is just people's willingness to say anything," remarks Derek Hodel, who as a member of the April panel endorsed continued testing but was, and remains, ambivalent. "It's a good example of a lot of people who know very little about vaccine development carrying on at some length about what should happen -- both scientists and community representatives. But I don't want to blame the representatives, because if somebody puts you on a podium and sticks a microphone in your face and asks what you think, it's hard to say 'I don't know,' especially when the people asking appear to know even less than you do. To scientists, one community activist is as good as another; it's the worst kind of tokenism. But you have to realize that the dynamics of prevention and treatment are completely different."
Hodel's own background is in treatment: for four years he headed a group that helped get unapproved therapeutic drugs into the country; he is now director of Federal affairs for Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. But Hodel has researched vaccines like a medical student and is quick to admit when he's beyond his expertise. "I'm not scientifically qualified to make the judgment whether gp120 will work," he says. "But I can make the judgment whether it's worth the risk to find out. And to me, it's ironic that the same community" -- he puts the word in finger-quotes -- "that supposedly won't accept the risk of a vaccine trial doesn't blink at accepting a huge amount of risk for treatment: huge, horrible unknowns. The drugs that people are willing to try if they're sick! But people don't experience risk as real until it touches them. Most of the public has no fear of AIDS. Those of us who do, only do because we're surrounded by it" -- five of Hodel's eight closest friends are sick. "Even then, it's hard to appreciate a statistical risk. When everyone knows someone who's sick, that will help. But that's a grim scenario."
Hodel is intense, compact and, in a suit, not so different looking from Fauci -- except for the two earrings in his left ear. He represents a new phenomenon: the activist as deep insider. Everyone is elaborately careful to show that they've heard him, and it isn't just pretense: he's the person most universally respected among the leaders of the various camps. Perhaps that's because Hodel doesn't get as ruffled by the day-to-day bumps in the road of science as most community representatives do. He admits that the activists' presence at meetings like this slows down progress. "Still, you couldn't do a clinical trial without them -- and that would be very slow indeed. You can't just line people up and inject them. It has to be a partnership. If it's time-consuming to get to the point where the subjects understand what they're engaged in, so be it."
Late in the day, an intense, if hushed, discussion begins. Considering what's at stake, some displays of antagonism -- or at least real debate -- might prove useful, but the mood in the room is sullenly respectful. Everyone is allowed a piece of the decision, and let the chips fall where they may. Everyone except the manufacturers. During the discussion, Don Francis keeps raising his hand to no avail, like the kid in class who knows too much; at one point he even hands up a note that reads: I want to be called on. But he's out of order, which is just as well. Some of the panelists are muttering curses about his self-righteous badgering. Shades of St. Francis? Don Quixote?
"Remember, this is not the Virgin Mary proposing a vaccine," I'm told later by Martin Delaney, a panelist who is also the founding director of Project Inform, a San Francisco AIDS organization. "To some degree, this is about a couple of companies who want to be the first to get their product to market. Don doesn't want to see himself as someone representing a drug company, but in fact he is. He's used to being seen as a public health official, on a mission by God, and that has to be tempered. This should be about issues, not personalities."
Delaney says that Project Inform has always made vaccines a priority and that he would volunteer for a trial himself, even if the risk were high, as long as the potential rewards were too. But a 30 percent effective vaccine "doesn't make sense" when the money could be spent more directly on education and other preventions. "If your concern is purely public health, you have to ask: What are we going to get out of a vaccine trial of a product that's a complete shot in the dark, based on the most primitive understandings of the disease? And if you blow your one chance on the wrong product, where does that leave you? Then come the other issues. Like, does risky behavior increase because people think they're protected? And the answer to that has to be yes."
Data from the testing sites suggest that, if anything, risky behavior among volunteers decreases, but Delaney and many others discount it. "You can survey and ask people all you want, but you're not going to get a straight answer," Delaney says. "As a gay man, I know this personally. In any case, add these all together and you get your answer."
"But," I ask, "are you comfortable making such a big decision when you're not a scientist?"
"I don't feel that science is magic," Delaney answers. "It's knowledge. It's quantifiable and transferable. You do worry about any decision to not go ahead, but the outcomes in AIDS research have been so disappointing that" -- he chuckles ruefully -- "no, it doesn't give me any huge pause."
And that's how the meeting plays out. Apparently stunned by the passion of the community representatives, the members one by one vote no or abstain -- even, amazingly, four who in April had endorsed expansion. Almost at once, Fauci announces that, since the recommendation is so strong, he will follow it. And though the Niaid news release will later say that the panel voted for "continuing but not expanding at this time," that's pure euphemism. Don Francis looks as if he could strangle someone, but there's no one left to strangle. Within three minutes of the decision, scientists are upstairs with drinks in their hands, activists are on the subway and someone has turned off the chandeliers in the Crystal Ballroom.
 
Safer Science
As it turns out, Fauci had already decided what he was going to do. "I was convinced before the meeting even started that the science did not justify expansion," he says. We are sitting, two months after the advisory committee meeting, in Fauci's office at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. "I had spent a lot more time than them looking at the data. It was comforting to me that a large and diverse group of my peers came up with the same conclusion. But I still would have made the same decision. Let me be perfectly honest, which I always am: it would have been more difficult to say no to an expanded trial if the community said, 'We're ready if you want to do it.' Because I know how quickly community views can change. But I would have done it anyway."
Fauci's curriculum vitae says he's 54, but his nervous energy, his runner's trim, his Rotarian attire and aviator glasses suggest a graduate student, circa 1966. To all appearances, he's pure science in a suit -- not unlikable, really, but not really there to like. He talks fast, like a good Brooklyn native, and whatever he's saying, you have the sense he's still got plenty of brain capacity left over for other things. In the middle of a sentence, he stands abruptly, goes to the door and barks at his secretary for a diet Coke; he then sits down and resumes, quite calmly, the interrupted sentence.
Whether because of his manner or his power, Fauci stirs up a great deal of anger. Anne-Marie Duliege, associate director of clinical research at Chiron Biocine, which has been testing its gp120 product in tandem with Genentech's, expresses openly what others say only in private: "The Niaid decision was a purely political, manipulated decision." The advisory committee meeting was stacked, she says, with people who knew little or "nothing at all" about vaccines. And the presentation of scientific data was, she feels, unfairly curtailed. "Besides, isn't it curious how the news of the seroconversions" -- the volunteers who became infected -- "got released to the Tribune reporter between the two meetings?"
Several scientists who were advisory committee members or otherwise close to the proceedings (but would not allow their names to be used) agree with Duliege. "I think it was manipulated," one says. "If they had simply reworded the question, they could have gotten a different answer. The sentiment of the group was to go with a halfway measure, not to stop altogether." Another says: "It was the most unintellectual discussion about a scientific issue that I have ever had the unhappiness to witness." Yet another goes further: "What's more surprising than the decision itself were the events that occurred immediately prior, which were used as an indirect lobbying effort. I mean the leak of the seroconversions. No one thought it was a coincidence."
Fauci says: "That's totally untrue. And if anyone felt pressured, it was coming from within them, and they should question their own integrity about voting against their belief."
You need not resort to Machiavellian scenarios to understand Fauci's decision. He makes a reasonable case, almost in one breath. "Now I am a big advocate, as you probably know, of early availability of drugs for people who are infected," he says. "But with a preventive vaccine, you're talking about an otherwise normal person who does not have H.I.V. infection and you're saying you want to inject that person with a product that, as a scientist, you can't in good conscience say there is even a more than reasonable chance of it being effective. And there is the possibility that there could be a deleterious effect."
"None has turned up," I say.
"Yes, but it's a very important theoretical possibility. Which could be overridden by the confidence you might have in a more effective vaccine. But when you start out with 30 percent at best -- which is only a hunch -- then the possibility of doing harm assumes a greater relative weight in the decision-making process. When the science is uncertain, you start weighing other issues, like whether volunteers really understand the risk. A film was made showing how little some of the people know about vaccines and it was scary. They had no understanding that they might not be protected completely. If you put all of these things together -- understanding that people in good faith have different opinions -- you decide you need to wait until you have a product you have a little more confidence in."
It's hard to argue with such a careful weighing of subtleties. But some of Fauci's premises are shakier than others. Although some activists go so far as to predict that their constituents will boycott a gp120 trial, the constituents in fact appear willing to cooperate. George Woody, who has recruited injection-drug users for a feasibility study in Philadelphia, reports that 90 percent of them return for follow-up interviews and blood tests with only token financial incentives. Cladd Stevens of the New York Blood Center, who endorses a Phase III trial, says she's sure gay men can be recruited, too, though not without a vaccine to test. "Building the tracks doesn't make the train come," she says. "But if a train's coming, the tracks will get laid."
Sten Vermund, formerly of Niaid, agrees: in April, he endorsed expansion of the trials and has written an op-ed article urging a reconsideration of the June decision. "If we have a partially effective vaccine and do not know it because we are not testing it," he says, "that would be a public health tragedy." Still, Vermund, now chairman of epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, appreciates his friend Fauci's predicament: balancing the scientific imperative with the social realities. Duliege, as might be expected, does not. "You can say that the various considerations put him in an impossible position, but I have no sympathy for the position he was in. You need some courage to work in this field -- and you need some leadership. Fauci was responding to fear that the trial might fail, but from a scientific point of view, no trial fails."
And that may be the heart of the problem. From a scientific point of view, no trial fails. But from a political point of view? In a perfect world, there would be no difference, but in this world, where a Surgeon General can lose her stripes for daring to discuss masturbation, Fauci may be right to fear. Is it worth taking a fall for a vaccine that might not do much, that the activists hate, that virtually no one but Don Francis speaks up for? Unvaccinated against political fallout, Fauci may feel he has little choice but to practice "safer science." Which in this case may mean no science at all.
But Fauci, to his credit, won't take that way out. "I have always gotten support right up the line, from the director of the N.I.H. to Donna Shalala. The fact is, it's a tough situation, but I have always -- and will always -- base my decisions on what I think is scientifically best. As for the rest, it's just part of the turf. And once I make that decision, I don't sit around and worry about it."
Fauci has weathered such storms before; virtually hung in effigy one day by activists, the next day he answers their medical questions. Does he regret having brought them to the table? "There are times, more than you would think, when they have a keen insight into a scientific problem," he says. "But sometimes you are almost blinded by them, and they are almost blinded themselves."
Still, Fauci considers himself an activist. "AIDS is my life. I have many, many patients we've taken care of here; my social circle has evolved into an AIDS social circle; my wife is an AIDS nurse. It's all around me. We're in the middle of an era of incredibly sophisticated science and there's this goddamn virus that has rapidly evolved to stay always a step ahead of us. You feel that you're very smart and have a lot of smart people around you -- and it's sticking its tongue out at you and saying: 'I don't care how smart you are. You don't have me yet.' "
 
How Much Love?
"AIDS is eminently -- and imminently -- beatable," Don Francis says. Back in California, completely unrepentant, he's still beating the gp120 drum. "If we sat around with smallpox and said, 'I don't know, it's going to be awfully hard,' it would still be raging today. So you just do it. What's failure? The worst you're going to do is waste some needles and syringes and some people's time. That's a small cost, given that we speak of this as an experiment answering a question. Here's my baseball metaphor: The ball is in the air, but in the Candlestick fog we can't see the trajectory. Will it be a home run? A pop foul? Something in between? I hope we will be allowed to find out."
For Genentech and Chiron Biocine, that will have to be a business decision. It's not just about the vaccines' merits; it's about priorities. Continuing to fund gp120 may mean not funding a breast cancer product. Fauci's decision has indeed had the chilling effect he predicted -- others call it "devastating" -- on the very few companies around the world that had bothered with an AIDS vaccine in the first place. Genentech is officially "re-evaluating" the situation, but seems close to dropping the project. Chiron Biocine and another company, Therion Biologics, have cut their efforts in half. "If you're the C.E.O. of a company that has fiduciary responsibilities," Francis says, "yes, you'd love to make an AIDS vaccine. But how much love can you afford?"
If you're Genentech or Chiron Biocine, Martin Delaney believes, you can afford a lot. "Despite their whining," he says, "these are not poor companies without means." (Genentech's 1994 revenue was nearly $800 million.) "I don't understand what's keeping them, if they feel that strongly, from going ahead with trials. Would we ask Merck or Abbott" -- major manufacturers of treatment drugs -- "to wait for the Government to pay for their trials? I don't think so."
Delaney is glossing over the economic difference between preventions and cures. Ours is a society that is loath to wear seat belts, quit smoking, ban handguns or teach teen-agers about condoms; we are strangely unwilling to sacrifice convenience, let alone money, for sensible preventions. "You don't have people taking to the streets and demanding improved fluoridation of the water supply," Vermund says.
The familiarity of vaccines -- they just seem to be there, as if by magic -- makes the situation worse. Extremely expensive to develop and test, and riddled with liability risks, vaccines are not nearly as profitable as people might think. In any given year, the combined revenues of the 20 or so vaccines currently available are dwarfed by the revenues of a single good ulcer drug. Add to this the ethical uncertainties of a global epidemic -- how much can you charge in Africa? -- and it's no wonder that the manufacturers, and Fauci too, insist that the development of an AIDS prevention vaccine will depend on a close, financial collaboration between industry and Government. Which means collaborating with democracy.
Did democracy derail gp120? When Franklin D. Roosevelt marshaled the country to defeat polio (which he, of course, suffered from), he did it without permission from anyone. But the age of individual arrogance -- and with it, perhaps, individual genius -- has been superseded by the age of consensus. Instead of Roosevelt we have panels: panels that are destined to disagree and cause more panels. Which isn't to say the process can't work. Even as Fauci announced his decision, the Food and Drug Administration was permitting Phase III trials of an experimental Lyme disease vaccine to go forward -- based on the same kind of ambiguous evidence that sank gp120. And in January, the F.D.A. permitted Phase III trials of Jonas Salk's AIDS treatment vaccine despite what it considered shaky data.
But Salk's vaccine is beyond the mayhem of democracy. A treatment, not a prevention, it could prove so profitable -- in the event it works -- that its manufacturer, Immune Response Corporation, has been willing to foot the bills to test it. And Lyme disease, typically transmitted by tick bites into the bloodstreams of wealthy suburbanites, excites no controversy. Because AIDS is so much more deadly than Lyme disease -- and because preventions are so much more difficult to finance than cures -- the trial of a vaccine like gp120 becomes almost impossibly political: everyone has expertise and everyone has a point. Activists are right to question a vaccine that may be 30 percent effective, because sex isn't calculus and people aren't wise. But public health scientists are right, too: such a vaccine might save thousands of lives, and a nurse who sticks her finger with a needle will be glad to have any chance -- even 30 percent -- of being protected.
The question, finally, is not who's right but what's most important, and science as practiced in the United States today is not designed to answer that. Still, despite all the maddening and interlocking paradoxes, what the panels have devised is amazing in its way -- a blueprint for a truly ethical AIDS vaccine trial. Only one thing's missing: a means of ever agreeing on how to start.
 
The Resurrection
But gp120 wasn't dead yet. At a vaccine conference last November in Reston, Va., one or two decorous fights broke out beneath the chandeliers of the Hyatt Regency ballroom. At the end of a panel on AIDS in Africa, Kenrad Nelson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, rose furiously and shouted: "To put up any roadblocks in the face of this kind of data borders on the unethical. This is a plague, and there won't be another vaccine to test for two years, minimum. We should be testing the vaccine we have, if only to calm people down and prime the pump, as AZT did in 1986. You can argue all you want, but if we don't do something, it's a crime."
A few heads turned. Scientists working on different AIDS vaccine approaches -- from "naked DNA" to futuristic "gene guns" -- pricked up their ears: how will anything come out of the pipeline, they began to wonder, if the pipeline is capped? Also spooked were those who'd actually had a look at the products supposed to be furthest along. "Certainly not better than gp120," said one scientist who had seen the data. Another told me that, if I wanted to study the early results, I could find them in his trash can.
But vaccines have an eerie way of rising from trash cans. Since many scientists assume that gp120 will eventually be part of the cocktail of an effective AIDS vaccine, the all-or-nothing mentality that halted testing may prove to have been shortsighted. "People point to hepatitis B as a model -- it's not," says William L. Heyward, an epidemiologist at the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS. "That was a grand-slam home run in the bottom of the ninth. The better model would be hemophilus influenza type B, recently licensed after a 17-year development period from 1973 to 1990. There were nine efficacy trials with at least five different vaccines, involving over 330,000 children. As a result, we now have three licensed, highly effective vaccines and incidence of the disease has been eliminated as a public health problem.
"I was on-site manager for a big N.I.H. contract in the process. Our expectations were very high and the first versions of the product didn't meet them. But they weren't 'failed' trials. They were part of the process. It's going to be an evolution for the perfect H.I.V. vaccine as well. Maybe 40 to 50 years. In the meantime," he concludes tartly, "we've had to work very hard to explain this decision to the rest of the world."
The rest of the world "thought we were crazy," as Derek Hodel puts it. At least four countries sought permission from W.H.O. to host gp120 trials. Indeed, at the conference, Natth Bhamarapravati, a pathologist from Thailand -- where AIDS, he predicts, will soon kill 100,000 people a year -- pleaded eloquently for the development of a vaccine Marshall Plan, in which American money and expertise would be deployed to help such countries as his start testing something. He will have a hard time convincing American activists, though. Martin Delaney even wonders if the Thais were "misled" into wanting to host the trials. Heyward understands the source of such disagreements. "I was director of Projet SIDA in Zaire, where 250 people a day were dying. And I watched their families carry the bodies away, day after day, wailing. In the U.S. we live in a bubble. In a lab you may not see the cost of doing nothing. Like they say: You stand near where you sit."
And so, after W.H.O. decided that vaccine trials "can go forward" and that "even results showing low efficacy would be important," Genentech began making plans with the Thai Government to conduct them. For those who had championed gp120, this was at best a bittersweet victory. In order to prepare enough Thai volunteers and to ensure that the vaccine will work in them the same way it did in Americans, most of Phase I and Phase II must be repeated -- thus delaying results by several years. But at least they're starting. On Feb. 6, 45 cartons containing 270 vials of gp120 finally left Genentech's cold room, destined by plane for Bangkok. They arrived at the vaccine testing center at Mahidol University on the 10th. The first 14 volunteers, who are recovering drug users, were injected on the 21st. Are they safer from AIDS than they would have been without gp120? In a few years -- a few years longer than necessary -- we'll know.
 
And the Band Plays On
"I know there are limits to our ability as humans to accomplish important things," says Don Francis. A sign pinned to the wall by his desk reads "Joyful participation in the sorrows of the world." But he doesn't look so much joyful as resigned. "It drives me crazy. I'm weary. I yearn for logic and a way to make good on all of this wasted time. But that's life. Well, that's the intellectual answer. On the other hand. . . . "
He swivels toward his computer. "On the other hand, right now, behind me will be things like this obituary. Or a piece of the AIDS quilt in the hall. Sometimes I can look at it and sometimes I can't. I've been through incredible epidemics, but I've never had one engulf me. Usually we come in at the downside of the curve. We have tools. We do something. We beat smallpox out of existence and move on. Here, your friends die right and left, colleagues you love! San Francisco is losing 4 percent of its population! My Rolodex, I don't take people's names out of it. I'm scared to. The frustration! I want to scream sometimes: I've seen this meeting before and 10,000 more people have died! But it doesn't help."
Has St. Francis finally been neutralized? In a frank and critical "Dear Don" letter dated March 1, Martin Delaney seemed to hope so, objecting not only to the "bad science" of gp120 but to Francis's passion as its advocate. "It pricks my memory back to the mid 1980's," he wrote. "When things didn't go exactly the way you wanted them, you began to see the players as either angels or demons, rather than people who saw things in legitimately different ways from their different vantage points. Seeing you begin to repeat this behavior over the vaccine vote, I can only urge you to look inward and soften your rhetoric. This time around, I think there is little likelihood that your version of events will carry the day."
But Francis isn't chastened. He points to another sign near his desk: "A scientist who is also a human being cannot rest while knowledge which might be used to reduce suffering rests on the shelf." The quotation is from Albert Sabin, who developed the oral polio vaccine. "I guess I keep doing it because I'm an optimist," he says. "I think it'll break. Nothing can take your eyes off that goal; if I possibly thought that I might fail, someone might stop me. It's like a bulldozer: your top speed might not be very fast but you keep on moving. And then you come to a slope and you'll move like crazy. That's the history of all of our progress."
But why do people resist that progress?
"Did I tell you about the frog?" Francis asks. "I hope it's true. If you take a pot of boiling water and dump a frog into it, he'll do all in his power to get out. But if you put it in a pot of cold water and put the pot on the stove and slowly bring up the heat" -- Francis looks over the top of his half-glasses -- "the frog will just sit there. And boil himself."

HEADLINE: Labor Board to Seek Injunction Against Baseball Club Owners

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
One week before the scheduled start of the baseball season, the National Labor Relations Board yesterday authorized its general counsel to seek an injunction in Federal court that could send striking players back to work as early as this week.
Daniel Silverman, director of the board's New York office, said he would initiate the effort for an injunction in United States District Court in Manhattan today and would ask the judge, once one is assigned, to handle the case expeditiously. 
 The injunction would force club owners to restore certain elements of the expired collective bargaining agreement, including salary arbitration and competitive bidding for free agents. The players have said they would end their seven-and-a-half-month strike and return to work if such an injunction is obtained.
What is not clear, however, is whether the owners would then vote to lock out the players rather than allow them back under the old work rules. Twenty-one of the 28 owners would have to vote to approve a lockout for it to take effect, and it is possible that those supporting a lockout would not be able to muster the votes needed.
Thus, the latest development at least raised the notion that major league replacement baseball -- which is scheduled to begin Sunday night when the Mets play the Florida Marlins in Miami -- might not get off the ground.
And in a related development, the two sides in the dispute agreed to resume negotiations tonight in Manhattan, meeting for the first time since March 4.
The vote to seek the injunction was 3-2, with the three Democrats on the board voting in favor and the two Republicans against. The board's action created a scenario under which the season could conceivably begin on a delayed basis with the regular players on the field. But the scenario includes a series of "ifs."
If the judge who gets the case today grants the preliminary injunction before the start of the season, and if the players offer to return to work and are not locked out, the two sides could agree to postpone opening day for about three weeks to give the players time for spring training.
In that way, clubs would not have to use the so-called replacement, or strikebreaking, players they have worked furiously, but not always successfully, to meld into temporary teams.
However, the labor board's decision to seek an injunction doesn't guarantee that its effort will be successful. And even if it is, there is no way of knowing if a judge would rule quickly enough to salvage the start of the season for the striking players.
If, for instance, the injunction came a few days into the replacement season, and the regular players were allowed to return, baseball would have to address the issue of what to do with the replacement games already played.
In addition, more than 800 players are currently unsigned and an additional 100 to 200 are free agents not affiliated with any team. And that only adds to the uncertainty of the situation.
Still, the union was clearly happy with yesterday's action, and the owners weren't.
"I'm pleased with the result," said Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel. "It's not only the result I was hoping for, but it's also the right result. Now I'm just hoping a judge sees it the same way."
Chuck O'Connor, the owners' chief labor lawyer, took the opposite view.
"We are disappointed that the N.L.R.B. took this action," he said by telephone from Washington. "We think it's an unwarranted intrusion into the collective bargaining process. More importantly, we do not believe it is warranted factually or legally. We expect to resist the action of the board as vigorously as possible."
The board had delayed its vote from last Thursday at the request of the mediator in the baseball dispute, Bill Usery Jr., who had hoped to get both sides to resume negotiations, which they didn't do. William B. Gould 4th, the chairman, and Margaret A. Browning and John C. Truesdale voted to approve the request for the injunction from Fred Feinstein, the board's general counsel. Charles I. Cohen and James M. Stephens voted against.
"I, along with the other two members, believe that the case is a strong one under the applicable legal standards," Mr. Gould said by telephone from Washington after the board's two-hour meeting. "That's why we voted to authorize."
Mr. Feinstein, in a statement, said the board believed the injunction "is necessary to level the playing field in order that bargaining may proceed fairly." Baseball players, he added, "are entitled to the protection of labor law" like any other employees.
In 126 previous injunction requests received by the board under Mr. Gould's chairmanship, board members did not meet but instead studied the cases and voted yes or no on a form on whether to seek an injunction. Mr. Gould's decision to meet in this instance obviously reflected the visibility the baseball strike -- the longest work stoppage in the history of professional sports -- has gained.
Last Wednesday, Mr. Usery asked Mr. Gould to give him time to try to push the two sides closer together. Last Friday, however, it became obvious to Mr. Gould that the delay was meaningless because Mr. Usery had not produced a bargaining session.
Mr. Gould, said a person familiar with his action, went to the other board members, told them he could see no evidence of negotiations and therefore felt it appropriate to move quickly.
Even if a judge doesn't grant the injunction, the players may decide to offer to return to work. They would be risking the kind of economic system they would play under -- it is not clear whose rules would take precedence -- but they would also force the owners to decide whether to lock them out. If the players are to remain out of work, they may prefer a lockout to a strike at this juncture, partly for public relations purposes and partly to keep any players from being tempted to break ranks and return to work.
The owners could ask the judge to stay the injunction, but if he declined, they would have to comply with it while appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The N.L.R.B. has a good track record in its quest for injunctions or in producing settlements of complaints when it plans to seek injunctions. According to board statistics, during fiscal 1995, which began last Oct. 1, the N.L.R.B. has won injunctions or gained settlements of cases 83 percent of the times it has set out to get injunctions. In fiscal 1994, the board was successful 81 percent of the time. In the preceding nine years, the board's success rate was 90 percent.
Mr. Usery had initially set a new round of talks for March 14 or 15 in Florida, but the owners called off the meetings when the board announced it was issuing a complaint on the union's unfair labor practice charge. That complaint led to yesterday's decision to seek the injunction.
As acknowledged by management people, some owners want to start the season with strikebreaking players as a means of inducing the striking players to go back to work without an agreement.
The owners believe the players will eventually return "in droves," one management person has said. The theory is that the players do not want to lose any more salary after having lost their pay for the last 52 days of last season. In previous work stoppages, the players always have held together while dissenting owners have undermined the owners' position and forced them to settle. This time, the owners have exhibited the players' kind of solidarity.
The owners, though, have tried different lead negotiators. They started with Richard Ravitch, who left when his contract expired Dec. 31, then switched to John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox and more recently to Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies. Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, has been involved, too. He, Mr. McMorris and Mr. Harrington were scheduled to be on hand when talks resumed this evening.
As contentious as all strikes and lockouts have been, this dispute has exceeded the others in the depth of the animosity it has created. The latest salvo was fired Saturday by Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, who the union believes is in control of the clubs' strategy.
Speaking at the White Sox camp in Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Reinsdorf drew a comparison between Donald Fehr, the baseball union leader, and Jim Jones, a cult leader who led his followers to mass suicide.
"I don't want to say something that's going to make headlines, but there is a certain similarity," Mr. Reinsdorf said. "The players are blindly following Don Fehr."
The two sides have been so entrenched in the battle over the game's economic system that even President Clinton failed to budge them when they spent an evening at the White House last month.

HEADLINE: Budget Planners Cast Nets For Surplus Special Funds

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 23

 BODY:
New Jersey's boarding house rental assistance fund has $20 million in its account but few applicants for the boarding house improvements it supports, so Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will divert half the money to her new urban housing program.
She has also grabbed $50 million from the state's unemployment insurance fund that had been destined for a health insurance program that still has not been put into place. 
 And the Governor is looking hungrily at the $125 million reserve that the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission draws on to maintain the giant, inactive landfill there. So far, the commission has managed to hold her off and hang on to most of its money, although $3 million was taken for the state's general fund and a little less than $1 million to help pay police overtime for the World Cup soccer tournament last summer.
All state governments have pots of money, large and small, stashed away in special accounts and funds, but few administrations have been as aggressive as Mrs. Whitman's budget makers in pursuit of surplus dollars to help pay for $1.4 billion in income tax cuts and balance her $16 billion budget.
"It's like looking under the sofa cushions and fishing out quarters," said Carl Golden, the Governor's spokesman.
"Our position is, if the money is not being used for a legitimate purpose, it belongs to the Treasurer," said Robert Friant, spokesman for the Department of Community Affairs, which manages many of the state's special funds.
Not surprisingly, the managers of the funds being studied by the Governor's accountants do not always react so cheerfully.
"We're very concerned about it," said Anthony Scardino Jr., executive director of the Meadowlands commission, which is trying to preserve its $125 million landfill closing fund to improve the area around the landfill, which has already been closed. "But fortunately, $4 million isn't $125 million, and we're grateful for that."
Most of the funds being studied by the administration do not receive money directly from the state budget, but are dependent on their own sources of financing. The Meadowlands fund, for example, was built up by garbage dumping charges while the landfill was open. But each year, most of the funds spend less than they take in, and it is the surplus that state accountants have their eyes on.
Although the funds are earmarked for specific purposes, the Governor has the power, either directly or through political pressure on fund managers, to divert unspent surpluses, usually to a related cause but sometimes simply to fatten the treasury. So far, only the most powerful guardians have been able to forestall the aggressive application of Treasurer Brian W. Clymer's belief that an idle dollar is a wasted dollar.
"This money belongs to the taxpayers," Mr. Clymer said in an interview. "Is it right to leave the people's money sitting around, when it could be put to use? I don't think it is."
As formal debate nears on the Governor's $16 billion budget for next year, much attention has been focused on the few tens of millions to be raised through a flurry of small fees and taxes, from a new tax on the savings from store coupons to the $5 fee for visits to the Division of Motor Vehicles.
Less noticed has been the way Mrs. Whitman's budget makers have been latching on to the unappropriated surpluses of the special funds. A few million here and a few million there will add up to about $1.5 billion by June 1996.
Sometimes administration officials have used their astuteness with a spreadsheet not to raise money, but simply to make a political point. When school districts, for example, complained last month about a plan to cut financing to districts that spend too much on nonclassroom items, the state's Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, disarmed the complainers by releasing district audits showing that several of them were maintaining large -- in some cases illegally large -- surpluses that were all but hidden from taxpayer scrutiny.
Sometimes money that the administration skims from surplus accounts is spent outright. At other times, the money is just borrowed, or "leveraged," to use one of Mrs. Whitman's favorite phrases, as a down payment on fresh borrowing.
This was the approach used by Harriet E. Derman, a tax lawyer who is now Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, when she found that the state's Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency had $200 million in unused bonding capacity and $60 million more than required in its reserve account.
Mrs. Derman developed a plan to lend the money twice, first to builders and then to their buyers, in a way that allowed the state to proclaim a $525 million home building program.
The announcement of the housing program came a few days after the Governor was roundly criticized by New Jersey editorial writers for releasing an urban revitalization program with no more than $200 million in seed money attached. Although the housing program included mostly artfully repackaged state money, the reaction was universally positive as newspapers announced a half-billion-dollar housing spending plan.
Only occasionally are the Governor's accountants turned back, perhaps growling as they go, when a fat fund is put beyond their reach. Last year, the administration tried to take $16 million in what it considered surplus money from the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, which helps with the medical expenses of seriously ill children.
"The Senate President, who created the fund, did not agree with the decision to do so," said Renee Trabert, a spokeswoman for Senator Donald T. DiFrancesco. "He said that the fund was off limits and not available to be lapsed into the general fund."

SHORT CUTS SUSPECTED ON PIPELINE
The $695 million Iroquois pipeline is the Northeast's most bountiful source of energy in decades, winding 375 miles from the Canadian border across the heart of New York through western Connecticut and into central Long Island, delivering fuel to heat 2.7 million homes.
But four years after the project was completed, Federal prosecutors, landowners and several of the very contractors who built the pipeline are questioning whether a rushed job took short cuts with safety, creating a time bomb somewhere along the pipeline. A1.
 
POLICE ARREST 296 AT A COCKFIGHT
Heavily armed police officers and agents of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals crashed into an old movie theater in the Bronx, seized 296 people and scores of caged and bloody roosters and shut down what had been billed as a national championship cockfight.
 
The raid -- the largest in the 129-year history of the A.S.P.C.A. -- followed two months of undercover investigations that tracked preparations for an event that had kicked off the 1995 cockfighting season in New York City and brought hundreds of spectators and fighting cocks from all over New York State, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Puerto Rico.

The police said 16-year-old Yong Xin Huang was shot and killed during a struggle with an officer on Friday when the officer's gun accidently discharged. But a friend of Mr. Huang said that the teen-ager did not resist and that the shooting was not accidental. The two starkly different versions emerged as the police and the family struggled to find out what really happened Friday morning in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. One thing both agreed on was that Mr. Huang was carrying a carbon dioxide-powered Grossman Air Pistol, which resembles a real weapon, outside a friend's house. B3.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Italian Monopoly Faces New World

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, March 26

 BODY:
In reaching out to the International Business Machines Corporation, Italy's state-owned telecommunications company is a bit like a sheep looking for a shepherd to fight off yapping wolves.
Societa Finanziaria Telefonica per Azioni, known in business circles as Stet, gives few details of the talks it began last month about possible cooperative ventures with I.B.M.. But the fact that there are talks is significant for a company that has long prided itself on its independence, and profited from monopoly status. 
 Independence, however, does not work very well in a global economy, and Stet's monopoly in Italy is eroding as European nations deregulate their telecommunications industries. So Stet is shopping around.
Some of the wolves snapping at its heels are just cubs -- small local companies seeking chunks of Stet's business. Others are more menacing -- European telecommunications giants that have a big technological lead over Stet and have formed strategic alliances with American companies, affording them a head start as Europeans prepare for the full deregulation of the telecommunications market by 1998.
Enter I.B.M. In the midst of a huge corporate turnaround effort, the computer giant retains big private communications networks throughout the world. It has announced its intention of entering global telecommunications, and could conceivably use a partner like Stet.
Enrico Graziani, Stet's 59-year-old general manager, says such a link would give the company a leg up against competitors like British Telecommunications P.L.C. or Deutsche Telekom by melding Stet's telecommunications skills with I.B.M.'s experience in processing electronic data, which will make up the bulk of telecommunications in the future.
Corporate analysts say such an alliance would make sense. "Stet has many irons in the fire, but in some ways not enough, such as international network links for its large corporate customers," said Sean Phelan of Yankee Group Europe, a British-based consulting operation. I.B.M., Mr. Phelan said, could offer Stet global connections, providing engineers and marketing, while Stet could provide specialized skills like transmission and switching.
As with most European state telecommunications companies, Stet has embarked on an extensive overhaul. Last year, five of its operating units, in businesses ranging from phone systems to manufacturing equipment to satellite communications, were combined into Telecom Italia S.p.A., an $18-billion-a-year group that is controlled by Stet.
The companies have thrust themselves into new businesses in Italy and abroad, starting interactive television projects, beginning one of Italy's two cellular phone systems and providing access to the Internet for business customers.
Stet, like other European phone companies, has been discussing tactical alliances with other players, including Siemens of Germany and AT&T in the United States. But all of this may do little good in the long run unless Stet can gain a strategic partner in a worldwide network for transmitting data and voice.
The outcome is crucial for Stet, which is high on the Italian Government's privatization agenda.
The forthcoming deregulation in European telecommunications is similar in scope and aims to the breakup of the Bell System in the United States in the 1980's. Unlike the American big bang, however, the European process is an evolution that will gradually eliminate state monopolies and lift national barriers until Jan. 1, 1998, when most of Europe's telecommunications market is to be opened to competition.
Already, the big players are choosing allies. Last year, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom announced plans to acquire a 20 percent stake in Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance carrier in the United States, and a little earlier, British Telecom announced a strategic alliance with MCI Communications, which is No. 2 in the United States. With such alliances aiming to create worldwide networks, Stet risked being left on the sidelines.
Analysts attribute the slowness of Stet's search for a partner to a reluctance to play second fiddle. "Stet is one of the last to enter the fray," said Bill Coleman of James Capel & Company of London. "They wanted to get in with one of the big players, but it did not suit them because they would have lacked the ability to control, to influence decisions."
According to Mr. Graziani, Stet's interest in I.B.M. is born of a conviction that the transmission of computerized data will one day dislodge voice as the dominant form of telecommunications. Thus, he said, a partner in the computer field is "an ingredient of major importance."
Analysts say I.B.M.'s greatest appeal for Stet is its plan to set up an I.B.M. Global Network to link its local communications networks in roughly 100 nations to the world's largest high-speed voice and data system.
Brian Ditzer, a spokesman at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., said the company was increasingly looking toward telecommunications partners to enhance the value of the system. Whether Stet fills the bill is presumably one of the issues being explored in the talks.
Both he and Mr. Graziani emphasized that the discussions were at the exploratory stage.
Even so, the possibility of joining forces with the world's biggest computer company is heady stuff for Stet. For years in Italy, the odds that a call would get through were only slightly higher than those of winning at roulette. Big corporate clients complained endlessly about high telephone bills and poor service. Last year, Fiat said that if its headquarters were in New York or San Francisco, not Turin, its phone bill would have been 42 percent less.
Stet's exploitation of its monopoly kept out competition. When British Telecom offered to provide Benetton with networking services well below the Italian rate, Stet blocked the British by undercutting the bid, offering rates unavailable to other customers.
Now, Stet is in the midst of a $5- billion-a-year investment program to upgrade its lines with fiber glass cable, pushing into businesses like interactive television and gaining corporate partners like Siemens to modernize its manufacturing.
As a hedge against competition, it is investing heavily abroad. Stet owns 32 percent of the company that controls Telecom Argentina and is looking to expand in Latin America. It also operates a cellular phone system in Greece, has reached agreements to upgrade Russia's telephone network and is bidding for a 27 percent stake in the Czech Republic's state phone company.
At home, with lower rates leading to more calls and new services swelling its cash flow, Stet's earnings for 1994 totaled $1.25 billion on operating revenue of $21.2 billion. The company says a comparison of last year's results with the previous year's would be misleading because of its revamping, but it points out that it cut its debt in 1994 by $2 billion, to $11.8 billion.
Stet is clearly playing for time. Mr. Graziani says the problem is that the company, like most of the world's old telephone monopolies, is now wedged between an era of competition and its monopolistic past.
Italy's carousel of governments has not helped the telecommunications giant. Legislation is needed to bring Italy into line with European Union rules, and plans for a telecommunications authority, similar to the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, are still on the drawing board.
"We need a strong authority," Mr. Graziani said, "to fix the rules of the game."

HEADLINE: USAir Pilot Pact May Cut Costs

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Breaking a yearlong deadlock with its pilots, USAir said Saturday that it had reached an agreement that could help it drastically cut costs.
USAir, the nation's sixth-largest carrier, based in Arlington, Va., did not disclose details of the agreement, nor did the pilots union, the Air Line Pilots Association. The airline's statement suggested, however, that the agreement included wage and work-rule concessions from the pilots in exchange for "financial returns and governance participation," most likely referring to stock in the company and representation on USAir's board. 
 Though the agreement is tentative and conditional on USAir reaching deals with its other labor unions, it is still significant. USAir has been among the most chronically unprofitable United States airlines, having lost more than $2.5 billion since the late 1980's. It is trying to cut $1 billion in annual operating costs, and wants half of those savings to come from agreements with its labor groups, including unions representing mechanics and flight attendants.
USAir said that discussions with those other labor groups were continuing.
The last publicized offer by pilots called for employees to contribute $500 million a year in savings in return for 20 percent of the company and seats on the board.
Kevin C. Murphy, an airline stock analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Saturday that the pilots and the company were probably motivated to end their impasse by the airline's thinning cash reserves.
USAir was among the first airlines to cut costs early in the economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Black Conservative Enters Race for G.O.P. Nomination

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, March 26

 BODY:
Alan L. Keyes, a passionately partisan black conservative who held several State Department posts in the Reagan Administration, jumped into the 1996 Presidential contest today, the first of his race to seek the Republican nomination in modern political times.
He vowed to turn the contest into a wide-open debate advocating family values and opposing abortion, an issue many other Republicans would just as soon leave on the back burner. 
 Because of his relative political obscurity, few political experts expect much from Mr. Keyes's candidacy, even if it is based primarily on the incendiary abortion issue. But Mr. Keyes, who is 44 years old and now earns a living as a Baltimore talk-show host, writer and lecturer, nevertheless plunged in with outspoken vigor this morning.
"Somebody has got to stand up and raise the banner," he said -- thundered, actually -- in announcing his candidacy during a meeting of the California Republican Assembly, the conservative wing of the state Republican Party.
"Too many of our political leaders finesse or run away from the questions of principle that will determine the kind of people we are and want to be," he continued. "We can no longer afford to follow leaders for whom the moral challenge this nation faces is an afterthought. The paradigm of all peace and security should be the peace of the unborn child in the womb."
The Assembly is hard-line conservative, as only California Republicans can be hard-line conservative, and Mr. Keyes surely picked a good forum for his announcement. No issue scores with Assembly members like abortion and Mr. Keyes, a devout Roman Catholic, more than once brought the house down with his attacks on what he called "this moral evil."
At times he even won applause from the many Assembly members who were wearing pins in support of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Patrick J. Buchanan, the columnist and commentator.
Still, Mr. Keyes, who was brought up in a military family and turned toward conservatism while studying government at Cornell and Harvard, faces major -- probably insurmountable -- hurdles with his candidacy.
Though he is on the political lecture circuit and though he served in the Reagan Administration as an ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and as an Assistant Secretary of State, he nevertheless is not widely known in the country, is almost never recognized in any national polls and has little campaign financing. Perhaps worst of all, the half dozen other Republican candidates or would-be candidates have already laid claim to most of the positions he holds dearest, though most cannot match his impassioned rhetoric in articulating them.
Add to all those hurdles the fact that Mr. Keyes is black in a party whose 20th-century history has been mainly white.
"He's good for the party and I welcome what he says," said one Assembly member, Steve Mesarch, a high school administrator from Palm Springs. "But, well, Phil Gramm also says it and I'm for him. That's the kind of thing a Keyes candidacy will constantly have to face."
William Kristol, a Republican strategist in Washington, offered an even blunter assessment of Mr. Keyes's political prospects.
"Alan's candidacy is historical and good for the debate but, no, he's not going to get the nomination," said Mr. Kristol, an adviser to Mr. Keyes in 1988 when he ran unsuccessfully in Maryland for the United States Senate. A 1992 Senate candidacy there also failed.
Whatever his 1996 prospects, Mr. Keyes declared his intention today to campaign the length of the country with his message that the cry is not only abortion but also teen-age pregnancy, homosexuality, "godless" schooling and a loss of "those values that made this country what it is."
He asserted that abortion was the "central issue" in American politics as the century draws to a close. He argued that if the nation did not outlaw it, a collapse of "the American way" was inevitable.
"The debate over abortion epitomizes how we define freedom," he said. "Abortion is a moral wrong. We have the opportunity, the duty to stand up and say, 'Nay!' "
Then, in what seemed to be his own blunt assessment of his political prospects, he concluded: "This is not a horse race. This can't be a campaign about winning government power. It has to be a campaign about winning back that power that built this country: faith, responsibility, family values. That is the victory that matters most."

HEADLINE: U.S. Vows to Press Hard On Iraq to Free Americans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The White House sought to step up pressure on Iraq today by pledging to be "very firm" with Iraq and to press diplomatic efforts to win the release of two Americans imprisoned for illegally entering the country.
Two Republican presidential candidates, Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and Patrick Buchanan, said that the United States should consider using its military to force the release of the two men. 
 "There is no justification for the sentences that were imposed on these two," Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
"We have made a very firm request that they be released immediately on humanitarian grounds."
Senator Lugar, one of the the Republican Party's leading spokesmen on foreign affairs and a moderate on foreign policy, said outside an Indiana church service today that the United States must "indicate that we are considering full diplomatic possibilities and military options."
"We ought to do so publicly, firmly and quickly," he said.
Mr. Buchanan, said he would start with diplomatic pressure and indicate that "these aren't our final options." Appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," he said he supported giving Iraq the impression that military action would be considered if the two prisoners are not released.
"These two Americans, if they've been put in jail for eight years for walking across the border, they're not being punished; they're being held as hostages," Mr. Buchanan said. "And I don't think we can tolerate hostage-taking."
Although the Republican views have no direct bearing on the Administration's policy, American diplomats said that Iraq would probably be forced to take the talk of military action seriously if someone as moderate as Mr. Lugar suggested such an option.
Mr. Panetta refused to comment on suggestions that military options be considered.
He told reporters after "Meet the Press," "I don't think either the Iraqi Government or anyone else ought to underestimate our resolve in this situation to have these two released as quickly as possible."
But in interviews today, several Administration officials said they hoped to win the release of the men -- William Barloon of New Hampton, Iowa, and David Daliberti of Jacksonville, Fla. -- through the same type of low-key, behind-the-scenes diplomacy that persuaded Iraq to release another American prisoner in 1993. These officials said they feared that if the dispute turned into a major confrontation it would be harder to win the two men's release.
The Clinton Administration said it would continue to ask the United Nations and Poland, which represents American interests in Iraq, to try to persuade President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to release the two Americans. Administration officials added, however, that they would also ask France and Russia to use their good offices on behalf of the two men.
France and Russia are urging the United Nations to lift economic sanctions imposed against Iraq as a result of its invasion of Kuwait. According to one Administration official, France and Russia would be urged to tell Mr. Hussein that he must release the two Americans soon if he is to retain any hope of having the sanctions ended.
All that can result from Mr. Hussein's "having these guys serve out this ridiculously long sentence is to hurt himself," said one Administration official. "Buy contrast, someone might convince them that they will show a brighter face to the world by releasing them soon."
But the official reiterated that the Clinton Administration would not accept any linkage between the prisoner dispute and its efforts to extend economic sanctions against Iraq.
Administration officials asserted that the two Americans entered Iraq by mistake while trying to visit friends in the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait.
The Administration is also arguing that Iraq should go easy on the prisoners because United Nations troops allowed them to cross into Iraq by mistake at one border crossing while Iraqi customs officials allowed them into Iraq by mistake at another crossing.
"These two men made an innocent mistake," Mr. Panetta said today. "They should be released."
Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon, who has lived in Kuwait for two-and-a-half years, are civilians who had been working on a contract that McDonnell Douglas has to maintain aircraft for Kuwait's Defense Ministry.
On Saturday, after Iraq sentenced them to eight years in prison, Mr. Barloon's wife, Linda, told Reuters news service in Kuwait: "I'm devastated. I just can't believe it."
She told The Associated Press that her three young children "question why their father is being held as a criminal."
Administration officials say they hope the two prisoners will be released long before they serve the full sentences, as was the case with Kenneth Beaty, an American oil exploration specialist who was sentenced to eight years in prison after illegally crossing into Iraq in January 1993.
After intense but quiet diplomacy, Mr. Beaty was released 205 days later. During his confinement, the Clinton Administration repeatedly urged American and other visitors to Iraq to press upon Mr. Hussein the importance of releasing Mr. Beaty.
Administration officials speculate that Mr. Hussein released Mr. Beaty and nine other foreigners in late 1993 to win good will as part of his effort, which was unsuccessful, to have the sanctions lifted.
"Steady low-key diplomacy worked in the Beatty case, and we hope it works here," said one American diplomat, who insisted that the Clinton Administration's opposition to lifting sanctions on Iran would not be affected by the dispute over the prisoners. The United States persuaded the Security Council to vote to extend the sanctions this month, but they are expected to come to a vote again in May.
"We're not going to be moved off our policy toward Iraq because of this situation, as horrible as it is for these two people being held there," one American official said.

HEADLINE: 7,000 G.M. Workers Threaten To Begin a Walkout This Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 26

 BODY:
About 7,000 hourly workers at the General Motors Corporation's truck engineering operations and its Pontiac East assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., could go on strike Friday.
The United Auto Workers union issued a five-day letter to G.M., which authorizes members of UAW Local 594 to strike Friday unless a variety of grievances are resolved, a company spokesman said today. 
 G.M. declined to specify what issues were to be resolved, although increased workloads for some employees and the practice of sending work outside the company to be done at lower costs have been among grievances that were expressed during previous negotiations. The union was not immediately available for comment.
G.M. and the union have been negotiating for several weeks, a company spokesman, Charles Licari, said, adding that the auto maker was optimistic that an agreement would be reached before the Friday deadline.
The North American Truck Group of G.M. is responsible for the engineering and production of the auto maker's light trucks, which include pickups and sport utility vehicles.
G.M. has settled two strikes since October, in part by agreeing to hire more workers at each plant.
Separately, G.M. disclosed late last week that it had lost $24 million on a derivative trade that was terminated last year.
The loss, disclosed in the company's 1994 annual report, which was being mailed to shareholders Friday, was on an interest-rate forward contract.
G.M. officials in New York said that no foreign currencies or banks were involved and that the loss would be amortized over 20 years, ending in 2013.
G.M. made $8 million on a derivative trade in 1993. It declined to say if it expected any derivative losses this year and it sought to minimize the 1994 loss.
An interest-rate forward contract is an agreement between a company and another party to exchange fixed and floating interest-rate payments periodically over the life of the agreement. In the transaction, also called a swap, one investor agrees to pay a floating interest rate to the other investor, who contracts to make payments at a fixed interest rate.

HEADLINE: Cholesterol Pill Linked to Lower Hospital Bills

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 26

 BODY:
A $2-a-day pill that lowers cholesterol can also lower the hospital bills of heart disease patients by cutting their risk of heart attacks and other expensive health problems, a study released last week concluded.
According to the study, giving the drug simvastatin to heart patients reduced their hospital admissions by a third during five years of treatment. It also reduced the number of days that they had to spend in the hospital when they were admitted, and reduced the need for bypass surgery and angioplasty, procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. 
 "This is both good medicine and good economics," said Dr. Sanford Schwartz, a physician and economist at the University of Pennsylvania.
The findings are the latest to be presented from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, an examination of the health effects of lowering cholesterol. Simvastatin is one of four similar cholesterol-lowering medicines now on the market. It is made by Merck & Company, which paid for the study but not for Dr. Schwartz's economic analysis.
The study was conducted on 4,444 volunteers. Its initial results, presented last November, showed that the treatment reduced the risk of death by 30 percent in patients who had already suffered heart attacks or angina pain.
At last week's meeting of the American College of Cardiology, the same team showed that the treatment could also have a major impact on hospital costs.
But like most medical treatments, this one does not actually save money. Hospital costs were $8 million lower among the 2,221 volunteers who got simvastatin rather than placebo pills, but the medicine itself costs $11 million, Dr. Schwartz said.
Nonetheless, Dr. Schwartz said the treatment was highly "cost-effective" compared with other widely accepted therapies and tests.
For example, it costs between $5,000 and $10,000 for each year of life saved to lower cholesterol, while mammograms to screen for breast cancer cost $30,000 to $35,000 for each year of life saved.
About a fourth of heart patients in the United States get medication to lower their cholesterol. Although the drugs have long been available, doctors have been reluctant to prescribe them routinely because of doubts about their effectiveness.
The latest findings were presented by Dr. Terje Pedersen of Aker University Hospital in Oslo. According to the study, treatment with simvastatin cut the total number of days patients had to spend in the hospital for heart problems by 34 percent. The treatment reduced the need for bypass surgery and angioplasty by 32 percent. Strokes and transient ischemic attacks, which are less serious brain blood flow disruptions, were also reduced by nearly a third by use of the drug.
When the study began, the patients' total cholesterol levels were mildly elevated, from 212 to 309. After taking the drug, their cholesterol fell by 25 percent and their levels of HDL, the form of cholesterol considered beneficial because it protects against heart disease, rose 8 percent.
The study did not examine the common practice of giving drugs to lower cholesterol to people who have high cholesterol but no signs of heart disease. Whether treatment for them saves lives or money has not been proved.

HEADLINE: U.S. Machine Tool Orders Fell in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW YORK, March 26

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell slightly in February for the second consecutive month, a trade group reported today, substantiating recent evidence that the economy is slowing down.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology said that machine tool orders totaled $372.85 million in February, down 1.1 percent from $377.15 million in January. 
 But compared with February of last year, orders were up 35.3 percent.
The monthly report covers metal cutting and metal forming machine tools, which are used to manufacture goods from household appliances to aircraft engines. Machine tool orders are considered a gauge of future economic activity. A rise is viewed as an indication that businesses feel confident that their sales will grow enough to justify investing in new equipment.
The report followed the Commerce Department's report on Friday that February orders to factories for durable goods had dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline in four months. Economists said that was significant evidence that the economy's expansion is beginning to slow.
For the first two months of 1995, machine tool orders totaled $750 million, up 17.95 percent from $635.85 million in the first two months of 1994.

HEADLINE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;
Don't Mess With PCS Primeco's Mr. Schmitt

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
The gavel may have fallen on the Federal Government's recent auction of new wireless communications licenses, but George F. Schmitt still sounds as though he is locked in a high-stakes bidding war.
Mr. Schmitt is the president and chief executive of PCS Primeco L.P., which aims to be a power player in the emerging business of personal communications services, or P.C.S. Backing PCS Primeco are Nynex, Bell Atlantic, US West and Airtouch Communications, a cellular company spun off last year by Pacific Telesis. 
 Thanks to the financial muscle of his backers, Mr. Schmitt was able to bid $1.1 billion for P.C.S. licenses in 11 markets, including such key franchises as Chicago and Dallas. Only AT&T and an alliance of the Sprint Corporation and three cable television operators bid more.
Now, though, Mr. Schmitt faces the daunting task of building a wireless franchise in each of the 11 markets. That may explain why this 51-year-old cellular-telephone veteran plays the tough guy when equipment manufacturers come to him, peddling everything from hand-held phones to cellular transmission towers.
"If they don't deliver what they promise, they're going to pay," Mr. Schmitt said. "We've been far too tolerant of vendors who don't deliver. It's why U.S. manufacturers have trouble overseas."
Mr. Schmitt needs to play hardball -- and not just with suppliers. The battle to sell personal communications services promises to be one of the most brutal in the history of telecommunications. AT&T, Sprint, GTE, BellSouth and a host of other companies spent a total of $7.7 billion for licenses to offer the service in the top 51 American markets.
The infant business also faces steep hurdles. For one, it must compete with conventional cellular, which has 23.7 million subscribers and is adding customers at an annual rate of 48 percent. For another, P.C.S. companies must persuade local zoning boards to allow them to put up scores of transmission towers before they can sign up a single customer.
As with cellular, P.C.S. signals are transmitted from a tower to a receiver built into the user's hand-held phone. If the user moves beyond the range of one transmission area, his call is handed off to the next tower.
Mr. Schmitt is no stranger to tough slogs. Before joining PCS Primeco in November, he built a cellular network from scratch in Germany as part of a joint venture between Airtouch and Mannesmann A. G., the German telecommunications giant. In just three years, Mr. Schmitt said, the fledgling service grew from zero to 600,000 customers.
During the Federal Communications Commission auction earlier this month, Mr. Schmitt made it clear in comments at industry conferences that he would retaliate against companies that went after markets he needed to fill out his national coverage. "You mess with me in Chicago, you pay," he said, shortly before the bidding ended.
Mr. Schmitt's bosses clearly hope he will bring the same brio to building his network. "You're dealing with a start-up business and a lot of competition," said Lawrence Babbio, the vice chairman of Bell Atlantic, who is also the chairman of the P.C.S. venture, "so you need a tough guy. If you want me to send him up to Capitol Hill, that's a different story."
Mr. Schmitt does not need to be diplomatic so long as he can attract new customers. In some ways, the job is no different from selling cellular. The only difference between the two is that P.C.S. signals are transmitted at a higher frequency and lower power than cellular signals. For now, P.C.S. phones are somewhat cheaper than cellular ones. But industry executives said that digital technology will soon erase that difference.
So Mr. Schmitt has to figure out how to make his service stand out from what analysts predict will be four or five competing wireless companies in every market that offer basically the same service. "The marketing costs are going to be a lot higher than anybody expected," said David Roddy, the chief telecommunications economist at Deloitte & Touche.
Mr. Schmitt's challenge is thornier than that faced by AT&T or the Sprint-cable alliance because he lacks a well-known national brand name. To get one, some observers believe PCS Primeco will end up allying with the MCI Communications Corporation, the only long-distance provider without a presence in P.C.S. MCI has already broached the subject -- in talks it held with Bell Atlantic and Nynex before the auction started.
But Mr. Schmitt insisted that MCI was not in his future. Instead, he said his company would probably devise a new brand name -- say PCS One -- and would market it alongside the name of each partner company in its home territory. In Philadelphia, for example, consumers would purchase the service from PCS One, brought to them by Bell Atlantic.
Whatever name he settles on, Mr. Schmitt figures to do it without any interference from his owners. He said that he rarely spoke to executives at his four parent companies, aside from Mr. Babbio, his direct boss. "I don't intend to have anybody in my back pocket," he said.
Still, with four strong-willed backers, Mr. Schmitt cannot avoid getting pushed around once in a while. Consider the arcane but important issue of how P.C.S. signals are transmitted.
Mr. Schmitt favors G.S.M., a digital transmission method widely used in European cellular systems. By using G.S.M., which stands for Global System for Mobile Communications, in the United States, PCS Primeco could offer customers extra services, like the ability to send and receive faxes via hand-held phones.
The trouble is, Mr. Schmitt's backers prefer a different transmission format, called code-division multiple access. Bell Atlantic and Nynex use C.D.M.A. in their cellular networks and they want to make sure their cellular customers can talk to their P.C.S. customers. That may not be possible with G.S.M. As a result, they are likely to choose C.D.M.A. for their P.C.S. service, regardless of Mr. Schmitt's objections.
As Mr. Babbio points out, when you have just collected $55 million from each of your backers to make a down payment on P.C.S. licenses -- which Mr. Schmitt recently did -- you cannot always get your way.

You Lucky Seven

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Like Lucy in the comic-strip Peanuts, who dispenses wisdom to all comers under the sign "Psychiatric Help -- 5," I offer herewith invaluable political-guru service to the seven Republican Presidential candidates for the price of a single newspaper.
To Phil Gramm: With Pat Buchanan slicing into your hard-right support, you cannot make it by reminding us of your triumph last year over Hillaryhealth, by out-grinching Gingrich, or by singing "Younger Than Doletime." A fresh, substantive appeal is needed. 
 You're an economist. Clintonites, joined by some nervous Republicans, are now saying "no spending cuts to finance tax cuts." This kicks Lord Keynes in the head.
You could explain how major spending reduction, unless accompanied by substantial tax reduction, would dangerously reduce aggregate demand -- perhaps plunging the nation into recession. By becoming the only anti-recession candidate, you can say you told them so when the downturn comes this winter.
To Pat Buchanan and Arlen Specter: How to break out of single-digit, second-tier status? Upstage the field by staging a series of formal, town-hall, C-Spanned Specter-Buchanan debates.
Just the two of you -- diametrically opposed on abortion rights and civil liberty and free trade -- could put on sustained performances that would energize your disparate constituencies, capture media attention, hype your fund-raising and raise the intellectual content of the campaign to a Bryan-Darrow level. And by grimly maintaining civility and mutual respect, you could detoxify the natural party split.
To Lamar Alexander: Ignore all elitist pundit advice to abandon your flannel shirts and outsider shtick. Nobody else in the field is working the cybercornball side of the street and it could turn out to be effective in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Your initial anti-Congress theme -- "Cut their pay and send them home" -- may be boring to the cognoscenti but could be appealing to voters when their hopes for term limits are dashed. As we will see, the problem of Congressional paralysis was not solved in 1994; by February, the term-limits candidate may find supporters resonating with resentment.
To Richard Lugar: To run as the Thinking Person's Candidate would have won press plaudits but no primary votes, but your strategy of double-hawkishness is intriguing.
Your hard line on Saddam -- send back those two American hostages or face real consequences -- dovetails with being a deficit hawk on seemingly untouchable farm subsidies. Nobody else has the foreign-policy hand and Hoosier eye to frame this symmetry, and there may be more interventionist budget-squeezers than pollsters suspect.
To Bob Dole: Drop the defensive deal-making about your age; promise to serve two full terms without one afternoon nap.
You're the legislative doer, so do: Get the Balanced Budget Amendment this fall by winning Hatfield's abstention, and send Clinton a welfare reform bill he'll hate to have to sign. Work secretly with Packwood to match spending cuts with a surprise tax package featuring flatter rates on both income and capital gains, with caps on future mortgage deductions. And stop running rightward against Gramm when your main competition is Wilson.
To Pete Wilson: Remember how Eisenhower wrested the G.O.P. nomination from Senator Taft -- appeal to the Republican lust to win.
Forget the sniping about running so soon after winning re-election as Governor; it's a reminder that you won. Welcome the onslaught about being pro-choice and never waffle; praise pro-life Gramm for candidly telling the preachers he won't become a preacher. Predict Dole's front-runnerhood for months ahead.
Even as you harass illegal immigrants to encourage their departure, show you're for legal immigrants by opposing plans to restrict their welfare. Don't pander to single-issue voters; because everybody knows the White House fears you most, your primary theme should be "go with a winner."
To my fellow right-wingers: What's the rush to decide 15 months before the convention? Send in a few bucks to the two or three candidates you like most. Revel in the system.

HEADLINE: Inflation Adjustment Defeats Real Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Mr. Kasich's Numbers" (editorial, March 20), concerning the House Budget Committee's proposal to help pay for tax relief, perpetuated the myth that all discretionary spending must automatically increase by the rate of inflation and if it doesn't is classified as a spending cut. We reject this "Inside the Beltway" approach to spending taxpayers' money and are prepared to offer real and honest budget cuts to the American people. 
 Your argument -- that any spending cut must be measured against an inflated baseline -- is the same mantra used by special interests who want to protect their programs and maintain the status quo. This built-in bias toward higher spending is one reason Federal budget deficits persistently total $200 billion and are projected to climb to more than $300 billion. Perversely, such reasoning allows special interests to claim their programs have been cut, when in fact spending has increased, albeit at a slower rate, or to make the reductions seem much greater than they really are, so as to make them appear impossible to accomplish. Measuring Federal spending with inflation adjustments only permits Federal spending to grow -- and forces Americans to finance a larger national debt.
These are the facts: Discretionary spending is now capped at $546 billion. The Budget Committee proposal extends and lowers the caps by $100 billion over five years.
These are real cuts, as they are measured not from an inflation-adjusted "baseline" but from current levels. We took this approach because we reject the notion that spending for every program must be adjusted upward for inflation.
Further, no matter what measuring stick you want to use to assess our spending cuts, it appears you cannot find even a single dollar or one program in the discretionary part of the Federal budget that should be cut.
We assume, therefore, that you do not support our efforts to attack corporate welfare, such as the Advanced Technology Program, which makes taxpayer dollars available to successful Fortune 500 companies. Although you describe our effort to cut spending as "punishing and arbitrary," we wonder if your readers support continued taxpayer financing of the Travel and Tourism Administration, whose promotional activities are nothing more than a subsidy for the nation's multibillion-dollar tourism industry, or the Interstate Commerce Commission, a regulatory agency with virtually nothing to regulate. This is just a small sample of the 144 proposals we suggested could be used to meet the goal of reducing discretionary spending by $100 billion.
The time for such reform is long overdue, and our effort to reduce the discretionary spending caps is only the first step.

HEADLINE: Creator of Business Zones Is Under Fire

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Daniel F. Biederman, the mastermind behind the Grand Central, 34th Street and Bryant Park business improvement districts, is about to create another. But this district is in Jersey City, and it has raised questions about the management and financial controls of the districts in New York.
Part of an audit of the Grand Central and 34th Street districts says that money from them was used to help set up the district in Jersey City. The audit is being prepared as Mr. Biederman and other top managers of the New York City improvement districts are about to sign a contract to run the one in Jersey City, too. 
 The audit and the contract have focused attention on the accountability of business improvement districts, which tax their members in exchange for providing services, as governments do, but do not have the same kinds of oversight. Such districts have been growing rapidly in size and numbers across New York City as a way to supplement city services.
"It is important that public-private partnerships be held to the highest standards," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, who is an ex-officio member of the three districts' boards. She said she had not been informed of the accountant's report or the Jersey City venture. "We anxiously await an audit," she said.
Peter L. Malkin, chairman of the Grand Central and 34th Street districts and the owner of several Manhattan office buildings, said it was a mistake to spend the New York money in Jersey City. He and Mr. Biederman said that it totaled only $2,000 and had been repaid by Jersey City officials.
Mr. Malkin said that he was familiar with Mr. Biederman's involvement in Jersey City, but that the venture had not yet been submitted to the full boards of the Grand Central and 34th Street districts.
He said he saw no conflict in Mr. Biederman and his staff working to create a New Jersey district. "We think it is our job to help wherever B.I.D.'s are being formed," he said, adding that the Grand Central and 34th Street districts had become models "to be replicated across the country at a time when government is cutting back."
Another city official said that the audit underscores the expanding interests of Mr. Biederman, who is paid $315,000 as president of the three New York districts.
Mr. Biederman would be paid $45,000 for the venture in Jersey City, although he would return $15,000 of that to the New York improvement districts. Under the conditions of his employment in New York, he can spend 15 percent of his time in Jersey City, but must return part of the salary he earns there.
"How can he devote 15 percent of his time to Jersey City when he is already running three B.I.D.'s?" asked Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, who is also an ex-officio board member of the districts presided over by Mr. Biederman. Mr. Hevesi, too, said he had not been informed of the accountant's report.
The audit, being prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, was to have been filed with the city by Dec. 31, but it has not yet been turned over. Mr. Biederman attributed the delay to the complexities of the three large business improvement districts, which are not-for-profit corporations financed through property owner assessments, corporate contributions, income from services, like payments from banks to keep homeless people out of automatic teller machine vestibules.
He and Louis J. Mezzina, a partner in Peat Marwick, said the audit had been delivered to the districts' offices on March 15 and would be submitted to city officials this week.
In addition to revealing the ties to Jersey City, the audit also raised questions about the districts' bookkeeping, the appearance of what it called inequitable benefits to some of the members in the district and executive salaries that it said should be "reviewed for reasonableness."
For example, Peat Marwick said that the midtown districts had sometimes made special arrangements to "meet the requirements of a particular building owner."
It pointed to $1.3 million that was spent by the Grand Central Partnership to install floodlights on the Lincoln Building, an office tower owned by Mr. Malkin across 42d Street from Grand Central Terminal. The lights were part of a project to illuminate 42d Street and the south side of Grand Central. More of the district's money was spent on Mr. Malkin's building than on any other.
Mr. Malkin said the expenditure was necessary because more lights were installed on the Lincoln Building, requiring a different type of rack, extensive roof repairs and a new air-conditioner to replace one that was destroyed when the lights were installed.
Mr. Biederman first became involved in the Jersey City project through Thomas Kelly, a real estate executive who is vice president of a company in the Bryant Park business district and who has also been appointed chairman of the new Jersey City district.
Mr. Kelly said that the district was to include several blocks in the Journal Square commercial neighborhood. Unlike districts in New York City, which are financed chiefly through assessments from property owners, this one would receive $1.4 million of the projected $2 million annual budget from public funds.
A contract for Mr. Biederman and his Manhattan colleagues, who Mr. Kelly said had been advising him for several months without pay, is "on our lawyers' desks," Mr. Kelly said. He said the contract stipulated that Mr. Biederman's group would receive more than $220,000 for their year of management responsibility.
But Mr. Biederman said the amount proposed was $210,000. Of that, he said $110,000 would be designated for phone bills and other administrative costs, leaving $100,000 in salary for himself and his Manhattan employees.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Urge A Rights Code For Businesses Dealing Abroad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
In its latest attempt to win back the good will of human rights groups disappointed by President Clinton's decision last year to extend trade benefits to China without tying them to human rights concerns, the White House will announce on Monday a voluntary code of human rights principles for American companies operating abroad.
After protracted argument within the Administration, Mr. Clinton decided last spring to bow to business interests who contended that the Administration's annual review of China's human rights performance was costing the United States billions in business in the world's most dynamic emerging market. 
 Now the Clinton Administration is once again trying to step lightly between two constituencies. Mr. Clinton has probably done more for American businesses operating abroad than any President in postwar history, turning the Commerce Department into a forceful advocate for American companies, pressing foreign governments to send business their way and raising trade issues to the top of the foreign policy agenda. But as the election approaches, Mr. Clinton also wants to protect his left flank after alienating many in the human rights community.
The chief problem is that America's allies, who are also its biggest economic competitors, have no such codes, and companies in those nations stand to sweep in business that the United States passes by. That issue was highlighted earlier this month when the Clinton Administration barred Conoco Inc. from entering a billion-dollar development deal with Iran. Now French oil companies are negotiating with Iran to replace Conoco.
It is unclear how many businesses will abide by the Administration's proposed code. Some executives reached last week said that if the wording is sufficiently weak or vague and appears unlikely to affect their competitiveness, there will probably be widespread adherence to what the Administration calls "a model of behavior."
But already there are signs that the final draft has so many compromises that it will disappoint the human rights groups it was trying to satisfy in the first place.
Details of the code have not been disclosed, but Administration officials acknowledge that many provisions governing the rights of foreign workers have been weakened in deference to the commercial realities of competing with the Japanese and Europeans.
People who have seen parts of the code say its strongest statements refer to bans on child labor and the use of prison laborers, actions that most large companies already say they oppose. The code will have deliberately vague language urging companies to respect the right of workers to organize and stops short of asking them to encourage such activities. The fear, several Administration officials said, is that such activity could be viewed in many nations -- including China -- as an effort to undermine national laws that strictly regulate labor activities.
The principles will be described to corporate executives, members of Congress and human rights groups by the White House on Monday. But the code will make no mention of paying a "fair wage" to workers in developing countries and emerging markets, and it sidesteps the question of how companies should treat workers who are prosecuted for engaging in political dissent in countries like China.
Nonetheless, the code is the biggest effort by the United States in two decades to create a minimum standard of conduct abroad for American companies. The last such effort was the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which bars American companies from bribing officials of foreign governments. That act has been widely criticized by American executives in recent years, who contend that while it is well intentioned, it often places them at a competitive disadvantage when they are bidding against companies from countries without comparable laws.
"We're back to the same problem again," a senior Administration official said. "This time we're juggling the interests of the business community and human rights, and discovering that it's an impossible balancing act."
In a declaration issued at the time he made the decision to extend China's trade privileges, Mr. Clinton committed himself to increased broadcasts into China by Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, more support for nongovernmental human rights groups operating in China and "the development with American business leaders of a voluntary set of principles for business activity in China."
Progress on the first two commitments has been minimal. When the Administration began drafting the code of conduct, the State Department argued that developing such a code only for businesses operating in China would further irritate relations between the two countries. So President Clinton's plan quickly evolved into the development of what Secretary of State Warren Christopher described to Congress last month as "the promulgation of a worldwide standard for the conduct of American business, not focused primarily on China, but focused on the world as a whole."
Many private companies already have codes of conduct for their operations abroad, including running-shoe manufacturers like Reebok and Nike, which have advertised their standards and used them as a selling point with American consumers. An Administration official who was deeply involved in drafting the new guidelines said that the White House reviewed several of the corporate codes and also looked at standards published by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, whose members have extensive manufacturing operations in China.
But in the course of consultation with the Administration last year, several executives warned the White House that its early drafts of the code would place a burden on American companies that was not shared by Japanese and European companies -- especially if the code appeared to create a standard for some kind of minimum wage.
"I give them credit, because no other Administration has even attempted to do something like this," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, which was formerly known as Asia Watch. "But they waited too long, and the human rights situation in China has deteriorated" since President Clinton decided to extend what in the trade community is called "most favored nation" status to Beijing, he said.
"If the President had pulled C.E.O.'s into the Oval Office last May when he issued the M.F.N. decision," Mr. Jendrzejczyk said, "he might have generated broader business support. That was the time of maximum political advantage," because the Administration had just given the business community something it desperately sought.

HEADLINE: The Swing Vote Has Dim View Of Both Parties

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MORENO VALLEY, Calif., March 26

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago this bedroom community of stucco houses and strip malls was little more than scrub land. Today it is ground zero in the battle for the American electorate.
The judgments of independent-minded voters like those that largely make up this middle-class enclave 75 miles east on the freeways from Los Angeles could determine whether Republicans or Democrats win control of the White House and Congress next year. The concentration of voters with no deep political roots or traditions explains why pollsters from both parties have been converging here. They are trying to figure out what the people want. 
 But dozens of random interviews with Moreno Valley residents suggest that the answer is not so simple as pronouncements from President Clinton about cutting taxes for the middle class or the passage of the House Republicans' Contract With America.
In spurning President George Bush in 1992, these voters helped fuel Mr. Clinton's victory. But now they are politically tortured. They complained that they were caught in a helpless predicament of declining wages, rising taxes and worsening crime. They wondered why politicians had not come to the rescue.
Jerry Nichols, the 40-year-old owner of a small computer supply company, said he voted for George Bush in 1988 and the independent candidate Ross Perot in 1992. He sees no reason to turn to the Republican or Democratic fold.
"Unless something is done to take care of the economy in the next two years there's going to be no middle class," Mr. Nichols said. "There will be just rich and poor. If Bill Clinton was helping me any more, I'd probably be bankrupt."
Indeed, the news in Moreno Valley -- representative of the fast-growing sprawl of seemingly endless suburbs east of Los Angeles called the "inland empire" -- is not heartening for either party. All but the most hard-core Democrats in this community of 130,000 expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Clinton, to the point of downright hostility, over what many described as his flip-flopping on issues and his failure to deliver on promises for the middle class.
But Republicans do not seem to have made much headway either. Many residents said they were taking a wait-and-see attitude about the promised achievements of Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker. Some, not so hopeful, said they feared that Mr. Gingrich and his lieutenants had embarked on a course that was too extreme. Democratic officials say they will be poised to seize on those fears come election time.
"I don't think there's any future without these independent swing voters, and that's true for both Democrats and Republicans," said Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster. "The parties are eyeing them and they are eyeing the parties. They're very much open."
For Mr. Clinton to win re-election, his advisers say he must again win California, the state with the most electoral votes, 54. And to win California, he must hang on to a substantial proportion of the voters in places like Moreno Valley.
In the interviews, most people who backed Mr. Perot in 1992 said they would probably do so again if he runs. Their point was that even with the upheaval in Washington and the Republicans' talk of reform, not much has changed: Politicians still cannot be trusted, and they still seem to be neglecting the middle class.
Most people, even many Republicans who said they always voted, responded with blank stares when asked about the Contract With America. And most were unaware of the Senate's passage last week of the line-item budget veto or House approval of its plan for an overhaul of the welfare system.
"I think the contract is going to be a tremendous boon for Republicans," said Tom Brooks, a 44-year-old Republican who builds steel-frame houses.
"What is it?" asked his wife, Karen, 45. "I'm ignorant."
"It's a deal with foreign countries," Mr. Brooks replied. Told that was not the case, he tried again, unsuccessfully: "Isn't it this trade thing with Mexico?"
Down the street, Cindy Polujancewicz, who described herself as a registered Democrat but said she had voted for Mr. Bush in 1992, said: "Contract? What do you mean?" But she had strong feelings about Mr. Gingrich. "He's a loudmouth and too aggressive," she said.
Asked what the parties should do to win her over, Ms. Polujancewicz, 35, who is married to a struggling tool dealer, said, "Be more concerned with your average person -- and don't pay attention just to the rich."
Over the last decade, Moreno Valley grew dramatically as people sought peace and quiet and escape from the high costs of Los Angeles. But the half-acre plots and well-manicured cactus gardens can be deceptive. In the aftermath of the economic downturn spurred by drastic military cutbacks in the area, the developments here are sprinkled with foreclosed homes. Some people who moved here have lost their jobs, cannot sell their houses -- whose values have plummeted -- and now have to contend with the gangs that migrated here from Los Angeles.
"This was a $259,000 home," said Mike Pagan, 51, a retired police officer whose house has been on the market for more than a year. "Now I'm selling it for $184,000. But it's not going to sell."
Mr. Pagan said that Mr. Gingrich's leadership was refreshing and that he would probably vote with the Republicans next time. But he said he was also watching carefully that the Republicans do not go too far. "We should dump it," Mr. Pagan said of the welfare system. "I don't believe we should have girls with babies running around picking up money for free. But that doesn't mean we should hurt people."
But Charles Johnson, 39, an ice cream store manager who explained that business was so bad that he had not gotten his usual bonus for two years, said neither party was addressing his needs. "I just did my taxes yesterday," he said. "I made less and paid more in taxes. We're too rich for food stamps but too poor to live in a good neighborhood."
Mr. Johnson said he typically voted for Democrats, but may back an independent in 1996. "I just don't see where anything he's done has done anything for me," Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Clinton.
Rob Oliver, who works for a securities company and describes himself as an independent-libertarian, said he might favor Democrats if he believed the party delivered on tax cuts for the middle class.
Would he vote for Mr. Clinton in that case? "There's no way I'd consider voting for Bill Clinton," replied the 36-year-old Mr. Oliver, adding that he had lost confidence that the President had any leadership skills.
Such talk obviously disturbs Democratic officials, who see a rise in Republican registrations among newcomers, although the two parties are about evenly split. A majority of voters in Moreno Valley, which is overwhelmingly white, backed Mr. Bush in 1988. But four years later, 41 percent favored Mr. Clinton, 34 percent voted for Mr. Bush and 23 percent turned to Mr. Perot.
"We have to do better," said Bob Mulholland, an adviser to the state Democratic Party. Noting that support for Democrats seems to have dwindled since 1992, he added, "It's absolutely key that we get at least 40 percent."
The Democrats should not count on Diane and George Mackay, who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988, Ross Perot in 1992 and have lost confidence in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Ms. Mackay does not work, and Mr. Mackay, after taking a buyout from his job in computers, has been unable to find a new one.
Mr. Mackay tried to play down his family's financial distress. "We're surviving," he said.
"By our fingernails," Ms. Mackay shot back.
Asked what she thought Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans had accomplished, Ms. Mackay, 48, shrugged. "Not much," she said. "I don't see any changes." And on some issues, like the passage of a law here to stiffen sentences for three-time offenders, Ms. Mackay said Republicans were going too far. "Are they going to take a whole state and make a prison out of it?" she asked.
The oratory from Washington about returning power to the states does not appear to have registered with Mr. Mackay. "I blame Democrats and Republicans for so much government," he said, as his 2-year-old grandson, Christopher, who lives there with the Mackays' daughter, watched cartoons on television. "I don't need their health care."
Asked what it would take for him to vote for Mr. Clinton in 1996, Mr. Mackay said that would never happen. "I'd be surprised if they ran Clinton again," he said.
But while Mr. Mackay may be a lost cause, Democrats should be worried about Nikki Heider, a reservations clerk for Amtrak who is worried that she may be laid off this week. Ms. Heider, a 39-year-old registered Democrat, said she voted for Mr. Clinton but was having second thoughts. "I'm disappointed in him and I'm upset that he's taking Amtrak funding away," she said. "I'm still a Democrat, but I'm listening to the Republicans more now."
Her husband, Dennis Heider, an engineering consultant, considers himself a right-leaning independent. Asked if there were any Democrats he would now vote for, he shook his head and remarked, "Truman died, right?"
Most voters interviewed said they had not given much thought to the Presidential field in 1996. Most had not heard of the Republican prospects. Even Gov. Pete Wilson's announcement last week of a committee to explore a possible candidacy was largely met with hostility. Almost every voter interviewed -- even Republicans who backed Mr. Wilson for re-election last year -- said they did not think he could win the Republican nomination.
Asked whom he would vote for, Mr. Pagan, the former police officer, offered a fairly typical response: "It won't be for Pete Wilson. That's for darn sure. He's not a guy you can trust, whether he thinks he's conservative or not."

Mr. Oliver, with his daughters, Lara Ashley, 11, and Anne Shirley, 6, said that he might favor Democrats if the party delivered tax cuts but that there was "no way" he would vote for President Clinton. Nikki and Dennis Heider of Moreno Valley said they had problems with the Democrats. Ms. Heider said she voted for President Clinton but was having second thoughts, while her husband, asked if there were any Democrats he could vote for, replied, "Truman died, right?" Charles Johnson, who manages an ice cream store, said he typically voted for Democrats but may back an independent in 1996. (Photographs by Jim Wilson/The New York Times)(pg. A10)

HEADLINE: Making Good Psychiatric Care Cost-Effective;
Costly Dental Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We applaud "The Albany Budget Games Begin" (editorial, March 15) and would like to supplement your observations by focusing on the proposed elimination of adult dental Medicaid services. This shortsighted proposal is economically unsound and destructive to the health of the neediest segment of our population. 
 Supposedly saving $17.1 million by not allowing for preventative dental care while retaining payment for only the more costly emergency treatment places health care economic theory back 20 years.
Should we not insist that caries be prevented and if necessary treated before the decay results in the need for more costly emergency root canal therapy or extraction? If New York State were to reimburse under Medicaid only for emergency dental treatment, it would require Medicaid to expend conservatively $35 million more than the proposed budget has projected.
To make the situation worse, it is more than likely that more than 900 private-practice dentists who primarily serve the indigent Medicaid population, including children, will be forced to close their offices and terminate the jobs of some 3,000 assistants, clerical aides and hygienists. What will be the economic impact of lost income-tax revenues and increased unemployment expenses?
Add to this the tens of millions of dollars in increased reimbursement by New York State Medicaid when even children covered under the program seek treatment at more expensive hospital clinics. Human suffering, unnecessary government spending and lost revenue are not rational solutions to our budget problems.

HEADLINE: President Goes on Offensive With Call for Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
President Clinton opened an ambitious new political agenda today by proposing spending cuts to shrink the size of NASA and three other agencies beyond what his budget recommended seven weeks ago.
The further cuts would amount to $13.1 billion over the next five years, far short of what Congressional Republicans are preparing to recommend. The President's proposal comes as he prepares for his most intensive schedule of domestic travel since the midterm elections last year. He and his advisers used the announcement to call renewed attention to the differences between what they portrayed as their common-sense approach to paring spending and a wrongheaded Republican alternative. 
 "You can reinvent Government and cut costs to taxpayers without a mean spirit or a meat ax," Mr. Clinton said during an appearance at the Federal Communications Commission, at which he announced the cuts.
Those blunt words suggested that the President has become emboldened by the success that Democrats have found in casting Republican budget-cutting plans as heartless. And as Mr. Clinton travels to Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, Texas and California during the next two weeks, his aides said today, that message will be a recurrent theme.
For Mr. Clinton, who has been overshadowed by the Republicans' new domination of the Capitol, the back-to-back journeys to the South and to the West Coast may prove an opportunity for political rehabilitation.
With much of his attention focused on the House Republicans' effort to pass the Contract with America into law, Mr. Clinton has not made even a one-day political journey outside of Washington in more than a month. But now that Congress seems likely to leave town for the Easter recess before it can reach agreement on any more important legislation, Mr. Clinton is eager, White House officials say, to return to the hustings.
Beginning in Atlanta, where on Wednesday he will preside over a daylong conference on the region's economy, Mr. Clinton hopes to win more credit for the nation's prosperity while emphasizing that he shares the sentiments of those eager to shift more power to the states.
To reinforce that embrace of Federalism, the President is scheduled to address the Florida Legislature in Tallahassee on Thursday, his first appearance in a statehouse since taking office.
The new cuts in Federal spending that he proposed today would give the states more authority in some respects. For example, Maryland and Virginia would be required to maintain what are now Federal roadways along the Potomac River, and states would be required to collect mine royalties now handled by the Federal Government.
At a White House briefing today, some of Mr. Clinton's top deputies took turns drawing comparisons between the President's proposals and those put forward by Republicans, like the legislation approved by the House last week to give the states broad authority over the social welfare system.
Elaine Kamarck, a senior policy adviser to Vice President Al Gore, said, "We believe there is a right way to cut Government and a wrong way, and we believe we are doing it the right way."
The changes recommended by Mr. Clinton emerged from the latest phase of the Administration's review, which is headed by Mr. Gore and has been greatly accelerated since the Republicans gained control of Congress. Beyond NASA, they would force consolidations in the Interior Department, the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Together with the $144 billion in savings that Mr. Clinton had already presented, the new proposals would amount to substantial shrinkage over the next five years in departments and agencies like NASA. The combined effect of reductions now planned at the space agency, including some that have been under way for several years, could cut as many as a total of 55,000 jobs from the Government payroll and space-related industries, Administration officials said today.
But the President's new five-year proposal amounts to about $4 billion less than the House has already voted to strip from the current budget alone, and its unveiling today is bound to intensify the rivalry between the White House and Capitol Hill on questions of taxing and spending.
The tax cuts that Mr. Clinton has already proposed are also much smaller than those that the Republicans have embraced, and their benefits would fall mainly to Americans who earned less than $70,000 a year.
To consolidate support around that limited approach, the White House remains intent on calling attention to the scope of the Republicans' budget-cutting plans, arguing that it leaves no doubt that the Republicans want to cut spending for the young and poor in order to cut taxes for the wealthy.
But aides to Mr. Clinton said today that he might well avoid direct attacks on particular Republican plans when he begins his Southern swing on Tuesday afternoon. They said he believed that the 1996 elections were still too far away for such outright partisanship, and the need to work with the Republican majority would make that stance counterproductive.
But they also said that by emphasizing his approach to issues like the economy, crime and education, the President hoped to call attention to what he had already done, while inviting comparisons about the two parties' proposals for the future.
The seven-day journey will also include a stop in Haiti on Friday, when the United States will hand over authority for the peacekeeping mission to the United Nations. The trip ends on Monday, when the President is to return to Washington after a weekend in Arkansas, where he is to make a political appearance. He is to begin a three-day trip to Texas and California on April 7.
Mr. Clinton has rarely spent much uninterrupted time in a single region of the country. Aides said today that he had grown frustrated with itineraries that have him hopscotching from state to state. As a native of the South, they said, Mr. Clinton chose that region for the first of four planned economic conferences reminiscent of the one he convened in Arkansas shortly before taking office.

HEADLINE: Orange County Faces Future With Anxiety

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., March 27

 BODY:
Three months after risky investments collapsed and plunged Orange County into bankruptcy, residents here are suffering new anxieties about the future, an unusual turn for people living in one of the most comfortable counties in the nation.
The full pain of the county's fiscal crisis is still to come. But people are already talking about fears of a future with fewer libraries, fire departments run by volunteers, parents filling in for teachers, coaches and janitors, and property values dragged down by the prospect of it all. 
 Even the unthinkable seems increasingly likely here in the nation's conservative, anti-tax heartland: a half-cent increase in the 7.75 percent sales tax collected in the county. After a preliminary vote last week, the five county supervisors are expected on Tuesday to put a proposed sales tax increase on the ballot for a vote in June. The current sales tax includes a state levy of 7.25 cents per $1 and a county levy of 0.50 cents for $1 for transportation.
To the surprise of many, a majority of respondents in a poll conducted this month by The Orange County Register said they favored increasing the sales tax. But the county's ardent anti-tax groups are gearing up for battle.
"We'll be opposing the sales tax tooth and toenail," said Tom Rogers, a rancher who is a former chairman of the county's Republican Party and now leads a private group, Citizens Against Unfair Taxation. Some people have threatened to try for a recall vote on any supervisor who votes to put the tax question on the ballot.
The likelihood of sharp cuts in services and new taxes has reinforced anxieties in recent years over the state's lingering recession and cutbacks in the aerospace industry.
They are affecting the swimming pool salesman who is uncertain about his business for the coming summer and the college president who fears that her salary may be cut. The administrator of a local hospital says she is preparing for the admissions of more people suffering from anxiety and depression.
In one indicator of a more uncertain mood, business is up at Proos Security, which trains and rents out security guards. Hard times breed crime, or at least fears of crime, said the agency's owner, Patricia Johnson.
Mark Baldassere, chairman of the urban and regional planning department at the University of California at Irvine, said: "The impacts of the bankruptcy are still being discovered. Every day a new rock is turned over and something else is discovered, and it's, 'Oh, gosh, we didn't think of that.' "
Last week, the county's chief executive, William J. Popejoy, presented his most detailed outline yet of a recovery plan: a mix of asset sales, privatization, layoffs, cuts in services, new bond issues and the half-cent sales tax increase.
Under Mr. Popejoy's plan, the sharpest and most immediate squeeze will be felt at the bottom, among the county's homeless, its disabled veterans, its mentally ill, its elderly, its abused children and its welfare recipients. Of 1,600 layoffs and staff reductions he proposed among county workers, two-thirds would come in the social services.
But the cuts will affect everyone, with a reduction in services that are rarely noticed until they are gone, said Tobye Lovelace, staff manager at the Orange County Employees Association.
"It's the county that makes sure that when you buy a gallon of gas, you are getting a gallon of gas," Ms. Lovelace said. "They check to make sure the restaurants are clean. They send the building inspectors to assess property."
And in a trickledown of hardship that is just beginning, the county's schools have tightened their belts severely, and cities and towns face their own layoffs, cuts in services and increases in fees.
The lightest burden will fall on the rich, who despite their abhorrence of taxes, comfort themselves, as one shop owner here reported, by saying, "The county's broke, but we're not."
At The Money Man, a gallery where it is possible to buy money in a frame, sales have dropped on the $200 and $300 items like Lincoln and Grant bills. But the luxury offerings, like a $14,000 Lincoln manuscript, are still selling merrily.
"Did you see our yacht parade this year?" asked Shirley Arconti, a saleswoman at The Money Man. "People were saying there would be fewer lights, but it was spectacular. It was one of the best we've had. Of course, here in Newport Beach, we live in our own little shell."
One customer at the shop, Avery W. Willis 3d, an executive with Scott Worldwide, the paper company, said cuts in social services might offer "a benefit in disguise" in persuading the county's growing number of poor people to move.
"That's a crude way to talk about it, but it's real," Mr. Willis said. "Let them go live in New York."
But other shoppers here at the Fashion Island mall spoke of an emerging sense of community and a spirit of volunteerism as people join to shoulder the new burdens, and especially to keep the county's schools afloat.
Whatever the economic and social divisions of the county, the fate of the schools is a broadly shared concern, crucial to both the future of Orange County's children and its property values.
June Sinclair, on a visit to the mall with her 6-year-old son, Jordan, who had just had his first tooth pulled, said that in her home town of Irvine, the Great Harvest Bakery had turned itself over for a day to the El Camino Real Elementary School, letting teachers and parents bake bread for sale to raise money for the school.
The Irvine school district, which had invested $100 million in the failed county fund, has cut its current budget by $3 million and is still struggling to find ways not to shortchange its students.
Mrs. Sinclair, whose husband is an anesthesiologist, said she had initiated an advertising newsletter at the school for local businesses that include real estate agents, travel agencies, accountants and house painters. Any that gain business from the newsletter would make cash donations to the school.
Valery J. Deveraux, a real estate lawyer and mother of two teen-agers, described school meetings at which parents are offering to teach math class, coach sports or perform janitorial services.
But volunteerism can go only so far. Ms. Deveraux said that bankruptcy filings had already begun to rise in the county and that there were fears that possible cuts in court personnel could jam an already overloaded court system.
She said some unincorporated areas, including her own home of Dove Canyon, might join together as new towns, thereby reducing their dependence on the county and contracting out for fire, police and other services.
One sector of the population has already felt the pain of the bankruptcy in all its force. About 150 county workers have lost their jobs so far, with hundreds more to follow.
Until this month, Lena Gniadek, 69, worked in the map unit of the county's registrar of voters. One day without warning, she said, she was handed a packet of severance papers and told to leave.
"I just walked back to my desk and took whatever I could after 13 years, and just left within 20 minutes," she said. "I remember it was raining and blustery and I got into my car and that was the end of my working life, and I was left to try and figure out what my life was all about."

HEADLINE: Mayor Asks Broad Powers Over Fulton Fish Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration, unveiling details of plans to rid the Fulton Fish Market of mobsters and corruption, yesterday asked the City Council for broad powers to determine who can do business and who can work at the market.
The proposed legislation would give administration officials the power to license, regulate and investigate all business owners and employees at the market. It would also give City Hall the right to fingerprint all vendors and workers as well as to conduct background investigations if any of them are suspected of being linked to organized crime. 
 But some Council members raised the issue of potential civil rights violations, questioning the administration's need for fingerprinting and background investigations.
Several business owners at the market and community leaders also questioned the need for any change in existing practices at the lower Manhattan market. One fish dealer warned that the proposal by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would drive legitimate dealers out of the city.
The proposed legislation to revise the city's existing regulatory authority over the market was conceived by the administration and top Council leaders and its provisions were disclosed yesterday at a hearing of the Council's Committee on Economic Development. Despite opposition, aides to Peter F. Vallone, the leader of the Council, said they expected the bill to be approved without significant amendments. After Council approval, Mr. Giuliani would sign the bill into law.
"Business as usual at the Fulton Fish Market cannot continue," Randy Mastro, chief of staff to Mayor Giuliani, told the committee. "We must act."
Other administration officials and supporters of the bill said that Federal and state law enforcement efforts over the last half century, through occasional prosecutions of reputed mobsters and the appointment of a temporary monitor, had failed to uproot the Genovese crime family or to end abuses. The bill's proponents said new tactics must be used in attempts to diminish entrenched mob influence in commercial enterprises in the city like the market, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Garment Center.
The Fulton Market, the nation's largest wholesale fish market, is mainly on city property on the East River and South Street, extending from Fulton Street north to Peck Slip. About 125 million pounds of fish are sold each year at the market for distribution to retail stores and restaurants in the New York metropolitan area.
Although various city agencies were empowered to regulate the market, the Giuliani administration, which took office in January 1994, said that previous administrations had largely abdicated responsibility to administer it and had allowed unlicensed vendors to operate without supervision.
Mr. Mastro said that mob influence, violence, extortion and fraud were partly responsible for fish and seafood suppliers on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Chesapeake Bay from shunning the market in favor of wholesale distribution points in other cities. He said that business at the Fulton Market had declined to less than $1 billion annually from about $3 billion in the early 1980's.
Mr. Mastro said the drop in shipments to the Fulton Market and hidden charges extracted by mob figures contribute to higher consumer prices. While he was unable to pinpoint the extra charges, Mr. Mastro said, "It is a corruption and crime tariff that inflates prices."
Under the proposed law, the Commissioner of the Business Services Department would establish regulations for all businesses operating in the market, and all employees and vendors would be required to wear photo identification cards. The bill would authorize the Commissioner to ban certain companies and employees from operating there.
The Commissioner would have strong regulatory authority over the flow of fish and seafood as it arrives and leaves the market. A particular target of the bill are companies known as unloaders and loaders.
Truckers who transport produce in refrigerated trucks have complained to Federal and city authorities that six unloading companies set prices and decide how perishable supplies are unloaded and taken to wholesalers on South Street.
A Federal judge in 1993 ruled that the six unloading companies were a cartel and imposed fines on them totaling more than $100,000.
A dozen companies known as loaders assign parking spaces to retailers and restaurateurs who purchase supplies in the hours before dawn when the market thrives. Retailers and restaurateurs say that because of intimidation they do not carry their own purchases back to their trucks but pay parking and loading charges set by the companies.
The bill would authorize the Business Services Commissioner to license loading and unloading companies and to investigate their owners and employees. At the hearing, Mr. Mastro said about 100 owners and workers would be subject to fingerprinting and criminal investigations.
Michael Driansky, a wholesale vendor and president of the Committee to Save the Fulton Fish Market, asserted that the bill would encourage dealers to move to New Jersey.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Car Makers Gaining Momentum in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
Aiming to make Brazil a leading world car manufacturer by the end of the decade, the four biggest car makers in Brazil are doubling their investment, and new companies are planning to start assembly lines in this country.
In rapid succession over the last few weeks, Ford announced a $2 billion investment; General Motors, a $2 billion expansion, and Volkswagen, $3 billion. Fiat said it intended to invest $1 billion in Brazil and $600 million in Argentina. Fiat's operation in Brazil is the Italian company's largest and most profitable. 
 "We are making investments far in excess of what we have ever done here," said Gurminder Bedi, president of Ford's Argentina and Brazil divisions. "In developed countries, automobile markets grow by 2 percent a year. Here, it could easily grow by 5 to 7 percent."
After sharply increasing vehicle production since 1990 -- to 1,583,000 last year from 915,000 -- Brazil intends to double production again by the year 2000. Surpassing Italy in 1993 and the former republics of the Soviet Union in 1994, Brazil expects this year to overtake Britain.
Its boom is part of a larger shift of car manufacturing to third world countries with cheaper labor costs. In general, auto production stagnated in the last decade in the world's four largest car-making countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany and France. In the same period, it doubled in India, tripled in Mexico, quadrupled in China and increased eightfold in South Korea.
The Koreans built their industry by nurturing national companies behind high tariff walls that blocked virtually all auto imports. Brazil encouraged multinational companies to set up manufacturing operations behind similar tariff barriers. But since 1990, Brazil has dropped import bans, forcing manufacturers to upgrade their assembly lines to successfully compete with the rest of the world.
As investments pour into Brazil's automobile industry, centered in the industrial belt around Sao Paulo, Brazilian-made cars are expected to win more international acceptance. Last year, about a quarter of the cars made in Brazil were exported.
For the moment, though, car makers are scrambling to keep up with domestic demand. Brazil is enjoying its lowest inflation in a decade -- about 1.5 percent monthly. From a monthly high of 50 percent last June, inflation has been driven down by a combination of a balanced budget and a shift to a new, dollar-linked currency. With consumer confidence soaring, Brazil's economy expanded last year by 5.7 percent, the highest rate in a decade. Growth this year is expected to exceed 5 percent.
"While Mexico has 8.5 inhabitants per vehicle, Brazil has 11.6," said Luiz Adelar Scheuer, a Mercedes-Benz executive who is president of the National Association of Vehicle Manufacturers. Mercedes makes trucks and buses in this country.
Given the strong consumer demand, both Volkswagen and General Motors recently started third production shifts at factories near here. General Motors plans to concentrate in Brazil its worldwide production of the Corsa, a compact car that is enormously popular in this country.
With the economic situation radically changed, a consortium called Autolatina will cease to exist by the end of the month. This Brazilian-Argentine production operation was formed by Ford and Volkswagen during hard times a decade ago. Since late last year, the two car companies have been phasing out Autolatina's operations.
Volkswagen plans to double its production in Brazil to one million vehicles by the end of the 1990's. And Ford intends to make Brazil the worldwide production center for the Fiesta. [On Monday, Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, arrived from Detroit for a two-day visit to study his company's investment strategy in this country and to meet with the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.]
Joining the parade of international automobile executives coming through Brazil will be Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's vice president for international production, who will come here next month to announce the site of a new truck-manufacturing plant. It is to serve as Volkswagen's world production center for trucks.
And for the first time in almost two decades ago, new companies are announcing plans to build passenger cars. Earlier this month, Cho Rae Seung, president of Asia Motors Corporation of South Korea, told Vice President Marco Maciel that his company planned to build a $150 million factory in Brazil next year. January sales show that Asia Motors' Towner van and the Besta van made by its parent, Kia Motors, were the leading import models made by companies that do not make cars in Brazil.
About the same time, Renault's chairman and president, Louis Schweitzer, met in Brasilia with the nation's President. Renault is a popular import, and, according to the local press, the French car maker is planning to open a Brazilian assembly line.
Peugeot's managing director, Yves Barbe, said on a visit here Sunday that his company was studying the feasibility of making cars in Brazil. Toyota, which began producing jeeps in Brazil in 1959, is considering manufacturing passenger cars on an industrial site it has purchased near here.
But manufacturers' interest began to cool last fall, when the Government cut taxes on imported cars, to 20 percent from 32 percent. This fueled a surge in imports that had started five years ago, when the import ban was lifted. Last year, Brazilians imported 193,516 cars -- a twelvefold increase over the 1991 level. Brazil thereby replaced Venezuela as the United States' leading Latin American market for its cars.
With imports accounting for one-fourth of all car sales in December, the manufacturers said they would not invest further without more protection. In February, they reached a deal with the Government. Manufacturers promised to invest to double production by the end of the decade. In turn, the Brazilian President promised "to end this orgy of importing cars." He restored the import tariff to 32 percent, returning to a former schedule that had called for a 20 percent tariff in 2001.
Even with the 32 percent tariff, however, imports are expected to almost double this year, reaching 350,000, roughly the same level as exports.
For now, the car industry does not have to look too far away for markets. Last year, 87 percent of Brazil's car exports went to South America, largely to Argentina. With Latin American sales increasing 10 percent, Brazil has a strong regional market.
Within three years, this country's automobile industry is expected to surpass Canada's, making Brazil the second-largest car-making nation in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States.

HEADLINE: Germany Privatizing Phone Service in '98

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BONN, March 27

 BODY:
Germany will open its telephone service market to competition on Jan. 1, 1998, in a move that could lower prices and create better services for consumers, the Government said today.
An unlimited number of private companies will be allowed to apply for licenses, the Post and Telecommunications Minister, Wolfgang Boetsch, said. The German telecommunications market has long been dominated by the state phone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom A.G. Deutsche Telekom, which the Government is privatizing, will begin selling shares next year. 
 The Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, had pushed to open the German market sooner. But other German officials reportedly thought that the privatization of Deutsche Telekom might be damaged by quick exposure to foreign competition.
"The date of 1998 was set at the highest levels of the German Government," Mr. Boetsch said, noting that all European Union countries are supposed to open their telecommunications markets by that date.
Major American and other foreign telecommunications companies have been eager to get into the German market, which was worth $43 billion in 1992, the world's third largest after the United States and Japan.
The first licenses to private companies should be granted early in 1997, Mr. Boetsch said, but he declined to speculate how many would be granted.
United States regulators have considered rules that could stall a bid by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to buy 20 percent of the Sprint Corporation because of complaints by other United States carriers about limited access to Germany's market.

HEADLINE: Canadians Cut the Nets Of Spain Ship

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 27

 BODY:
The Canadian Coast Guard has cut the nets of a Spanish trawler just outside Canada's territorial waters east of Newfoundland in a renewal of the battle with the European Union over North Atlantic fishing rights.
The action was announced late Sunday in Ottawa after a confrontation on the high seas involving five Canadian patrol vessels and a dozen Spanish trawlers. 
 No shots were fired, but Canadians chased a second Spanish trawler they had also tried to board. That trawler suddenly lifted its nets and ran for the protection of a Spanish Navy patrol vessel. The Canadians abandoned the chase because of what officials said was heavy fog.
"They're all out of the zone, so the activity of today has produced the result that we were aiming to get," Prime Minister Jean Chretien told reporters in Ottawa.
The Spaniards were fishing in the breeding grounds of the Grand Banks, an area Canada has unilaterally declared off limits because of a sharply declining fish population. The disappearance of cod and other species has left some 50,000 Canadian east coast fishermen and fish plant workers unemployed.
The phenomenon has affected the United States as well. In December the Commerce Department ordered the emergency closing of more than 6,000 square miles of fishing area off the Massachusetts coast.
Sunday's high seas drama followed the seizure on March 9 of another Spanish trawler, also operating just outside Canada's 200-mile territorial boundary.
That trawler, the Estai, was brought into St. John's, Newfoundland, and its master was arrested. But a week later he and the vessel were released after its owners posted a bond of $355,000.
Canada and the European Union have vowed to try to resolve their dispute diplomatically. But Spanish trawlers have remained in the disputed area, under the protection of a naval patrol vessel, the Vigia.
On Sunday the Canadian Government increased the conflict by authorizing the use for the first time of a large scissors-like device called a warp-cutter, which slashes cables that attach nets to a trawler.
When the Pescamaro Uno refused to be boarded Sunday, the Canadian cutter Sir Wilfred Grenfell moved alongside and deployed the warp-cutter. The trawler lost an estimated $70,000 worth of gear besides the value of its catch. Then the second trawler, the Verdel, pulled its nets and fled.
Canada says the dwindling stocks must be protected by toughly enforced international conservation measures beyond territorial waters. It has accused the Spanish fishermen of using undersized nets and catching species protected by fishing bans and keeping secret sets of books.
The European Union has denied the allegations and accused Canada of piracy. Yet while condemning Canada for cutting the nets of the trawler, ambassadors of the 15 member countries at a meeting today in Brussels refused to invoke sanctions, presumably hoping to prevent further confrontations.
The Europeans and the Canadians accuse each other of overfishing. After trying unsuccessfully to resolve their differences in talks in Brussels and Vancouver, Canada and the European Union shifted the venue of their debate today to the United Nations in New York.
Although public opinion data is not yet in, newspaper editorials and radio talk shows indicate that the public likes the Government's new gunboat diplomacy.
"The minister is saying the right things that attract a large amount of support in the country," says John Wright, senior vice president of the Angus Reid Group Inc., a national polling organization.
But some Canadian voice disquiet. "This kind of behavior," a recent editorial in The Globe and Mail said, "is jarringly out of character for a country whose greatest international role has been as peacemaker and conciliator."

Fed Governor to Step Down; Clinton Gets a 3d Vacancy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve Board governor with a reputation for favoring higher interest rates and opposing the Clinton Administration's banking policies, announced his resignation today, to take effect April 30.
His departure gives President Clinton his third chance to fill a vacancy on the powerful board in less than a year. The replacement of any single governor tends to have little effect on interest rate policy. But the Administration's two appointees to the board have shown slightly more willingness than their Republican colleagues to discuss publicly the risks of higher unemployment posed by Federal Reserve efforts to fight inflation by pushing up interest rates. 
 The Fed's top interest rate policy committee, comprising the 7 Federal Reserve Board governors and 5 of the 12 Federal Reserve regional bank presidents, is scheduled to meet again on Tuesday. The Fed announced today that in keeping with tradition for departing officials, Mr. LaWare would not attend the meeting.
Financial analysts said that with the economy showing clear signs of slowing, the Fed was highly unlikely to raise interest rates again at the meeting, with or without Mr. LaWare there. "I think this is an easy meeting for the Fed -- no change and waiting for the data on the second quarter," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers.
Mr. LaWare said in an interview that he had announced his resignation shortly before the meeting partly because a resignation shortly after a meeting might be misinterpreted as a policy difference.
"I passed my 67th birthday last month and I'm ready for a change of pace," he said. "I plan to work on my golf handicap, and beyond that I don't have any specific plans."
When the committee voted not to raise interest rates in December, Mr. LaWare took the uncommon step of dissenting in favor of higher rates. But he has changed his tone over the last several months, becoming one of several governors to comment on early signs of economic slowing this spring.
"There are signs of a slowing down, but it's a slowing down in the rate of growth -- it's not the kind of slowing down that says you're in a nose dive," he said in a wide-ranging interview on March 10.
Mr. LaWare has been known at the Federal Reserve chiefly for his outspoken positions on bank regulation. He heads the board's bank regulatory committee and led the Fed's successful fight last year to stop the Administration's plan to consolidate banking regulatory agencies, a move that would have taken away some of the Fed's considerable powers over large banks.
Before joining the Federal Reserve in 1988, Mr. LaWare was the chairman of the Shawmut National Corporation, which was a big Boston banking company at that time but has since set up a headquarters in Hartford after expanding into Con necticut. Mr. LaWare is the only former banker on the Federal Reserve Board now, and in his letter of resignation to President Clinton today, he urged that another banker be named to replace him.
"The quality of board deliberations and decisions on banking matters is enhanced by the direct participation of a member with personal private-sector experience in banking," Mr. LaWare wrote.
The resignation took the White House by surprise, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank N. Newman said that it was premature to speculate whether the Administration would nominate another commercial banker. He also said the Administration could not choose a replacement and win Senate confirmation for the nominee before Mr. LaWare stepped down. "April 30 is virtually impossible," Mr. Newman said.
The Administration is under no obligation to follow Mr. LaWare's advice to appoint another banker, but, after appointing two academicians last year, the White House might find it easier to win confirmation for a banker from the Republican-controlled Senate.
Edward L. Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, said, "We will urge that a banker be appointed -- it's very important given the tremendous role that the Fed has in bank regulation."
But Allen J. Fishbein, the general counsel at the Center for Community Change, a Washington-based advocacy and research group that focuses on issues of fair lending, said President Clinton should appoint someone who would look out for the interests of working Americans and borrowers. "This is a Federal Reserve Board that all too well reflects the banking industry's interests, whether or not they come directly out of commercial banking," he said.
There are some limits on finding an eligible banker because of a requirement that no two governors may come from the same Federal Reserve regional district. The New York and West Coast districts are already represented on the board, excluding bankers in those regions from consideration.
Early speculation in banking circles today focused on John G. Medlin Jr., the 61-year-old chairman of the Wachovia Corporation, a big regional bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C. Mr. Medlin has already announced plans to retire this year, and he is said to know both President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
Another possible nominee -- although not a banker -- is Alicia H. Munnell, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Extend a Rally On Slow Home Sales Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rallied yesterday for a second consecutive session, helped by a report on home sales that confirmed the market's view of a slowing economy.
The advance came despite a weaker dollar. A surge in the dollar helped set off the bond rally on Friday, but yesterday the dollar retreated against the German mark and other European currencies. 
 The market instead focused its attention on a sign indicating an economic slowdown. With each such report, traders and analysts are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve is closer to achieving its goal of slower economic growth and little inflation. Indeed, few market participants expect that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making committee, will raise short-term interest rates when its meets today. The Fed has raised interest rates seven times in the last 13 months.
Prices rose yesterday after the National Association of Realtors reporting that sales of existing single-family homes fell 5 percent last month to an annual rate of 3.43 million units -- the lowest level in two years. Economists had expected sales to fall 1.1 percent, to an annual rate of 3.55 million.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to 10324/3 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.31 percent, from 7.36 percent on Friday. The yield is at its lowest level since June. Shorter- maturity bill rates were mixed.
Rates at yesterday's regularly weekly bill auction dropped smartly, with a three-month bill going at an average rate of 5.64 percent, down eight basis points from last week's auction and the lowest since a rate of 5.56 percent on Dec. 27. The Treasury also sold six-month bills at an average rate of 5.80 percent, down 11 basis points from the previous auction and the lowest since Nov. 14, when the rate was 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director of ASB Capital Management, a Washington-based company managing $6 billion in bonds, said the market had a good tone yesterday. One of the reasons, he said, was a "a growing sense that the central banks of both Germany and Japan could lower their rates, thus strengthening the dollar and at the same time enhancing the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investment like Treasury securities."
Mr. Carpenter said the market's view of Federal Reserve policy had shifted sharply in recent months. A few months ago, "there was a large group of economists who thought the Fed would raise rates at the March 28 meeting, but an even larger consensus that the Fed would wait until May 23 to raise rates," he said. "Today, virtually no one believes the Fed will raise interest rates tomorrow," he added.
Indeed, there is a growing minority of traders and analysts who see the Fed's next increase happening sometime after the May meeting of the policy-making committee. The Fed committee is not scheduled to meet in April.
Susan M. Herring, an economist at Salomon Brothers, says policy makers most likely will not feel compelled to tighten further at today'smeeting, having increased rates just eight weeks ago. "If the Federal Reserve remains intent on constraining inflation, however, additional tightening likely will be required in the coming months," she said. "To be sure, the Fed's earlier efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Interest-sensitive spending by consumers has faltered, and their creditworthiness is eroding."
Today, the market will turn its attention to the Government's auction of $17.25 billion in new two-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the new two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.62 percent, while the five-year note, which will be auctioned tomorrow, was offered at a price to yield 6.89 percent. Both have shown there is good investor demand, particularly in the two-year note, whose yield has dropped more than 10 basis points since last Wednesday, when the Treasury announced the size of the auctions.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Stocks Set New Marks Amid Questions on Durability of the Rally

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks hit record levels once again yesterday, even as analysts questioned whether the rally could last.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.67 points, to 4,157.34, the eighth record in the last 12 sessions. But just five stocks accounted for all of the gains: Boeing, J. P. Morgan, American Express, International Business Machines and Caterpillar. The Dow was flat much of the day, surging in the last half-hour of trading. 
 "Today was a decidedly mediocre advance, a rush to blue chips," said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.23 points, to 503.20, also a record. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index climbed 3.97 points, to 822.63, for another record.
The stock market seemed to take little notice of an announcement by John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, that he planned to retire April 30 and would not take part in today's meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee. Mr. LaWare has been known as an advocate for raising interest rates to fight inflation.
The bond market, which is somewhat more sensitive to Fed developments, continued a morning rally after the National Association of Realtors reported a decline in home resales, another indication of a slowing low-inflation economy, which is favorable for bonds.
Most Fed watchers expect the central bank to do nothing about interest rates today.
Bond prices rose and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.31 percent from 7.36 percent, the lowest level since August.
While the Dow advanced yesterday, some analysts continued to see signs of the market slowing, much like the economy. Yesterday's gain "has all the earmarks of an aged advance," Mr. Roth said.
For one thing, he said,, mutual funds have less than 8.5 percent of their net assets in cash or its equivalent. "There is little fuel, in the form of cash in reserve, to push this market up," he said.
The other sources of money for lifting stocks, Mr. Roth said, would be money locked up in long-term bonds and from foreign investors.
But bonds continue to offer attractive interest rates and therefore it is unlikely that much money can be coaxed away from them soon, Mr. Roth said. And foreign investors are unlikely to buy United States assets unless the dollar stabilizes.
The value of the dollar is important to stocks because a fall in the dollar can wipe away any profits enjoyed by foreign investors. The Dow has risen 8.42 percent this year, but fallen 1.69 percent in terms of German marks, and dropped 2.72 percent in terms of Japanese yen.
Yesterday, the dollar was up from historic lows against the Japanese yen, rising to 89.40 yen from 88.95 yen. But it fell to 1.4050 German marks, from 1.4172 marks on Friday.
Among the large gainers yesterday was Oxford Health Plans, an insurance company, which rose 12 5/8, to 109 1/2, after a Salomon Brothers analyst rated its stock a "buy." Security Dynamics Technologies, which makes security systems for computers, rose 10 1/8, to 37 1/2, after the company said first-quarter earnings would exceed that of the fourth quarter,
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, rose 7 1/8, to 102 7/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airlines industry was showing signs of recovery.
Among the big decliners was C-COR Electronics Inc., an electronics manufacturer, which fell 3 1/4, to 19, after it said fiscal-third-quarter earnings would be lower than Wall Street expected. Shares of Presstek fell 3, to 69, after Barron's questioned whether increased competition might hurt the maker of imaging technology.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 296.3 million shares changing hands, about 10 percent below this year's daily average of 329 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.22 points, to 271.72, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,361 to 826. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.29 point, to 461.19.
The most active stock, at 8.4 million shares, was Telefonos de Mexico, which rose 1 5/8, to 29 3/8, after the Mexican peso and financial market appeared to improve.

HEADLINE: Resales of Homes Decline to a 2-Year Low

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes in February dropped to the lowest level in two years, as consumer concerns over a slower economy offset a slip in mortgage rates, a real estate trade group reported today.
 "Despite rates starting to come down some, consumers are now focused on a grim outlook in job growth," John A. Tucillo, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, said. 
 The association said that sales of existing single-family homes dropped 5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.43 million, from 3.61 million in January and 3.84 million a year earlier.
It was the lowest number of sales since a similar 3.43 million rate in March 1993. Except for a 1.9 percent gain in December, sales have not advanced since March 1994.
The Government reported earlier that housing starts also fell in February, and many analysts expect the Government to report on Wednesday that new-home sales also deteriorated in February.
Analysts attributed the weakening market in large part to rising mortgage rates. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.77 percent in February, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said. Although that was down from 9.15 percent in January, it was above the 7.15 percent of a year earlier.
The monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage at 7 percent is $665.31; the payment on the same loan at 9 percent is $804.63.
In addition to pushing up housing loans, seven short-term interest-rate increases engineered over the last 13 months by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation are leading to slower job growth in some areas.
As a result, the realtors' president, Edmund G. Woods Jr., said, "People simply don't feel good enough about job prospects or job security to buy a home."
The real estate group said that price changes had little effect on housing affordability in February. The median price of a house was $107,100, barely changed from $107,000 a year earlier.
Regionally, the Midwest had the largest loss in sales, down 7.7 percent, to an 840,000 annual rate. The median price was $86,900, up 2.1 percent from $85,100 a year earlier. Sales were off 4.3 percent, to a 1.32 million rate, in the South, where the median price was $92,500, down 2.4 percent from $94,800 in February 1994.
The Northeast posted a 3.6 percent drop in sales, to a 540,000 rate. The median price slipped four-tenths of 1 percent, to $137,100 from $137,700. In the West, sales fell 2.7 percent, to a 730,000 rate, but prices edged up six-tenths of 1 percent, to $144,100 from $143,300.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Limp Noodle

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
At least this much can be said about a new human rights initiative of the Clinton Administration: There are people in the Government who understood and argued that it was an embarrassing piece of hypocrisy, saying much, meaning nothing, fooling nobody.
They were overruled by higher authorities in the White House and National Economic Council, who actually still believe that the President can restore his reputation as a human rights leader with funny-house mirrors and without putting pressure on Communist China or its American business lobby. 
 Last year Mr. Clinton reneged on his written word to use higher tariffs on some Chinese goods as incentive to bring smidgens of human rights decency to Communist China.
So Thursday his Administration disclosed his new idea. U.S. business should institute voluntary codes of human rights principles for American corporations operating abroad.
This is supposed to satisfy Americans interested in human rights, get them and their money behind him in the Presidential campaign, and so avoid the price Presidents pay when they break their word.
Presumably Americans, Chinese Communists and tortured political prisoners in China and Tibet are all moronic enough not to notice a few realities that make the proposal just more salt in the wound.
1. It transfers entirely the political and moral responsibility for fighting for human rights in China from Washington to American business, which has already enthusiastically rejected any intention of annoying the Chinese Communists by harboring such thoughts.
2. To insure that Beijing is not irritated merely by being mentioned in context of a human rights proposal, the Administration does not mention any country. The plan is supposed to apply to the whole wide world. Un-codes for un-countries -- so diffuse that un-China need take no offense, or worry about its impact.
If catch-all declarations about human rights had any effect -- so many exist already -- China would be a huge civil liberties entertainment park. The point and purpose of human rights action is to apply specific pressure on specific tyrannies.
3. Even as the limp noodle it is, United States businesses complained that it might somehow annoy the dreaded China. So, in the lengthy code-contemplating process, the noodle was made ever limper.
4 to 100. The plan contains no provisions for economic pressure or penalties against governments and businesses that will continue saying what they have always said about human rights codes without any enforcement: Put it in your ear.
Instead, the Administration "encourages" businesses to adopt codes on fair employment practices, including "avoidance" of child and forced labor. Avoidance!
About political oppression in workplaces in Whereverland, the Administration says only that it should not be condoned, no. There are no unsettling details about how Chinese Communists openly operate within foreign-backed factories to carry out such political terrorism as harassing women workers into abortion.
Commenting on the noodle, Human Rights Watch/Asia said that given the range of abuse in countries where American companies do business, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and of course China, the "codes" would do no more good than the "hortatory" language already found in personnel manuals. History records no dictatorship frightened by a company manual.
But in Congress a bill has been introduced that would demand reports from U.S. businesses in China on what they have done to deal with specific violations of human rights affecting their workers. The sponsors are Tom Lantos and Nancy Pelosi, California Democrats, and Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey and Gerald Solomon of New York, both Republicans.
Mr. Lantos, long a human rights fighter, said in a written statement that it was "unconscionable" for American business to say that to operate in China they had no choice but to accept gross violations of human rights on their own factory floors. Mr. Lantos said the Clinton plan was "weak and ineffectual."
Over the phone he was more pithy. In seven words he summed up what I have been writing in this column.
"It makes me sick to my stomach," he said.

Dollar Moves Lower vs. Mark But Strengthens Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday, hurt by profit taking and fading hopes that the German central bank would lower interest rates.
But the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen after Japan's Finance Minister indicated he might reduce interest rates in an effort to halt the yen's rise. 
 "Traders are watching closely to see if interest rates are going to move," said Paul Farrell, head currency trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. "Much of the trading is based on speculation of what's to come."
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.4050 marks, from 1.4172 marks on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.1595 Swiss francs from 1.1740. The British pound edged up to $1.5975 from $1.5935.
But the dollar rose to 89.40 yen from 88.95 yen. The dollar moved higher against the yen after Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura of Japan indicated that rates might be lowered. He did not directly call for lower rates, but he said a cut was possible, depending on the economic conditions in coming months. Lower rates would make yen-denominated investments less attractive.
"There is really a chance that the Japanese will move the rates," Mr. Farrell said.
Japan wants a weaker yen because the currency's rise has made Japanese products more expensive and less competitive abroad.
Also helping the dollar against the yen yesterday was heavy intervention by the Bank of Japan during overnight trading in Tokyo.
"The dollar really started to rally as the Japanese central bank intervened," said Richard Vullo, vice president of the New York branch of Hypo-Bank of Germany.
The Bank of Japan has been regularly buying dollars and selling yen on currency markets in an effort to hold down the value of the yen.
After climbing to a two-week high against the mark on Friday, the dollar fell back yesterday.
The dollar was weighed down as currency dealers became increasingly skeptical that the Bundesbank would lower interest rates when its policy makers meet on Thursday.
And most analysts and dealers expect the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when its policy-making comittee meets today. Higher rates in the United States typically make dollar-denominated holdings more attractive.

HEADLINE: Mother Nature Didn't Devastate Fisheries

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report March 22 that Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts will ask President Clinton to declare his state's commercial fisheries a natural disaster. While no one would dispute the magnitude of the crisis, the devastation of Georges Bank, off Cape Cod, is not attributable to the "uncontrollable forces of nature." 
 The demise of once-rich fish populations is the consequence of a management regime rife with conflicts of interest and of the failure of fishery managers to heed warnings on overfishing.
Populations of cod, haddock, flounder and other ground fish in New England waters have been declining since the early 1980's.
Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that excessive fishing pressure was undermining the long-term health of the Georges Bank fishery, the New England Fishery Management Council refused to impose conservation measures. As a result, a fishery that ought to contribute $350 million annually to the region's economy is today virtually shut down.
While we recognize the need to provide assistance to individuals and families who will suffer as a result of the mismanagement, this should not be accomplished under the guise of natural disaster relief. Other avenues are available.
For example, Congress last year provided more than $30 million to bail out the New England fishing industry, and the Commerce Department has embarked on a $2 million pilot program to buy back excess fishing vessels. In this time of fiscal austerity we need to focus on the biggest problem confronting New England's fisheries: an overcapitalized fleet.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 27

 BODY:
A string of storms, floods and fires and the Los Angeles earthquake rocked property-casualty insurers last year and cut the industry's profit in half, a trade group said today.
The combined earnings for the insurers fell 47.7 percent, to $10.1 billion, last year from $19.3 billion in 1993, according to the Insurance Information Institute. 
 "Last year was the second-worst year on record for catastrophes," said Sean Mooney, senior vice president and economist at the institute, which released the figures.
The insurance companies paid out $15.7 billion, still less than the $23 billion in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida and parts of Louisiana in the costliest United States natural disaster on record.
The biggest single factor causing last year's decline was the earthquake on Jan. 17, 1994, near Los Angeles, now estimated to cost the industry $11.4 billion, he said.
The tropical storms Beryl, Alberto and Gordon accounted for another $235 million in losses, while above-normal levels of flooding, snow and wind damage pushed the overall losses even higher.
The figures were compiled by the Insurance Services Office and the National Association of Independent Insurers and are consolidated estimates for the entire industry based on the reports of insurers that account for 96 percent of the country's property and casualty insurance business.
The industry's pretax operating income of $10.7 billion in 1994 was 26.5 percent lower than 1993's $14.6 percent. The operating income includes a pretax underwriting loss of $22.4 billion and pretax net investment income of $33.0 billion.

Injunction Hearing Set; Clubs Offer New Plan

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In the most active day-night doubleheader baseball may see all year, a Federal judge yesterday scheduled a hearing for Friday on a request for an injunction that the players say would end their seven-and-a-half-month strike, and the owners last night presented the players union with a new proposal they believe should end the strike.
"We're very pleased the judge will have an opportunity to render a decision prior to the start of the season if she chooses to," said Daniel Silverman, director of the National Labor Relations Board's New York office, who filed the injunction request yesterday afternoon in United States District Court in Manhattan. 
 Judge Sonia Sotomayor scheduled a hearing for 10 A.M. Friday, giving the two sides time to submit briefs tomorrow and Thursday.
"I won't decide until Thursday if I'm going to have oral arguments or live testimony," she said. Sotomayor instructed the owners' lawyers to submit their papers by 5 P.M. tomorrow, "concentrating on whether the Sunday deadline is significant."
The judge referred to the scheduled start of the season Sunday night. The owners basically made that a deadline, too. Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, repeatedly declined to characterize the new proposal as nonnegotiable, but his answers to questions at a news conference left that impression.
"We have said to them," Selig said at a Manhattan hotel, "with the economics changing on a daily basis for both parties, if this offer isn't accepted by this weekend, it's hard for us to estimate what may happen after that. The economics are changing and getting more negative on a daily basis."
Union representatives did not appear at the news conference, and the only officials who could be reached, Donald Fehr and Gene Orza, declined to comment.
The proposal, however, did not seem to be one the union would leap to accept. It was an improvement over the proposal the owners made at the last bargaining session, March 4 in Scottsdale, Ariz., but it still contained elements the union is virtually certain to reject.
First on the union's rejection list would be the payroll tax -- 50 percent on the portion of payrolls above $44 million, beginning in 1996. The threshold was up from $40.7 million, but the tax rate remained the same, double the 25 percent the players proposed with a payroll threshold of $54 million.
Furthermore, the tax would be in effect for the last five years of a six-year agreement, whereas the union has proposed ending any payroll tax after three years.
The players would continue to see the tax as having the same effect as a salary cap. Eleven clubs had payrolls greater than $44 million in 1994, and the union believes a 50 percent tax would force clubs to reduce their payrolls to the threshold to avoid paying taxes.
The owners made more significant improvement on salary arbitration and free agency. They offered alternative plans -- the same arbitration and free-agency systems that existed under the expired agreement but with some modifications, or unrestricted free agency for players after four years (down from six) and the elimination of arbitration for other eligible players after 1996.
One of the changes under the first alternative would be a three-man arbitration panel for each case in place of the one-arbitrator system that has always been in effect.
When Selig was asked if the proposal was subject to negotiation, he said: "I don't want to get into that. We strained to make this offer. They know they have this offer. They have to accept it by Saturday or Sunday."
The Mets are scheduled to play the Florida Marlins in the opening game Sunday night, and they will do that with substitutes for the striking players barring a development either in court or at the bargaining table that would prompt the owners to delay the start of the season.
The players have said they will return to work if the N.L.R.B. gains an injunction forcing the clubs to restore salary arbitration and competitive bidding for free agents. The owners, who have said they do not want to play this season under the previous work rules, would then have to decide whether to lock out the returning players. They would need the votes of 21 of the 28 teams to do so.
There has also been talk among people on both sides that the players might offer to end their strike even if the the injunction request is denied.
"I doubt if that will be the subject of much discussion," Fehr, the players' labor leader, said of the latter possibility, alluding to meetings of the union's negotiating subcommittee tonight and the executive board tomorrow. "If the injunction doesn't issue, we'll worry about what to do after that."
When the two sides resumed bargaining last night after a 23-day hiatus, no one expected the new round of talks to lead to a dramatic 11th-hour settlement that would render court action unnecessary.
The owners' lawyers indicated no interest in having a ruling by Sotomayor before the start of the season, or any time, for that matter. Frank Casey, representing the clubs, raised points in a 30-minute hearing that appeared to be aimed at muddying the issues before the judge.
He said a grievance filed by the union last Friday contending that all unsigned roster players are free agents eliminates the need for the court to rule on the labor board's charge that the owners have eliminated salary arbitration. He also said the clubs did not understand the board's charge that they had eliminated bidding for free agents.
"We simply do not know what they are talking about; we need discovery," Casey told the judge, referring to information two sides in a court case seek before proceeding with the case.
Casey, in court, and Chuck O'Connor, outside court, emphasized the owners' view that an injunction would not affect the strike.
"Under Federal labor law, what happens in this proceeding has nothing to do with the strike," Casey said.
After the hearing, O'Connor, the chief management labor lawyer, echoed the argument. "The N.L.R.B. should decide the issues first, not the court," he said. "There is nothing this court will do to end the strike. If the union wants to end the strike at some point, it will do so. The court will not impact that directly -- maybe indirectly."
But Casey and O'Connor ignored the union's stated stance about ending the strike. They were trying to make the point that only a negotiated settlement will end the dispute.
But Silverman said the labor board thought it was necessary to eliminate the changes the owners made unilaterally last month on salary arbitration and free agency.
"If the players will go back to work under the terms that existed prior to these changes, the season can progress," he said. "We believe the elimination of these conditions will permit the parties to end the dispute themselves."
In three previous labor disputes, the owners have locked the players out. If the players offered to end the strike and the owners locked them out, it would be the first time the clubs would have taken that step while using replacement players. Court rulings have permitted the use of replacements during a lockout, but it is not clear whether there could be circumstances under which an employer would not be permitted to take that dual action.
Among those who have appeared before her during her two and a half years on the Federal bench, Sotomayor, at 40 years old the youngest of the 38 judges in the district, has a reputation for being thorough and deliberate. She is not likely to be rushed if she feels she needs more time to make the correct decision.
She did not display any particular reaction to having the celebrated baseball dispute land in her courtroom. "I know nothing about this," she said, "except what the common layperson reads in The New York Times."

HEADLINE: Nigeria Accused of a 2-Year War on Ethnic Group

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: AMINIGBOKO, Nigeria, March 24

 BODY:
Two years ago, when a handful of villages were destroyed and residents began fleeing a wave of killings in the oil-producing Niger River Delta country near this small town, the Government and refugees gave starkly different explanations of the violence.
For Nigeria's military authorities, the killings were an example of the kind of inter-ethnic hatred that has long afflicted the overcrowded farming and fishing lands of this region, and occasionally exploded in tribal violence. 
 For the Ogoni people, however, a mostly poor 500,000-member ethnic group that shares its lands near the outlet of the Niger River with the work crews and rigs of foreign oil companies, the violence was clearly the work of soldiers bent on silencing their protests over their tiny share of the revenues generated by some of the continent's richest petroleum fields.
Now, in the first independent accounting of the two-year rash of violence in Nigeria's oil-producing southeast, Human Rights Watch says it has collected the accounts of both victims and participants in attacks on the Ogoni.
In a report published this week that largely corroborates the victims' claims, Human Rights Watch, based in New York, says Nigeria's military has conducted what amounts to a two-year war against the Ogoni that has involved repeated attacks on Ogoni hamlets, shooting of unarmed villagers, gang rapes of women and burning of homes.
In one of the worst of the attacks, in May 1993, according to the report, a Nigerian soldier said his company had been told they were being sent to repel an incursion by troops from neighboring Cameroon.
"When we arrived, they told us to shoot everyone who crossed our path," a Nigerian soldier who took part in the attack on an Ogoni village told Human Rights Watch. "I followed my orders until I realized that the approaching civilians were Nigerians."
The accounts of army-led drives against the Ogoni come at a time of growing calls, in Nigeria and abroad, for sanctions to isolate the dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha.
At the heart of the campaign of violence, residents of the delta region say, is a conflict that has pitted the interests of the Ogoni against the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. For years the Ogoni have been at the forefront of demands by many of Nigeria's ethnic minorities that the Government do more to protect their environment and share more revenue with oil-producing lands in the southeast.
The Ogoni, in addition to accusing Shell of destroying their lands, say the company has ordered army reprisals or provided support in the form of money and intelligence to the military in its campaign against them.
Shell officials at the company's sprawling operational headquarters for eastern Nigeria in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers state, deny both assertions, saying they have voluntarily withdrawn from Ogoni areas.
"I have made it quite clear that we are not prepared to spill one drop of blood, even for a million barrels," said Egbert Imomoh, a Shell general manager. "We are not in a hurry, and will return only when we are welcome."
At the same time, however, officials of Shell Nigeria say the company's conflict with the Ogoni is spreading to other ethnic groups in the region who harbor many of the same complaints against the company. Shell says that in several areas of the Niger Delta its equipment has been sabotaged and its workers have been taken hostage.
Nigeria's military Government has repeatedly denied any involvement in reported atrocities in Ogoniland, ascribing any killings to local conflicts and terrorism by the Ogoni themselves.
Last May, in what Nigerian and international human rights groups describe as a politically inspired frame-up, the authorities arrested Ken Saro-Wiwa, an Ogoni who is one of Nigeria's most distinguished writers, on charges he had killed Ogoni leaders.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa, who has been held in military jails since his arrest and deprived of visits for most of that time, is being tried for the murders before a military-run tribunal in Port Harcourt.
James Ron, a Human Rights Watch researcher who spent three weeks investigating military abuses, said that after the killings of four conservative Ogoni leaders for which Mr. Saro-Wiwa was accused, "soldiers moved in and just began shooting people in their villages, burning their homes and arresting young Ogoni men en masse."
"When the Government began its attacks, it looked at first as if they were looking for the killers, but they conducted themselves as if they were leading a punitive expedition," Mr. Ron said. "If some people were interrogated, many of the detainees were simply mistreated. Young Ogoni men were flogged twice a day, and there was an effort by the soldiers to extract as much money from the detainees as possible. People were told that unless their families came up with large amounts of money they would not be released."
Mr. Ron, who was allowed to enter Ogoniland for one day with a military escort, said he and another colleague had only been able to interview many of the victims in secret after they were brought out of their homeland by trusted messengers.
Since the start of the attacks on the Ogoni, access to their villages has been effectively closed to outsiders by Nigerian security forces. Throughout this region, the police and soldiers maintain heavily armed roadblocks where menacing men in uniform wave automatic weapons as they systematically stop vehicles for searches and interrogations.
Human Rights Watch was allowed to tour the region with military escorts, but during a three-week investigation was able to arrange clandestine meetings with several Ogoni victims, as well as with four soldiers who separately gave their accounts of army-led attacks on Ogoni villages.
Military officials and Shell managers warned of "trouble" should foreign reporters seek to enter Ogoni areas.
Nigeria has increasingly become the focus in recent weeks of international human rights critics. They have reproached General Abacha's 18-month-old Government for wave after wave of arrests of political opponents, union leaders and, most recently, one of the country's former Presidents, Olusegun Obansanjo. In 1979 General Obasanjo became the first Nigerian leader since independence in 1960 to voluntarily surrender power after democratic elections.
The Washington-based lobby TransAfrica warned Nigeria this month that it was preparing to mount a "global campaign of economic and political isolation" to force General Abacha to restore democratic rule.
Petroleum production accounts for 80 percent of Nigeria's Government revenue. Nigeria exports between 60 and 90 percent of its oil, a lightweight, or "sweet," crude considered ideal for gasoline production, to the United States. Shell, which generates about half of this country's output, is by far Nigeria's largest producer.
For years villagers have complained that Shell's operations have poisoned their once-rich croplands and devastated the wetlands of the Niger River Delta, which form the world's largest mangrove swamp. At the same time, residents of these oil-producing zones have complained that together, Shell and the Nigerian Government have done little to develop the area.
"The problems of the oil areas can be summed up as irreversible destruction of the environment," said William Odiete, a chemist at the University of Lagos who has studied oil-related ecological damage in Nigeria. "The inhabitants are becoming more and more impoverished because their farmlands, rivers and vegetation is dying."
Flying over Ogoni territory in a Shell company helicopter, the devastation of the last two years can be seen in the burned and badly tarred fields around damaged oil installations. Unlike other areas of the Delta, automobile traffic is almost nonexistent and many villages seem barren and abandoned.
Even more than environmental damage, though, what most strikes many visitors to this area is its lack of development. While gas flares that from a distance resemble giant bonfires burn off millions of cubic feet of natural gas, most of the rural world here remains without electricity or other modern amenities.
"In Nigeria, companies like Shell are struggling between greed and fear," said Claude Ake, director of the Center for Advanced Social Science, a Nigerian social and environmental research center in Port Harcourt. "Because of their behavior, moderates are losing ground in our communities, and Shell will have to think if one day they will be able to afford to protect each and every one of their workers."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
2 California Health Care Providers Agree to a $1.8 Billion Merger

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Two big California health maintenance organizations, Wellpoint Health Networks and Health Systems International have agreed to a $1.8 billion stock swap that would create the biggest stockholder-owned H.M.O. in the lucrative California market and the fifth largest in the country, people close to the deal said yesterday.
The companies said Wellpoint was "in discussions" to buy Health Systems. Health Systems stockholders would receive 1.09 shares of Wellpoint common stock for each Health Systems share and a proportionate share of $1.2 billion in cash. 
 The combined company would have a stock market valuation exceeding $4 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Wellpoint jumped $5, to a 52-week high of $36, on the news yesterday, before falling back to $33.75, up $2.75; Health Systems' class A shares rose $1.375, to $32.375.
The combined company would have about one-sixth of California's 12 million H.M.O. enrollees, Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said. With that kind of size, it could drive hard bargains with doctors and hospitals in the hotly competitive California market.
H.M.O.'s also need to grow to make up for lower profit margins. Employers, led by the California Public Employees Retirement Systems, or Calpers, have driven down the premiums the health maintenance organizations get by 3 percent per enrollee, Mr. Abramowitz said.
Wellpoint had put itself up for sale, but it rejected takeover offers from Blue Shield of California, a nonprofit mutual insurance company, and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations.
Wellpoint and Health Systems said their merger plan would "offer distinct advantages in terms of long-term stockholder value, strategic fit, operational synergies and the probability of closing" the deal.
Spokesmen for Blue Shield and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts declined to comment, and it was not clear if either company would make a new offer or contest the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal.
"We are very very far along in the process" of completing the deal, Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman and chief executive of Wellpoint, said in a telephone interview. The boards of Health Systems and Blue Cross of California, which owns 80 percent of Wellpoint, met yesterday to go over the fine print. All three companies are based in Woodland Hills, Calif.
Any deal is subject to approval by Gary S. Mendoza, the California commissioner of corporations. He said his department and its Wall Street adviser, Bear, Stearns & Company, were "reviewing the situation."
Wellpoint and Health Systems said they would turn over $1.2 billion in cash and about $2 billion in stock to a California philanthropic foundation -- a move that they hope will placate consumer groups and persuade Mr. Mendoza to approve the deal. Consumer advocates have objected to any privatization of the nonprofit California Blue Cross.
The foundation, which would be one of the nation's five or six biggest philanthropies, would get $1 billion of the $1.2 billion cash from Health Systems and $200 million more from the sale of certain businesses by Blue Cross to Health Systems. Wellpoint's public shareholders would divide $200 million.
Health Systems has 1.25 million California enrollees in health maintenance organizations and 300,000 in seven other states. It recently acquired M. D. Enterprises, a Connecticut H.M.O., for $100 million. Wellpoint has 700,000 H.M.O. enrollees and 2 million people in more loosely organized managed health plans called preferred provider organizations.
Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit company, is the nation's largest H.M.O., with 4.7 million California enrollees and 6.7 million nationwide. The Wellpoint-Health Systems merger would be the second largest in California. Other big H.M.O.'s in the state include Pacificare with 1.1 million enrollees, FHP International with 900,000 and Foundation Health with 700,000, Mr. Abramowitz said.
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts offered a fully financed buyout valued in the high $30's a share, people close to the deal said. They said Blue Shield offered $40 and then raised it to $45. But, they added, Blue Shield had not lined up financing. They also said that Blue Shield, as a mutual insurance company owned by policyholders, would need approval from Mr. Mendoza's Department of Corporations to convert to a for-profit company. That could subject Blue Shield to political challenges by consumers, similar to those faced by Blue Cross and Wellpoint.
In the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal, Mr. Schaeffer would be chief executive. Dr. Malik M. Hasan, chairman of Health Systems, would become chairman and a major owner, with about 6 percent of the shares.
Dr. Hasan merged a Colorado-based company, Qual-Med, with Healthnet last year to form Health Systems International. Like Wellpoint, Healthnet was originally part of Blue Cross of California; thus, it has products and computer systems that are compatible with those of Wellpoint.
The Healthnet unit is tangled in litigation with the state Department of Corporations and shareholders who have challenged the terms under which the company transferred ownership to a foundation, the California Wellness Foundation.
In the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal, the Wellness foundation would have nonvoting shares valued at about 25 percent of the new company. The foundation to be set up in the merger would have voting control with 53 percent of the votes and about 43 percent of the economic equity.
The negotiations generated a feast for investment bankers and lawyers. The Wellpoint and Blue Cross boards created committees of outside directors to weigh the offers. Morgan Stanley advised the Wellpoint committee. Goldman, Sachs advised the Blue Cross committee. Merrill Lynch advised the Wellpoint company, and Furman Selz advised Blue Cross.
Late last year, the Foundation Health Corporation and the FHP International Corporation made separate offers to buy Health Systems International, which rejected the offers as too low. Both offers were withdrawn last January.

HEADLINE: Housing Voucher Test in Maryland Is Scuttled by a Political Firestorm

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
The theory was elegant, the outcome anything but.
The idea was that by scattering one or two poor families in large middle-income areas, they would disappear like salt crystals in a glass of water, quietly integrating themselves into communities where they would find more jobs, better schools and safer streets. 
 Instead, a national program that was intended to spend $234 million over two years to move 6,200 poor families to better neighborhoods unleashed a firestorm of protest here over race and class even before any of these families were moved.
As a result, financing for the second year of the program was canceled and Federal officials were left reeling from what could serve as a case study of how failing to lay the groundwork for a program that involves race and class can undercut an experiment.
"Primarily, we learned not to offer a program like this during an election year, when people are looking for a wedge issue and are not above frightening people with questions of race," said Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "Secondly, we need to put this into perspective for the community so we can get the correct information out there instead of having the picture painted incorrectly by someone else."
The opposition was started by citizens in several blue-collar towns east of Baltimore who feared that their neighborhoods would be inundated by poor blacks from the public housing projects in the city. The residents were quickly joined by local politicians. Eventually Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who is chairwoman of a subcommittee that oversees HUD, doomed the program. She said she had not responded to political pressure but she also said the program had become too controversial.
The program was begun in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Baltimore, but only in Baltimore were any families, only a handful of them, actually moved. They will be the last.
Margery Turner, deputy assistant secretary for research, evaluation and monitoring at HUD, said it was "a sad, discouraging experience." But she still expresses some hope for the idea. "But it's important not to be diverted by short-term flare-ups," she said. "I have a strong, perhaps naive faith in the ultimate power of information."
The program, called Moving to Opportunity, was one of a number of voucher programs. Currently, 1.3 million families receive a total of $7 billion in housing vouchers and the Clinton Administration hopes to substitute this overall concept for all Federal housing programs eventually. In general the Republicans in Congress, too, favor a voucher approach, but they balked at one that involved intrusions into wealthier neighborhoods.
Moving to Opportunity is one of the sharpest departures from decades of Federal housing policy, which had isolated the poor in pockets of poverty and violence.
The program sought to use vouchers to help poor families move to middle-class neighborhoods. It was modeled on a desegregation program in Chicago, the Gautreaux program, which was ordered by Federal courts two decades ago. During that time, the program has moved several thousand families, and has been credited with raising incomes and drastically lowering school dropout rates among the children.
Moving to Opportunity was not intended to be a desegregation program as such, but Mr. Cisneros said he expected it to combat what he called the "spatial segregation" that has resulted from the concentration of poor blacks, especially those in public housing, in center cities. Though 61 percent of the poor in the United States are white, they are not compressed in what Senator Mikulski calls "zip codes of pathology." Only 12 percent of poor whites live in poor neighborhoods in Maryland compared with 75 percent of the poor blacks.
Some sociologists and urban policy experts say that dispersing some poor to middle-income neighborhoods not only benefits the families, but also spreads the fiscal burden of social programs more equitably between city and suburbs. But others note that voucher programs like Moving to Opportunity cannot be the sole solution to the problems of poverty and that at some point the available housing runs out.
Officials are under some pressure to find alternatives to urban housing projects from a spate of lawsuits against HUD and local housing authorities complaining about racial segregation. The most recent one was filed here in Baltimore in January by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland. Court-ordered programs in Chicago, Dallas, Cincinnati, Memphis and Boston have spurred programs that have succeeded in helping low-income families escape ghettoes.
Some have started without much opposition. Karla Irvine, executive director of Housing Opportunity Made Equal, said the 12-year program, has successfully placed 900 families in the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
"People are so spread out that we've had very few racial problems," Ms. Irvine said. "We certainly haven't had any angry crowds like in Baltimore."
Here in Baltimore and in the other cities, the Government hoped to duplicate the achievements of the Gautreaux program and document the results by tracking participants for 10 years.
For Robin Dudley, the benefits of the program are already evident. Living in a modest town house in a Baltimore suburb, Mrs. Dudley, a single parent, said she had already seen changes in her three children, Gerrard, 9, Lachaye, 7, and Latish, 4. They liked school and were eager to explore this new green and quiet neighborhood after the crack-infested neighborhood that kept them indoors in Baltimore.
"I was scared to move, scared that there might be prejudice, but I was ready," said Mrs. Dudley, an unemployed high school graduate.
Admirers of the project say the circumstances here were unique. They note that there had been no incidents in Boston, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. But critics contend that housing vouchers, by their very nature, are slated to generate controversy.
"It runs counter to the social structure of American neighborhoods, which are stratified along social, economic and education levels that people have worked to attain," said Henry Husock, a voucher opponent and director of case studies in public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
Federal officials say they failed to educate the white working-class communities near Baltimore about the program. The opposition began in blue-collar areas like Essex and Dundalk east of Baltimore.
The residents there believed that the program meant that Baltimore would tear down its public housing projects. People envisioned Baltimore's 18,000 public housing tenants, who are predominantly black, being dumped in their overwhelmingly white backyards. In an area that had already suffered the loss of a steel plant, the idea of black welfare families being subsidized to move into their neighborhoods was untenable.
"When I found about what the program would do, I thought people should know," said Jerry Hersl, a resident of the area who led the crusade against Moving to Opportunity. "The program wasn't to give people in public housing a hand up to move up, but make them equal right off the bat."
The program also ended up, during an election year, being a frequent topic on talk radio.
During one such program, Louis L. De Pazzo, a State Delegate from Baltimore County and at the time a Democratic candidate for the County Council, warned that the county would be flooded with thousands of inner city people who would have "to be taught to take baths and not steal."
E. Farrell Maddox, former chairman of Baltimore County's House delegation, said that while housing vouchers had some value he still opposed them.
"I don't think we should get into social engineering and that's what they do," he said.
Oddly what was lost in all the shouting was the fact that places like Essex and Dundalk are too poor themselves to have been picked as destinations in the program.

HEADLINE: Dr. James Coleman, 68, Dies; Work Helped to Foster Busing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Dr. James S. Coleman, the renowned University of Chicago sociologist whose controversial studies laid much of the groundwork for and against the use of busing to desegregate schools in the 1960's and 1970's, and later helped shape American education policies by comparing public and private schools, died on Saturday at the University of Chicago Hospital. He was 68.
Dr. Coleman died of prostate cancer, said William Harms, a spokesman for the University of Chicago, where Dr. Coleman had spent much of his career as a teacher, researcher and author. Since 1973, he had been University Professor of Sociology. 
 In an academic and public life that spanned four decades, Dr. Coleman wrote 30 books and hundreds of articles, developed important theories on social change and collective action and widely influenced the course of education in America. But he was also drawn into many heated professional and political controversies.
In a 1966 report to Congress based on an extensive study of the performance of students in public schools, Dr. Coleman concluded that disadvantaged black children learned better in integrated classes, and his findings became a manual for political and court actions and were widely used to support busing to achieve racial balance in public schools.
In some cities, anger over busing and other desegregation efforts led to violent clashes among proponents and opponents and disputes over the policy continued for years, with much credit or blame ascribed to Dr. Coleman. Lost in the controversy were many caveats he had posed, including that black children could learn better only when mixed with a majority of middle-class children.
In 1975, Dr. Coleman apparently reversed himself, finding in another study that busing had been a failure because, he said, it had prompted a massive departure of whites from public schools, and he concluded that this "white flight" had undermined the aim of increasing contact among the races in public schools.
The second study generated enormous uproars among government policy makers, civil rights leaders, experts in education, sociologists and parents. Critics disputed his data, saying that white flight had begun long before busing, and attacked his motives, saying he had abandoned his commitment to desegregation.
But supporters contended that many of the critics were themselves motivated by racial politics, not educational facts, that Dr. Coleman had simply reported his scientific findings and that he had demonstrated courage in changing his mind when the new data dictated that he do so.
"Exceptional ability, fertile imagination and the courage to go against received opinion and to bear sometimes vicious attacks marked his distinguished career," Gary Becker, a professor of economics and sociology at the University of Chicago, said yesterday.
Dr. Becker recalled that some prominent members of the American Sociological Association moved to have Dr. Coleman expelled for his 1975 work. "It was not a fashionable or pleasant scientific finding," he said. "Fortunately for the integrity of the association, the move to expel him failed." Dr. Coleman was elected president of the association in 1991.
In 1981, another study by Dr. Coleman concluded that private and Catholic schools provided a better education than public schools. When another uproar ensued, he drew back from his findings, saying that the data were flawed and that his report did not emphasize the most significant issues. He said the new study did not prove any inherent superiority of private schools, only that they were more likely to stress things like discipline, homework and high standards. Dr. Coleman's study, "The High School and Beyond," is said to be the largest American survey ever conducted on the effects of schooling. It is a continuing research project that examines the lives and careers of 75,000 people who were sophomores and seniors in high schools in 1980.
In his 1990 book, "Foundations of Social Theory," which he considered his most important work in sociology, Dr. Coleman examined the formation and behavior of communities -- "natural" ones, like towns, based on geography and the decisions of ordinary people to live in them, versus "artificial" communities, like corporations or trade unions, in which people are grouped around objectives.
The book explores the use of rational choice by individuals -- long the basis for studies in economics -- as the basis for reviewing the way institutions are run and communities are structured, and shows how individual choices are affected by social norms, peer pressure and other factors.
James Samuel Coleman was born in Bedford, Ind., on May 12, 1926, and grew up there and in Louisville, Ky. He received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1949 from Purdue University, but switched fields in graduate school and earned a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University in 1955.
He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1956 and taught there until 1959, when he joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University to found its Department of Social Relations. He was a professor and department chairman at Johns Hopkins until 1973, when he returned to the University of Chicago.
Dr. Coleman is survived by his wife, Zdzislawa Walaszek; four sons, Thomas, of Greenwich, Conn., John, of Madison, Wis., Stephen, of Baltimore, Md., and Daniel, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
MERGER TO CREATE NEW JAPAN BANK, WORLD'S LARGEST

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 28

 BODY:
Two of Japan's most powerful financial institutions, the Bank of Tokyo and the Mitsubishi Bank, announced today that they planned a merger creating the world's largest bank. With about $819 billion in assets, the new bank would be about a third larger than the Sumitomo Bank, now the biggest with $604 billion, and more than three times the size of Citicorp, the largest in the United States.
If the deal goes through, the new behemoth, tentatively called the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, would combine two of the strongest banks in Japan, where the banking industry has been shaken in recent years by the collapse of the country's stock and real estate markets. 
 Some experts see this deal, whose terms were not disclosed today, as the possible forerunner of other large combinations of Japanese banks, many of which are either looking for fresh capital or a strategic alliance to help them compete.
But analysts said the merger would have little impact on banking and trading markets outside of Japan. Japanese banks, after all, have been the largest in the world for a decade but they are by no means as influential as such big European and American banks as Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and J. P. Morgan & Company.
"These are markets with lots of players," said John D. Leonard, a bank stock analyst with Salomon Brothers in London. "One more or less will not make a difference."
The merger could have some impact, however, on consumers and small businesses in California, where Mitsubishi and the Bank of Tokyo each own medium-sized banks based in San Francisco. The Bank of Tokyo owns about 70 percent of the Union Bank, which has $17 billion in assets and 200 branches. Mitsubishi owns all of the Bank of California, which has about $7 billion in assets and 50 branches.
While these California-based banks could be combined as a result of the merger announced today -- strengthening Union's position as the fourth largest in the state -- such a deal would face regulatory scrutiny in the United States. For that reason, some analysts say, one of the California banks could wind up being sold.
In Japan, the proposed merger of Mitsubishi and the Bank of Tokyo radically alters the banking landscape. The union, which had been talked about for years, would link the Bank of Tokyo's strong global presence with Mitsubishi's extensive domestic branch network.
"It's like marrying the two most beautiful people in the world," said Alicia Ogawa, a bank stock analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.
Mitsubishi, which was founded in 1880 and is now ranked sixth in the world, is one of several companies that make up the loosely knit Mitsubishi corporate group. The others in the group -- whose name loosely translated means three diamonds, the shape of its corporate symbol -- include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Motors. The Mitsubishi Bank has the reputation of being among the most prestigious and conservative of Japanese banks and is sometimes referred to as the J. P. Morgan of Japan.
The Bank of Tokyo, the world's 24th-largest bank, has traditionally been the most international of Japan's banks. Its precursor, the Yokohama Specie Bank, which also dates back to 1880, was so close to the emperor that it served for a time as the main conduit between an isolated Japan and the outside world. But the Bank of Tokyo's distinctive international role has been reduced in recent years as Mitsubishi and others have increased their foreign presence.
After a trail of "no comments" and denials earlier in the day, the presidents of the two banks sat shoulder to shoulder tonight to declare their intention to merge.
"As bank presidents, we frequently met in various occasions, including drinking sessions, and we exchanged opinions and we found we had sympathies with one another," said Tsuneo Wakai, president of Mitsubishi.
Although they refused to reveal which side initiated the deal -- and declined to describe its financial terms -- they suggested that they both endorsed the idea from the start.
"I had come to think that a new image of the bank was necessary," said Tasuku Takagaki, president of the Bank of Tokyo. "I came to think that if we could work together, we could make an interesting bank."
The Ministry of Finance and the Fair Trade Commission both appeared to welcome the news, suggesting that they would not block the merger, which the two banks say they hope to complete before April 1996. The ministry has recently endorsed rescue mergers that would bring together a strong institution with one of the many weaker banks suffering from a heavy burden of sour debt.
Bad real estate loans have plagued the banking industry in Japan, since the collapse of the "bubble" economy in the early 90's depressed prices and made it impossible for many companies to repay loans for real estate projects. Analysts say that problem loans -- on which interest has not been paid for six months -- amount to nearly $150 billion.
Yet both the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi have a relatively small amount of bad loans, as a percentage of their loans outstanding.
"Both are star performers in terms of writing off bad debt," said Rie Ota, an analyst at Barings Securities (Japan) Ltd.
So the proposed deal is startling in that it will create an exceptionally strong bank to compete against a group of large ailing banks, and it is likely to shake up the banking community in Japan even further.
"This is a superbank," said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Smith New Court Securities (Japan) Ltd. "It shows that the stronger can be stronger."
Immediately, speculation focused on other potential merger candidates. The share price of the Fuji Bank, a strong institution, rose 300 yen to close at 2,050 yen ($23.06) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Another candidate, the Sanwa Bank, saw its share price rise 260 yen, to 1,900 yen ($21.37). A third candidate is the Asahi Bank, the product of the most recent major bank merger, in 1991.
While the terms of the merger were not disclosed. Mr. Yamada suggested that the target share prices in the merger, which is expected to occur with an exchange of stock, would be 2,400 yen to 2,500 yen ($27 to $28.12) for Mitsubishi and 1,500 yen ($16.87) for the Bank of Tokyo. Trading in Mitsubishi and Bank of Tokyo stock was suspended after news about the merger leaked out, but their share prices rose earlier on rumors of the deal, with Mitsubishi rising 160 yen to close at 2,150 yen ($24.18), and the Bank of Tokyo rising 150 yen to end at 1,400 yen ($15.75).
Mr. Yamada said, however, that while the proposed deal might precipitate some mergers it would not begin an explosion of activity. That is partly because there are not that many banks to merge, he noted. Japan has only 150, compared with about 11,000 in the United States.
The Japanese banks, broadly, have been shrinking their overseas activities, returning capital to Japan, in part because of the rising yen and in part because the capital is needed to deal with loan losses at home. This merger is not in itself likely to reverse that trend, analysts said.
"As long as the dollar stays weak, it's hard to convince the Japanese to put money overseas," said Robin Monro-Davis, managing director of IBCA Ltd., a credit-rating agency in London. He said he doubted that the merged bank would use its bulk to buy large commercial or investment banks in the United States or Europe. "It will be a long time before the Japanese banks will make major acquisitions in the States," he said.
Although the Bank of Tokyo had indicated for years that it was looking for a match -- and a good yen deposit base to compensate for its weak presence in Japan -- many analysts said they believed that Mitsubishi stood to gain more from the merger.
Mitsubishi would gain the right, for example, to borrow money by issuing medium-term fixed-rate bonds, a privilege currently available only to certain banks, including the Bank of Tokyo.
"It's a great capital play for Mitsubishi," said Elizabeth L. Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
In a purchase essentially orchestrated by the Government, Mitsubishi recently acquired the ailing Nippon Trust Bank. That will hurt Mitsubishi's profits and drain capital.
Mergers in Japan do not necessarily result in big layoffs. Thus, it is unclear exactly where or whether substantial costs would be cut in Japan.
Japanese banks have not been shy, however, about laying off foreign staff members. A combined Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank would be able to achieve some savings by merging trading and banking operations in various world financial centers. And there is substantial overlap in their two California subsidiaries.
Yet a merger of the California banks is not assured because Union Bank is partly owned by the public. Federal regulators would need to be assured that the terms of any merger would be fair to Union's shareholders. As a result, the Japanese banks may delay any decision on the fate of the California subsidiaries and may instead choose to sell one of them, rather than attempt a combination, analysts said.
"For the folks back in Tokyo, what they decide to do in California is not a page 1 priority," said Thomas F. Theurkauf, a bank stock analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. "The two banks represent 3 percent of the assets of the new bank."
The biggest issue for Mitsubishi and the Bank of Tokyo will be melding two venerable but different cultures as well as two well-entrenched bureaucracies, analysts said.
"On paper, it looks like a great team-up," said J. Brian Waterhouse at James Capel Pacific Ltd. "But I've strong doubts in terms of how it will work. Each has a strong corporate culture and in any merger of two very large organizations, it never goes as smoothly as planned."

HEADLINE: Major Ethnic Changes Under Way

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
New York City's white population, which made up more than 60 percent of the residents in the city in 1970, will decline to 35 percent by the end of the century, predicts a new forecast by the City Planning Department.
By contrast, the Hispanic population is projected to grow substantially by the year 2000, the study says, surpassing the black population for the first time.
The study, based on projections of birthrates and migration from the 1980's, provides a rough sketch of what the racial mixture is most likely to be. 
 The real numbers may be different if trends in the 1990's vary from those of the 80's, but planners said it was clear that Hispanic people, principally Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, and nonwhite ethnic groups would have a much larger role in politics and economics.
"The city is headed in the direction of more diversity," the director of the population division, Joseph Salvo, said. "We're going to see much more of a balance of the major groups."
The study predicts that the overall population will increase slightly in the 90's, to 7.48 million from 7.32 million. The city is projected to lose 559,000 non-Hispanic white people, but expects to gain 391,000 people with Hispanic backgrounds, 101,000 blacks and 233,000 of other ethnicities, mostly Asian.
One surprising finding, Mr. Salvo said, was diversity in patterns among the major groups. Each of the four has a distinctly different mixture of births, deaths and comings and goings.
Hispanic people, for example, have high birthrates and immigration rates, the study showed. More than two-thirds of the Hispanic increase is forecast to come from births to existing residents, with the remainder a result of immigration. By contrast, more whites are dying than are being born, and more are leaving the city than moving in. Black residents have a moderately high birthrate, but more blacks leave the city than move in.
Asians have a low birthrate, but a very high immigration rate, even higher than the Hispanic rate.
Ms. Salvo said the differences were primarily a result of age disparities. Although whites' median age is 40, the median age of Hispanic residents is 29, meaning a greater proportion is of childbearing age.
The newest Hispanic immigrants tend to be even younger and closer to childbearing age, Mr. Salvo said, noting that the median age of immigrants from the Dominican Republic is about 21.
The median age of Asian immigrants, half of whom are Chinese, is about 27, which explains their relatively lower fertility, Mr. Salvo said. "Six years is a big difference in fertility terms," he added.
The increase in the Hispanic population parallels a national trend in which Hispanic residents now outnumber blacks in Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix and San Diego. Most Hispanic people in those cities are of Mexican or other Latin American origins. In New York most trace their roots from Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic.
For the first time Hispanic residents will be a majority in one borough, representing 52.3 percent of the Bronx by the year 2000, the study projects. In Queens the white population will drop, from 48 percent in 1990 to 34 percent in 2000, according to the projections, and all other populations will increase.
Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx said he believed that his borough was already more than half Hispanic, a trend that he added was long in coming.
"I don't think this will mean anything dramatic for the borough," Mr. Ferrer said. "We're about there now, and we have a Puerto Rican Borough President, a black District Attorney and a white Jewish Surrogate Judge elected countywide. The faces may change. The names may change. But the nature of building support for a consensus government will go on."
Mr. Ferrer noted that those groups did not necessarily act or see themselves as part of a monolithic Hispanic bloc, any more than Jews and Italians behaved in similar ways because they were listed in the category of whites.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was questioned about the study at a news briefing yesterday, because one of the seven or eight closest advisers in his inner circle is Hispanic and the others are white. Asked whether his administration reflected the growing diversity of the city, he said such questions promoted division.
"My government's representative," Mr. Giuliani said, "made up of people of merit and quality who work very, very hard. I think I've moved the city to a deeper understanding of how people interact with each other, not based on an excessive concern over differences, but looking for things to unite us."

HEADLINE: Council Set to Fight Mayor On Service Cuts in Budget

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Drawing battle lines over Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed New York City budget, officials of the City Council said yesterday that they would scale back some or all of the Mayor's $185 million in proposed tax cuts if the city failed to receive enough state aid and could not find ways to pay for the cuts without drastically reducing services.
And if the city can afford any tax reductions, the Council officials said they would propose alternatives to the Mayor's plan that would provide a greater benefit for middle- and working-class New Yorkers. 
 Specifically, the officials said yesterday, the Council would reject the Mayor's proposed elimination of sales tax on clothing under $100 and instead propose a package of tax cuts for homeowners, first-time home buyers and married couples, as well as tax credits for college students and working families.
The tax issue is included in a report, to be released today, detailing the Council's concerns and objections to the Mayor's financial blueprint for the coming fiscal year. It reflected the opening barrage in what could become a bitter fight over the Mayor's proposed $30.5 billion budget, which includes a $1.3 billion spending cut, the deepest reduction since the Great Depression.
In the summary of its report, scheduled to be released today in full, the Council also takes the Mayor to task for calling on Gov. George E. Pataki to expand his proposed reductions in Medicaid and welfare, saving the city a total of $1.2 billion.
In recent weeks, as the Governor and State Legislature have haggled over the state's budget, the Council has lobbied in Albany against many of the Mayor's and Governor's cuts in those programs, saying they will cost the city in the long run.
"The Council believes that the financial plan responds to the current political climate and economic circumstances, but in many areas fails to acknowledge the long-term social and economic consequences of these budget choices," the report said.
The Council's report also staked out its opposition to the Mayor's proposed cuts in education, sanitation, cultural programs and youth services. And it recommended abolishing the Human Resources Administration and dividing the Department of Social Services into three new agencies dealing separately with children, adults, and benefits programs for Medicaid and welfare.
The Mayor's office declined to comment on the Council's proposals until officials could review it. "We look forward to studying the Council budget plan," said a spokeswoman, Karen A. Crowe.
Although the summary report made clear that the Council would oppose the Mayor on several fronts, it did not address the additional cuts the city could be forced to make if it fails to receive all of the savings from the state that the Mayor anticipated in the budget plan he unveiled in February.
A Council official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the uncertainty in Albany raised questions about the city's ability to afford the tax cuts the Mayor proposed, which total $185 million in the next fiscal year and grow to $539 million in the following year.
Besides objecting to eliminating the clothing sales tax, whose loss would cost the city $98 million in revenues in the next fiscal year, the Council also opposes the elimination of the 12.5 percent surcharge on personal income tax that Mr. Giuliani proposed beginning in fiscal year 1997. The costs of the two tax cuts, the Council said, would total $370 million over the next two years.
In its report, the Council's staff argues that the Mayor's tax cuts over the next four years offered more savings for people who make more than $80,000, while the Council's plan would give greater relief to people who make less than that. The Council also argued that tax relief for home buyers would stimulate economic growth. The Council will not oppose the Mayor's $70 million reduction in property taxes on co-ops and condos.
The Council also clashed with the administration yesterday over the Mayor's plan to sell three of New York City's 11 municipal hospitals.
In more than four hours of often combative testimony, Maria K. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health policy and the newly appointed chairwoman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, rejected charges that the Mayor's office had developed its plan without doing adequate research on its impact and without consulting the Council.
"I want to know what is the mind-set of the administration," said Julia Harrison, a Democrat from Queens. "Are we serving an autocratic ruler?"
Una Clarke, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said the administration's plan would dismantle the city's health care system for the poor. The Mayor, she said, was trying "to make it a city of the middle class and not the poor."
Ms. Mitchell countered by saying that the city needed to restructure its health care system. "I can't understand why anybody wants to keep the status quo," she said, "when we have health indicators that show us that we're not doing a good job."

HEADLINE: A Changing California Emerges From Recession

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 28

 BODY:
New evidence shows that three years after the rest of the country, California has finally pulled out of its brutal recession, with job growth and incomes rising swiftly. There are even signs that the outflow of residents from the state has slowed sharply and may reverse in coming years.
But California's economy has changed considerably and has been humbled by the extraordinary growth of the late 1980's. 
 A business forecasting group at the University of California at Los Angeles has released a much anticipated survey confirming indications that the state, which accounts for nearly 13 percent of the national economy, is gaining momentum in spite of problems like the peso crisis in Mexico and the aftereffects of the Northridge earthquake.
Perhaps the most impressive aspects of the U.C.L.A. forecast were its projections of growth in personal income and employment. The report said that in both categories California would catch up with and surpass the national average in several years. That would be the first time since 1990 that California's economy, long used to setting the pace for the United States, exceeded the rest of the country.
"In 1994 we were sort of flying blind," said Larry J. Kimbell, head of the U.C.L.A. Business Forecasting Project. "The numbers weren't all that clear, and we had to make a number of revisions in our forecasts, but now we're much surer. The economy is recovering."
But it will clearly be a different economy from the boisterous one that tumbled into the recession five years ago. Housing construction remains weak and housing prices, which had soared to extravagant levels, are still dropping. The biggest change is a shift away from the aerospace industry, which once formed the backbone of the state's economy, toward service industries, particularly entertainment.
Mr. Kimbell said that for the first time, the number of jobs in the entertainment industries, including movies, music and television, had surpassed those in the aerospace industry, with much of that shift focused in Southern California and Los Angeles.
"We're going to be much more of a media town," he said. "The number of jobs in that area before was never up to the image. But the jobs are here now and we're going to see a lot more growth."
The cutbacks at aerospace companies, a product of the end of the cold war and a slowdown in military spending, has eliminated 210,000 high-paying jobs in California that are never expected to be replaced.
By contrast, the motion picture industry alone added 23,000 jobs last year alone, a 17 percent spurt. That pace is expected to continue. The service sector in general will add 470,000 jobs from the beginning of this year through 1997, according to the U.C.L.A. report. Over all, the state will add 880,000 jobs through 1997.
"The growth of service industry jobs remains the driving force in the California expansion," the forecast said.
The renewed growth in California, although vulnerable to an economic slowdown at home or falling demand in its key export markets, in Japan and Mexico, has now generated another positive change: the flight of people from California is reversing.
David Hensley, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, and a former forecaster at U.C.L.A., said the stream of Americans who had been migrating out of California has slowed sharply. Many settled in other western states, whose economies were healthier.
Traditionally, California has received a large influx of Americans from other states. That movement reached a recent peak in the fiscal year that ended in June 1989, when there was a net inflow of 232,000 people, state figures show. (These figures exclude legal and illegal immigrants and include estimates based on changes in the number of drivers' licenses issued.)
The recession changed that with a net outflow of 189,000 in the fiscal year that ended last June. Preliminary figures indicate that the outflow will slow to 80,000 or less in the current fiscal year and could turn positive next year.
"California has come into 1995 with a reasonable head of steam," Mr. Hensley said. "There is lots of pent-up demand and we're seeing the benefits of that. It is pulling people back."
He added that the shift in migration will benefit the California economy, spurring spending on everything from autos to housing.
In total, California lost 520,000 jobs from the beginning of the downturn, in July 1990, to the bottom, in October 1993.
The current number of jobs in the aerospace industry, 170,000, is expected to drop further, to 153,000, by the end of 1997. Employment in high-tech industries is projected to remain flat.
The string of disasters that have afflicted the state -- the Los Angeles riots and earthquake, heavy flooding this year, the Orange County bankruptcy and the peso crisis in Mexico -- have exerted some negative pull on the economy, the report said, but it did not quantify the problems.
California has now won back 330,000 of the lost jobs since the slow recovery began last year, but it will not equal the previous peak employment level until next year.
California's nonfarm employment grew a modest 1.1 percent in 1994, but that was the first time in two years that the state posted any job growth. The growth rate in job creation will double this year, according to the U.C.L.A. report.
Still, California's economy faces a number of challenges, Mr. Kimbell said.
If higher American interest rates squelch the expansion, California will likely follow suit. Another wild card is Mexico, California's third-largest export market, after Japan and Canada. The plummeting value of the peso and a government austerity program there have slashed the inflow of California-made goods and agricultural products. A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco noted steep declines in retail sales in border districts.
But the U.C.L.A. group foresees the Mexican economy recovering by 1997, helping lift California's prospects that year.
The weak American dollar will help the state's exports to Japan, Mr. Kimbell said, but not substantially until 1997. And even then it is not clear that the troubled Japanese economy will still be expanding.

HEADLINE: Students Turn to Internet for Nationwide Protest Planning

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 28

 BODY:
Gone are the phone chains that mobilized antiwar efforts in the 1960's. Campus activism has launched into cyberspace.
Communicating by electronic mail from dormitories, libraries and campus centers across the country, college students have been sending one another a blizzard of messages during the last several weeks, discussing political platforms, possible protest dates and ideas for slogans and petitions. 
 The result: a computer-organized day of demonstrations against the Contract With America, the campaign manifesto from which House Republicans built their legislative agenda.
The planning for the demonstrations, which are set for Wednesday at more than 100 colleges and universities and in communities adjoining them, was spearheaded by a 32-year-old former campus protester and is thought to be the first instance in which campus organizers have taken to the Internet to map a nationwide campaign.
Their unusual origin notwithstanding, the protests are expected to be of the usual sort: a march in Ann Arbor, Mich.; a sit-in in Duluth, Minn.; a fast in Ithaca, N.Y.; leafleting in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and rallies in New York City, including a mock funeral procession through Battery Park City that was organized by students at Columbia University.
Even on the biggest campuses, organizers are expecting only several hundred participants. But the speed and ease with which the protests were planned, and the broad coalitions of student groups that were reached, are evidence, organizers say, of how fundamentally computer networking has changed the way students communicate.
The Internet, they note, not only links students on one coast with those on the other but also joins collegians of the very same campus who might not have banded together had it not been for common causes discovered through computer interaction.
"Electronic mail is a means to really have a participatory democracy," said Elaine R. Holeton, a senior at the University of Virginia. "Everyone can have their voices heard."
"Electronic mail," said Jeremy Smith, "has totally changed the way students do political activism."
Mr. Smith, 24, a former student protester at the University of Florida, now works at the University Conversion Project/Center for Campus Organizing, which coordinated Internet planning for Wednesday's demonstrations.
The University Conversion Project, run out of the basement of an old stone Baptist church here in Cambridge, was created in 1991 by Richard Cowan, a 1987 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to help students protest the Persian Gulf war.
At M.I.T. in the early 1980's, Mr. Cowan protested apartheid in South Africa, tuition increases and President Ronald Reagan's proposal for the "Star Wars" anti-missile defense system. Now 32, he works as a computer consultant at Lesley College here and runs the nonprofit University Conversion Project in his spare time with contributions from liberal foundations and individual donors; its budget last year was $42,000.
Not that campus-based computer interaction is the sole province of the student left. Conservative student groups are also active on the Internet -- there is a particularly active Republican electronic discussion group based at Temple University, for instance -- and young Republicans at Middlebury College in Vermont and Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C., were not too shy to argue over the network with the organizers of Wednesday's protests.
Plans for those protests began in early February with a discussion in the Conversion Project's cluttered one-room office about a national day of action against the Contract With America, an idea first proposed by a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
The idea was circulated by computer to several E-mail discussion groups. One, in Berkeley, Calif., had been used by opponents of Proposition 187, the voter-approved California ballot initiative aimed at denying social services to illegal aliens. Another, called Actnow, was based at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and had a widespread undergraduate audience.
The computer conversations quickly moved to the University Conversion Project's own discussion group, which is based at the University of Missouri and, Mr. Cowan says, currently has about 700 subscribers.
"It started out as just a few people talking about the Contract With America," said one subscriber, Camille Leganza, a freshman at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Miss Leganza said she was soon getting 30 messages a day about plans for campus demonstrations.
"It has opened up this whole world for me," she said. "Instead of this small liberal arts school that I am at, I am connected to the whole country."
A draft of a Call to Action was carried in February to the Conversion Project's annual retreat, which attracts campus organizers and members of organizations like the New York Public Interest Research Group and Amnesty International. The retreat took place at the offices of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an interfaith peace organization in Nyack, N.Y., and among those attending was Mr. Cowan, who distributed the draft electronically on Feb. 23.
In early March, the Conversion Project circulated a packet of advisory materials offering suggestions to campus groups about how to mobilize support and plan protest events.
From that point on, planning for Wednesday's demonstrations became something of a ride on the information interstate, with campus organizers across the country pitching ideas back and forth.
At Wellesley, for instance, students designed an "Unpetition of the Contract With America" that, among other things, states opposition to the House Republican proposals on social services programs, education and the environment. The Unpetition was distributed by computer and will be passed around on paper at Wednesday's demonstrations nationwide.
Protest planning by Internet does have its drawbacks, though.
First, those students whose schools are still not connected to the Internet, especially community colleges, may never learn of a protest organized solely on computer. That, said Nicole Newtown, the Conversion Project's outreach coordinator, is the danger of relying too heavily on electronics.
Another concern is that electronic communication, though fast and effective, is somewhat sterile. "There is no substitute for the face-to-face interactions that build political commitments," said Mark Naison, a onetime leader of Students for a Democratic Society who is now a professor of history at Fordham University and teaches a course on 1960's activism.
"Politicization is a very complex process," he said. "It's not very easy for a student to make the transition from preoccupation with their grades, their careers, their financial problems, their social life, to a passionate political commitment that consumes everything. It's a life experience of new forms of group solidarity. I am not sure there is any shortcut for that."

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Transit Workers Strike After Rejecting Pay Offer

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 28

 BODY:
A strike by transit workers today brought the city's subways, buses and trolleys to a halt, forcing 350,000 people to find new ways to travel around the nation's fifth-largest city.
The strike against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority began at 12:01 A.M., after 5,200 members of Local 234 of the Transport Workers Union rejected a 7 percent raise over three years. 
 No talks were held today and none were scheduled. Average pay under the old contract, which expired on March 15, was $16.10 an hour.
Suburban operations -- buses, trolleys and commuter trains into the city -- are covered by contracts with different unions and were not directly affected by the walkout.
Nevertheless, the walkout crippled more than 80 percent of the region's public transportation, causing a big increase in traffic on local highways and city streets. By 8 A.M., many parking lots in the city's business district were filled.
The transportation authority tried to ease the burden by running 12 extra trains on regional rail lines from the suburbs. The number of riders on those lines increased to 47,000, up from the daily average of 31,000, said Michael Burns, the assistant general manager for the railroad division.
But those trains were of no use to most of the people who live within the 136-square-mile city's limits.
For example, 30,000 of the city's 207,000 public school students who rely on public transportation had no ride to school, said a spokesman for the school district, Paul Hansen.
Mr. Hansen said that attendance was down about 6 percent overall, most sharply in high schools, which saw attendance down 21 percent.
Tempers sometimes flared when frustrated commuters encountered striking workers. "You're keeping me from my job," a woman, Emma James, shouted at pickets outside the transportation authority's offices downtown.
A bus driver, Lee King, said: "This is nothing personal against the public. We're sorry for the inconvenience, but they have to understand that this is our livelihood."
Charles Brown, a bus driver for 25 years, said most drivers could not afford to retire until age 65. "Do you really want a bus driver who is 65?" he asked.
The workers walked out today after rejecting a 2 percent raise in each of the first two years of a new contract and a 3 percent increase in the third year. The union is seeking 3 percent each year, as well as greater pension benefits. The transportation authority said the difference between its offer and the union proposal was $37 million.
The president of Local 234, Harry Lombardo, said he had met for less than a minute with a state mediator. The union is planning a rally for 11 A.M. on Wednesday.
A transit authority spokesman, Stephan Rosenfeld, said this afternoon: "There is nothing new to report. Period. Zip. Nothing."
A cab driver, Siamak Padar, predicted that the strike would increase both his fares and anxiety. "It will get crazy," he said. "The traffic will get bad and people will be angry."
The Chamber of Commerce said Philadelphia's last transit strike, a four-day walkout in 1986, caused the local economy to lose about $2.5 million a day.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed, Deflated Somewhat by Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling, the Standard & Poor's 500 index edging again into record territory and the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich in technology stocks, surging to another high.
The negative factors included the dollar again falling near post-World War II lows against the mark and the yen, and bond prices dropping and long-term interest rates rising. Moreover, some analysts say stock prices may be too high and thus headed for a fall. 
 "The market had every excuse to go way down," said Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer & Company.
Nonetheless, the Dow declined only 5.53 points, to 4,151.81, while the broader S.& P. 500 rose 0.70 point, to a record of 503.90. The smaller-company Nasdaq index rose 3.51 points, to 826.14.
"It was an incredibly good performance, considering," said Edward Laux, senior managing director of equity trading at the Chicago Corporation.
The Federal Reserve, as expected, did not raise interest rates yesterday, which deepened an overnight plunge in the value of the dollar. Currency traders had already bid down the dollar and accelerated their sales after the Fed announced after 2 P.M. that its policy-making meeting had ended.
The dollar's weakness may be helping the stocks of some American companies with multinational interests, as they receive part of their revenue abroad in local currency. When a multinational company is paid in yen or marks, for instance, it receives more dollars than it would otherwise.
"If you see a stronger dollar, you're going to see people easing out of the Coca-Colas, the Gillettes and the Mercks," Mr. Laux said.
Bond prices fell yesterday after two unexpected private-sector reports seemed to indicate the possibility of widening inflation as consumers continued to spend. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.39 percent from 7.31 percent on Monday.
The Conference Board's consumer index for March rose to 101 from 99.4 in February, instead of an expected decline. A weekly survey by Johnson Redbook Service projected 1.3 percent higher retail sales for March from February. Analysts had expected a decline.
As bond yields remain relatively high, these fixed-income investments have coaxed money away from stocks. But despite investors' shifting money into bonds in recent months, stock prices continue to rise.
Some analysts note that the price-earnings ratio for the S.& P. 500, a key measure for valuing the stock market as a whole, has steadily risen. Last month, the stocks of the S.& P. 500 sold for $15.84 for each $1 of profit, up from $15.05 in December, the low point for 1994.
High-technology stocks may be especially vulnerable. Top stocks on the Nasdaq composite index yesterday included Intel, the computer chip maker; Microsoft, the giant software company; MCI Communications, the long-distance phone carrier, and Cisco Systems, the maker of computer networks.
Among the biggest gainers yesterday was the Limited, a specialty retailer. It rose 2 3/8, to 22, after it announced plans to split into three companies and sell stock to the public in two of them, a lingerie and toiletries operation that includes Victoria's Secret, and its flagship Limited stores.
The Healthcare Compare Corporation, a hospital-management company, rose 6 7/8, to 38, after a survey indicated that Wall Street analysts expected higher first-quarter profit. Micron Technology, the semiconductor manufacturer, rose 4 1/2, to 84 3/4, after the company doubled its dividend and announced plans for a 2-for-1 stock split.
Among the biggest decliners were Exide, a maker of lead acid batteries, and Tandy Brands Accessories, which makes leather accessories. Exide fell 6 5/8, to 36 1/8, after it announced that a warm winter meant that fewer car batteries had failed, hurting its sales. Tandy Brands fell 4, to 7 1/8, after it said it would close its television-shopping operation.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was close to normal with 320.4 million shares changing hands, about 3 percent below this year's daily average of 329 million shares.

HEADLINE: High Court Ruling Upholds Trademarking of a Color

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that color can be registered as a trademark when it distinguishes a particular product and serves no other function.
The decision, written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, resolved a dispute among the lower Federal courts and upheld the longstanding position of the Patent and Trademark Office. 
 The North American Free Trade Agreement, among other international economic agreements, includes trademark protection for color. The Clinton Administration urged the Supreme Court in this case to overturn a 1994 ruling by a Federal appeals court in California that "color alone" was ineligible for registration as a trademark.
The case was a victory for a Chicago manufacturer, the Qualitex Company, which since the 1950's has used a particular shade of green-gold for the pads it makes for use on dry-cleaning presses.
Qualitex registered the color as a trademark in 1991 and brought a trademark infringement suit against a rival company that had begun making pads in the same color. Qualitex prevailed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, but its victory was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. The appeals court ruled that the Lanham Trademark Act, the basic Federal law in the area, did not permit a trademark for "color alone."
Under the Lanham Act, "any word, name, symbol, or device" may be eligible for trademark registration. Because the 1946 law does not mention color, courts have arrived at differing interpretations. In one precedent, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which sits in Washington, ruled in 1985 that the Owens-Corning Fiber-glas Corporation could register the color pink as a trademark for its residential insulation products.
In his opinion today, Justice Breyer said there was no reason not to regard color, under appropriate circumstances, as a "symbol" within the meaning of the Lanham Act.
"There is no rule absolutely barring the use of color alone," he said, noting that trademarks have been authorized for shapes, sounds and even smells. "If a shape, a sound, and a fragrance can act as symbols, why, one might ask, can a color not do the same?" Justice Breyer said.
The decision, Qualitex v. Jacobson Products, No. 93-1577, had several qualifications. For a color to qualify as a trademark, Justice Breyer said, it had to have attained a "secondary meaning" that "identifies and distinguishes a particular brand."
And the color cannot serve a significant function of its own beyond the identification. Competitors would be put at a particular disadvantage if color that served a function could be registered, Justice Breyer said.
The Federal Circuit appeals court ruled last year, in a case now on appeal to the Supreme Court, that a manufacturer of outboard engines could not register the color black as a trademark for its engines because the color served purposes beyond simple identification.
The court found that black made outboard engines look smaller, a desirable feature, and was also compatible with many different boat colors. The Justices will announce shortly whether they will review that decision, Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull, No. 94-1075.
In his opinion today, Justice Breyer examined and rejected the general arguments against permitting color as a trademark. Chief among these was the asserted problem of "shade confusion," under which the use of one color as a trademark is said to confuse competitors and customers.
"Courts traditionally decide quite difficult questions about whether two words or phrases or symbols are sufficiently similar, in context, to confuse buyers," Justice Breyer said, giving examples ranging from Bonamine and Dramamine (both motion-sickness drugs) to Huggies and Dougies, two brands of diapers.
He said that customers benefit by being able to use color to identify products they like or dislike. Owners of color trademarks benefit, he said, because they can "reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product" while at the same time discouraging "those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale."

HEADLINE: A Charm School For Car Salesmen;
In Class, Making Peace With Buyers; Then There's the Real World

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md.

 BODY:
It is barely 8:30 in the morning, but already Timothy C. Gercke, auto industry educator and evangelist, has invoked Henry Ford, Moses and the Masai in trying to rouse the two dozen auto salespeople before him to the potential of their calling.
He wants to inspire them to resolve the bitterest feud in American commerce, between the people who sell cars and pretty much everyone else. 
 "What do we say about buyers?" he demands, big hands waving, big voice revving from a whisper to a roar as he paces the windowless hotel meeting room. "All buyers are -- what?"
"Liars," the salespeople chant, revealing a perspective that is the precise reciprocal of that of many of their customers.
"Sure, they lie through their teeth," Mr. Gercke says.
Then he urges his pupils to understand why customers might lie -- about the condition of their trade-ins, for example, or the other cars they are considering -- and prods them toward higher ground. Customers are frightened, he said, and salespeople must bravely take the first step by being honest with them.
Mr. Gercke, who lectures on behalf of the National Automobile Dealers Association, is an avatar of an industrywide effort to turn salespeople into "sales professionals" and buff the business's greasy image. The auto companies have inaugurated numerous training programs because they believe that as quality gaps narrow, the salesman is the key to keeping customers loyal in a market jammed with competitors selling what Mr. Gercke, with typical sweep, refers to as "this thing called a car."
Part Tony Robbins self-esteem booster, part Gatsbyesque self-improvement exercise, the program offered by the dealers' association educates salespeople on dressing (no dark glasses, no loud jackets), speaking (don't call female customers "babe" or "honey"), and, most urgently, grappling with the ethical quandaries they confront daily.
But a few days of watching salespeople labor in their lots shows how hard it is to abide by Mr. Gercke's injunctions on ethics, if not etiquette. Few professionals work under their kind of pressure.
While a couple of auto makers, notably Saturn, encourage their dealers to put salespeople on salary, elsewhere they still make their money by commissions. The more forgiving that salespeople are in negotiating price, trade-in value, interest rate, floor mat cost and everything else, the less money they make.
"Buying a new car should be fun; why isn't it?" the trade weekly Automotive News recently editorialized, giving the blame partly to "the antiquated commission system."
Mix with that system the suspicion, contempt and lies some customers heap upon them, and one is left wondering why all salespeople don't metamorphose into sharks, rather than why so many do.
And many do not, including, it seems, most of Mr. Gercke's audience. In fact, that is another obstacle the association faces: The worst sinners are unlikely to enter Mr. Gercke's church.
"I'm not a sales slob -- I'm a professional," said one student, Nolan Burgess, a self-described sales consultant at Benson Motor Cars, a Mercedes dealership in Annapolis. While arguing that good salesmen get no credit, he acknowledged, "There's a whole bunch of bad apples." The course, he said, was renewing his sense of purpose.
Indeed, the course can seem like a pep talk for salespeople who are already trying to do the right thing, despite the market forces arrayed against them.
"You're not bad people," Mr. Gercke says, sounding a poignant theme he and his pupils repeatedly revisit. "You can be proud of our business."
To make it better, though, salespeople should not ridicule their customers behind their backs, he says, sizing them up by clothing or color and dismissing them as "roaches" (people with miserable credit) or "get me dones" (one slither above roaches on the credit scale). Instead, they should view them as "people with dignity and value who can make you a decent living, if you treat them well."
The programs run by the car companies tend to have highfalutin names -- Oldsmobile has its Vision Center, Chevrolet its Customer Focus Academy -- but their goals, like those of the dealers' association, seem basic: persuading dealers to refurbish their showrooms or to keep their service departments open on Saturdays, and teaching salespeople more details about the products, and to be nicer.
In fact, the training by the association at times is so basic as to be alarming. "You are in dangerous ethical waters when you deliberately misinform or lie to customers," warns the gravelly narrator on one of the training tapes.
Improvements are slow in coming. The association has persuaded only 350 of its 19,400 members to sign up and pay the fee, which is $1,295 per dealership, plus $295 per salesman (no negotiating). The association created the program three years ago, but began aggressively promoting it to its members only recently.
After at least 12 hours of studying with tapes and the 8-hour class, which travels to towns nationwide, the salespeople must score a minimum of 70 percent on a multiple-choice exam. They must also have spent at least six months at their dealership and completed product training for the vehicles they sell. Only then can they be certified as members of the Society of Automotive Sales Professionals.
The association hopes that enough dealers will hang a certification plaque in their windows that customers will learn to look for it, gradually forcing other dealers to raise their standards.
Mr. Gercke tells his pupils the change starts with them. "People aren't going to buy from you because you have a plaque on your window," he says. "They're going to buy from you because you have a plaque on your heart that says, 'I am different.' "
But consider the position of the average new-car salesman (he is a man), and you will see how hard it is to change.
Generally, a salesman will spend one to three hours with a couple of dozen customers a week. Many will promise to come back, and never do. Frequently, they will make an appointment to return and not show up, leaving the salesman to pass up other customers as he paces and checks his watch, or wistfully watches cars pull into the lot.
Once the negotiating begins, so does the lying. Customers swear they never damaged their trade-in, when it has more dimples than a golf ball. They lie about deals they have been offered elsewhere, about what their neighbors paid for the same model they are considering, or about their credit histories. One salesman attending the class told of selling 17 cars in a row only to discover when it came time for the paperwork that each person had such bad credit that not one deal was approved.
Meanwhile, every customer suspects the salesman of being slime.
Such experiences could make a man cynical. "It was so hard at first," said Timothy S. Gulick, a salesman from the Bob Smith Automotive Group, the "G.M. Giant" on Maryland's Eastern Shore. "It was: 'These people think I'm lying. My God, what's going on?' "
At the end of the workweek -- which is often six days -- the typical salesman may have sold three cars. He generally receives 20 to 25 percent of the dealer's gross profit, so he makes about $300 a car. In 1992, according to the dealers' association's most recent data, the average salesman in a new-car dealership made $29,319. Almost all pay for their own health and retirement benefits.
The top salespeople averaged $44,788, and that kind of money is the job's greatest appeal. Some salesmen also cite the thrill of closing a deal or of helping people. "Once a kid gets his first car -- that's a good feeling," David Shepherd of Bob Smith said.
Of course, while salespeople resent their poor public image, customers have developed it from hard experience, as Mr. Gercke reminds his pupils. Horror stories abound.
In one remarkable case, a Texas jury found that a Tarrant County salesman trapped a deaf and mute customer for four hours, taking his keys and hiding them. "Let me go home," the customer pleaded in one note to the salesman, according to court documents. "I'm very hungry and if you mail me good deal then maybe I come over here to buy!"
The jury awarded the customer almost $5.8 million, an award upheld last year by an appeals court. The court found that the dealer, George Grubbs Nissan, systematically took advantage of customers "through the use of deception and psychological pressure in an effort to make as much profit as possible." The dealer is appealing to the Texas Supreme Court.
The court's words cut to the heart of salespeople's quandaries. How, for example, can a salesman expect to keep up with the mortgage if he honestly answers this question: "What did the dealer pay for this car?"
As Mr. Gercke paces his classroom, he labors to convince his pupils that it is in their interest to answer such questions honestly, and not to "high gross" their customers. Sacrificing some profit now will yield referrals and repeat business, he says.
To be sure, even honest answers to these questions will not necessarily protect customers against profiteering. Any salesman can build extra profit into a deal by playing with trade-in value, options and interest rates on the financing.
During the afternoon session of the one-day class, Mr. Gercke explains that myriad state and Federal laws make telling lies not merely unethical, but illegal. "I would suggest that none of you would look good in prison blue," he booms.
Even exaggerations can cause trouble. Statements such as "this car will meet all your needs" create implied warranties, Mr. Gercke explains. Further, he says, today's more sophisticated car shoppers are likely to detect any overpromising, and have their suspicions of a salesman's slipperiness confirmed.
"The bad reputation of our industry has gone like a ripple on a wave into the future," Mr. Gercke says. "It has to stop with us, in this room, here, today."

HEADLINE: Panel Vote Is Set on Repeal of a Federal Wage Act

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Senate Republicans have scheduled a committee vote on Wednesday on legislation to repeal the Depression-era law that guarantees workers on Federal construction jobs the prevailing wage.
Officials of organized labor and one of their chief allies in the Senate, Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today that they would try to persuade the Republicans to amend the law, the Davis-Bacon Act, instead of repealing it. 
 The chief sponsor of the repeal legislation, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, scheduled the bill for consideration and a vote before her committee on Wednesday.
Similar legislation was approved on March 2 by a subcommittee of the House Economic and Education Opportunities Committee.
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted in 1931, at the height of the Depression, to protect construction workers' wages from union leaders who would have undercut each other on pay to get jobs for their members. The law requires that contractors on any Federal construction project costing more than $2,000 pay their workers not less than the "prevailing wage."
"This is another assault on working families," said Mr. Kennedy, citing Republican opposition to an increase in the minimum wage and a bill that would have barred the replacement of striking workers. "This is antiworkers ideology run amok."
The substitute legislation offered by the Democrats was written by Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. It would raise the threshold for application of the law to $100,000 from $2,000.
Over the years, there have been efforts by both the White House and Congress to repeal or amend the law, but each one has failed in the face of opposition from the labor lobby.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. says the law protects the living standards of construction workers. The labor federation says the law also gives local construction companies more of a competitive chance against transient contractors who might win Federal contracts by paying wages below the local standards.
Senator Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, says the Davis-Bacon Act is outmoded and raises Federal construction costs by 5 percent to 25 percent. She introduced her bill to repeal the act on Jan. 4, the day Republicans took control of both the Senate and the House.
"Davis-Bacon decreases competition, raises construction costs and diminishes employment opportunities," Ms. Kassebaum said in introducing the bill.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Consumer Optimism Hurts Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday, hurt by a report showing consumer confidence was higher than expected. The selloff gave back more than half of the gains of a two-day bond rally.
Prices fell after the Conference Board said consumer confidence in March rose to 101 from a revised 99.4 in February. The report revived concerns that recent signs of an economic slowdown might be fleeting. 
 But some traders said the selling on the confidence data was merely an excuse by investors to take advantage of a market that was overbought.
"The strength of the numbers was a surprise, but as far as reports go, it is a minor report," said Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "That bonds reacted the way they did suggests to me that the bond market wanted to go down."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 29/32 to yield 7.39 percent, up from 7.31 percent on Monday. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. Rates on bills with shorter maturities also moved higher, up more than 5 basis points on average. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged had little affect, as it was widely anticipated. The Fed's policy-making committe ended its meeting at 1:15 P.M. yesterday, and nearly an hour later issued a characteristically brief statement, "There is no further announcement."
But bonds were under pressure from a weak dollar, which dropped further on the news that the Fed had not changed its monetary policy. A weak dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors.
Traders said selling in yesterday's session gained momentum around noon as the price of the June bond futures broke through a support level, with long bonds liquidating and investors taking short positions on expectations that the market would continue to fall.
Other data out yesterday included the Johnson Redbook survey, which showed retail sales through March 25 up 1.3 percent, a sizable improvement from last week's reading of six-tenths of 1 percent. The survey results provided another sign that a slump in consumption earlier this year may turn out to be only a pause.
At the Treasury's note auction yesterday, the high yield on a new two-year note was 6.717 percent, down from 6.999 percent at the previous auction. It was the lowest yield since Sept. 27, 1994, when the yield was 6.55 percent.
Traders said the auction went well, with rates at levels that were anticipated last week.
The Treasury will auction a new five-year note today. In when-issued trading, it was being offered at a price to yield 6.99 percent, up 10 basis points from the previous day.
In the municipal market, new bond sales drew strong demand even as prices of existing issues fell.
Traders said sales of more than $100 million in general-obligation debt from each of two states, Tennessee and Missouri, drew good investor demand because of those states' top credit ratings and infrequent sales of new debt. Investors said the sales also did well because investors could buy large blocks of bonds, which is more difficult in the secondary market.
According to Bloomberg Fair Value Analystics, the Missouri bonds were priced to yield 5.10 percent, or 14 basis points less than similarly rated issues, while the Tennessee bonds due in 15 years were priced to yield 5.55 percent, or 5 basis points less than similarly rated issues.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High yield . . . 6.717%
Low yield . . . 6.651%
Median yield . . . 6.690%

The two-year notes mature on March 31, 1997.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Pushed Down Sharply As Fed Declines to Raise Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rate unchanged.
The dollar fell throughout the day amid expectations that the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates. When the Fed announced yesterday afternoon that it was not taking any action, the dollar stayed at its depressed levels. 
 Rising interest rates often help a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it more attractive. The prospect of steady rates prompted many traders to sell dollars.
"The Fed didn't do anything," said Frank Conte, deputy chief currency dealer at Royal Bank of Canada. "That was expected, and the expectations triggered dollar selling."
The dollar fell as low as 1.3857 marks, its lowest since March 20. In New York trading yesterday, it settled at 1.3882 marks, down from 1.4050 marks on Monday. The dollar fell to 88.90 yen from 89.40 yen.
Growing expectations that the Bundesbank -- the German central bank -- will not lower interest rates at its policy meeting tomorrow also weighed on the dollar, dealers and analysts said.
The Bundesbank's dominant concern is to control inflation. Strong economic growth and recent labor settlements that included annual wage increases of more than 4 percent will probably keep the central bank from lowering rates, analysts said. The Bundesbank has left rates unchanged since July 27.
"Interest rate differentials will probably move against the dollar," as strong German economic growth pushes German interest rates higher, said Bruce English, manager of currency sales for ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago.
Three-month dollar deposits in Europe yielded 6.25 percent yesterday, compared with 5 percent for three-month Euromark deposits.
The dollar fared better against the yen than against the mark because of expectations of an interest rate cut in Japan, market participants said.
Those expectations arose on Monday after Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, using a phrase that has become a code word for interest rate cuts, said Japan would follow a "flexible monetary policy" to cope with the strong yen.
In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.1465 Swiss franc, from 1.1740 francs on Monday. The British pound rose to $1.6150 from $1.5975.

HEADLINE: The Foxwoods Myth

BYLINE: By Ben Nighthorse Campbell; Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Republican Senator from Colorado, is a trustee of the American Indian College Fund.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The phenomenal success of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., has led many Americans to believe that gambling is an economic panacea for Native Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth.
According to the 1990 census, Native Americans are the nation's poorest group; 31 percent live below the poverty level. In the 1980's, their average household income fell by 5 percent, while that of all other major racial and ethnic groups rose. The average annual income of Native Americans living on reservations is less than $5,000. 
 Gambling will not quickly improve these grim statistics. Of the more than 500 U.S. tribes, fewer than 100 have casino-type operations. And most casinos cannot make huge profits because of their small size, isolation and state restrictions.
Consider the Fort Peck reservation, in northeastern Montana, which has a 70 percent unemployment rate although its Assiniboines and Sioux are considered high-stakes gambling tribes. Their operations are hampered by the state's prohibition on slot machines and blackjack games.
Foxwoods, run by the Mashantucket Pequots, is expected to generate more than half a billion dollars from slot machines alone this year. At 200,000 square feet, the casino contains more square feet than the total of all the homes and businesses on many reservations.
Tribes need outside investors to raise the millions of dollars needed to build large casinos. Potential speculators will be interested if the reservations are close to a large population and far from competitors. Foxwoods is the only casino in one of the country's wealthiest and most densely populated areas. But in Alaska, home to 85,000 Native Americans, 80 percent of the villages cannot be reached by roads. Navajos in Chinle, Ariz., must drive 70 miles across the reservation to reach a bank.
The condition of Indian lands can keep investors away. After years of neglect, reservations often lack running water, sewers and trash disposal. Yet the situation is far from hopeless. With the support of investors, Federal money and private donors, many tribes are building economies.
In Browning, Mont., the Blackfeet used oil and gas revenues to buy an insolvent local bank in 1987. This Government-insured institution attracts deposits from charitable organizations, corporations and other tribes. It gives loans to Indians and others on the reservation.
On the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota (in the nation's poorest county), the Lakota Fund invests in small enterprises such as video rental stores, auto mechanic shops and manufacturers of traditional crafts.
There are 29 tribal colleges across the nation, including one run by my own tribe, the Northern Cheyenne. According to the most recent data from the American Council on Education, in 1991 almost 14,000 Indians were enrolled in these schools, up from 2,100 in 1982.
As they build local economies, these tribes bring down unemployment rates, reduce welfare rolls and earn the respect of neighboring communities. We should applaud those that have found routes out of poverty through casinos or other means. But just because a small percentage of tribes can make it through gambling, private donors and public agencies should not abandon the less fortunate reservations.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Wednesday News Quiz

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the old days, The Times ran a news quiz every Saturday. It was always a favorite of mine, and I think it's time for a revival. Here are this week's questions:
1. Which country today is Iran's largest single trading partner? a) Russia; b) France; c) Iraq; d) Guatemala; e) the U.S.; f) Japan. 
 2. True or false? U.S. exports to Iran have gone up tenfold since 1989.
3. Which country's oil companies in 1994 bought roughly 30 percent of Iran's oil exports, for $4.25 billion?
4. True or false? U.S. companies don't need a special export license to sell Iran toxins, centrifuges or other equipment convertible to military use.
If you answered: 1) the U.S.; 2) true; 3) the U.S.; 4) true, you not only qualify as a news junkie but you are among the select few who understand why America's policy of "dual containment" of Iran and Iraq isn't working -- because we're among the biggest violators.
That's right. Despite the decision by the Clinton Administration to ban the Conoco oil company from doing a $1 billion deal to develop new Iranian oilfields, there are so many other loopholes in our "containment" policy (namely the right of U.S. companies to buy Iranian oil as long as they don't sell it in the U.S.) that the U.S. is still Iran's largest trading partner.
Where I come from in Minnesota we call that commerce, not containment.
I think the impulse behind dual containment is correct. The Iranian and Iraqi regimes are both up to their necks in terrorism. They should be contained. But while the current policy has, for the moment, restrained Iraq from threatening its neighbors, it has done nothing to moderate Iran -- let alone topple either regime.
This policy needs to be rethought. "Containment" is a strategy that emerged in the cold war as a way of dealing with the Soviet Union. But the Soviets were fundamentally different from Iran and Iraq. The Kremlin threatened the existence of so many countries that it was always possible to maintain a modicum of allied cohesion to isolate it economically and militarily. Neither Iran nor today's Iraq poses that sort of broad existential threat, so allied cohesion is fraying on Iraq, and doesn't exist with Iran.
Moreover, the Soviet Union offered few attractive economic opportunities to the West, so there was no great cash incentive for allies to break ranks. Iran and Iraq represent huge export markets. With all governments now under pressure to generate more jobs by expanding exports, it's little wonder that Russia is trying to sell Iran expensive nuclear technology or that U.S., German, Japanese and French companies can't resist the Teheran bazaar.
What to do? We have three options. One is to maintain the present policy, but we have to understand that this is not containment. It is "feelgood containment" -- a policy that makes us feel good but doesn't make Iran feel bad enough to change its behavior.
Two, we can take containment seriously, sever all economic relations with Iran and tell our allies that if they take over our contracts they will have to pay a price with us. That is, we will denounce Japan, France, Russia and Germany every chance we get for cooperating with an Iran responsible for everything from blowing up marines in Beirut to Jews in Buenos Aires.
Three, we could say to the Germans and others: "Look, you say your policy of constructive engagement with Iran will moderate its behavior over time. But you have set no conditions for Iran to meet, like an end to terrorism or improved human rights. We say that isolating Iran will moderate its behavior over time, but we cannot sustain that policy alone. Let's merge. We will all agree on a limited degree of economic engagement with Iran, but also on a list of political conditions Teheran will have to meet in a set time period in order to win more engagement."
But before we do that we have to deal with one other little problem with our dual containment policy -- deciding what its objective is. Our policy of containment of the Soviet Union had a clear strategic objective -- the downfall of Communism. What is our strategic objective in Iran? Democracy? Kinder, gentler ayatollahs? An end to Islamic rule? We've never said. Right now the biggest hole in our containment policy is a philosophical one -- the inability to answer the question "How will we know when we've won?"

HEADLINE: Big Rise Found In Consumers' Confidence

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Americans showed a surprisingly high increase in confidence in the economy compared with a month ago, a widely watched survey reported yesterday.
But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index also showed that many Americans are worried about what's ahead, especially in the job market. 
 The business research group's index, a barometer of consumer spending and borrowing patterns, rose to 101 in March from a revised 99.4 reading in February. Some economists consider the survey to be a useful gauge of consumer sentiment.
The monthly index, calculated on a base of 100, is derived from responses to questionnaires sent to 5,000 United States households. Consumers are asked questions on several topics ranging from job availability to car-buying plans.
"It was a big surprise to see that number increase," said Kathleen Stephansen, a senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. "This contradicts other reports that show an economic slowdown early this year."
In the latest survey, more than one out of every four consumers surveyed believed current business conditions were good.
David Bostian, an economist at Herzog, Heine & Geduld in New York, said the optimism toward current conditions could be attributed to factors like the surging stock market.
"They see that and think the economy is O.K.," he said.
But consumers' expectations for the next six months fell in March to its lowest level in a year. That could indicate the slowing economy has begun to have an impact on consumers, Mr. Bostian said.
Optimism about the job market also declined for the third consecutive month, and fewer respondents said they expected their earnings to increase in the next six months.
While 23 percent of respondents said there were plenty of jobs available, about the same number indicated that jobs were "hard to get."
Consumer confidence was the highest in the South and Midwest regions of the United States and lowest in New England and the Middle Atlantic States.

HEADLINE: The Fed Meets, and Doesn't Raise Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee met here today without changing short-term rates, the latest sign the central bankers think that the United States economy is settling down to steady growth with low inflation.
The policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, issued a characteristically brief statement at the end of the meeting, which was the first since the panel raised rates by half a percentage point on Feb. 1. 
 "The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1:15 P.M.," said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman. "There is no further announcement."
Stock and bond markets were already down slightly before Mr. Coyne's statement shortly after 2 P.M., and edged down a little further. The stock markets later recovered and closed little changed over all. But 30-year bond prices fell and long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.31 percent on Monday. The dollar declined on currency markets.
Most markets declined this morning after the Conference Board, a New York business group, released a survey showing that consumer confidence was strong. Traders interpreted the survey's results as an indication that Americans might soon start spending more money again, bidding up prices for goods and services and possibly encouraging inflation.
Financial analysts were divided today over whether to declare the Federal Reserve done with raising interest rates, after seven increases in just under 14 months. Some analysts noted that strong growth in employment over the last several months had left hundreds of thousands of Americans with more money in their pockets.
Widespread spending could push up prices and nudge the Fed into again raising rates at the next committee meeting on May 23, they said.
"I think the Fed is still on the hook for another round of tightening unless the consumer takes the Fed off the hook with very weak spending," said John Lipsky, an economist with Salomon Brothers.
Other analysts predicted that consumer spending would remain subdued because for the collapse last year of the boom in the refinancing of home mortgages at lower rates. The refinancing boom had allowed millions of Americans to reduce monthly payments, freeing income for other purposes.
Lawrence Chimerine, domestic-policy economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group, said: "Fed tightening should be over. I think it is over, and I think there's a greater possibility four or five months from now that they'll be lowering rates," rather than raising them.
Analysts concerned about a possible surge in consumer spending have pointed to a rising savings rate, a sign that Americans are at least temporarily saving part of their extra money. They saved 5 percent of their incomes in January, up from a low of 3.8 percent in August.
But Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor who specializes in consumer behavior, said in an interview on March 10 that so many households had large debts that those consumers might be reluctant to spend more money if their paychecks increased and more family members found jobs. Sustaining consumer spending growth "at the rates of last year, I think, is unlikely because of household balance sheets," he said.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee have cited a wide range of statistics in the last month as indications that the economy may be slowing. These indicators include slowing car sales and production schedules, fewer permits and construction starts of new homes, and slowing orders for industrial goods.
"There are just a lot of little things like that, that add up to a slowing down," said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve Board governor, in an interview on March 10.
On Monday, Mr. LaWare announced his resignation from the board, to take effect on April 30, and he did not take part in today's meeting. Analysts said they did not believe that his absence had any effect on the outcome.
The Federal Open Market Committee consists of the seven Federal Reserve Board governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, taking turns, four of the presidents of the 11 other Federal Reserve regional banks.

If There Is a Lockout, Owners May Face Risks

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
If a Federal court judge rules in favor of the players, then the owners of the major league baseball teams would find themselves open to much greater risk opening the season next week with replacement players.
They could do it. The regular players have said that if United States District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor grants an injunction in their favor, they would be willing to end their strike. The owners, who have said they do not want to play this season under the previous economic system, could them lock them out and field the replacement players. But they would suddenly find themselves at risk of having to pay huge fines, if they lost a second round in the courts. 
 "If you lock people out, you can hire temporary replacements; there is no question about that," said David M. Silberman, a labor law expert at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. "But the risk in doing that -- the reason the owners might hesitate -- is that the damages are considerable."
The courts, in effect, would have to decide whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice or a fair one. A fair lockout would be one that is a continuation of the battle over "economic issues," which means the terms of a new contract. Using replacement workers, temporary or permanent, during lockouts over economic issues is legal. An unfair lockout would be one imposed without first engaging in strenuous good faith bargaining over the "economic issues."
If the judge grants the injunction, perhaps on Friday after a hearing, the owners could then lock them out, assuming 21 of the 28 teams vote to do so. But that would almost certainly draw the case back into court in the early weeks of the season for a battle over whether the lockout was fair or unfair.
Under the National Labor Relations Act, if a court ruled that the lockout was unfair, the owners would have to immediately dismiss the replacement workers, take back the regulars -- if the players' union still wanted to end the strike -- and pay the players as a penalty two or three times their wages during the lockout period. That's no problem for lockouts involving auto workers or steelworkers. Their wages are clearly defined. But who knows how much to pay a major leaguer who had not yet signed a contract for this season -- the situation for most of the 700 or so players.
The National Labor Relations Board, established in 1935 to govern relations between unions and management, plays a big role in this process. The board's general counsel, Fred Feinstein, with the backing of the five-member board, brought the court action that Judge Sotomayor is to rule on. The N.L.R.B. asked for an injunction against what Feinstein, responding to the outcry of the players, described as an unfair labor practice by the owners.
The owners, according to Feinstein, unilaterally and precipitously changed the rules on player free agency and salary arbitration without first trying hard enough to reach agreement through collective bargaining. If the judge agrees, then the rules under the old contract on salary arbitration and players' rights as free agents would be temporarily restored -- and the players have said that in these circumstances, they would end their strike.
The owners, although reinstating the old rules, could then lock out the players, perhaps immediately or after a few days of resumed negotiations, to help strengthen their case that they had done all they could to reach an agreement and they therefore had a right to continue the labor standoff in the form of a lockout -- using replacement players.
That would start the legal process over again. The players would push Feinstein to decide whether the owners had in fact bargained sufficiently, and if he decides they had not, then he could once again take the case to court.

A Former Major Leaguer Wonders What to Do Now

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

DATELINE: WINTER HAVEN, Fla., March 28

 BODY:
Carmelo Martinez peruses the talent on the field, dares to gauge it against what he still possesses and knows that he, more than any so-called replacement player, can fit the bill of major leaguer.
But with less than a week to go before the start of the season, Martinez is still torn between taking the express route north, via a spot on a replacement roster, or sticking it out on the local, with no guarantee the whistle stops will ever occur in big-league cities again. 
 "It's a hard place to be right now," said Martinez, who was invited back by the Cleveland Indians. "It's the worst."
It is nothing like what was envisioned by the player once called Mellow Carmelo because of his engaging personality and also called a big-hit threat because of his successes with the San Diego Padres of the mid-1980's. A year after helping lead the impressive 1984 San Diego club to its one and only World Series, Martinez set personal highs in 1985, with 21 home runs and 72 runs batted in.
But it all ended in 1990, because of injury, and lack of interest on the part of the major league clubs. Although only 34 years old, Martinez has not played major league baseball since then. What did not end was his dream to continue to play, which explains the many stops in Japan, Mexico and his native Puerto Rico, where he plays winter ball each off-season.
When last seen in uniform, Martinez was hitting home runs in the Caribbean World Series, showing that he still had the tools as well as the drive needed to excel. What he has yet to show, however, is the type of drive that would propel him to Cleveland and quite obviously into the Indians' replacement starting lineup.
"I thought it was going to be easy," Martinez said. "When I came here I thought I would do it right away. Then I started thinking about it, and I said, 'Oh, no,' I said, 'I'll let you know in two days,' then 'by the 15th,' then 'by the 20th.' Next thing you know you're right there near opening day."
There has been pressure, albeit friendly, on Martinez not to play. Both his close friend Carlos Baerga, the Indians' second baseman, and his cousin Edgar Martinez of the Mariners have beseeched him not to take part in replacing them.
Martinez usually counters their pleas with questions about whether either is in position to pay him the $115,000 he might gain by opening the season with the Indians. "It's not that I need the money, necessarily," he said. "But there are some things that I could do for my daughters with it and I have to think about them. It's good money and that's hard to overlook."
Still, he sits.
While some clubs have cajoled, even pushed their minor leaguers for decisions, the Indians have not. The Indians brought ex-major leaguers like Martinez, six-year minor league free agents and second-tier minor league youngsters to camp early in February, to let them get some exposure to the Indians' system and staff.
"Then we just made an open invitation, if guys wanted to come up and play," John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said. "We only had seven guys in camp that said they wouldn't.
"They know the stakes," Hart said of the undecided players. "We don't have to explain it to them. They know. If the economics are there for them, whatever decisions they want to make, they make. But we recognize the sensitivity of it."

HEADLINE: Gloomy Reports to the Contrary, 87% of Americans Feel Healthy

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
IN a national survey that challenges doomsayers' views of American health, a Federal agency has found that nearly 87 percent of adults said their health was good to excellent.
By two measures in the survey, more residents of the District of Columbia, where political, economic and crime problems are easily evident, reported satisfaction with their physical and mental health than did adults living in any of the 49 states surveyed. This finding was among many intriguing tidbits to emerge from a state-by-state survey reported last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Only Wyoming failed to participate in the 1993 survey because it lacked money to pay for its share of the costs. 
 Dr. Matthew Zack, a medical epidemiologist at the Federal agency, said he and his colleagues were "pleasantly surprised" by the overall findings in the survey of 102,263 adults interviewed by telephone at home.
"This is good news, in sharp contrast to the usual messages we hear of gloom and doom about health," Dr. Zack said in an interview. "People in general think their health is pretty good. Though our findings might be a little overoptimistic, I don't think people are kidding themselves."
Alaskans gave themselves the highest overall health rating; the self-reported health of West Virginians was the poorest in the nation. While 91.6 percent of Alaskans rated their health as good to excellent, only 76.6 percent of West Virginians gave their health status such high marks.
When the researchers looked at the number of days during the month before the survey that were marred by physical or mental problems, the District of Columbia emerged at the top of the heap. Washingtonians averaged 28.4 days (out of the previous 30) during which they considered themselves to be in good physical health and 28.6 days during which they said they were in good mental health. Over all, they said that 27.3 of the previous 30 days were "good health days" during which neither physical nor mental problems kept them from performing their usual activities, like caring for themselves, doing their work or participating in recreation.
By contrast, West Virginians reported 25.9 days of good physical health and 27 days of good mental health, with an average of 24 "good health days" in the previous month.
New Yorkers said they were in good physical health for 26.9 of the previous 30 days, and in good mental health for the same number of days. Over all, 87.6 percent of the adults surveyed rated their health as good to excellent.
Dr. Myrna Weissman of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, who conducted a nationwide study of the prevalence of mental disorders in the 1980's, said the number of people in the current survey who reported days of impaired mental health "may or may not be trivial, depending upon how impaired they were and how persistent was the impairment."
Dr. Zack said the survey, done by random telephone dialing to reach residents over 18 at their homes, undoubtedly overestimated the health of the nation, since those in institutions and hospitals, the homeless and those too poor to have a telephone were not surveyed. Nonetheless, he said, the data provide a different and perhaps clearer picture of people's overall health status than is obtained from studies of death rates, hospitalizations and doctor visits.
"There are a lot of disabilities that people don't go to the doctor for, such as the aches and pains of arthritis that may cause them difficulty in walking upstairs or getting out of bed," he said. "And many people who are down in the dumps, anxious or stressed out may consider these emotional problems a part of life that doesn't warrant a doctor visit."
As for the findings in the District of Columbia, he said they seemed to reflect "a tale of two cities." He explained, "While there is a group within the district that is hard hit by poverty, low education and high crime, there is also a large highly educated, high-income group that does fairly well relative to other states."
The new assessment of general health, done by asking four basic questions, was conducted as part of the centers' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Each year, the state health departments question residents by phone about a long list of factors that could influence their current and future health. These were the four questions added in 1993:
*Is your health generally excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?
*How many days during the previous 30 days was your physical health not good because of injury or illness?
*How many days during the previous 30 days was your mental health not good because of stress, depression or problems with emotions?
*How many days during the previous 30 days did your physical or mental health prevent you from performing your usual activities?
More than 98 percent of those surveyed responded to the questions.
Dr. Zack said these questions were added to those asked each year of more than 100,000 adults, now including the residents of Wyoming, to help state health officials determine what public health measures might be taken to improve the mental or physical health of their residents.
"We will continue to ask these four questions annually state by state through the year 2000," he said. "We hope to identify subgroups of people with relatively poor self-perceived health and quality of life and see if we can intervene to improve their situation."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
The Backlash Against New Deal Liberalism

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

THE END OF REFORM
New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War
 By Alan Brinkley
 371 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50
In the grim winter of 1942-43, with the United States at war abroad and Franklin D. Roosevelt's advisers striving to maintain their liberal program at home, opinion polls suddenly showed that the public was becoming impatient with the New Deal, especially with the high taxes and the bureaucratic expansion that many voters saw coming with it. 
 The unpopularity of the programs with which the Roosevelt years were most associated suggests that there may be a natural limit placed by the American people on the tendency of Big Government to get even bigger, and more expensive. The suggestion, inspired by Alan Brinkley's "End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War," is that a cycle of acceptance and rejection circumscribes the liberal ambition to use the state to improve and regulate society. The public is thrilled by the liberal vision; but it is also repelled by its cost and by the anti-Jeffersonian statist philosophy it perceives lurking in the rhetorical shadows.
The country these days is once again experiencing an anti-liberal backlash, and that makes Mr. Brinkley's account of the transformation of liberalism after Roosevelt's first term very timely. "The End of Reform" is a perceptive and judicious study of the way the New Deal locomotive took on such a freight of caution and opposition that the liberals themselves abandoned their early objectives, even as they retained the New Deal label and rhetoric.
And yet, while Mr. Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia and one of our foremost historians of the mid-century, deals with the greatest issues and the central figures of the Roosevelt years, his book remains strangely bloodless, abstract, a bit dry. This is in part because in writing about the behavior of bureaucrats and bureaucracies, Mr. Brinkley too often writes like a bureaucrat himself. Moreover, he never fully flexes his historian's muscles to wrestle strenuously with the Bigger Questions about liberalism that he himself raises: whether greater daring would insure its success, or whether the American political culture itself limits its ambitions.
In his last major book, "Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin and the Great Depression," Mr. Brinkley studied American populism and its deep impact on government. "The End of Reform" looks at a different aspect of Depression-era America, beginning with a basic question: How and why did the audacity of the first Roosevelt Administration change into the cautious and constrained liberalism of later terms? The early New Deal, while not exactly anti-capitalist, was based on the idea that the flaws of capitalism, and especially the monopolistic practices of big business, had brought about the Great Depression, and that those flaws needed to be eliminated by vigilant, intrusive government.
When Roosevelt won re-election in a landslide victory in 1936, getting 523 of 531 electoral votes, elated New Dealers saw the results, Mr. Brinkley notes, as "not just a vindication of Franklin Roosevelt and his party," but also "a vindication of liberalism" itself. Setbacks came quickly, however, especially what came to be called the "Roosevelt Recession" of 1937. "By the end of the year," Mr. Brinkley writes, "liberals were expressing bafflement at the New Deal's rapid demise."
From that point until the end of World War II, the New Dealers' goal of changing the system and eliminating its flaws was abandoned, though so gradually and with such assiduous retention of the reformist rhetoric that the New Dealers themselves were unaware of the extent of the transformation. Reform gave way to the set of programs that have defined liberalism until now: not changing the system but trying to regulate it through fiscal policy; not eliminating the flaws of capitalism but creating welfare programs for people in trouble.
Mr. Brinkley's narrative of this transformation is most vivid when he colors in the role of particular individuals, some of them rescued in "The End of Reform" from historical semi-oblivion. There is, for example, Marriner Eccles, the eccentric Mormon tycoon from Utah who, as governor of the Federal Reserve, became a chief apostle of government spending as a way out of recession; or Thurman Arnold, of Laramie, Wyo., and the Yale Law School, who became Roosevelt's antitrust chief. Mr. Brinkley's account of Arnold's effort to remake the concept of antitrust action -- changing its focus from bigness in itself to an exclusive concern for the interest of the consumer -- and his failed attempt to make it a permanent feature of government activity is lucid and even gripping.
Still, it is not easy to keep up a lively pace when writing about the inner workings of government agencies and policy debates. Mr. Brinkley always manages to be clear and straightforward. And yet his tone is so unmodulated that he seldom raises the reader's pulse. His habit of falling back on lifeless phrases like "broader array of social and political forces," or "the vitiation of anti-monopoly impulses," or "fiscal measures and enhanced welfare-state mechanisms" does not help.
This tone of scholarly neutrality also masks what one suspects is Mr. Brinkley's passion for his subject. Early on, he allows that he wants to understand a "contemporary political question": why has liberalism lately become "a so much weaker and more vulnerable force than almost anyone would have imagined a generation ago"? "The End of Reform" answers that question for an earlier era, and historical precedents are always illuminating. Perhaps next time Mr. Brinkley will give his passion for the subject fuller rein, and tell us why, two generations later, reform of the New Deal type seems to have ended again.

HEADLINE: Welfare's Vital Core

 BODY:
The welfare system is at a turning point. No longer are Republican politicians arguing over how best to improve a system that all agree needs improvement. Instead, House and Senate Republicans have now agreed to eliminate the core principle of the system -- that assistance should be provided throughout the nation to all people poor enough to be "entitled" to it. With one ill-considered legislative lurch, the Republicans would destroy the beacon that has guided the system humanely for more than half a century and would leave the poor to the mercies of state spending whims.
Welfare existed long before the Federal Government got into the act. From the early 1900's, state governments helped poor mothers and the impoverished blind and elderly. But these programs often excluded blacks, divorced mothers and other "undeserving" poor. Once the Depression struck, many of the state programs went bankrupt -- driving President Roosevelt to push a Federal program of cash assistance through Congress. 
 Though Roosevelt's response was partial -- states preserved a large measure of independence -- the New Deal nevertheless delivered a historic declaration that poverty was a national problem that demanded a national response. That doctrine eventually evolved into a Federal commitment that no one, no matter where he or she lived, should go hungry. Experience showed that states, left on their own, could not be trusted to provide what the poor needed or deserved.
Sixty years later, the Republicans are on the verge of destroying the New Deal legacy. Under the intoxicating mantle of state flexibility, the G.O.P. wants to rip up Federal guarantees, known as entitlements, that promise every eligible family access to cash assistance, nutrition subsidies, medical care and child welfare programs. In their place, the Republicans would have Washington turn over fixed pots of money, called block grants, to the states to spend on the poor much as they please. States could wipe out their own contributions.
The proposed switch from entitlement to block grants would inevitably damage the poor. The Republicans would nearly freeze Federal aid over time, guaranteeing that the amount of food, clothes and shelter that poor people could buy with the money would dwindle with inflation. The harm would escalate in a recession. As poverty rolls swelled, Federal money would almost surely run out and leave newly unemployed parents in the lurch. Never mind that these parents might have paid taxes for years so that those who got into the welfare lines early would get help. The chief victims would be the young. Two-thirds of the welfare population are children.
Republican leaders insist that state governments can be trusted to look after their own citizens. But recent experience says otherwise. Over the past 20 years, states have cut the value of cash assistance nearly in half. By contrast, the one poverty program paid entirely by Washington -- food stamps -- has remained whole. Whenever the economy slows, states will inevitably refuse to commit economic suicide by raising taxes to help out the poor. Instead they will yield to pressure to cut back poor relief, which yields no tangible benefit to state taxpayers and often backfires. States that try to be generous invariably find themselves serving as a magnet for their own poor as well as the poor from every nearby state.
That is why welfare programs belong in Washington, not in 50 state capitals. There seemed hope, until this week, that Republican moderates in the Senate -- especially Bob Packwood, chairman of the Finance Committee -- agreed. Mr. Packwood knows that Congress can allow states to experiment with money-saving reforms without ripping huge holes in the Federal safety net that has taken 60 years to stitch. But Mr. Packwood, following orders from the majority leader, Bob Dole, declared that turning cash assistance -- which, unlike health care or food stamps, has no corporate constituency -- into a block grant would be dandy. That would put no requirements on how much states must spend on their own, allowing them to shrink their own welfare expenditures without suffering a loss in Federal funds.
State control of welfare is the wrong way to go. Congress has plenty of ways to help states transform welfare from a system that encourages dependency and handouts to a system that puts the able-bodied to work. Congress should reform the national welfare system, not fragment and destroy it.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Finding a New Voice

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 29

 BODY:
Halfway around the world from the battles that haunt her, an outspoken American woman found a new voice today in the words of an Indian schoolgirl, who composed a poem called "Silence" and sent it to Hillary Rodham Clinton with the handwritten exhortation: "More power to you."
" 'Too many women in too many countries speak the same language -- of silence,' " Mrs. Clinton said in a speech, quoting the poem by Anasuya Sengupta, a senior at the Lady Sri Ram College here. " 'My grandmother was always silent, always aggrieved, only her husband had the cosmic right (or so it was said) to speak and be heard.' 
 " 'They say it is different now,' " Mrs. Clinton read on, her voice catching just a bit at the end of her speech at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, a research institute here. " 'But sometimes, I wonder. When a woman gives her love, as most do, generously, it is accepted. When a woman shares her thoughts, as some women do, graciously, it is allowed.'
" 'When a woman fights for power, as all women would like to, quietly or loudly, it is questioned,' " Mrs. Clinton continued, still quoting the poem. " 'And yet, there must be freedom, if we are to speak. And yes, there must be power, if we are to be heard. And when we have both (freedom and power), let us not be misunderstood.' "
The poem had special resonance here in the world's largest democracy, where the birth of a daughter can still be an occasion for dread, where some brides are beaten or burned if their families resist in-laws' demands for a higher dowry and where sexual harassment is commonplace.
But the First Lady, who has so often felt misunderstood and who has kept her own counsel in the months since the collapse of her health-care drive, seemed to be speaking as much to herself and her fellow Americans as to the students in the balcony who exploded in applause.
"I read it and I was just overwhelmed by it," Mrs. Clinton said later of the poem, which was given to her by the college's principal, Dr. Meenakshi Gopinath, at a women's luncheon at the United States Embassy on Tuesday. "And so I was thinking last night about the speech today, and I rewrote large parts of it so that I could use the poem. I think it expressed the feelings that all of us share, that women's voices should be heard and that silence is not appropriate for women in their own lives, and women in the larger world."
Silent is one thing Mrs. Clinton has not been on this official goodwill visit to five South Asian countries, a journey that her Wellesley classmate Martha Teichner, who is covering the tour for CBS News, described jocularly on the air as a "chick trip." It blends the giddiness of a sorority spring break with the sober feel of a graduate seminar on the responsibilities of sisterhood.
Traveling with her entourage of senior aides, almost all of them women, the First Lady has sought to straddle the dichotomies of a region where most women remain subjugated, and where others have become pioneers in high political office only at the price of widowhood or parental assassination.
Mrs. Clinton has steered clear of some policy problems like nuclear proliferation that have long bedeviled United States relations with India and Pakistan, focusing instead on the importance of educating girls and women. An hourlong meeting today with Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao produced only the word that they had discussed how to improve Government performance and economic development.
In her speech today, she said the first installment in a new 10-year international aid program for educating girls and women would come to India, and the amount, $500,000, was modest enough that she did not even mention it.
At the same time, the First Lady has appeared both freer -- and a good deal funnier -- than she has seemed at home in some time. The South Asia she has seen is a freshly paved, tightly secured and somewhat sanitized version of the real thing.
In Pakistan Mrs. Clinton, a Midwestern-born Methodist, awoke at dawn to the prayer call of a muezzin over the loudspeaker of a mosque, and shared with schoolgirls her thoughts on the politics of meaning and her worries that the "rampant materialism and consumerism" of Western countries is now poised to threaten developing ones.
Asked by one ninth-grade English student in the middle-class village of Burki, outside Lahore in eastern Pakistan to name her idol, Mrs. Clinton replied, "At my age, I don't think I have anyone anymore." Asked by another girl if she had any nicknames, the First Lady replied dryly: "Some people have, I would imagine, quite rude nicknames for me."
Radiant in a billowy red silk shalwar kameez, the traditional Pakistani pajama-style pants suit, she joked to reporters after a moonlight official dinner in the red stone ruins of the Mogul fort at Lahore that she was thinking of experimenting with such a wardrobe back home, in place of the much-remarked past changes in her hairstyle.
In Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity orphanage in New Delhi, she cuddled and cooed at months-old babies with the ease of an experienced mother, never blanching when one little girl tugged at the large gold-and-pearl eagle pinned on her lapel. If she misses a sight or misremembers a story, her 15-year-old daughter Chelsea is there to point it out or correct her with exquisite poise and an air of friendship that would be the envy of most mothers.
"Educating girls is not something that is seen as something to put in banner headlines," she told a group at the Islamabad College for Girls in Pakistan, but "it is something that will change a country if it is done."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Bank Failures Undercut Venezuelan Government

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
Fourteen floors above the disconnected teller machines of the failed Banco La Guaira, Luis Raul Matos Azocar revels in his new penthouse office with its Persian carpets, leather sofas, antique tables and a small rock garden overlooking this capital's Andean valley.
"I love the sunsets," chortled Mr. Matos Azocar, Venezuela's Finance Minister. "I have never gone back to the old ministry." And no wonder. The rundown Government office center he moved from two weeks ago is notorious for its wheezing air- conditioning, exposed electrical wiring, broken elevators and padlocked bathrooms. 
 But as happily ensconced as he is in his office aerie, Mr. Matos Azocar surveys a national economic landscape littered with the ruins of not only Banco La Guaira, which failed last June, but also of 17 other private banks that went bankrupt in the last year. The collapse in banking has ricocheted through Venezuela's economy, first forcing the Government to pump $7.5 billion into the sector, or the equivalent of 13 percent of the nation's total economic output last year. In turn, that has contributed to a doubling of inflation, despite price controls, to 71 percent last year. And there is no end in sight.
With a budget deficit now approaching Mexican proportions, Venezuela again seems destined to claim the dubious distinction of having South America's highest inflation and deepest recession. That is particularly galling when -- despite the ripple effects from Mexico's collapse -- many countries in South America are doing far better than they have in years.
And just when this country of 21 million people -- the second-largest supplier of oil to the United States after Saudi Arabia -- thought it had put the worst of the bank failures behind it, a recent series of collapses has pushed the country back into an economic crisis that only sharpens political and social tensions that are never far from the surface here.
Although 100 indictments have been issued so far by the Venezuelan Government in connection with the bank failures, no banker is on trial and none are in jail. Most of Venezuela's fugitive financiers are living in Miami, where they will continue to enjoy a palmy exile unless officials, working with the United States Embassy here, can build a case for extradition.
In the case of Banco Progreso, which collapsed in mid-December, losses were originally reported at $658 million. But when outside auditors plugged into the bank's computer system, they discovered that real losses neared $2.2 billion. The fallout from that failure -- the biggest so far -- dragged down three more banks controlled by Orlando Castro, a Cuban-born financier.
"Castro had two accounting systems, maintained by a very sophisticated computer system," said Tesalio Cardenas, who resigned early this month as Superintendent of Banks. "Only police work could have detected it. We don't have computers. It's like David against Goliath."
Mr. Cardenas is being sued by a Constitutional Safeguards Court, because Government money -- a $312 million bailout loan -- was used to prop up Banco Progreso.
Somehow, between the disbursement in August and the failure in December, $353 million, transferred from the bank, mysteriously ended up in a Panama bank.
And Mr. Castro, who is wanted for questioning, has apparently gone to Miami.
Over all, $7 billion is missing in the collapses of Venezuelan banks. That leaves the Government with a huge credibility gap that makes it all but impossible to convince the public to accept the austerity measures needed to right the nation's financial ship.
Rafael Caldera, the President of Venezuela, has already gone through two finance ministers, two central bank presidents, three bank superintendents, three development ministers, four planning ministers, and eight economic plans in his first 14 months in office.
Daily trading on the Caracas stock exchange, reflecting a collapse of investor confidence, has fallen to $1.4 million, just one-tenth the level of last year.
Saddled with running about 60 percent of Venezuela's banking industry, the Government now wants to return the banks and other state companies to the private sector in hopes of raising $1.5 billion by the end of the year. By one count, the Finance Ministry has 30 high-rise buildings and 1,200 bank branches in its portfolio. But its record of privatization is thin, totaling only $11 million last year.
Aside from the oil sector, American and European investors have shunned Venezuela. Strict foreign-exchange controls imposed last June cut Venezuela's imports nearly in half.
Over the last year, the only significant investors in Venezuela have been Latin American multinationals looking to expand their reach at bargain-basement prices. Brahma, a Brazilian beer company, bought a brewery; Cemex, a Mexican cement company, acquired a cement company; and Cadenalco, a Colombian supermarket company, picked up a supermarket chain.
But if private buyers don't want to have anything to do with the ruined banks, at least some Government bureaucrats are enjoying the opportunity to move into the real estate, feathering their office nests. The Finance Minister's move was so sudden that the talking elevator still announces "Banco La Guaira." Next month, Venezuela's state tax agency plans to move into the headquarters of Banco Maracaibo, and the Superintendency of Banks is eyeing Bancor's tower.
"The Bancor building is great," said Mr. Cardenas, the ousted banking superintendent. "It has computers, it's only five years old, the physical space is perfect."

HEADLINE: Cuts Must Go to Deficit, Senate Says

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Senate today unanimously approved an amendment that would require $13.5 billion in cuts from spending in the current fiscal year be applied to reducing the Federal budget, not reducing taxes. The move was intended to blunt the opposition of Democrats to the spending-cut plan.
As the Senate began debate today on the midyear budget cuts, known as rescissions, Democrats made it clear that they would oppose the legislation unless they were given assurances that the Republicans would not use the savings to help pay for their proposed tax cuts. 
 "I will not indirectly cast my vote for tax breaks for the wealthy by voting for painful cuts that may be used to finance subsidies for the rich," said Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and the sponsor of the amendment that directed the savings to deficit reduction.
Mr. Byrd's amendment was approved 99 to 0.
With barely two weeks to go before the start of a scheduled break, the first major recess since the 104th Congress began on Jan. 4, Republicans and Democrats in committee meetings and on the floor of the Senate today debated budget cuts, tax cuts and the future of a 64-year-old Federal labor law whose repeal Democrats warned would lead to wage cuts for construction workers.
Even as the debate on the rescissions was beginning in the Senate, the Republican-controlled Committee on Labor and Human Resources was voting along strict party lines to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, the Depression-era law that guarantees that workers on Federal construction jobs will be paid the local prevailing wage. Its critics say the act is outmoded and has raised Federal construction costs by 5 percent to 25 percent.
But vowing that the legislation "will never see the light of day," Democrats said they would filibuster the bill when it reached the Senate floor for debate.
On the House side of the Capitol, an even bigger partisan battle was brewing.
In what amounted to a preview of the debate on tax cuts scheduled for next week, the sharp divisions between Democrats and Republicans and the deep intraparty splits took shape in testimony before the Rules Committee. Republicans argued that their tax proposals would lead to a stronger economy with more jobs, while Democrats countered that the Republicans were pandering to the rich.
Democrats tried to use each of the issues to build a case against the Republicans in the court of public opinion and to turn the image of Republicans pitting the rich against the poor into a campaign theme.
"This is part of a mosaic that has to be at the heart of the whole national debate and discussion," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. "I know that isn't what the last election was all about, and I think the American people are not going to accept it."
The Senate version of the midyear budget cuts targets nearly $4 billion less than the $17 billion package that passed in the House nearly two weeks ago. The major cuts still would come from social, labor, education and veterans' programs.
Among the major differences is that the Senate excluded House-approved language to cut the entire $1.3 billion from the Low Income Energy Assistance Program. That program provides heating oil in the winter to poor families in the Northeast. Also, the Senate version calls for $1.2 billion more in cuts for transportation than the $700 million that the House approved.
The Senate proposed rescinding $231 million in military construction money, while the House bill contained no such cuts.
But the most significant differences lie in cuts affecting the Federal Government's huge social service agencies.
In the House version, the Veterans Administration-Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee outlined a $9.3 billion cut to agencies and programs under its control and the Labor-Health and Human Services Subcommittee identified $5.9 billion in reductions to programs it oversees. But the Senate legislation recommends a $6.8 billion cut for the V.A. and HUD.and a $3.05 billion cut for Labor and H.S.S.
The committee vote to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act followed a similar move in a House subcommittee earlier this month.
"Davis-Bacon is a good example of legislation that needs to be reviewed," said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources
The committee members spent just short of an hour debating the bill before the nine Republicans on the 15-member committee defeated a Democratic amendment to save the law and then approved Mrs. Kassebaum's bill to repeal it.
"It may make it out of committee, but I guarantee that it won't make it anywhere on the Senate floor," Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said before the final vote. "I will do everything I can to stop it. If that means a filibuster, then that's what it'll be. But it will never see the light of day."
Easily, the most passionate debate of the day was over the tax issue.
When the Rules Committee met today to set terms for the debate over the $189 billion package of business and personal tax breaks, the leadership faced unusual opposition. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, touted the leadership's bill, which Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia calls the crown jewel of the Contract with America. But a band of Republicans argued that the $500-a-child credit to families should be limited to those with taxable income of $95,000 rather than $200,000, and sought the right to propose such an amendment.
A second band, led by Representatives Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, and Glen Browder, an Alaska Democrat, contended that the nation cannot afford tax breaks with the Federal deficit untamed. They asked for the right to offer an amendment that would allow the tax reductions to take effect only after progress had been made in lowering the budget deficit.
The House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, proposed a tax cut of his own -- one that would allow deductions for families with annual incomes below $75,000 -- to help offset the cost of college tuition. Mr. Gephardt's proposal is similar to one made by President Clinton.
The Rules Committee, an arm of the Republican leadership, will not announce which amendments will be allowed until next week, after Mr. Gingrich and other leaders make their choices. Mr. Gephardt's will most likely be allowed, as a courtesy; leaders suggested today that no others would survive .
Mr. Gingrich nevertheless opened negotiations with the Republican dissidents, led by Mr. Upton, who want to make tax cuts contingent on deficit cuts. Mr. Upton and Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican, say they have enough Republican support to overturn the Rules Committee's decision on the House floor, and thus keep the tax bill from reaching a vote.
The two met with Gingrich emissaries this afternoon and Mr. Castle said the meeting went well. "The idea," he said, "is that maybe we can work something out."

HEADLINE: Students Protest Education Cuts at Rallies Around U.S.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 29

 BODY:
Students at universities around the country held rallies, marches, teach-ins and vigils today to protest both proposed Federal cuts in education and the Republicans' Contract With America, which they said was responsible.
At Emory University here, where about 300 students rallied while President Clinton held a regional economic conference, speakers included the university's president, William M. Chace, and representatives of homosexual student groups. At Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., students built a shantytown of cardboard boxes that they called Newtville after Speaker Newt Gingrich and some began a four-day hunger strike. In New York City, students dressed in black held a mock funeral march from Battery Park to City Hall. 
 Still, few of the events, many of them staged by liberal student groups and billed as the first student protest movement organized over the Internet, drew large numbers. And while it was clear that proposed cuts in student aid struck a raw nerve across a broad cross section of students, it was far less clear whether the issue would galvanize a broad movement of student opposition.
Republicans in the House have called for $1.7 billion in cuts in money already appropriated in the $34 billion Department of Education budget for the 1995 fiscal year and have proposed $20 billion in higher education cuts over the next five years, including ones in student aid and loan programs.
At a rally with students later in the day, Mr. Clinton encouraged them to voice their complaints.
"I want you to enter the debate by determining what is best for you," the President said after outlining his differences with Republicans in Congress. "Stand up for education, and stand up for the future."
To be sure, not all students opposed the cuts.
At Georgia State University here, where no protest was planned, David Prigge and Chris Alford, both physical therapy majors, said they had no problems with the proposed education cuts. "I personally believe the deficit is maybe the No. 1 issue that needs to be addressed," Mr. Prigge said, "and everyone has to bite the bullet."
But many others, whether demonstrating or not, said that any cut in financial aid could endanger their ability to get an education.
"I'm an undergraduate on financial aid," said Matt Jordan, a sophomore at Yale University, where about 100 students held a protest today. "I'm going to have to pay $40,000 in loans when I graduate. I want to fight having to pay $60,000."
Organizers said more than 105 campuses in at least 34 states participated in demonstrations today. At Connecticut College, about 150 students marched from the New London campus to City Hall. At the University of Michigan about 150 students marched through Ann Arbor, stopping briefly at a police station to discuss crime issues.
Some events met organizers' expectations.
At Bowling Green State University in Ohio, Annette Wannamaker, a graduate student in literature, was pleased by the turnout of 300 students at a rally and teach-in.
"This is a sleepy little university in the Midwest, and we've just had the best turnout for our rally and teach-in," she said. "I think on a very basic level, students, even those who don't call themselves liberals, are interested because it's going to affect their student loans."
Here at Emory, Dr. Chace, the university president, lent his support to the demonstrators, saying there had been a contract with America from the nation's inception that included investing in people and the nation's future.
"This year, the Federal Government allocated $31 billion as part of a contract with America to student financial aid, and Emory received about $42 million of that money," he said. "It has made this institution stronger. It has made you stronger. It has made the future stronger. It absolutely must be retained."
Still, some Emory students said that while they did not like the education cuts, they approved of other parts of the Republican agenda.
"I could think of a thousand and one things that should be cut before education," said Andrew Halverstam. "Nevertheless, I support the Contract With America as a whole."
Some students said protest was an option that today's hard-pressed students could not afford to take part in the way students of the 1960's could.
"The difference is we are working ourselves to death," said Stacey Green, a senior at Fresno State University in California.
Others said that student protest was just not for them.
"There is a romanticism about protesting," said Stuart Rosen, 21, an Emory student. "Their parents did it while they were in college."

HEADLINE: Clinton Opens Drive on Economic Gains

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 29

 BODY:
President Clinton engaged in an all-day public discussion of the Southern economy here today as he began a yearlong campaign to overcome a political conundrum: that his standing with the voters remains mediocre despite the nation's economic health.
The South, a leader both in economic vitality and in antipathy to Mr. Clinton, may be the region where that difficulty is most pronounced. But from early this morning until late this afternoon, in a regional conference at Emory University, the President demonstrated just how relentless he intends to be in trying to subdue it. 
 In opening remarks that set the tone for similar conferences he plans across the country, Mr. Clinton said he understood the reasons for American unease: primarily, he said, stagnant wages and a decline in job stability. But he told dozens of business leaders and other guests invited to the forum by the White House that apprehension should not obscure clear signs of progress.
"If you look at what has been achieved in this state and in this region for the last 10 years," the President declared, "there is a lot more room for hope than for doubt."
The gathering today was modeled on the session that Mr. Clinton convened in Arkansas shortly before taking office, and its trappings were familiar as he presided over one panel discussion after another from the center of a horseshoe-shaped table.
But in contrast to that December 1992 conference, which was in part a celebration of the victory he had achieved after a campaign in which he pledged to make the economy his top priority, today's gathering was motivated more by concern about how little credit he had received in the months since.
More than 40 percent of the jobs created in the United States in the last two years have been in the South. With a regional unemployment rate of 5.2 percent, the 13 states that were the focus of today's conference are now faring half a percentage point better than the nation as a whole. Donald Ratajczak, an economist who is an expert on the region and has sometimes been critical of Mr. Clinton, used an opening presentation today to paint a picture of the South as "a dynamic region of the country."
But after winning the electoral votes of 5 of the 13 Southern states in 1992, Mr. Clinton has seen a plunge in his popularity that has been more precipitous in the South than in any other region. In choosing the South as his setting to kick off the new drive, Presidential aides said, he is calculating that early and intensive attention may restore his fortunes.
Mr. Clinton, who traveled on to Florida tonight for a three-city tour, began his visit here with a speech on Tuesday evening before organizers of the 1996 Olympic Games, saying he expected them to "stun the world" with their performance. The Atlanta Olympics will fall between the Republican and Democratic National Conventions next summer, and Mr. Clinton made clear that he intended to play a prominent role in them; a President who did not do so, he said, was bound to be "a one-termer."
In an interview published today in The Atlanta Constitution, Mr. Clinton said he saw no political purpose in the economic conference here. And during today's proceedings, he refrained from all but the most general criticism of Congressional Republicans.
But among the business leaders, economists, community leaders, students and others assembled for the discussions, more than a few took up the attack, including Elena Hanggi, director of the Institute for Social Justice, a liberal advocacy group in Little Rock, Ark. None of the participants, who also included such prominent executives as Ronald W. Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines, and Elizabeth Coleman, chairwoman of Maidenform, criticized Mr. Clinton.
The White House also circulated fact sheets listing "what President Clinton's accomplishments have achieved" in each of the 13 states. And with 29 Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials roaming the South this week to underscore those accomplishments, it was plain that the Administration regarded the event as an opportunity of considerable moment.
Mr. Clinton allowed himself to pose the question that has been a preoccupation of his political advisers. Referring to gauges that have shown sustained economic growth and declining unemployment since he took office, he said, "You may wonder with these numbers, which are better than we've had in decades, why poll after poll after poll says that people think the country is not going in the right direction."
The explanations offered by Mr. Clinton focused on stagnant wages and increased job instability, factors that he said had left many Americans insecure even in a thriving economy.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. WILL ORDER PHONE COMPANIES TO CUT ACCESS FEE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission will order the nation's local telephone companies on Thursday to reduce the access charges they impose on long-distance carriers by about $1 billion a year for the next few years, agency officials said today.
The rate cuts could translate into one of the biggest single reductions in long-distance telephone costs since the breakup of the Bell System a decade ago. 
 Consumers are likely to see somewhat lower long-distance prices, though long-distance carriers like AT&T, MCI and Sprint will try to keep as much of the reduction for themselves as the market will allow. This comes at a time of intense competition for consumer business by these big carriers, marked by barrages of television and print advertising.
The access charges the long-distance carriers pay to connect to local telephone networks constitute about 40 percent of the cost of a long-distance call and total about $27 billion a year nationwide. Access charges are also the biggest source of profit for local telephone companies, and the rates have come down very gradually over the last decade.
A typical long-distance call from New York to Los Angeles can cost 10 to 27 cents a minute, depending on the time of day and a customer's discounts. But long-distance carriers must pay about 4 cents a minute to each local phone company on either end of the conversation -- 8 cents a minute on average.
Consumer-advocacy groups and the long-distance carriers have been lobbying the Government for months to push these prices down sharply, charging that the Bell companies have been able to enrich themselves unfairly.
Government officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said today that the new rules would reduce these local charges about 4 percent a year for the next few years and begin to take effect this summer. That reduction would roughly double the average decline in access charges in recent years, they said.
While the amounts may be unnoticeably small for individual calls, they add up to very large amounts of money when multiplied by the billions of phone calls made every year.
The F.C.C action is intended as part of a grand bargain in which the local phone companies, in exchange for lowering access charges, would be free to keep more of the profits they can make from long-distance access services by cutting their own expenses. Until now, the F.C.C. has put a limit on the profit the local companies can make from these access services.
In addition, the agency plans to develop rules over the next few months that would give the local companies much greater flexibility in the way they allocate costs in pricing various services.
"The goal here is to reinvigorate competition among long-distance companies by reducing the cost of access," said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the commission, who refused to discuss any precise details of the plan.
Executives at the regional Bell companies were hesitant to comment on the new rules before they were made public officially. But they were clearly unhappy, in part because they contend that the F.C.C. was taking only modest initial steps to let them retain more of the profit they generate through cost-cutting.
"It's unfair," said one executive, complaining that the Bell companies had already reduced their access charges significantly over the last four years. Frank Gumper, vice president for Federal regulatory planning at the Nynex Corporation, added, "This will obviously cause us to reduce some of our rates faster than we had planned."
The new rules also fall well short of the reductions sought by consumer groups and long-distance carriers.
"This is chicken feed," said Brian Moir, Washington counsel for the International Communications Association, a group that represents large business customers. The association, in an alliance with the Consumer Federation of America and long-distance carriers, had argued for rate cuts that would total about $2 billion a year.
The debate over access charges raises many of the most difficult issues swirling through the communications industry, particularly at a time when local and long-distance carriers are gearing up to invade each other's markets.
Local telephone companies, dominated by the regional Bells, concede that many of their prices are artificially high -- in part because of regulatory policy and in part because they still have a near-monopoly over much of the local phone market.
Commission officials, prodded by consumer groups and long-distance companies, have wanted to force those prices down. At the same time, however, they have been at least partly receptive to the idea that local telephone companies should be given more freedom to reap the benefits from their cost-cutting.
The new rules will modify a regulatory system of price limits that were adopted four years ago. Under such limits, regulators impose a ceiling on the prices a telephone company is allowed to charge and they permit the local phone company to retain more of the profit it can realize. But under those rules, phone companies that earn a rate of return higher than 12.25 percent above their costs have to start giving back the excess profit in the form of subsequent rate reductions.
Commission officials said that they were still haggling over precise details, but had reached agreement on several basic points.
First, the F.C.C. will essentially reduce access charges by 2.8 percent this year -- which the agency estimates will yield rate reductions to the long-distance carriers of about $500 million for the rest of 1995.
But the commission will change the formula under which telephone companies are allowed to adjust the price ceilings for inflation. At the moment, these ceilings can be adjusted up by the rate of inflation, but also down by an amount that reflects the improvements in productivity. The theory here has been that telephone companies should pass along some of the benefits handed to them by the soaring advances in technology.

HEADLINE: Officials Say U.S. Is Unlikely to Meet Clean-Air Goal for 2000

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
In a move that seems likely to reduce their leverage at a global conference, Administration officials conceded today that the United States was unlikely to meet President Clinton's goal of limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The admission, though not a surprise, is expected to make it far harder for American officials at a global climate conference now under way in Berlin to persuade other countries to reduce output of gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere much the way glass traps heat in a greenhouse. 
 Convinced that emission of the so-called greenhouse gases is causing global warming, the Clinton Administration is trying to take the lead to get countries to make new and firmer pledges to cut such emissions well into the 21st century.
In the 1992 presidential campaign and again in April 1993, Mr. Clinton pledged that the United States would meet the 2000 goal. In the campaign, he criticized President George Bush for rejecting that goal, set at the 1992 Earth Summit conference in Rio de Janeiro. At the time, Mr. Bush and others in his Administration said that limiting the gases, which result primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, would damage the American economy.
Today, however, several Administration officials acknowledged that the United States was unlikely to meet Mr. Clinton's goal.
"It's going to be very hard," said one White House official. "You could say the way things look now we may be a little short."
At a recent news briefing, Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and head of the American delegation to Berlin, said the United States would probably miss the goal by a wide margin.
In an interview today, he was somewhat less pessimistic. Still, in previously discussing the most important heat-trapping gas, carbon dioxide, Mr. Wirth estimated that the United States would emit 30 million more tons of carbon in 2000 than it did in 1990.
In 1990, the United States emitted 1.3 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. That level would rise to more than 1.4 billion tons by the year 2000 without energy conservation measures, Mr. Wirth said, but he predicted that energy conservation steps the Administration will put forward would limit the emissions to about 1.33 billion tons.
The Administration has relied primarily on voluntary and cooperative measures, like providing technical assistance to companies to install more efficient lighting and heating systems. Energy efficiency is vital to reducing emissions because carbon dioxide is produced by burning coal, oil and natural gas, the fuels that make modern economies run.
Environmental officials in the Administration say that emissions of heat-trapping gases have increased more rapidly than expected over the last three years and are almost 5 percent above 1990 levels. They cite several reasons: economic growth has been strong, fuel prices have been relatively low and the Administration was unable to win Congressional approval of an energy tax that was to be a cornerstone of the its efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Administration officials say that tax would have cut carbon emissions by 25 million tons annually by the year 2000.
Many environmentalists cite another reason for rising emissions -- that the Administration has not sought stricter fuel efficiency levels for automobiles for fear of alienating companies and consumers.
Mr. Wirth said today that Vice President Al Gore was overseeing development of further steps that would be announced in October to fulfill Mr. Clinton's commitment.

HEADLINE: House Subcommittee Initiates a Bill to Establish a Board to Manage Washington's Finances

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
A House subcommittee today voted unanimously to establish a board that would essentially take over the financial management of the District of Columbia. The city, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, faces a deficit of about $400 million.
The legislation would create a five-member board, which is modeled on the financial bailout agencies used for New York and Philadelphia. It was described by staff members who worked on the bill as "the strongest ever created" for any American city. The board, which will be selected by the President and Congress, will control the city's spending and will set up an annual balanced budget, as well as a four-year financial plan for the city. 
 The bill retains some degree of home rule for the mayor and the 11-member Council. Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. will be able to select two new officials provided for in the bill, the chief financial officer and the inspector general. But his choices must be approved by the board, and only the board can dismiss them.
The board will control the finances until the city balances four budgets in a row and repays any money borrowed with the board's cooperation. In addition, any money the city borrows in private markets would need approval by the board.
The bill is expected to be taken up by the full House next week, where few difficulties are expected. To go into effect it would have to be approved by the Senate and President Clinton, who has said he supports such an authority.
House Republicans said their goal was to have the board in operation overseeing the city's finances by the end of April.
After years of what some have called chronic overspending, muddled accounting practices and ignored signs of trouble, the city was found to be essentially bankrupt after Mr. Barry took office. Many in the city, however, say the situation is mainly a result of its being the nation's capital and having so much Government property that it cannot tax.
"Measured by the desperate condition of the city and what I have been able to get included in this bill, I concluded a few hours ago at the end of the final negotiating session that I could become a co-sponsor," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate in Congress.
The bill approved by the Oversight of Government Management subcommittee avoided efforts by some House members to include nonfinancial matters, including lifting the city's ban on guns and imposing an anti-abortion measure.
This afternoon, members of the subcommittee emphasized that the bill won bipartisan support, playing down the tough compromises that went into it.
"This is a major bipartisan effort," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the Virginia Republican who heads the subcommittee. "This bill does not abolish home rule. It is not designed to micromanage."
Mr. Clinton, in consultation with Congress, will appoint the board members. They will serve with no compensation for an initial three-year period and must be residents of the District or pay taxes to the city, including business fees or wage taxes.
In Atlanta, Mr. Clinton made clear that he would support a financial oversight authority for the District. He said his Administration had closely worked with Congress in drafting the bill introduced today and was ready to work further with it to determine what help might be appropriate.
"The financial crisis in the District is serious and demands immediate attention," Mr. Clinton said. "Although other cities have suffered similar problems, Washington D.C. plays a uniquely important role in the nation's life. It is the nation's capital and is important not just to the people who live there but to all citizens of the United States."
"I care deeply about the District and its residents," he said. "They deserve a government that delivers municipal services efficiently and effectively."
Mr. Davis said today that the bill's path in the House would be smoothed because of the interest Speaker Newt Gingrich has in it.
Representative Gil Gutknecht, the Minnesota Republican who is vice chairman of the subcommittee, said Mr. Gingrich had been at some negotiating sessions on the bill.
Speaking this afternoon at the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, Mr. Gingrich talked about the negative effects of welfare citing the Anacostia section of Washington as an example of the "destructive undermining of the poor".
"You are in the national capital of the greatest country in the world," Mr. Gingrich said. "And you have citizens in your capital who we have abandoned as though they were not Americans and were not endowed by God."
But David Clarke, chairman of the City Council was not appeased.
"We wanted to be able to review contracts over a million dollars among other things," said Mr. Clark. "Instead we will be talked to. We will be notified. It's a disappointment."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Picks Miami as Base for Latin America Command

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
In a decision that could bring 1,500 new jobs and thousands of additional visitors to Florida, the Pentagon today selected Miami as the next headquarters for United States military activities in Latin America.
The announcement was timed to coincide with President Clinton's arrival in Tallahassee, Florida's capital, this evening. "The President was going to be in Florida and has good news to share with them," said a senior White House official. 
 At the airport in Tallahassee, where he arrived this evening after a daylong economic conference in Atlanta, Mr. Clinton told a welcoming crowd that the regional military command was "working to promote democracy," and added, "The center of that effort will be in your state."
Florida, which will have 25 electoral votes in the 1996 Presidential election, had powerful Congressional support for two of the six sites the Defense Department was considering: Miami and Tampa.
Military officials said they concluded that Miami was the best choice after considering the cost, quality of life for military personnel and the city's standing as a cultural, business and transportation hub of the Americas.
Miami civic leaders have estimated that the new headquarters will provide 1,500 new jobs, 10,000 additional visitors a year and a five-year infusion of $100 million in the local economy.
With United States forces scheduled to withdraw from the current headquarters of the Southern Command in Panama by 1999 under terms of the Panama Canal Treaties, the Pentagon's search for a new home for the command had touched off a mad scramble among six communities. Besides Miami and Tampa, the Defense Department was also considering New Orleans, Atlanta, Washington and Puerto Rico.
At a time when the Pentagon is closing scores of military installations nationwide, the new headquarters offered a rare opportunity to win a major headquarters with 700 military and civilian employees and a $27 million annual payroll.
The Southern Command is responsible for United States military activities in 19 countries in Central and South America, excluding the Caribbean and Mexico. The command, which now has 8,500 troops in Panama, provides humanitarian aid, wages an aggressive anti-drug campaign in the region and protects the Panama Canal.
Some losers said they would demand an explanation from the Defense Department. "We hear it's very, very close and so we are now asking for them to show us their cost analysis," said Representative Robert L. Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee and was pushing hard for New Orleans.
Indeed, Pentagon officials said if cost -- including moving expenses and cost of living -- were the only criterion, New Orleans might have been the cheapest site. But senior military officials said cost was only one factor that the Pentagon weighed. Others included quality of life for military personnel, good schools for their children, good airline connections and strong cultural ties to Latin America.
Of four sites in the Miami area, the Pentagon said today it would seek to develop a 140,000-square-foot headquarters at the United States Coast Guard base at Richmond Heights, in southern Dade Country.
The building's planning and design will continue through next year, as will environmental impact reviews, with construction to begin in 1997 or 1998. The military wants to move in by late summer 1998. Pentagon officials said the total cost of the project would be about $60 million.
"Obviously, we are thrilled that the President has made Miami the choice for the Southern Command headquarters," said Carlos Palomares, the chief executive of Citibank Florida, who is chairman of the Beacon Council, an economic development organization in South Florida.

HEADLINE: Orange County to Vote on Tax

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., March 29

 BODY:
Although they showed no enthusiasm for the prospect of a half-cent increase in the sales tax, Orange County's supervisors decided early today to let the voters decide whether to impose the increase for the next 10 years to help pay for investment losses.
For years Orange County has prided itself on avoiding tax increases, but three months after risky investments plunged the county into bankruptcy, the mood here has changed. That paved the way for the board's 5-to-0 vote at 1:20 this morning in favor of putting the tax increase, which will be known as Measure R, on the June 27 ballot. 
 The sales tax increase of 0.5 percent would be added to the current rate of 7.75 percent to help the county make up for $1.7 billion in investment losses.
One Supervisor, Marian Bergeson, said it was not her intention to raise taxes when she was sworn in, but "we have all taken a dose of realism."
A second Supervisor, Jim Silva, said he was unhappy with the prospect of a tax increase but believed the voters should decide.
Without a sales tax increase, Mr. Silva said, the county will be unable to meet its financial obligations.
Although most of the 50 or so speakers who addressed the supervisors before their vote opposed the tax increase, there was powerful support for letting the voters decide from speakers representing the League of Women Voters, labor unions and others.
Angela J. Keefe, president of Local 681 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, said the 5,000 workers she represented were on the county's lowest economic rungs and stood to be hurt the most by a tax increase. Nevertheless, Ms. Keefe said, the workers would be willing to support Measure R.

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes Opening Power Cost and Supply To Competition

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Federal agency that oversees the nation's utilities approved a sweeping proposal today to force utilities to open their transmission systems to competitors.
The proposed rule, which would greatly increase competition, would eventually bring down wholesale rates, if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides to put it into effect later this year, as expected. However, the changes could be modified after all sides have the chance to comment. 
 Strictly speaking, the proposal affects only the transmission of power to wholesale customers like big industrial plants, not to retail customers like homeowners. But opening wholesale competition is expected to have a ripple effect, eventually lowering the cost of electricity for all customers.
Robert Glynn, executive vice president of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in San Francisco, the nation's largest investor-owned utility, said, "This is one more step toward the competitive electric industry of the future." He added, "Most people think that greater competition will lower prices."
The proposal would require 137 investor-owned utilities to allow outside access to their transmission grids on the same basis that they use the grids.
Charles E. Bayless, chief executive of the Tucson Electric Power Company, said: "This will make it easier for wholesale buyers like smaller utilities and independent power producers to get access and sell their power. This will also help insure that the lowest-cost producers are the ones that will tend to deliver the power."
Utilities would have to file prices for transmission service with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and to disclose their transmission costs.
Elizabeth A. Moler, who heads the commission, an independent body within the Department of Energy, said at a meeting today: "Clearly, this commission is not introducing competition to the electricity industry. Competition has introduced itself. Marketplace economics have changed. Customers are simply demanding access to lower-cost supplies from the other regions and access to newer, lower-cost generation resources."
The pressure for the changes has come from independent power producers, which have rapidly grown and have many plants that produce cheap surplus power. The independents want to sell that surplus over the big investor-owned utilities' transmission grids.
Even though they are required by law to transmit outside suppliers' power, the big utilities, afraid of losing customers, have often stymied the independents by making them go through a long process of getting orders from the commission on a case-by-case basis. These utilities have also used the information filed for such orders by their smaller rivals to go after the same customers, often beating them out.
The aim of today's order is to equalize opportunities so that outsiders will have the same information and the same cost of using the grid as the utility owning the transmission system.
Opening the system is expected to make it increasingly possible for industrial customers to build their own power plants and to sell the surplus or to buy power directly from independents, rather then from their local utilities.
Because in many cases, utilities have had to build power plants and transmission lines specifically to serve big industrial sites, this could leave them with what are called stranded costs -- assets that are underused and that would become an economic burden. That, in turn, could lead to overall rate increases and declines in the utilities' stock prices. To avoid such results, the commission proposed a way for utilities to recover their costs.
This recovery provision would allow utilities to file requests with the commission to recapture costs, either by making a customer who leaves the system pay an exit fee or by allowing an extra charge for power transmission.
Mr. Glynn of Pacific Gas and Electric said the industry was pleased that the commission had recognized the possible costs and had provided a means of recovery.
Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group that represents many investor-owned utilities, said that thanks to the recovery provision, the proposal today would not undermine investor confidence.
The five commissioners who met in Washington all said that they could not just throw open a transmission system without allowing utilities to recover from the losses that could result. But they were unanimous, as well, that it was time to end inequities in power transmission.
"Now is the time to eliminate the transmission-market power of the utilities over which we have jurisdiction," said one of the commissioners, William L. Massey. "How can there be truly robust competition if buyer and seller can't reach each other?"

HEADLINE: Single-Family Home Sales Lowest in Nearly 3 Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell a larger-than-expected 14.0 percent in February to the lowest level in almost three years, even as mortgage rates dipped below 9 percent for the first time in four months.
All regions of the country reported declines. The largest came in the West, where flooding devastated communities in California and sales made their sharpest drop in 13 years. 
 "Builders have been telling us that higher interest rates are weakening demand, hurting sales and stamping out the housing recovery," said Jim Irvine, a home builder from Portland, Ore., who is president of the National Association of Home Builders.
Total sales decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 551,000 -- the lowest since April 1992 -- after rising a revised 2.6 percent in January, the Commerce Department said. A month ago, the Government estimated that January sales increased 3.8 percent.
The outlook for the rest of the year is not promising, builders said.
"In 1995 we'll experience less business -- how much less, we don't know," said Tim Eller, president and chief executive of the housing subsidiary of the Centex Corporation of Dallas.
The drop in housing has also led to declines in the appliance industry. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said shipments in February fell in all six major categories -- ranges, washers, dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators and freezers. Before today's report, economists had expected a 3.7 percent decline in February new home sales.
The drops are seen as a result of the Federal Reserve's board fight to hold down inflation by pushing up interest rates, which makes housing more expensive for buyers by raising monthly mortgage payments.
Robert Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said the question now was whether the economy will grow at a more modest pace in 1995 and 1996 -- or slide into recession.
"The economy is trying for a landing," Mr. Dederick said. However, the sharp decline in home sales "doesn't tell us whether it's soft, hard or in-between," he said.
Though borrowing costs are higher than a year ago, mortgage rates have been moving lower since December. After peaking at 9.25 percent in December, mortgage rates fell to 8.73 percent by the end of February and to 8.40 percent last week. New home sales should decline by 6 to 7 percent this year, while starts of new construction are likely to drop even more, by 12 to 13 percent, said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
In today's report, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped by 28.5 percent in the West in February to an annual rate of 118,000; fell 10.7 percent in the South to 266,000, declined 8.8 percent in the Midwest to 104,000, and decreased 1.6 percent in the Northeast to 63,000.
The supply of homes for sale nationwide increased by 1.7 percent in February to an annual rate of 350,000 -- the largest since June 1990, just before the last recession started -- while the inventory of vacant homes climbed to a 7.7-month supply.
The Commerce Department also reported today that the average price of a new home increased by 5.6 percent, to $155,700 in February from $147,400 in January.
"People simply don't feel good enough about job prospects or job security to buy a home," said Edmund Woods, president of the National Association of Realtors, regardless of where mortgage rates stand.

HEADLINE: End of Urban Agency Draws Fears of Neglect

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Seventeen floors above 125th Street in Harlem, Donald J. Cogsville was reluctantly preparing to move out of his corner office, with its expansive windows and sweeping views of Central Park and the Hudson River.
"We've been cut out," said Mr. Cogsville, the chairman and chief executive of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, as he sat surrounded by architects' renderings and scale models of grand development projects, many of which never came to be. 
 Although he acknowledged that creating jobs and growth in the ailing economy of Harlem had been difficult, Mr. Cogsville said he still could not understand why, after 23 years, the Pataki administration had decided to shut down the corporation and fold its activities into the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
That move "leaves the future of this community to outsiders," he said.
"You can't develop Harlem from downtown," he said. "You have to be here, constantly pushing, out there all the time."
Charles Gargano, Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development, said that eliminating the Harlem organization as a separate entity would promote efficiency and save $3.5 million a year. He pointed out that financing for another economic development group in western New York was also eliminated in Gov. George E. Pataki's final proposed budget.
The elimination of the corporation will not become official until the Legislature passes a final budget, but no one expects the agency to win a reprieve, and the office could shut down as early as this week, when the fiscal year ends.
The demise of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation comes as Congress has approved plans for the creation of a Federal empowerment zone, using investment and tax breaks to lure businesses to Harlem and parts of the South Bronx. But the empowerment-zone effort faces a threat from the Pataki administration, since the Governor's budget plan includes only one-tenth the amount the state had originally planned to contribute to its creation this year.
State legislators have said they hope to persuade Mr. Pataki to increase the empowerment zone allocation in the budget.
The Harlem Urban Development Corporation, set up in 1971 by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, was intended to spur housing and commercial development by attracting private and public investment in blighted areas of Harlem.
"We fought so desperately hard to get the Harlem Urban Development Corporation," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a founder of the agency. "This seems like the end of development in Harlem as we have known it."
Another co-founder, the Rev. William M. James, said the state's action ignores the organization's purpose. "It came about so that we could have a say in our own destiny," said Mr. James, the agency's board chairman.
But like many urban economic development groups that emerged during that era, the Harlem agency had difficulty in attracting investment. By the late 1970's, after modest success building low-income housing, the organization's leaders decided that the only way to attract commercial development would be to keep middle-income residents from leaving.
With Mr. Cogsville at the helm, the organization sought to develop housing on neglected city-owned property, which in 1980 accounted for about 65 percent of the land in Harlem. It teamed with local developers and housing groups to help plan and negotiate financing for more than 6,500 mixed-income housing units in the area. Other housing groups also developed projects, and since then the land in Harlem owned by the city has decreased to about 35 percent, according to the agency.
But the group's success in creating jobs and expansion has been far more limited. It did play a major role in revitalizing 125th Street, helping to renovate the legendary Apollo Theater and negotiating to bring many retailers onto the strip. Still, by 1990, the unemployment rate in Harlem had reached 13.4 percent, compared with 11.1 percent a decade earlier, and 30 percent of the population was living in poverty, according to Federal census figures.
The development corporation has also attracted criticism from community residents and state officials. William Stern, who between 1983 and 1985 was the chief executive officer of the State Urban Development Corporation, said many people viewed the organization as ineffective, and he criticized it for wasteful spending. "Not much that they did ever worked or had anything to do with the economic development of Harlem," said Mr. Stern, a Harlem native who is now a private investor in New York City. The agency and other local urban development groups "are something better done without," he said.
Mr. Gargano said $500,000 had been kept in the state budget to pursue capital projects in the Harlem area, but many of the agency's 42 employees, including Mr. Cogsville, will lose their jobs at the end of this week. Those who remain will move to state offices in lower Manhattan.
Mr. Gargano said Mr. Cogsville's office on 125th Street might be taken over by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. That department is headed by Commissioner Joseph Holland, a Pataki appointee and businessman from Harlem who has been a critic of the organization. After all, "the space is going to be available, and we have a lease there," Mr. Gargano said.

HEADLINE: Suddenly Put on the Defensive, Pataki Takes to the Road to Do Battle for His Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: NEW CITY, March 28

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki hunched forward in the metal chair and stared intensely at the student with the nose ring, someone else upset about his budget: It would increase state college tuition, close campuses, hurt poor people, hurt single mothers, hurt her, she said.
As she spoke, the Republican Governor fidgeted like an excited student waiting to answer. "By far the most important part of this budget for students, for you, for everybody, and you might disagree, is that we are going to start creating jobs in New York State," he finally blurted out, karate-chopping his hands together. "We want you to get a decent, good, affordable higher education in New York, and get a job." 
 No chance meeting, the encounter between the Governor and the student was arranged for reporters as part of an aggressive campaign to sell Mr. Pataki's first budget, using commercials, letter-writing drives and personal appearances by the Governor across the state. [In an unusual move, Mr. Pataki also plans to deliver a five-minute statewide television address Thursday night calling on voters to support his budget.]
Mr. Pataki's campaign, which hit full stride just this week, comes as he has been thrown on the defensive by a multimillion-dollar media and lobbying blitz by opponents of his plan to cut taxes, cut spending and require able-bodied welfare recipients to work.
Mr. Pataki is also struggling to overcome a series of public-relations setbacks this week, which included his retreat from a threat to close down state agencies if the budget is late and efforts by some Republican allies to get him to delay future phases of his four-year tax-cut plan.
Now, in the most critical battle of his young administration, he finds himself being outspent by opponents and having to fight for votes in the divided Legislature. Given that backdrop, even supporters say his budget road show, which has taken him to eight cities in seven days, is belated.
"Certainly coming out earlier would have helped," said Rick Zimmerman of the Farm Bureau, an agricultural industry group that is financing radio commercials supporting Mr. Pataki's budget. "But I think the Governor still can help his case by articulating his vision."
Mr. Pataki and his allies, chiefly the state Republican Party and business groups, have sought to build pressure on Democratic and Republican lawmakers, mainly from upstate, by flooding their districts with letters, phone calls and television and radio commercials endorsing the Pataki budget.
But at the heart of the campaign is Mr. Pataki himself, whose amiable personality and regular-guy style, his advisers believe, make him an effective pitchman for a budget that opponents have attacked as heartless to the poor and generous to the rich.
It is a difficult task, given that Mr. Pataki's promises are for unspecified future economic growth, while his opponents' warnings are of sharp and immediate pain. "The other side needs only to say this threatens the foundations of civilization, details to follow," said David Shaffer, secretary of the Business Council, a lobbying group that supports Mr. Pataki. "His job is tougher."
Mr. Pataki has attempted to sell his policies by emphasizing the notion that, above all, they are reasonable. In Rochester last week, he told 800 Rotarians that the State University "will still be the most affordable in the Northeast" even after he cuts its aid by 31 percent.
At a Chamber of Commerce meeting outside Buffalo the same day, he said New York will still have the largest college tuition assistance program and still spend more per Medicaid recipient than any other state even if his budget passes unchanged.
Two days later in Poughkeepsie, he told 600 business leaders that cutting welfare will allow "people to develop a sense of self-worth and confidence and dignity." He also said that a welfare mother who works a minimum-wage job two hours a week will take home more money per month under his plan than under current policies.
And here in New City, he said that New York would still have higher income tax rates than its neighboring states at the end of his four-year plan, despite critics' claims that it cuts taxes too quickly, too deeply.
Everywhere he goes, he cajoles his audiences to lobby their legislators to support his plans. "I welcome your support and your willingness to get out there and tell your legislators and tell the people of this state that this budget is what we need to restore people's confidence in the future of New York State," he said in Hamburg, near Buffalo.
Everywhere he goes, Mr. Pataki also encounters protesters, usually state workers, state university students and advocates for poor people. At times, he wades into their ranks to debate his policies. But in Rochester, he entered a Rotary Club luncheon through a basement entrance to avoid demonstrators, only to have a woman hand him a bouquet of dead flowers as he stepped onto the podium.
Like an accomplished miler, Mr. Pataki has the ability to appear as if he is loping even as he runs hard. In New City, he slouched nonchalantly in a chair while fielding questions from about two dozen business representatives in the office of the Rockland County Executive, C. Scott Vanderhoef. But his answers were crisp and well-received, particularly when he pledged to reduce red tape, cut business taxes and lower utility costs.
"It was kind of inspirational," said Barry Hersh, a project manager with Reynolds Metal Corporation. "I got the feeling he really means it."
After his session with the business leaders, Mr. Pataki's aides ushered into the room five college students who had been demonstrating against his budget outside. But though he talked to the group for nearly 20 minutes, offering assurances that poor people would not be denied college educations under his budget, he won no converts in the group.
"He just met with us because he knew it would look good for the press," said Bobta Kim, 19, who carried a cardboard gravestone that read, "R.I.P. CUNY."

HEADLINE: Private Research Unit Sees Big Shortfall for Whitman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 29

 BODY:
A respected nonpartisan legislative research group predicted today that the state would take in $680 million less in revenue than Gov. Christine Whitman has anticipated, raising serious questions about her ability to deliver another round of tax cuts.
The prediction by the research group, the Office of Legislative Services, represents the widest forecasting discrepancy with a Governor's budget in at least a decade. Last year, the projections by the group and Governor Whitman were nearly identical. 
 Administration officials said they had used a different method to make their forecast this year, one that anticipated a larger surge in tax revenues when people start paying their taxes next month than the research group predicted. They also said the group's forecast about the state's business outlook was too pessimistic.
"We are not trying to palm off a rosy scenario to your committees," Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, said in defense of the Governor at the opening of the annual budget hearings today. "But rather, to make as reasonable and as informative a forecast as we can."
If the usually reliable legislative research group is correct, however, the $680 million discrepancy is a serious blow. The Governor was counting on having to find only $300 million of cuts plus additional revenues, in a $16 billion budget.
Democrats pounced on the gap in forecasting, accusing the Whitman administration today of cooking its revenue outlook. They said the administration was trying to quiet growing concerns among even some Republicans over the wisdom of enacting Mrs. Whitman's full 15 percent tax cut this spring, a year ahead of her original schedule and months before the impact of Federal cuts in state aid are known.
"We have been saying that tax cuts are great if you explain how you're paying for them, and the Governor has failed to do so," said Tom Byrne, the state Democratic Party chairman, when the legislative figures were released this morning. "It is becoming abundantly clear that a billion in gimmicks and shifts to property taxes wil not only hurt her budget but every New Jerseyan's."
Senator Bernard F. Kenny, the ranking Democrat on the joint Assembly-Senate budget committee that conducted today's hearing, said: "Let's be clear. Governor Whitman is not lifting the tax burden from hard-working New Jerseyans, she is only shifting it from one pocket to another."
Last year, the difference between the administration and the legislative forecasts amounted to less than a hundredth of one percent, but the contending forecasts, on which all budgeting is based, differed by 3.3 percent this year.
Revenue forecasts predict how much money the state will collect in taxes and fees during a budget year, and they are often the subject of dispute. Over the years, however, the legislative forecasts have usually proved to be more accurate than those of the administration in office.
The problems for the Whitman administration are compounded by forecasts from Rutgers University predicting that that the state economy this year is not likely to match last year's level of job creation and tax receipts, which made the Governor's last round of tax cuts possible.
Mr. Clymer, the treasurer, said the administration used a different method to forecast revenues for the budget, which takes effect on June 30.
Besides charging the legislative group with misreading minor parts of the Whitman budget proposal, Mr. Clymer said that the legislative agency's forecast failed to anticipate a surge in income tax receipts, as taxes are collected next month, because of 1994's robust economy.
Because it is a neutral arm of the Legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, the office did not reply to Mr. Clymer's charges. In his presentation to the joint budget committees, however, David J. Rosen, the office's chief forecaster, said that New Jersey's state receipts might, if anything, turn out to be lower still.
The legislative group assumes a gradual slowing of economic growth, Mr. Rosen said, but some economists think that the Federal Reserve Bank's interest rate increases "may precipitate a more drastic slowdown in economic activity."
"If this alternative view proves correct, our revenue estimates are too high."
In addition, Mr. Rosen reminded the committee that the Governor's revenue forecasts depend on the enactment of many small taxes and fees, like a tax on the savings from store discount coupons, that many members of the Legislature oppose. If all these small money-makers are not enacted on schedule, he said, revenues will fall still more.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slumps as Dealers Expect No Rate Change to Ease Pressure

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against leading currencies yesterday as dealers increasingly saw little chance that interest rate changes would provide any relief for the currency.
Dealers sold dollars yesterday in anticipation that the Bundesbank would not lower interest rates at its policy meeting today . A similar selloff occurred on Tuesday, when dealers, anticipating that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates at its policy meeting, pushed the dollar lower. When the Fed left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday, the dollar fell further. 
 Higher interest rates help a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it more attractive.
"A combination of the Fed's inactivity and rising expectations of no Bundesbank activity have taken a bite out of the buck," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Statements today by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, calling for a strong dollar helped the currency pare its losses.
The dollar dropped as low as 88.04 Japanese yen before settling in New York trading at 88.43 yen, down from 88.90 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also touched a low of 1.3737 German marks, its lowest since March 8, when it reached a post-World War II low of 1.3455 marks in intraday trading. The dollar settled at 1.3825 marks, down from 1.3882 marks.
Relatively strong economic growth will probably keep the Bundesbank from cutting rates today, analysts said. The economy grew 2.5 percent in western Germany last year.
"With wage settlements not satisfactory enough, I think the Bundesbank will hold back" from a rate cut, said Ken Nixon, currency adviser at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in New York.
Some unions in Germany have reached labor settlements that included annual wage increases of nearly 4 percent. Bundesbank officials have expressed concern about large wage increases.
While interest-rate concerns weighed on the currency today, "Rubin's and Summers's comments have helped the dollar" rebound from its lows, said Stephen Flanagan, currency dealer at Credit Agricole in New York.
Mr. Rubin said on CNBC television that the Clinton Administration believed a strong dollar was good for the economy. And Mr. Summers told a Washington trade conference that a "strong dollar is in America's national interest."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A gritty campaign from DDB Needham seems to be the medicine Digital Equipment needed.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
FOR DDB Needham Worldwide, it was one of the toughest assignments possible for an advertising agency: persuade people to buy big, expensive products from a company when everyone thinks the company is dead or dying.
The solution, since last fall, has been chin-up bravado and television commercials so irritating that no one could mistake the company for dead. The campaign moves into a new phase next month. 
 Last summer, the Digital Equipment Corporation, a big computer manufacturer, certainly looked like a goner. From a 1987 peak of almost $200 a share, its stock price had plummeted to barely $20. Cumulative losses since 1991 totaled $5 billion, or close to the gross domestic product of Iceland.
Even the company's top marketing officer, Charles B. Holleran, has adopted a kind of gallows humor. "You're calling me?" Mr. Holleran said at the beginning of a recent interview. "You're going to pay for the phone call? Good! We could really use the money."
New management, under Robert Palmer, the chief executive, had been furiously cutting costs and reorganizing the business for months, but by last summer the company realized it needed to get its advertising and marketing house in order, too.
For years, Digital, with a multitude of products, had used a multitude of ad agencies, as many as 77, with Ketchum Advertising in Pittsburgh and Young & Rubicam in New York being the largest of the American agencies. When the company was making money, it didn't matter that Digital's message was fractured.
But when it was hemorrhaging money, Digital had to reassure customers, suppliers, and perhaps even its own staff and executives, that the company was still in business. Last summer, Digital executives asked five ad agencies, including DDB Needham Worldwide, to pitch the account.
Surprisingly, DDB Needham not only had a basic strategy but also specific creative ideas for a campaign. "It had stopping power," recalled Mr. Holleran about the DDB Needham pitch. "It was gritty as opposed to pretty."
DDB Needham executives knew they had their work cut out for them, even before they won the $90 million account in August. When potential customers on a test panel were presented with identical ads for personal computer products, but each with a different Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., or Digital logo, they rated the Digital ad as much as two-thirds lower in believability.
The company's financial problems created "an ugly algebra of fear and doubt," said Mike Rogers, executive creative director at DDB Needham. To twist around the negative perceptions of the company, Mr. Rogers, DDB Needham's executive creative director -- along with Tony Romeo, Giff Crosby, David Nathanson and John Staffen -- brainstormed ideas for days before the pitch.
They hit upon the idea of a series of stark, quick-cut TV commercials tied together with a signature coda of take-no-prisoners rock music as well as a series of print ads related to the TV campaign.
And they pursued the unusual media strategy of buying commercials mostly on Sunday. The commercials would boom out of the television set and the fast editing would light up a quiet Sunday morning living room like a strobe light.
Typical of the approach was a commercial that began with a stinging guitar chord, followed by quick cuts of scenes of tornadoes, flood and fire.
"When billions of dollars' worth of mission-critical computing is threatened," booms the urgent voice-over, "who do people call?" Then, the Digital logo appears, then lettering like that punched out of plastic labeling tape appears. "Hell Has Our Phone Number," it reads.
Perhaps the boldest ad was one that ran only twice on Thanksgiving. "Some of the contracts we've won lately," reads the same style of labeling tape, as the same heavy metal music blares. Names like Navistar, Rockwell and Blockbuster Entertainment Group appear. Then a shot of what looks like a medieval engraving of Death with a scythe.
"Today's Score," the label continues. "Digital 15, Grim Reaper 0."
While the effectiveness of corporate awareness campaigns is often hard to measure, Mr. Holleran of Digital said that consumer awareness had risen 13 percent and that Digital had received as many as 3,000 calls on a Sunday to its "800" number for more information.
Perhaps more importantly, Digital has reported a profitable second quarter, and Wall Street analysts project a narrow loss for the year as well as a profit for the 1996 year ending June 30.
Now, the campaign is entering a more settled phase, too, with advertising returning once again to specific products and services, but with the same bat-out-of-hell approach.
A recent ad, playing off recent computer hacker cases but conceived before the arrest of Kevin Mitnick, contends that Digital has some of the toughest computer security services in the business.
"For more information on how tough Digital security is," reads the labeling tape, as the picture of a prisoner comes on the screen, "Contact Inmate Number 23-38AA3872, Leavenworth, Kansas."

HEADLINE: Heavy Angst When It's 'Ivy or Else'

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., March 26

 BODY:
Within easy reach in the green canvas backpack that Karen Sumberg carries to high school is a pocket-size daily planner that helps her track all the assignments, volunteer activities, projects and club meetings that are crammed into every free hour.
Ever since sixth grade, Karen's daily life has been circumscribed by all she must do to reach her self-imposed goal of getting into a top-tier college. "You are always asking yourself, 'Are they going to like this or that?' " said Karen, a sophomore, as she strode across the marble foyer of Temple Beth El, in Norwalk, where she spends Sunday mornings as a religious-school aide. 
 By 1 P.M. she was ladling fruit salad at a soup kitchen. Later she rushed home to change for a swim club awards dinner, at which she was honored as co-captain of the senior team (sportsmanship wins points on a college application, too). Many evenings she practices her vocabulary skills on a computer in the family room. Last summer, she completed an S.A.T. prep course at Wellesley College. She has joined a Model United Nations debating club and has even taken up rowing.
"I want to go where I want to go," Karen said. "I don't want to settle for where I can get in. And the schools look for these things. Grades alone aren't going to do it."
Determined? Yes. Unusual? No. Getting into an increasingly rarefied list of the nation's most prestigious colleges, once a status symbol, is now perceived as a survival issue by families who see a future dogged by diminished opportunities, a stagnant economy and heightened global competition. And more students from places and circumstances where the Ivy League once seemed too remote are competing for all they're worth.
"You have to do more than be a good student," said Jennifer Hong, 15, of Dunwoody, Ga., who has joined the Future Business Leaders of America even though she intends to be a pediatrician.
The Ivy-or-bust mentality is evolving as a defining issue from earliest childhood. It haunts the games students play, the vacations plans they make, relationships with parents and friends and even the sports they choose.
Harvard University was deluged with a record 18,000 applications for the 1,600 places for men and women entering in 1995, up 50 percent from 12,000 applications in 1990. The University of Pennsylvania was similarly swamped with 15,000 applications this year, compared with 10,600 five years ago. Applications to Princeton University have also climbed, from 12,600 in 1990 to 14,200 for 1995. All three universities say the odds have never been tougher.
The amount of down time in these youngsters' lives is disappearing rapidly. The two largest national tutoring services that focus on S.A.T. preparation, Kaplan Educational Centers and the Princeton Review, each enrolled more than 30,000 student in their after-school classes in 1994, almost double the number of five years earlier. In the last five years, Kaplan has added 1,000 satellite classrooms to its 150 learning centers as demand has grown from Tullahoma, Tenn., to Minot, N.D., said Jonathan Grayer, the president of Kaplan.
And the demand for their services is coming at an ever-earlier age. Three years ago, the Princeton Review introduced a junior level, for grades 7 through 10. More than 5,000 now attend.
"Parents are asking us for S.A.T. prep even for our eighth and ninth graders," said Marcia Evans, president of Academic Study Associates in Armonk, N.Y., a company that provides summer enrichment programs at five universities. Duke University, a pioneer in summer programs for the mathematically gifted, today serves about 6,000 children a year.
College expectations are even redefining the hot sports. "You see kids giving up baseball for lacrosse," said an 18-year-old from Wilton High School in Wilton, Conn., who asked that her name not be used. Lacrosse, she says, often leads to big Ivy League scholarships. Crew is another popular choice, because it is seen as an easy way to stand out.
The pressure to succeed is also touching the lives of the very youngest children. Educational toys have become the fastest-growing category in the industry, according to Playthings magazine, a monthly trade journal. Stores like Egghead Software have entire shelves of products for toddlers.
The emphasis on beating the competition is so profound even in kindergarten and first grade that children think they must win all the prizes "just to feel 'good enough,' " said Maria Alba-Fisch, a child psychologist in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
The regular rankings of colleges by U.S. News and World Report and Money magazine, plus "The Bell Curve," the recently best-selling book by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray (Free Press, 1994) about America's intellectual elite, have contributed to the angst. So has the latest boomlet in the birthrate, called the baby boom echo, plus the rising cost of an undergraduate degree, which can now top $100,000.
Educational counselors have found that parents are reluctant to spend a huge sum on a college without a prestigious name. But the pressure can "drive a wedge" between parents and their children when it starts too soon, because the children can't always see the point, warned John Katzman, president of the Princeton Review.
Antoinette Saunders, a clinical psychologist working with children in Wilmette, Ill., warned of increased rebellion and resentment and even drug or alcohol abuse among less able children.
Many parents say it is a no-win situation. "It's the way we give our children the very best chance for their future," said Toni Peebler, a Manhattan mother of a 14-year-old son. "The child might be more relaxed if the pressure were off. But try being the only boy in a class of 20 who didn't get into the Harvards of the world. It's not only their future but their self-worth that's in jeopardy."
Others argue that a busy schedule is healthy. "Being involved in a multitude of activities has helped Karen find her strengths," said Ilene Sumberg, in Norwalk. But what about the stress? "When we think she's going into overload, we talk about where she can pull back," Mrs. Sumberg said. "It's a way to learn priorities." Karen says she is learning to become an efficient time manager, adding that it helps her enjoy her tight schedule rather than resent it.
Anwar Bennett, 15, of Decatur, Ga., who has set his sights on either Cornell or Vanderbilt, lets out the tension by playing soccer or golf. Yet, he sounded melancholy as he recalled the fun of being the "class clown," a role he relished until ninth grade, when his parents sent him to parochial school and private after-school tutoring. Things had to change, he said, because "as a black youth, you're afraid you'll get even less opportunities if you don't get into a good school."
The cutthroat college competition can warp friendships. "If you get a really good grade in math, then everyone else in the class gets mad at you," a student observed at a focus group in Wilton on college pressures. Betsy Kahan, a clinical psychologist in Wilton and a former consultant to the town's public schools, said it was particularly tough for a successful girl to develop relationships with boys who viewed her as a competitor.
To keep friends and appearances, "kids lie to each other about their grades and their scores," said Amanda Rose, executive director of Stanford Coaching, a Manhattan service that provides private tutors. Typically, she said, a child will call a friend to find out how much time has been spent studying for a test. The friend, who may have been working for six hours, may say, "Only half an hour," to prevent the other from doing as well. Lisa Jacobson, president of the company, knows youngsters who do "all nighters" with their books and coffee.
The top colleges insist that they're not to blame and that the panic emanates from rising applications and wider economic concerns. "We're hearing it's statistically much harder to get into the right kindergarten in some cities," said William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions.
Yet, the pressure to excel may also be coming from a change in attitude toward financial aid by the colleges. At a conference on higher education held last month at Spelman College in Atlanta, one paper reported a nationwide shift toward basing financial aid on merit. "So extra-curricular activities have to be even more impressive," said Alison R. Bernstein, director of the educational and cultural program at the Ford Foundation and a former associate dean of the faculty at Princeton. And this, she added, will further separate the rich and poor. "You will lose a lot of kids whose parents can't give them that extra leg up."
Claire Gaudiani, president of Connecticut College, says that ivy has crowded people's vision too much. "Ninety-eight percent of our 1993 graduates have gone on to graduate school or are employed," she said. "The Fortune 500 companies actively recruit on campus, and we see starting salaries in the $40,000-to-50,000 range."
But Ms. Jacobson said, "You can say to a child, 'Don't worry, it doesn't matter where you go,' but with all the peer pressure and hype, the kids won't believe you."
She urges parents to remove themselves from the "me too" trap and to show a child, through specific examples, that many roads lead to success in life. "Otherwise," Ms. Jacobson said, "those children may never know the sheer joy of just being a kid."

HEADLINE: House Proud

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
ONE side of the two-family house has a new kitchen with a neon banana hanging over a grand piano. The other side also has a new kitchen -- with a sedate collection of Staffordshire plates over an oak table.
David B. Waters and Don Sturdy live side by side. They met 13 years ago, were housemates for five years and then drifted apart -- until one needed a partner to buy a house. Now, they live together again -- in mirror-image half houses with completely different decor. 
 With the aid of an architect friend, Mr. Sturdy and Mr. Waters enlarged what one of them called a "dark and dreary doll's house" and created two distinct maisonettes that can either be closed off -- they once had two dinner parties simmering on the same night -- or combined into a single drawing room suitable for a raucous party for 40.
Their plan called for a new addition off the back that created twin living rooms with back-to-back corner fireplaces. They also built a cantilevered, double-story bay window on each side. They remodeled extensively, creating the two kitchens and two new bathrooms with skylights, and they redid the second-story bedrooms and installed new plumbing and wiring -- all for $80,000.
They were able to pull off this financial sleight of hand because their friend, Adam Schoenhardt, became their architect, drawing up plans with the skill of a budget-minded Houdini. They also did all the scouting for salvaged building materials, appliances and furnishings. Mr. Sturdy -- the one with the neon banana -- dug up an Art Deco bar in a Boston warehouse, sunk a sink into it and put it in his bathroom. Some of their best bargains came from discount catalogues and hardware chain stores.
Mr. Waters, who runs the Hasty Pudding Club's restaurant at Harvard, was tired of paying $1,000 in rent every month. But as his search for a reasonably priced house propelled him deeper into the suburbs, he realized he couldn't afford the house he wanted -- where he wanted it -- unless he found a partner.
He thought of Mr. Sturdy almost immediately. Mr. Sturdy, a singer and music manager who is an assistant treasurer for the Wang Center for the Performing Arts, was amenable to buying a place with Mr. Waters but insisted on some conditions he thought would be hard to fulfill. "I would only do it if we got a side-by-side duplex," he said. "I like symmetry, and how would we ever decide who would get the upstairs and who would get the downstairs if we did it the other way?"
As it turns out, side-by-side houses are indeed rare; Mr. Waters estimates that there may be only 20 in all of Boston. He was living on Chilton Street when he saw a FOR SALE sign go up on a dilapidated two-family home a block away. It was in a pocket of six identical houses built in the 1920's for workers at a nearby brick factory.
"Stuff in the neighborhood was all $300,000 to $400,000," Mr. Waters said. When he learned that the asking price for the house on Concord Avenue was $230,000, he said he almost fell over. But the reason for the price soon became obvious.
"It never had any work done to it," Mr. Sturdy said.
"The house had a certain amount of charm, but it was ridiculously small and humble," Mr. Waters added. The two men bargained and later signed a contract for $204,000.
"By dumb luck, we hit the very bottom of the mortgage market," Mr. Waters said. They got a mortgage fixed at 6 percent for 10 years, with no points and 10 percent down. Closing costs were held to $1,500.
Before the bank gave the two men a definite commitment, it demanded a signed contract with a building contractor; to pick a contractor, the two men had to have plans to show. Mr. Schoenhardt saw only half the house for 10 minutes, discussed the concepts briefly with the new owners and delivered the plans the next day.
"We went, 'Uh, huh,' and that was that -- he got it exactly right," Mr. Waters recalled.
By "pinching the envelope," as Mr. Schoenhardt said, and opening up every possible space to new windows, he was able to reconstruct a 1,900-square-foot house into one of 2,500 square feet that feels as spacious as one of 3,500 square feet.
Besides adding the new 28-by-15- foot space at the back of the house and the 9-by-2.5 foot, double-story bay windows, the architect also opened up the kitchens, which lead to the new sunken living rooms. Instead of spending $8,000 for twin masonry fireplaces, the owners opted for metal fireplaces, which cost $2,000.
The design of the two halves is identical; the decor is not. Mr. Waters categorizes his taste as "more like a room in an Edwardian club." Mr. Sturdy gives new meaning to the word "eclectic": "My artwork is 80's and 90's and my furniture is 20's and 30's," he said.
The two kitchens are an interesting case study in tastes -- and pocketbooks. Mr. Sturdy, 39, who is also a part-time chef, chose a $2,000 Viking restaurant stove and pickled maple cabinetwork ($3,800). To economize, Mr. Waters chose to cover his counters with laminate and trim them with cherry wood. He did without upper cabinets, saving $1,200.
"I'm an old New Englander," the 35-year-old restaurateur said. "If I paid full price, I paid too much. I found a church podium at a junkyard in Maine -- and turned it into a dictionary stand."

Profit at Deutsche Bank Declined 39% in 1994

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's largest bank, said yesterday that bond trading losses slashed its profit by 39 percent, to 1.36 billion marks ($980 million), in 1994. The managing board chairman, Hilmar Kopper, said profit would rebound amid confidence that 1995 would be a better year for financial markets.
Operating profit, which is before taxes but after provisions for bad loans, fell 23.1 percent, to 4.05 billion marks ($2.92 billion). 
 In a prelude to grim trading reports expected from other German banks, Mr. Kopper said the profit slump was essentially a product of a global bond-market collapse that started after the Federal Reserve of the United States raised interest rates in February 1994. (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: Tale of Evasion Of Ban on Aid For Guatemala

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, in a show of public anger over the killing of an American, cut off military aid to Guatemala in 1990 but secretly allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to send millions of dollars to the military Government to make up for the loss, members of the Bush and Clinton Administrations said today.
The payments apparently continued into the Clinton Administration but it could not be learned if they are still being made. 
 About $5 million to $7 million flowed annually from the C.I.A. through the agency's Guatemala station to the military, the officials said.
The delivery of funds started after the White House formally halted military aid approved by Congress, a public display of frustration at the Guatemalan military's failure to assist in the investigation of the killing of the American, Michael DeVine, the officials said. Mr. DeVine, an innkeeper in the northern forests, was killed by Guatemalan soldiers in June 1990.
Two Bush Administration officials familiar with the payments, who insisted on not being identified, said the money did not buy weapons but went to mollify the Guatemalan military and to pay C.I.A. sources.
"The agency ran this program on the basis that it was the key to keeping U.S. policymakers informed about what was going on within the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan military," one official said. But he noted that it did not buy crucial information about the death of Mr. DeVine.
The apparent contradiction between the public policy and the approval of secret funds raises the question of how deeply committed the White House and the C.I.A. were to investigating Mr. DeVine's death.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has linked a C.I.A. agent, Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez of the Guatemalan Army, to the killing of Mr. DeVine and to the death of a guerrilla leader who was married to an American lawyer.
The White House, acting for the first time in the matter, has begun an inquiry into the killings, and said late tonight that the National Security Agency, the electronic-eavesdropping branch of United States intelligence, had secured an area where "document shredding is allegedly occurring." The White House gave no further details.
The White House also said it had ordered all relevant agencies to preserve documents and had instructed the Justice Department to begin a formal investigation.
President Clinton also plans to ask the Intelligence Oversight Board, senior officials charged with reviewing United States intelligence activities, to review the case of Colonel Alpirez.
Within the Bush Administration, some officials said, there were arguments over whether the Administration was being hypocritical by sending contradictory messages to the Guatemalan military.
"Guatemalan military officers told us: 'You guys are crazy. You shut us down in public, and then you give us stuff through the back door, and everyone in the military knows it,' " one Bush Administration official said.
The C.I.A.'s payments to the Guatemalan military apparently fell under the veil of a "liaison" relationship with a foreign intelligence service, the Bush Administration official said. The details of such relationships are rarely shared with Congressional oversight committees, though it is not known whether Congress was informed in this instance.
The Bush Administration's public decision to withhold military aid to Guatemala in 1990 came as its Ambassador, Thomas F. Stroock, was protesting increasing rights abuses in Guatemala and the inability or unwillingness of political leaders there to assert control the army.
Washington cut economic aid to Guatemala to $113.4 million in 1990, from $141.3 million in 1989; military aid fell to $3.3 million, from $7 million. In 1990 the State Department also placed Guatemala on its list of major drug-trafficking countries.
Mr. DeVine was kidnapped and nearly beheaded by members of the Guatemalan military in June 1990, and left by the roadside near his inn in Poptun, a village in the Guatemalan jungle. His body was discovered near a Guatemalan Army Special Forces training camp run by Colonel Alpirez, the officer accused by Representative Torricelli of complicity in the murder. At the time, the colonel was on the payroll of the C.I.A., Mr. Torricelli says.
Ambassador Stroock said in an interview that he dispatched his military attache, Col. Allen C. Cornell, to interview Colonel Alpirez at his jungle base but that the attache was rebuffed.
Mr. Stroock said he went to see the C.I.A. station chief after Colonel Cornell reported the incident.
"I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Are any of your 'assets' involved in this?' " the former Ambassador said. "And he said no. And I believed him. I had absolutely no idea that Alpirez was a C.I.A. asset."
But Mr. Stroock said that after Colonel Alpirez refused to cooperate, he told senior officials at the American Embassy that they were not to help the colonel again.
Colonel Alpirez received at least $60,000 from the C.I.A. between the time of the killing and the end of his financial relationship with the C.I.A. in the summer of 1992, Administration officials have said.
In December, after Ambassador Stroock had tried and failed to persuade the Guatemalan Government and military to find the officers responsible for the death of Mr. DeVine, the Bush Administration halted military aid to Guatemala.
In addition to $3.3 million appropriated that year, millions more in the pipeline were withdrawn, said a third former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Bush and Clinton Administrations.
"The DeVine case was a big issue with us," he said. "It was the central issue between the United States and Guatemala, and we were breaking their arms and legs over DeVine. We were very angry."
This official said he was certain the C.I.A. did not inform the State Department and the National Security Council that Colonel Alpirez was its paid agent, even after the State Department received intelligence reports in 1991 that the colonel was implicated in the DeVine case.
"This raises a very serious question," he said. "The C.I.A. absolutely knew that the U.S. Government at the highest levels was confronting the Guatemalan Government and insisting they investigate. They knew it was a central issue in U.S.-Guatemalan relations. For them not to have disclosed that to State and to N.S.C. is a serious issue."

HEADLINE: Electricity Rates Are Frozen For Con Ed and Lilco for Year

 BODY:
Electricity rates will be frozen this year for customers of Consolidated Edison and the Long Island Lighting Company under rate plans approved yesterday by the State Public Service Commission.
The commission approved a three-year rate plan for Con Edison that involves no increase for the first year, beginning April 1. 
 The plan, on which the utility and the commission's staff had reached agreement in January, allows the company to raise rates in the second and third years to cover rises in some of its costs, including contracts with independent power producers, property taxes and interest rates.
Con Edison had initially sought a 3.6 percent rate increase. The commission's staff had proposed a rate cut.
In contrast, Lilco had proposed no increase in its base rates for two years and a 4.3 percent increase in 1997.
The commission acted only on the first year of the Lilco plan, approving the rate freeze with some modifications. But it said that if Lilco could match the cost-cutting programs already adopted by other companies, it would not need rate increases for years.
A Lilco spokeswoman, Elaine Davis, said the rate decision was "just what we expected." She said the company had already cut costs and reduced its work force of about 600,000 by one-tenth in the last several years.
But the commission chairman, Harold A. Jerry Jr., said the company had not done enough. "I think they can do more and do better," he said.
Many on Long Island had hoped the commission would impose a rate cut. Long Island officials and business leaders have long said that high electricity rates have hindered economic growth and forced businesses to leave.
"The decision is a disappointment," said Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority. "Basically, the rates Lilco wanted were approved. If people were looking for rate relief, they are going to be disappointed. I would call today's decision a nonevent."
The authority, a Lilco watchdog created by a 1986 state law, had called for a 2.6 percent rate decrease.
The decisions yesterday were the first by the commission since Gov. George E. Pataki took office. Mr. Pataki named Mr. Jerry as chairman to succeed Peter A. Bradford, who resigned. He also appointed John O'Mara to a commission seat.
Commission officials said that Lilco's rate freeze for 1995 was attained by reducing the amounts Lilco will be required to spend for conservation programs, research and development and customer service.
Lilco spent more than $30 million for conservation programs in 1994. It will be required to spend about $12 million under the rate plan approved yesterday.
Mr. Jerry and other commissioners said the cost reduction strengthened the company, but they expressed concern about Lilco's high debt and any ill effects the rate decision might have on the company's bond rating.
Richard W. Cortright Jr., a utility credit analyst at Standard & Poor's Rating Group in Manhattan, said he expected no immediate impact on the company's bond rating.

An article yesterday about a plan to freeze rates charged by the Long Island Lighting Company misstated the number of people it employs. It is 6,000, not 600,000.

HEADLINE: Maj. Gen. John M. Dunn, 69, Military Aide to Vice Presidents

BYLINE: By J. MICHAEL ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
John Michael Dunn, a veteran of three wars who rose to become a major general and a military aide to two Vice Presidents, died on Friday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 69.
The cause was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, said his son Alan. 
 At the time of his death, General Dunn was president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, a national trade association, a position he had held since 1976.
He was on the staff of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in the second term of President Richard M. Nixon. After Mr. Agnew's resignation in the fall of 1973, General Dunn stayed on to serve his successor, Gerald R. Ford.
He began his stint on the Vice-Presidential staff as a military assistant and rose to become an assistant in charge of foreign and economic affairs and finally chief of staff. He handled relations with the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Science and Technology.
He stayed on the Vice-Presidential staff until early 1974, when he retired from the military and became the principal assistant Secretary of Commerce for domestic and international business. Later that year, he became executive director of the Council on International Economic Policy, a Presidential advisory group. He was also a liaison between the White House and Congress on economic affairs.
Born in Los Angeles and reared in Natick, Mass., he needed his mother's permission to enlist in the Army at age 17. After serving in World War II, he entered Harvard University, graduating in 1949. He returned to the Army as an officer and fought in the Korean War.
During his career, he received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, Silver and Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart with two oak-leaf clusters and the Commendation Medal with oak-leaf cluster, among others.
From 1963 until 1965, he was personal assistant to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in South Vietnam and executive secretary at the American Embassy in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.
He earned master's degrees in public affairs and international affairs and a doctorate in political science, all from Princeton University. He was also a graduate of the Command and General Staff College and the National War College.
Besides his son Alan, of Alexandria, Va., he is survived by his wife of 44 years, Mary Frances Hobbs Dunn; another son, Neal, of Panama City, Fla., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Declined Last Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month, the Labor Department said today. Analysts said the decline suggested that moderate job growth was continuing despite a slower economy.
First-time applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 338,000, down 10,000 from the week that ended March 18. 
 It was the first decline since claims fell by 12,000 in the week that ended Feb. 25. Claims rose during the next three weeks, the first three-week string of increases since last April.
In fact, the report said claims during the week that ended March 18 were higher than the initial Government estimate of 346,000.
Despite the decline last week, the closely watched four-week moving average of weekly jobless claims continued to rise. The average was 341,750, up from 340,250 in the period that ended March 18 and the highest since 347,750 in the period that ended last July 30.

HEADLINE: Stocks Generally Shrug Off The Bundesbank's Action

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Germany's surprise interest-rate cut electrified the international currency markets yesterday and sent the dollar higher, but stock traders appeared to take little notice.
Indeed, against most expectations, the stock market closed mixed but mostly down yesterday. 
 After the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, announced its rate cut, the dollar surged more than 2 percent against the German mark to 1.4083 marks in New York, theoretically giving foreign investors an incentive to buy American stocks and bonds. It did not work out that way.
True, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.76 points, to a record 4,172.56, setting its 10th record closing high this month. But the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 companies fell 0.90 point, to 502.22, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 2.30 points, to 816.86.
Prices for bonds also dropped. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.41 percent from 7.37 percent.
"What the bond market and maybe the broader stock market are saying is that the rise in the dollar is not going to last long," said David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank.
Emotion may be at work as well. "The market is very nervous at these price levels," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jeffries & Company, referring to a Dow nearing the 4,200-point level.
Because today is the end of the first quarter, both stock and bond markets may experience more volatility than usual, as portfolio managers use their last day to buy and sell assets to meet performance targets.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavier than normal with nearly 363 million shares changing hands, about 10 percent more than this year's daily average of 330 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.01 point, to 271.83, with advancing stocks outpacing decliners 1,310 to 825. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.66 points, to 465.01.
Among the biggest gainers were shares of Circa Pharmaceuticals Inc., a drug maker, which rose 6, to 23 3/4, after Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. agreed to buy the company.
Shares of the James River Corporation rose 3, to 26 3/8, after the forest products company said it would spin off a subsidiary. Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker and favorite of institutional investors, rose 2 1/2, to 56 3/8 a share.
Among the biggest decliners were Exx Inc., a toy maker. Its class A shares fell 5 1/8, to 19 3/4, on the American Stock Exchange and its class B shares fell 5 1/4, to 18 3/4, despite a large rise in fourth-quarter profits.
The Chipcom Corporation, a computer-equipment maker, fell 4 1/4, to 38 a share. As with other high-technology stocks, some traders believe Chipcom's share price is too high.
The most active stock, at 10.2 million shares, was that of the Intel Corporation, which fell 111/16 , to 853/8 .
One reason that some expected yesterday's sharp rise by the dollar to be temporary is that it was accelerated by short covering. Traders who had expected the dollar's value to fall had shorted it -- that is, borrowed dollars, then sold them hoping to buy replacement dollars at a lower price and make a profit on the difference. When the dollar rose instead, such traders had to buy dollars to stem potential losses.

HEADLINE: Insurer to Settle Milwaukee Bias Lawsuit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The American Family Mutual Insurance Company of Madison, Wis., has agreed to pay $14.5 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of discrimination against black people in Milwaukee.
The settlement, announced yesterday by the company, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union and the United States Justice Department, was the most costly insurance-company settlement ever for discrimination charges. It comes as the Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing rules to make clear that the Federal Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale of homeowners insurance. 
 As consumer groups have accused insurers of discriminating in recent years, insurance companies have variously denied that discrimination is a problem and have asserted that higher prices and less attractive products offered in low-income areas reflect the higher risks of doing business there.
In the American Family case, the Justice Department said it had written and tape-recorded evidence of company managers who told agents to quit writing policies for blacks. But it commended the company yesterday for turning "a new page in its history and agreeing to take steps to provide insurance to the African American community of Milwaukee."
Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement: "Risk discrimination is permitted. Race discrimination is not."
A study issued late last year by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that "property and liability insurance is more expensive and difficult to obtain" in inner-city areas. While insurers may not be intentionally discriminating, the study said, "the fact that underserved areas tend to have high minority populations leads to charges of racial as well as geographic discrimination."
The case against American Family, which was not proved in court, was based on records of policies and internal documents that A.C.L.U. lawyers also said made clear that agents were discouraged from selling to blacks.
As part of the settlement, American Family, the country's 11th-largest property and liability insurer, recently began offering policies that promise to pay the cost of replacing a damaged building, even if its market value is as little as 40 percent of the insured replacement cost. Many companies do not make replacement-cost policies available in cities where those costs can be far higher than a building's market value.
Consequently, homeowners typically buy less attractive policies that promise to pay the cost of repairs, reduced by depreciation. Because those policies often fail to cover the full cost of repairs, they can result in abandonment of damaged buildings.
The $14.5 million is to be divided among black homeowners in Milwaukee's inner city. Uses of the money will include interest-rate subsidies on mortgages and home repair loans, emergency home repairs, a counseling program for homeowners and cash payments to people who were denied insurance or deterred from seeking it.
Rick Fetherston, a spokesman for American Family, noted that the allegations were based on events in the 1980's, and said the company had recently built a strong record for selling insurance in the seven ZIP codes in Milwaukee with large black populations. In those areas, he said, the company is the leading insurer, with 37 percent of the market.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Talks to Poor Working Women in India

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AHMADABAD, India, March 31

 BODY:
In a sweltering tent, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke today with vegetable vendors, embroidery workers and other poor women who said they were no longer afraid to organize for better treatment in India's marketplace and society.
Mrs. Clinton's visit to the Self-Employed Women's Association could well be the high point of her 12-day tour of South Asia, a trip centered on promoting better health, education and opportunity for women and girls throughout the world. 
 "I will never forget what I have seen and heard and learned here today," Mrs. Clinton told a group of 200 women. "I know how this kind of solidarity and effort can change lives."
The association is a union of 143,000 women formed in 1972 to help those in the largely invisible "informal" economy of agricultural workers, vendors and other self-employed women. It was organized by Ela Bhatt, 62, a follower of Mohandas K. Gandhi who wanted to ensure better treatment for the often oppressed, illiterate women who struggle to provide for their families.
From a modest beginning, the association has grown into the country's leading women's organization. It set up a bank that offers credit to women who otherwise could not get loans, organizes cooperatives to build up business and create jobs, offers skills training and health insurance and provides legal aid.
Mrs. Clinton, who first met Mrs. Bhatt at the White House last year, said the United States could learn from the association's example on expanding access to credit and other matters, and praised the group's efforts to give women "a better life without fear."
Earlier today, Mrs. Clinton laid a wreath at a monument to Gandhi and toured the Ahmadabad retreat where he lived from 1918 to 1930. She also toured the Taj Mahal with her 15-year-old daughter, Chelsea. The 17th-century tomb was built by the Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child.
On Friday Mrs. Clinton is to fly to Nepal. She has already visited Pakistan and is to visit Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Following Move By Germany to Lower Its Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against leading currencies yesterday, registering its biggest one-day gain against the mark in seven months, after the Bundesbank unexpectedly cut German interest rates.
The move by the German central bank was seen as an effort to slow the recent rapid ascent of the mark, which had surged to record highs recently against many other European currencies. Many dealers sold dollars on Wednesday in anticipation that the Bundesbank would leave interest rates unchanged because of relatively strong economic growth in the country and concerns over wage increases in recent labor settlements. Lower German interest rates would make mark-denominated deposits and assets less attractive to investors and the dollar more attractive, in comparison. 
 "The Bundesbank caught the market off guard, and we had an immediate bounce by the dollar," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company.
The dollar rose as high as 1.4205 marks after the increase by the Bundesbank, before settling in New York at 1.4083 marks, up from 1.3825 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 1.1680 Swiss francs from 1.1425 francs. The British pound fell to $1.6035 from $1.6118.
The Bundesbank's move "smacks very much as being related to foreign exchange concerns," said Tom Hoge, a currency trader at the Bank of New York. "They were playing it for a maximum surprise and foreign exchange effect."
While the Federal Reserve disappointed the foreign exchange markets by leaving interest rates unchanged on Tuesday, dealers yesterday were looking next to relief from Japan. They said it was increasingly likely that the Bank of Japan would follow the Bundesbank's lead and cut its discount rate to try to halt the soaring yen.
In Tokyo early today, the Bank of Japan said it was encouraging declines in some short-term money market rates, although it did not cut its discount rate.
The dollar rose a 13-day high of 90.14 yen before settling in New York at 89.55 yen, up from 88.43 yen.
Though the dollar rose yesterday, many currency dealers said they expected it to resume the decline that took it to post-World War II lows against the mark, yen and Swiss franc this month. Indeed, the dollar is still down 9 percent against the mark since the beginning of 1995.
"It's crucial for the dollar to hold these gains," said Karl Halligan, vice president for strategic trading at CIC Bank New York. "If it doesn't, the dollar's got bigger problems than people thought. The dollar needs to go a lot higher to convince people that it has bottomed."

The German rate cut gives a lift to European stock markets.

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
BY shaving its key interest rates yesterday at a time many feared it might do the reverse, the German Bundesbank has given a lift to German stocks and other European equity markets.
Earlier this week, the German mark's renewed strength against the dollar and leading European currencies had pushed the Frankfurt stock market's 30-stock DAX index down to an 18-month low of 1,910.96. This meant that in March alone it had lost some 9 percent of its value, wiping out much of the spectacular gain it posted during 1992 and 1993 when the smell of Germany's coming recovery sent it soaring from 1,450 to a high of 2,271. 
 The Bundesbank announced its rate decision only after official trading was over in Frankfurt. But in after-hours trading the index rose 30.91 points to end at 1,949.76, after briefly touching 1,957.50. Other European stock markets rallied by 1 percent or more.
"We consider Frankfurt a buy opportunity," said Catherine Ayers-Rigby, an expert on Germany at Ceros Portfolio Management in Fairfax, Va.
While she had not expected the Bundesbank to cut interest rates until later this year, she said that yesterday's rate cut and the weaker mark now "mean company earnings are less endangered than they seemed when the mark was overshooting." She said she favored the German software company S.A.P. and the auto maker BMW.
The German rate reduction will also be especially welcome in France, where the Paris stock market rose more than 2 percent on the news. Lower German rates make it easier for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to maintain his strong franc policy -- "le franc fort" -- in the run up to the May presidential election at a time when he is trailing fellow conservative and rival, Jacques Chirac, in the polls.
The German central bank also lifted some of the gloom settling in over Europe's economic prospects after eight countries, including Britain, France, Italy and Spain, raised interest rates to protect their currencies against speculative storms unleashed by the rise of Germany's mark.
The German cut, which generally caught analysts by surprise, was widely seen as a signal that the Bundesbank now feared that the strong mark, combined with five consecutive monthly declines in money supply growth, could seriously hurt the country's export-based economy in the second half of this year. The damage would come at a time when German companies are already struggling to absorb the recent round of high wage settlements for German workers.
In the past, the Bundesbank has usually welcomed an appreciating mark as an inflation depressant. And some analysts had even expected the central bank to raise rates this year to offset the inflationary impact of the latest pay round.
"Last year's mark appreciation did not damage German export competitiveness as companies offset the effects of a stronger currency with corporate restructuring," said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
"But this year's 10.7 percent appreciation against the dollar was too strong for corporations to sustain," she added. "The recent decline in the German stock index is a telling sign."
Other analysts speculated that the Bundesbank move was also intended to allay growing fears in Europe that the mark's new-found strength and the tensions this has created in currency markets were threatening the Continent's recovery prospects this year and next.
"In the last few days the mark has been rising against all the main European currencies, creating pressure for higher interest rates," said Lisa S. Kaess of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York investment advisory firm. "This is the Bundesbank doing its bit for Europe."
In a report to clients earlier this month, Salomon Brothers' chief European analyst, Kermit L. Schoenholtz, pointed out that recent foreign exchange turbulence had forced Italy, Britain, Sweden, France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain and Ireland to raise interest rate in recent months to defend their currencies. "If these increases last beyond midyear we will get an economic slowdown," he warned.
The Bundesbank move may also relieve a bit of the tension in the world's financial markets that has followed the bungled currency devaluation by Mexico at the end of last year.
The immediate impact of that devaluation was to destabilize the industrial world's emerging stock markets. But a secondary impact was the flight into "safe haven" currencies, like the mark, which helped to send the American dollar into a worrisome downward spiral.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Halts Senate Budget Bill by Move on Mexico Aid

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and a band of fellow Republicans stunned the Clinton Administration today and stalled a vote on a Senate budget-cutting bill by introducing an amendment aimed at blocking the American loan package to Mexico.
The surprise amendment left both Senate Democrats and the Administration momentarily shocked and fearful that even a discussion of cutting off aid could imperil the Mexico rescue plan. And it sent the Republican leadership scrambling to avoid a threatened Democratic filibuster that would delay if not kill any chance of swift passage of the bill, which would cut $13.5 billion out of spending in the current fiscal year. 
 Late in the afternoon, about three hours after he set off the furor, Senator D'Amato, a New York Republican, agreed to delay consideration of his amendment until the end of the debate on the budget adjustments, known as rescissions, or to introduce it again -- as early as next Monday -- as a separate bill.
The amendment offered by Mr. D'Amato and nine other Republican Senators would require Congressional approval of annual assistance to any foreign country exceeding $5 billion from the exchange stabilization fund. The Administration tapped that fund for $20 billion to help Mexico after failing to win support from Congress for an aid package.
The amendment is retroactive to Jan. 1, and thus would scuttle the loan guarantee package that Mr. Clinton presented on Jan. 31 with the political blessings of the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
"We're dealing with economic dynamite here," said Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat. "The very discussion has to be disquieting to a lot of people in the financial markets around the world."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin gave just that warning to Mr. D'Amato today.
"I am deeply concerned that the actions you are taking will have the potential to undermine market confidence in international support for Mexico and thereby reduce the likelihood of success," Mr. Rubin wrote in a letter to the Senator. "By limiting the American response to the Mexican crisis, your amendment could threaten the credibility of the stabilization program and undermine the confidence Mexico is trying to restore among investors. These consequences could, in turn, have a negative impact on jobs, wages and prospects of American workers here at home."
But Senator D'Amato was initially unmoved. "We're talking about rescissions of $14 billion and here's $20 billion going to Mexico -- $5 billion has already gone down and another $5 billion plus will go down in the next two or three weeks," he said. "You want to talk about aid? I want to aid the communities that need it. Orange County -- I'd rather give them a loan guarantee with this money. How about the District of Columbia?"
Mr. D'Amato was joined in his effort by nine Republican co-sponsors, including Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Larry Pressler of South Dakota.
"This may not pass; I think it probably will be defeated," Mr. D'Amato said on the Senate floor. "I understand that there are lots of my colleagues who would just as soon stay out of this situation. They are happy to let the President do it, and if Mexico deteriorates we didn't do anything. But I think it is a question of our constitutional responsibility."
The D'Amato amendment set off a furious round of inside politics.
Fearing that the measure would have the votes to pass, Senate Democrats, led by Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, quickly began what the Republicans immediately criticized as a filibuster.
For Mr. Dodd, who is co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the fight was as much to protect Mr. Clinton on the Mexico deal as it was a legislative battle.
Senator D'Amato's political maneuvering appeared to fly in the face of the public stance that Mr. Dole had taken on the Mexico deal. Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee who was managing the budget bill on the floor, was flabbergasted and clearly angered by the D'Amato amendment. It suggested that senior Republican leaders were just as surprised as the Democrats by Senator D'Amato's move.
But the Senator, who is leading Mr. Dole's Presidential campaign effort in New York State, said in an interview that he had advised Mr. Dole on Wednesday of his intentions, and that his amendment was completely in line with the majority leader's views.
Only weeks after giving his public support to the Administration's Mexico plan, Mr. Dole said in a speech on the Senate floor on Feb. 24 that after analyzing the agreement, he found it "somewhat surprising and, at its core, disappointing."
Senator Dole put even greater distance between himself and the plan in a letter on March 10 to Secretary Rubin. While Mr. Dole supported the aid package to avoid Mexico's "complete financial collapse," he said in the letter -- a copy of which was provided by Mr. D'Amato -- the majority leader added that "this expression was not intended and should not be construed to convey my blanket support for the underlying policies of the Administration or for the economic and legal agreements implementing these policies."
Senator Dole concluded that he fully supported the "ongoing examination of the important issues raised by the Mexico situation" by the Senate Banking Committee, of which Mr. D'Amato is chairman.
In a telephone interview, Mr. D'Amato said he would be willing to withdraw his amendment to the budget bill but would bring it up again on "another piece of legislation that the President wants."
In further explaining the timing of his legislation, Mr. D'Amato said that he and other members of the Banking Committee and the members of the Energy Committee had met with Administration and intelligence officials on Wednesday for a confidential briefing on Mexico. The Senator said the meeting had left him "deeply concerned about the manner in which this is being administered."
Mr. D'Amato declined to elaborate on what he and his Senate colleagues were told.
In the House, Republican dissidents continued to vex the leadership with demands on the Republicans' five-year, $189 billion tax cut bill, despite assertions by Speaker Gingrich to the contrary.
With a floor vote on the legislation scheduled for next week, each of at least four groups of Republicans has its own gripe about some aspect of the bill. And to varying degrees, each has the potential to block the floor vote by joining with the near-unanimous bloc of 204 House Democrats who oppose the bill.
The leadership is somewhat whipsawed between the groups, because changing the legislation to suit one faction has the potential to upset another.
The central parts of the tax package would lower the capital gains tax rate, wipe out the alternative minimum corporate tax and bestow a $500-per-child tax credit on taxpaying families earning less than $200,000 a year.
One dissident Republican group of uncertain size, led by Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, seeks to lower the earnings ceiling for the family tax credit from $200,000 to $95,000. But a second group of 37 Republicans, led by Representative John T. Doolittle of California, has sent the leadership a letter that all but threatens to block a vote on the bill if the leaders consent to Mr. Roberts's request.
A third rebel group threatens to oppose a vote because it dislikes a provision that would trim retirement benefits for members of Congress and their staff, making pensions more like those that other Federal workers receive.
And the fourth, most muscular group does not oppose the tax cuts themselves, but wants the bill changed to make them contingent on cutting the Federal budget deficit.
Members of this last group, Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, Bill Martini of New Jersey and Michael N. Castle of Delaware, met with House leaders Wednesday night and today, and Mr. Upton said later that Mr. Gingrich seemed generally amenable to their notion. But the Speaker and other leaders are balking at the three lawmakers' proposal to set deficit-reduction goals each year and to suspend the tax cuts if the goal is not being met.
Mr. Castle said today that he believes the three have the edge in the debate. "We haven't backed down on anything," he said.
None of the four rebel groups could singlehandedly defeat the tax bill itself. But most have enough members to block a vote by opposing a procedural motion, called the rule, that must be approved by the full House before a final vote can take place.

HEADLINE: If They Play It, Will Fans Come?

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Kenneth E. Smith sat in his windowless office at Shea Stadium in Queens this week with a telephone receiver at each ear. He had the mustard guy on one end and the nacho guy on the other.
"When can you get that product in?" Mr. Smith asked the mustard guy. "Monday is good. In three weeks, we'll make the conversion from half gallons to gallons. All I want you to do is send the pumps directly to me. Attention: Kenny Smith." 
 Mr. Smith, assistant general manager for the Aramark Concession Company, hung up with the mustard guy and started talking nachos: "We need the warmers, the chips, the cheese and other supplies on Saturday."
Players' strike or not, with the first Mets home game since early August scheduled for next Tuesday, preparations are proceeding for peanut, popcorn, hot dog and pretzel vendors, who count on sports events for their livelihood.
But even as they place their orders for mustard and ketchup and other ball park fare as if it were business as usual, no one knows for sure what kind of opening day it might be, if in fact there is an opening day for the Mets on Tuesday.
The specter of replacement players means lower ticket sales, which means fewer hot dogs. So how much mustard and ketchup do you order?
As Thomas Soloweyko, the souvenir manager at Shea Stadium, put it: "We're in a dither here. We're preparing for opening day with replacement players. If the regular players come back, then we'll have the regular goods come in at a later date. Everybody wishes things were back to normal."
What is normal, for the next few weeks at least, may be determined today. Judge Sonia Sotomayor of United States District Court in Manhattan is scheduled to hold a hearing this morning on the National Labor Relations Board's request for an injunction that would force team owners to restore salary arbitration and competitive bidding for free agents.
If the judge grants the injunction, the players will end the strike; the owners would then have to decide whether to allow them back or lock them out. If the judge doesn't grant the injunction, owners have said they will start the season with replacements.
The season is to open on Sunday with the Mets playing in Florida. Their first home game is scheduled against the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday, with the Yankees and the Minnesota Twins in the Bronx on April 10.
Amid all the possibilities, though, one thing seems sure: there will be no regular players on a New York diamond next week, since they would need several weeks of training first. In the meantime, the two sides continued to negotiate last night in Manhattan.
Advance ticket sales seem to reflect the confusion. Bill Ianniciello, vice president of ticket sales and services for the Mets, said 42,467 fans filled the stadium on opening day last year. Though Mr. Ianniciello would not release sales figures for this year, workers at Shea said they were told to prepare for 10,000 to 12,000 fans on opening day.
To match last year, "we'd have to do a good walk-up sale," Mr. Ianniciello said. Officials at Yankee Stadium said 56,706 tickets were sold for opening day last year. For this year's advance sales, they would say only that tickets are available.
The baseball strike -- it costs the local economy $2 million a game, the City Comptroller's office said -- has been especially painful for small merchants whose businesses stand in the shadow of Yankee Stadium, in the Highbridge section of the Bronx. The uncertainty has been compounded by doubts about whether the Yankees will remain in the embattled South Bronx.
Usually a bustling commercial strip, River Avenue, which runs alongside the stadium, seemed dark and deserted this week, even on a sunny day. Blue steel gates were drawn across the fronts of most of the businesses along the strip, which runs beneath elevated train tracks.
One of the few businesses open on River Avenue this week was the Ball Park Lanes, a bowling alley with a small souvenir stand in front. Some $20,000 worth of merchandise sat in boxes, left over from Aug. 12, when the strike began. John Gianos, the building owner, said the remnants would be put out on opening day, about half the usual stock.
His bowling business, he said, lost $150,000 as a result of the strike, with the souvenir stand down $8,000.
The Wendy's restaurant that had been at 161st Street and River Avenue since 1980 closed in February, said Gary Monie, vice president of Fast Food Systems, a Queens company that owned the franchise. A Popeye's restaurant sharing the space also closed that month.
Mr. Monie estimated that the strike cost him at least 10 percent of his business and helped contribute to its demise.
Stan's Sports Bar and Restaurant -- "Home of the Diehard Yankee Fan" -- the Discount Dugout, the Yankees Eatery and Stadium Souvenir are usually open a few days a week during the winter, according to neighbors, but this year they have been shuttered since August.
Nonetheless, the strip is expected to spring to life on April 10.
A fresh coat of blue paint has been applied to the outside of Yankee Tavern, at 161st Street and Gerard Avenue. Joe Bastone, the owner, said he was planning on five employees for April 10, half his usual opening day staff.
Donna Sheehan, in her second year working at the tavern, said she had lost a quarter of her income because of the strike. "My son doesn't understand that Christmas was smaller than usual because of the strike," said Ms. Sheehan, who has a 10-year-old boy. She doesn't expect a substantial raise. "A lot of baseball fans told me they would never go to another game," she said.
But the Kinney System, which runs the parking garages around Yankee Stadium, was hiring its usual number of attendants for the season, 55 to 65, this week.
"I must be prepared for what will be," said Alex Vincent, Kinney's regional vice president.
At a cavernous, dimly lighted garage at 156th Street and River Avenue, about 60 people lined up to turn in job applications. For them, the return of the baseball season could not have come soon enough.
"I need employment, so I don't care who plays," said Terry Felton, 33, who said he had been unemployed for two years. Raymond Mowatt, 19, agreed. "I haven't had a job in three months," he said.
Inside both Yankee and Shea Stadiums this week, workers bustled as they slapped on new coats of paint, replaced awnings at concession stands, watered the plush lawns and smoothed the infield clay.
Workers at Yankee Stadium unloaded a 16-wheel truck full of concession supplies. Hundreds of silver canisters emblazoned with RC Cola and Sea Breeze punch were stacked on the dock, four deep. A dozen 10-gallon containers filled with "Yankee blue" paint sat in the walkway.
At Shea, the concessionaire prepared for new offerings as well as old. This year new stands include Sbarro's pizza, Carvel ice cream, popcorn, lemonade, buffalo wings and nachos.
Workers completed orders and tallied the ones they had already received, including 1,680 pounds of jumbo hot dogs, 840 pounds of franks, 750 pounds of kosher hot dogs. They will receive cups on Monday because a new design is still being printed. Hot dog rolls will arrive on Monday or Tuesday morning so they remain fresh, said Tim Zorn, a commissary steward.
"The beer is here," Mr. Zorn said. "It started arriving two weeks ago."
The stadiums, in fact, have been careful to stock up on refreshments after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced that the union would refuse to cross a baseball players' picket line to make beer deliveries.
"We wanted to start the beer up early," Mr. Zorn said, "because we wanted to avoid picket lines in case there are going to be any."

HEADLINE: Essex County's Bond Rating Is Downgraded

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 30

 BODY:
The financial crisis in Essex County deepened today when its bond rating was downgraded for the second time in four months, in part because of concern that an austerity plan for layoffs and service cuts would do little to address the county's sustained economic decline.
In taking the action, Moody's Investors Service, a major Wall Street bond-rating concern, said that the county's fiscal health was so poor that its leaders had little room to maneuver. It also questioned whether all the reductions being considered to balance the budget were possible. 
 The cut in the bond rating, from A (average) to Baa1 (below average), came a little more than a week after the new Essex County Executive, James W. Treffinger, presented a $529 million budget that trimmed $66.2 million in annual spending and did not seek an increase in property taxes.
He proposed eliminating 450 jobs, furloughing some workers one day a week and making millions of dollars in other reductions. He said later that he might reconsider the furloughs if other ways can be found to save a similar amount of money.
Mr. Treffinger, a Republican, has blamed the Democrats who have long ruled this county for the budget situation, maintaining that his predecessors had often put off paying their bills. The county's debt has soared during the last 20 years, from $88 per resident in 1979 to an estimated $958 per resident by the end of 1995, according to figures provided by Moody's.
Mr. Treffinger said today that he was not surprised by Moody's decision, which will force the county to pay higher rates of interest when it sells its bonds. He said Moody's was merely confirming what he has said since he came into office: that the Democrats had mismanaged the county.
"No one wants to see a downgrade," he said. "But the way I interpret this is that Moody's has recognized that we were left a mess and that they are hopeful that some of the reforms will be implemented. They see the problem being fixed, but only if very large spending cuts are implemented."
The Democrats who control the Board of Freeholders, the county's governing body, have often criticized Mr. Treffinger over the budget, saying he has manipulated figures to make the Democrats look bad. This afternoon, Joseph DiVincenzo, the Freeholder President, declined to comment on the Moody's action, saying he was still reviewing it.
In December, Moody's lowered Essex County's rating from A1 (above average) to A (average), pointing out that property values in the county were declining while poverty rates were growing. As the county becomes poorer, it said, its bonds are a riskier investment.
Today, Moody's said that Mr. Treffinger had taken appropriate steps so far, but it emphasized that he was restricted in his moves because he did not control all of the county's budget. About 60 percent of the county budget is for items required by the Federal or state governments, including jails, law-enforcement and courts.
That means that if Mr. Treffinger does not raise property taxes, the cuts he can make come out of a smaller pool of money in the county budget, about $225 million.
"The budget as presented by the executive is a very satisfying one from our standpoint," said Paul Devine, a vice president at Moody's. "There are no smoke or mirrors there. On the other hand, we also perceive that the severity of those actions is reflective of a lack of flexibility."
With the downgrading today, Essex County's rating continues a slide that began in the early 1980's, when its rating was AA (high grade). With its new rating, it has the lowest of any county in the state except for Hudson County, which also has Baa1. Hudson, which has more working-class and poor people than Essex, was particularly hard hit by the recession in the early 1990's.

HEADLINE: Back From the Brink, the Legal Services Corporation Discovers It's in Danger Again

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
It was a heady reception at the White House last September when old and young civil rights lawyers and judges gathered in the East Room to celebrate the survival of the Legal Services Corporation.
After more than a decade of fighting Republican Administrations that had tried to shutter its doors, the corporation had finally found itself with many supporters sprinkled throughout the highest ranks of power in Washington. Its two strongest allies were in the White House -- a President who had long supported its mission of providing legal services to the poor and downtrodden, and his wife, who had once served as the corporation's leader in the late 1970's, its period of expansion. 
 The agency also enjoyed strong support in Congress, and at the White House ceremony there was talk about dramatically increasing its size.
Now, a mere five months after celebrating its triumph, the agency is again honing its survival skills.
With little notice, the Legal Services Corporation has joined other federally supported programs on the list for drastic cuts or possible elimination by the new Republican Congressional leadership. But unlike the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, which are also targets of cutbacks or cutoffs, Legal Services is being rent by three political forces: fiscal austerity, welfare reform and a powerful new hostility to lawyers in Washington that has inspired conservative lawmakers to promote an agenda aimed at limiting lawsuits brought by the poor or injured.
Prominent Republicans, including Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the Republican Presidential aspirant, have begun a loosely organized campaign to eliminate or dramatically curtail the budget and mission of the Legal Services Corporation.
"There is little question they are in danger of not surviving," said Representative Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the agency's budget and will soon be holding hearings on it. Mr. Rogers, one of the corporation's Republican supporters, said it was likely that the agency's budget will be significantly reduced this year.
Other lawmakers say the reductions will only be the first step.
One of the most powerful Republican House leaders, Mr. Kasich has proposed phasing out all financing for Legal Services over the next five years, part of his plan to cut $100 billion in discretionary spending from the Federal budget.
Across the Capitol, the fate of Legal Services rests largely in the hands of Senator Gramm, a longtime critic. In an interview this week, Mr. Gramm said that he viewed Legal Services as a "major impediment to meaningful welfare reform" and that it could expect significant cuts and possibly elimination.
What irks Mr. Gramm and other conservative lawmakers is Legal Services' lawsuits to gain the rights to welfare for large groups of people in class actions as well as suits that have stopped states from imposing restrictions on welfare benefits. Such precedent-setting cases represent a relatively small amount of the legal work financed by the corporation. But they have had far-reaching consequences, making it harder for states to adopt restrictions that the Democrats had been reluctant to impose. As such, the Legal Services Corporation has emerged as a new symbol to the Republicans of what is wrong with welfare.
"They're being advocates for the existing welfare bureaucracy, and while they may have a right to do it, they don't have a right to do it with taxpayers' money," Mr. Gramm said.
Other critics, such as Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, argue that the corporation should be abolished because it is undermining American values. In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Reed asserted that Legal Services "subsidizes divorce and illegitimacy" by paying for the representation of indigents in domestic disputes.
In its defense, the lawyers at Legal Services maintain that fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of all its cases are class actions, and that Congress has already established procedures to insure that class actions are filed only when appropriate. They assert that in welfare cases they do not make the law, but argue on behalf of clients as zealously as they can. The same is true in domestic disputes, they say.
The Legal Services Corporation budget this year is $415 million, which is distributed among some 320 organizations around the nation that supply 4,000 lawyers for a wide array of civil legal matters. (Criminal cases are typically handled by other public defender's organizations.) Its lawyers assist poor people in landlord disputes and domestic strife; help the indigent and elderly obtain Social Security and other entitlements; involve themselves in legal issues affecting the homeless and mentally handicapped, and aid migrant workers and American Indians.
Alexander D. Forger, the president of Legal Services, said that even though the agency had been strongly supported by the American Bar Association and lawyers' groups, the opposition had been formidable. "These people who are fighting us have large contributors and the middle class is angry at us because they don't get free legal services," Mr. Forger said. "We have no contributors. Where is our power base?"
The corporation, an offspring of the Johnson Administration's Great Society programs, was founded in 1974 in one of the final pieces of legislation to be signed by President Richard M. Nixon. It flourished in the Carter Administration, when Mrs. Clinton became its chairwoman, but steadily declined in size in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, as the White House installed Legal Services officers who were openly hostile to its mission.
Although it has made significant inroads in providing lawyers for the poor, its supporters say it has never come close to providing the representation that the poor need. On average, the corporation's officials say it provides one lawyer for every 6,000 to 7,000 indigent clients. By comparison, for the rest of the population, there is an average of one lawyer for every 300 people. Legal Services lawyers earn starting salaries of about $25,000 a year and generally can expect annual pay increases of about $1,500, far below the national average for lawyers.
And although the corporation's budget has been increasing, many of its largest offices report that they are about half the size they once were because Federal contributions have failed to keep pace with inflation. Legal Services provides an average of only about two-thirds of the local legal services' budgets; the rest is donated by the states, law firms and charitable groups.
The decline in Federal support has forced Legal Services to perform the equivalent of legal triage in deciding which matters to take and when. "We used to be able to get involved in the earliest stages of the process -- such as when a client received notice of a foreclosure," said Louis S. Rulli, the head of Community Legal Services Inc. of Philadelphia. "Now we often can only get involved at the very end of the process, when an emergency exists."
Other local units of Legal Services report similiar problems. "We get about 85 calls a day asking for new help, but we can only offer services for about 16 or 17 of them," said Ashley T. Wiltshire Jr. of Legal Services of Middle Tennessee.
Congressional Republicans argue that any Federal money for Legal Services should go in block grants to the states to decide how they want to spend it, as they propose to do with welfare and health care.
But Mr. Forger said that many states in the South and the Rocky Mountain region have never provided money for Legal Services, while others, like Pennsylvania, have recently cut all such financing.
Opponents of Legal Services say the job of representing the poor should be left to various bar associations. But many law firms have been reluctant to provide more free services and many of the nation's poor live where there are few lawyers.
"In North Carolina, for instance, there are broad areas of the eastern plains and western mountains where there is great poverty and very few lawyers," said Richard M. Taylor of Legal services of North Carolina. "Poverty is not distributed where the lawyers are."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Official Israeli Advice

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Why has terrorism against Israelis exploded since the signing of peace principles between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the White House lawn on Sept. 13, 1993?
Is the P.L.O., a collection of groups united by a detestation of Israel and a determination for Palestinian independence, capable of carrying out its commitment to combat anti-Israeli terrorism? 
 Why does its leader, Yasir Arafat, not try to stop it -- to pursue and arrest Palestinians after they kill Israelis, even disarm some before they add to their score of at least 120 Jews since that fine September day?
Will more Israeli concessions of land persuade him to follow the approach of Shimon Peres, Israel's Foreign Minister? It was so neat and simple -- "Why should we chase the terrorists? Let the P.L.O. do it." Why doesn't Mr. Arafat get it?
In the Mideast, there are few more important questions than those. The Israeli Government wants to move to the long-delayed next step in the process -- pulling its army out of some Arab towns, followed by Palestinian elections.
But the Rabin Government fears it will fall if it orders the pullout before it calms Israeli fears by presenting evidence that the P.L.O. will prevent or punish the murder of Israelis.
P.L.O. compliance with its anti-terrorist promises is watched day by day, by those Israelis and foreigners who favor the peace talks and those who think they are a trap for Israel.
So, on March 1, at a Jerusalem meeting with presidents of American Jewish organizations, a top Israeli official was asked a skeptical question about the P.L.O. The gathering got a prompt, straightforward reply: Mind your own business.
Only Israel, said Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, would decide whether Mr. Arafat was in compliance with those commitments, not Americans or anybody else.
Mr. Beilin's comments are still ricocheting around American Jewish organizations. The Rabin Government has been consistently and curtly clear that it does not relish advice by non-Israeli Jews.
But still -- some of the organization heads did assume that since Israel had asked the U.S. to lead international economic support for the P.L.O., urged it to get ever more involved in the P.L.O.-Israel talks, and also wanted U.S. troops to be stationed on the Golan Heights if Syria ever deigned to accept it back, why, Americans had some interest in Arab anti-terrorist performance and might be forgiven by Labor if they opened their mouths now and then as they did in the old Likud days.
In fact, Congress has made antiterrorism a condition for aid to the P.L.O., and the Administration must report this spring.
That's a rub, there. Israeli officials want no fuss about compliance lest it mire the talks deeper. And Washington, after taking a major role in the talks and funding of the P.L.O., considers Clintonian prestige committed to momentum between Israel and the P.L.O.
The U.S. has issued an interim report to Congress, which blamed any lack of P.L.O. compliance on inefficiency. The full assessment is due by June 30 under legislation introduced by Senators Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York.
But the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee recently published a document that raised questions about P.L.O. compliance. That piece of impudence contributed to the furious Beilin response to the P.L.O. question, which was put at the meeting by Morton Klein, head of the Zionist Organization of America.
Mr. Beilin reminds me that Israel itself must be assessed on its compliance to peace principles. True; since it gave the P.L.O. political parity the Israeli Government bought into moral equivalency.
He says that only his Government can assess P.L.O. compliance to antiterrorism because nobody outside it is privy to secret contacts and understandings it has with the P.L.O. That may not calm Israelis who remember that the recognition of the P.L.O. also resulted from secret Labor-Arafat talks.
Mr. Beilin is highly intelligent but cannot understand why, when he says just trust me, everybody does not sit down and shut up. It's a problem that strikes the best of us sometimes.

HEADLINE: What Became of My Democrats?

BYLINE: By Felix G. Rohatyn; Felix G. Rohatyn is a senior partner at Lazard Freres, investment bankers.

 BODY:
When I landed in this country in 1942, I was 14 and very lucky. I was in America. I could as easily have wound up in Auschwitz. To me, America meant freedom, opportunity and F.D.R. Even though I later made my career on Wall Street -- not exactly a bastion of liberalism in the 50's and 60's -- there was never the slightest question in my mind about my political identifications. I was a Democrat, a liberal, a believer in the New Deal and in government's ability and duty to improve the well-being of its people.
As chairman of New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation from 1975 to 1993 and an adviser to two governors, I began to see the world somewhat differently. Irving Kristol once said that a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged. I was mugged by deficits. I did not change parties or become a social conservative. But I became a fiscal conservative -- a balanced-budget liberal. 
 All during the 1980's, while a Democratic Congress and Republican Presidents ran up $3 trillion in deficits and collapsed the value of the dollar, I continued to believe in the need for fiscal restraint coupled with active government.
When Bill Clinton came along, his philosophy seemed very much along those lines: deficit cuts, investment in the public infrastructure, greater emphasis on education, active involvement in trade and support for conversion of defense industry.
While the commitment to the infrastructure and any serious effort to reshape defense industry has gone by the boards, in its first two years the Administration delivered on some of the main issues that concerned me. I felt, then and now, that it had compiled an important record of economic achievement that is largely unappreciated by the voters. And then the roof caved in last November -- and my political home caved in with it.
As a result of the Republican landslide, both parties (if you can call what is left of the Democrats a party) seem to have adopted the opposite of "balanced-budget liberalism." What they have adopted is "deficit-financed conservatism" -- abdicating Government's responsibilities in order to cut taxes while pretending to balance the budget. To me this is the worst of all combinations: economically untenable in the long run and, in the near future, socially destructive.
I do not believe that "conservatism" or "liberalism" are relevant ideologies now. Given the financial constraints of an advanced industrial democracy in the age of global economics, neither the hard-edged conservatism in fashion here nor European-type welfare states can provide the policies required by the competitive nature of "advanced capitalism." An appropriate mix of fiscal conservatism, a strong private sector and active and supportive government will have to be brought about.
The Administration had the opportunity, after the election, to take the high road economically and the courageous road politically, which would have been consistent with its previous policies. It could have pointed out that cutting taxes while the economy is growing and the Fed is increasing interest rates makes no sense; that reduced interest rates and a strong currency are far more beneficial to Americans than the middle-class tax cut myth; that until the deficit is brought much lower by continued reduction in expenditures and economic growth, it would veto any tax cut, and that it would join with Republicans in a meaningful tax cut when the deficit was nearer to zero and a slowdown in the economy was apparent.
I had hoped the Administration would, at long last, face the reality of the unsustainable growth in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. None of this has happened. On the contrary. The Administration and the new Republican majority seem to have adopted variations on the same theme: tax cuts financed by unspecified reductions in expenses; more or less punitive forms of welfare reform; more or less drastic reductions in the size of the Government; continued increase in the Federal debt.
The Republican variations are harsher, more drastic and internationally more isolationist in concept. But behind both variations lies an underlying rejection of the need or the capacity of the Government to play a major role in the well-being of most of our citizens. Indeed, wherever possible the responsibilities for more and more of these roles are to be passed backed to the states.
As a result of these approaches, we are about to see the most profound attempt to change the structure of our Government since the Confederacy. The push to send programs such as welfare and Medicaid back to the states is likely to be the start of the dismantling of a social safety net that had evolved since the Depression.
There is no question that many of these programs need major reforms and restructuring. The states should act as laboratories to determine the best approach. But they should not set national policies.
Nor can we expect that the states will carry out Federal responsibilities. The states will cut taxes to attract business, by reducing support to the cities and to the social programs the cities must provide. The cities are at the bottom of the pyramid, and as Washington and the state governments cut taxes, the cities will be left with their problems undiminished and resources shrinking -- a recipe for social disaster.
It is up to the Democratic Party to do something about this, but regrettably it has become a kinder, gentler version of the Republican Party. It no longer stands for a clear set of principles. The Democrats will oppose some of the more extreme Republican proposals on orphanages or child nutrition, but that is not the underpinning of a major political party.
The Democrats were once the party of ideas -- a role now pre-empted by the Republicans. I disagree with many of the Republicans' ideas and much of the ideology. But political power will go to the party with ideas. When one party is bereft of ideas, it does not bode well for the two-party system -- or for the country.
As the most powerful and productive nation in the world, we should be approaching the 21st century with the confidence that it, indeed, will be the American Century. Our policies, however, are going the other way.
By pretending that a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget is fiscal prudence, we are fostering an illusion. By abdicating to the states we are weakening the country. By continuing to overconsume we are starving investment. By refusing to focus more heavily on public education, public investment and public jobs, we are perpetuating an urban underclass that will combine with an educational proletariat, neither of which will have a real place in our society.
The next election should be an argument about those issues, not about affirmative action or abortion. But this debate won't happen unless Democrats recapture their bedrock belief in hope, opportunity, faster growth and higher living standards. It is not too late for Mr. Clinton to provide the leadership to bring this about. Otherwise, the party will become irrelevant and I will, once again, become a political refugee.

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

CONSTRUCTING THE SELF, CONSTRUCTING AMERICA
 A Cultural History of Psychotherapy
 By Philip Cushman
 430 pages. Addison-Wesley. $27.50.
Given the ascendancy of the therapeutic ethos in America today, the expressed aim of Philip Cushman's new book is certainly a useful one: to trace evolving notions of the self in America and to provide a cultural history of psychotherapy as it has developed in this country in recent years. But while "Constructing the Self, Constructing America" is peppered with fascinating insights, the volume is also filled with dogmatic assertions that ultimately color all of the author's arguments. It should not be read as an objective or fair-minded cultural history, but as a highly ideological assessment of American psychotherapy and its social and political implications. 
 A faculty member of the California School of Professional Psychology, Alameda/Berkeley, Mr. Cushman relies heavily upon the theories and methodology of the French philosopher Michel Foucault, and to a somewhat lesser degree upon Marxist-inspired analysis. He is not only intent on situating his subject in a social and economic matrix, but is also eager to interpret any and all developments in terms of shifting vectors of money, power and control.
As Mr. Cushman sees it, "each era has a predominant configuration of the self, a particular foundational set of beliefs about what it means to be human," and the current configuration of the self in contemporary America is "the empty self," characterized "by a pervasive sense of personal emptiness" and committed "to the values of self-liberation through consumption."
"The empty self," he adds, "is the perfect complement to an economy that must stave off economic stagnation by arranging for the continual purchase and consumption of surplus goods. Psychotherapy is the profession responsible for treating the unfortunate personal effects of the empty self without disrupting the economic arrangements of consumerism." By medicalizing such phenomena as "emotional isolation, selfishness, drug addiction and the nihilistic use of others," he argues, psychotherapy effectively depoliticizes them, disguising "the exercise of power, the impact of economic forms of production, and the injustice caused by oppression owing to race, gender and class."
Such assessments, of course, are predicated on the belief that there are no universal illnesses, that there is no shared human condition. And they tend to reduce all human problems to time-bound, socio-economic byproducts, as though selfishness, greed, loneliness and alienation were unknown feelings in Shakespeare's England or Chekhov's Russia, as though such emotions were simply modern, capitalistic afflictions.
When Mr. Cushman stops trying to hammer home his impassioned anti-consumerist message, the results are considerably more convincing. He gives the reader a succinct and relatively readable account of how Freud's theories were adapted from a European context to an American one, evolving from a vaguely threatening theory of sexuality and aggression into a more optimistic and pragmatic course of self-improvement. There are several long, angry digressions about American advertisers' use of Freudian theory to sell products like cigarettes and soft drinks, and repeated asides about the fruitless efforts of Americans to fill up their emotional and spiritual emptiness with food, drugs and an assortment of unnecessary consumer products. Still, the patient reader is also treated to a fascinating account of the different sorts of popular therapies (including mesmerism, the mind cure and positive thinking) that have captured the American imagination at different times.
As for Mr. Cushman's narrative of how America evolved from a small group of colonies, devoted to God and community, into a sprawling, culturally diverse nation filled with therapy-seekers, it is familiar, to say the least, drawing heavily at times on the work of such disparate writers as Christopher Lasch, T. J. Lears and Philip Rieff.
Once again, we are treated to a discussion of the dislocating effects of urbanization, industrialization and secularization; and the moral conflicts engendered by the Indian wars, slavery and the Civil War. Mr. Cushman tells us how the idea of character came to be replaced by personality, how heroes gave way to celebrities, how manual labor was increasingly supplanted by sales. As the country grew more and more secular, he says, as entrepreneurial zeal increased, the search for transcendence was removed from the communal realm and relocated within the individual; a sense of fulfillment became an end in itself instead of a byproduct of communal participation.
Needless to say, Mr. Cushman's discussion of these matters is heavily embroidered with complaints about the empty self and its pivotal role in America's consumer-based economy, complaints that escalate by the end of the book into an out-and-out rant against consumerism.
"Consumerism," he writes, "brought members of the middle class an affluence and psychological-mindedness previously unheard of, but it also caused a commodification of human relating that has been degrading and self-defeating. Finally, it caused the United States to squander precious environmental, financial and human resources in service of wasteful and ultimately destructive campaigns of paranoia, acquisition and consumption."
With such passages, Mr. Cushman signals that he has abandoned all pretense of scholarly detachment, that he has stepped from the realm of history writing into the realm of proselytization.

HEADLINE: A Surprise German Rate Cut Propels the Dollar Up by 2%

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 30

 BODY:
Moving against a powerful surge by the German mark and a punishing fall in the American dollar, Germany's central bank cut key interest rates today by up to half a percentage point.
The rate cut immediately propelled the dollar up more than 2 percent against the mark to 1.4083 marks in New York; it traded as low as 1.3758 in Europe in the early morning. 
 The Bundesbank's move, the first since May, stunned European markets. Traders generally believed that because of fears of inflation the bank would not try to halt the mark's persistent, monthlong climb.
But analysts said the central bank feared that an overvalued mark would make German exports too expensive to compete in world markets and would risk aborting the country's economic recovery that began last year.
"You've had a drumbeat of chief executives recently getting up at their shareholders meetings and saying that a high mark threatens their exports," said Ralf Conen, chief equities analyst at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt. "We have an export-led recovery, and if you're the Bundesbank you don't want to see this go down the drain because of an overvalued currency."
[Some traders had expected Japan to follow suit. However, the Bank of Japan chose not to cut its discount rate on Friday morning, preferring instead to encourage declines in short-term money market rates, and Japanese stocks fell sharply.]
European stock and bond markets rallied on word of the German cuts. In Germany, the DAX 30 stock index, which had closed down 0.42 at 1,918.46 before the Bundesbank's announcement, only 7.5 points above its 18-month low, surged 30.91 points in after-hours trading to 1,949.76. [Page D6.]
Other currencies also soared, after being beaten down by the mark in the last month, including the British pound, the French franc, the Canadian dollar, the Spanish peseta and the Swedish krona.
Traders warned that the Bundesbank's move alone would not stop the strong anti-dollar sentiment in Europe, where investors are concerned about the effects of the Mexican bailout on the dollar and the inability of Washington to reduce its budget deficit substantially.
"After a while we're headed back down again," said one American trader in Frankfurt. "I think we are seeing a long-term trend here. And a 50-basis-point cut is not going to change that."
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Bundesbank cut its discount rate to 4 percent from 4.5 percent. That is the rate charged on loans used mainly to meet German industry's liquidity needs for up to three months.
The bank cut its rate on repurchase agreements, or repos, to 4.5 percent from 4.85 percent. That is the rate charged commercial banks for short-term borrowing.
The bank left its Lombard rate unchanged at 6 percent. The Lombard rate is roughly equivalent to the Federal Reserve Board's discount rate, which is an overnight rate to banks. The Bundesbank has left this very-short-term rate higher than the other two rates to discourage its use.
Central banks of Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands also cut their lending rates, in line with their policy of mirroring the monetary policies of the Bundesbank to keep their currencies stable against the mark.
While there was speculation that the Bundesbank wanted to help bolster the dollar, German economists said that the action was purely aimed at internal problems.
"The decision has to do with the bank's outlook in domestic terms," said Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF Bank in Frankfurt. "The domestic scenario gave room for a cut. If there are effects in other countries, that is fine. But the bank is concerned about Germany."
Analysts said today's move was exceptional because it marked one of the few times the Bundesbank had responded to the pressures of the currency markets -- attempting to defend the German economy.
"The danger is that once you start playing this game, the market decides to take you on and see if you will cut rates again if the currency continues to strengthen," said Adrian Cunningham, chief currency economist for the Union Bank of Switzerland in London.
Members of the Bundesbank's council seemed later in the day to try to curb expectations that the rate cut would calm the currency markets and solve the dollar's problems.
"I do not believe our decision can significantly change currency markets," said Hans Tietmeyer, president of the bank. "The currency markets are determined primarily by a judgment of the situation in weak currency countries."
But Finance Minister Theo Waigel was more optimistic. "The measures taken by the Bundesbank will contribute to strengthening the trust in the stability of exchange rates in the markets," he said.
Though most analysts agreed that the bank was reacting to the mark's surging strength, the bank tried to play down its market reaction.
It justified the interest-rate move because its key measure of the German money supply had fallen below the bank's target range. The bank uses a broad money supply measurement called an expanded M-3, which includes cash in circulation, demand and savings deposits at banks and money market accounts. Its yearly range for this M-3 measurement is a growth rate of 4 percent to 6 percent.
It said today that between January 1994 and 1995, it had grown only 2.4 percent, including an uptick in February of seven-tenths of 1 percent. As a result, it said, it could cut interest rates without fearing a surge in inflation.
The central bank also said that because the strong mark made imports cheaper for Germans, inflationary pressures would also be reduced.
"The appreciation of the mark should form a considerable counterweight to the upward pressure on domestic costs and to the price rise for imported raw materials, as well as industrial products," the bank said in its statement.

Treasury Securities Prices Retreat After Early Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slumped yesterday, after a brief bounce from early gains in the dollar.
The dollar surged after the German central bank lowered interest rates and four other European central banks followed suit. A stronger dollar makes securities denominated in it more attractive to foreign investors. 
But the rise in the dollar failed to support Treasury prices. Part of the reason, traders and analysts said, was the concern that lower European interest rates could stimulate global economic growth and accelerate inflation as a result.
"With foreign central banks stimulating their economies, the potential for export growth in the U.S. is keeping the economy moving ahead at a faster-than-sustainable level," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32 , to 10218/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.41 percent, from 7.37 percent on Wednesday. Rates on short-term bills were also higher, up an average of about 4 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Underscoring investor concern yesterday about economic growth, were two employment reports. The Conference Board said its February index of help-wanted advertising rose to 134 from 129 in January, suggesting there is still demand for workers. And the Government's weekly report on initial jobless claims for the week ended last Saturday fell by 10,000, to 338,000, which was in line with expectations. But it also showed labor strength could accelerate inflation.
Rising prices of precious metals, often viewed as a proxy for inflation expectations, played another factor in undermining the market, Mr. Hale of MMS International said.
Also weighing on the market yesterday, some analysts said, were end-of-the-quarter pressures brought on by managers selling securities to take profits and dress up their portfolios. Traders noted some profit taking in early trading on the bounce in prices on a strong dollar.
The Treasury, meanwhile, sold $42.25 million of short-term debt, with $25 billion of 17-day cash management bills and $17.25 billion of new one-year bills. It brought the total amount of debt sold this week to $69.75 billion, when the regular weekly bill auctions and sales this week of two- and five-year notes are included. Traders said it was a sizable amount of debt for the market to absorb during a week of so much uncertainty and could have also put pressure on prices.
At auction, the new one-year bill was priced at an average rate of 6.02 percent, down from 6.06 percent last month.
The weekly jobless claims data did not draw much notice even as they confirmed the trend of strength in employment.
In the corporate bond market, the Tennessee Valley Authority increased the size of its planned sale of equity-like debt to $600 million from $500 million amid good investor interest.
The securities, which mature in 50 years, are callable in five. The pricing is expected to take place today through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of a new one-year bill and 17-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: In Budget War, Pataki and Silver Fight a Battle on Television

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 30

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and his chief political rival, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, shifted their budget duel out of the back rooms and onto the airwaves tonight, firing bitter partisan salvos at each other in back-to-back, statewide televised addresses.
For Mr. Pataki, a Republican, the air time allowed him to go over the heads of the protesters and lobbyists who have ringed the Capitol in recent weeks and speak directly to the people outside what he calls "the Albany beltway." He argues that most New Yorkers strongly support his proposals to shrink government, reduce welfare and cut taxes. 
 "The Assembly leadership opposes our changes even in the face of a budget deficit of a staggering $5 billion, more than the total budget of 31 other states," Mr. Pataki said in his five-minute address. "This deficit has been caused by endless special interest spending of your tax dollars. It has to stop. It will stop. The special interest groups are going to discover that there is no free lunch for them anymore in Albany."
For Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, the five-minute rebuttal provided his first opportunity before a statewide audience to counter Mr. Pataki's arguments.
The Governor's budget, he said, finances tax cuts for the rich by cutting health care, transportation and education programs for the middle class. "The difference between George Pataki and his Newt Gingrich approach to governing, and this Democratic Party, is that we are not going to sit idly by and allow the destruction of the middle class so George Pataki and his colleagues can continue their policies of helping the rich get richer," Mr. Silver said.
The speeches gave both men a chance to blame the other for stalling negotiations and virtually assuring that, for the 11th consecutive year, the budget will be passed after the April 1 legal deadline. Both men implored viewers to voice support for their positions in letters and phone calls to the other side.
The dueling addresses cranked up what has already been one of the most intense budget battles in state history. Both sides have spent millions of dollars in television and radio advertising, direct mail campaigns and phone bank operations. Mr. Pataki, whose aides first requested the free air time from television news directors on Wednesday, spoke for five minutes starting at 6:05 P.M., making him among the lead items on newscasts on about 30 stations across the state.
Mr. Silver's rebuttal followed immediately, and most but not all of the television stations carried it. In New York City, for example, Channels 2 and 4 carried both addresses, but Channel 7 carried only the Governor's address.
The last New York State Governor to receive donated air time to make a statewide address was Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975, when he implored President Gerald Ford to help New York City avoid bankruptcy.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has taken to the airwaves three times in the past 15 months to make direct appeals to viewers, twice to brace New Yorkers for budget cuts and once to endorse former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. His predecessor, David N. Dinkins, also made three television addresses at times of pressing concerns for the city, two in 1991 dealing with the recession and one in 1992 to calm continuing tensions from the Crown Heights disturbances a year before.
But the addresses tonight were clearly sharper edged, more partisan. Both men have already traveled back and forth across the state attacking the other and seeking support for their positions.
Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, said he believed the partisan quality of both speeches may have turned voters off to both men's messages.
"Score one for gridlock," he said. "That's what people see when they watch the Governor and Speaker lock horns for 10 minutes."
Aides to Mr. Pataki said the Governor wrote the speech himself, with some polishing from Zenia Mucha, his director for communications, and Robert J. Bellafiore, his press secretary. The live address was broadcast from a Capitol conference room that was set up with a makeshift office complete with a desk and photographs of the Governor's children.
Mr. Pataki, wearing a gray suit and red tie, spoke while seated behind the desk, clasping his hands before him except to make occasional pointing gestures for emphasis.
At its heart, Mr. Pataki's message was that the state's economy will continue to falter unless government spending shrinks and taxes are cut. He said the state has missed a national recovery that has produced 7 million new jobs nationwide since 1991. New York, meanwhile, lost another 125,000, he said.
He argued that his plan to require able-bodied welfare recipients to work would help them become less dependent on government, and he said his proposal to offer managed care for Medicaid recipients would improve their health care. And he accused Mr. Silver of wanting to spend more money on failed welfare policies.
"Speaker Silver wants to increase state spending and keep your taxes the highest in the nation," he said. "That's wrong. I'm asking you to contact Speaker Silver and urge him to pass our budget."
Mr. Silver's counsel, Fred Jacobs, wrote his speech, along with his press secretary, Patricia Lynch. Also dressed in a gray suit and red tie, Mr. Silver spoke from a state television studio situated near the Capitol.
Mr. Silver argued that Mr. Pataki, who won with 49 percent of the vote, did not have a mandate to make such deep spending cuts. He said those cuts would make college too expensive for many middle-class families, cause local property taxes to rise and force elderly people into nursing homes.
"Middle-class New Yorkers are terrified, and they should be," he said.
After the speech, Mr. Silver told reporters that he is willing to pass a budget that spends less than the current year's budget -- something the state has not done in a half-century. This has been one of Mr. Pataki's major goals. Even with that, however, the Legislature would still be able to restore up to $1.1 billion that Mr. Pataki proposes to cut.

Owners Vote to Use Replacements as Talks Go On

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Club owners formally anointed replacement baseball yesterday, hours before the union made a new proposal. But a hearing before a Federal judge today could put the striking players back on the field in the replacements' place.
By a conference-call vote of 26 to 2, the owners authorized the use of replacement players beginning Sunday night, when the regular season is scheduled to open. Only the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays opposed the plan. 
 George Steinbrenner of the Yankees initially voted against the use of replacements, saying it would be a tragic mistake, but subsequently changed his vote, saying he was doing it to support Bud Selig, the acting commissioner and owner of the Milwaukee Brewers.
Negotiators for both sides met for an hour and a half last night, with the union issuing a new offer on a luxury tax. Selig said the owners had accepted the players' offer to return to work under previous terms and conditions of employment, assuming that they return under the owners' definition of previous terms and conditions of employment.
It is the difference of opinion over what those terms and conditions should be that will place the two sides and the National Labor Relations Board before Judge Sonia Sotomayor of United States District Court in Manhattan at 10 A.M. today.
The Mets and Florida Marlins are scheduled to play the first game of the season at 8 P.M. Sunday in Miami. The replacement players will take effect officially at 6 P.M. Sunday, when general managers must submit their 32-man rosters. The owners chose to wait until the last possible minute, wanting to leave as much time as possible to get the dispute resolved.
They have an economic reason to wait, too. Once the season begins with replacements, the clubs will be committed to paying an additional $21.6 million in bonuses to the 864 players the union has called strikebreakers.
While they want an agreement, the owners aren't rooting for the striking players to return to work under an injunction the N.L.R.B. will seek today. The injunction would force the owners to restore salary arbitration, competitive bidding for free agents and the anti-collusion provision of the free-agency rules.
Those weren't the terms Selig had in mind in his letter sent to the office of Donald Fehr, the union leader, while Selig and Fehr were meeting 10 blocks away in the New York law offices of the owners' lawyers.
In what almost seemed like a tongue-in-cheek reply, Selig wrote, "I am delighted that the Union has decided to end its strike, and I hope that we can come to terms on a new long-term Basic Agreement in the near future."
The owners' labor committee, Selig concluded, "will work with you and your staff to arrange for an orderly return to work."
While that letter was being faxed to Fehr's office, Fehr was presenting the union's new proposal to Selig. It lowered the tax-triggering payroll threshold from $54 million in the previous proposal to $50 million but held the tax rate at 25 percent. Had the tax been in effect last year, six clubs would have paid taxes.
Under the owners' latest proposal, 11 clubs would have paid taxes at a rate of 50 percent on portions of payrolls over $44 million. In that proposal Monday night, the owners raised the threshold from $40.7 million but stayed at the rate of 50 percent.
"I said Monday the clubs strained to make that proposal," Selig said at a news conference. "But we now have been given a counterproposal and we'll digest that proposal."
In another part of the tax plan separating the sides, the owners want the tax to be in effect for the last five years of a six-year agreement. The players proposed no tax the first and fifth years of a five-year agreement.
N.L.R.B. lawyers have urged Sotomayor to rule before the season opens, but the owners' lawyers have called the Sunday deadline arbitrary, pointless and legally irrelevant. There is no way of telling when the judge might rule.
Selig's letter aside, if the judge grants the injunction, the owners would have to decide whether to allow the players to return or lock them out.
With increasing frequency, people familiar with the thinking of the owners and their lawyers have said this week that the owners don't have the 21 votes needed to approve a lockout and the lawyers are advising against it because of the legal risks.
The owners have not indicated if they would play replacement games for three weeks while the returning players got in shape if that scenario developed.
During the owners' conference call yesterday afternoon, said a person who listened in, the owners did not discuss the players' offer to end their strike or a possible lockout. "The word lockout was never used," the person said. Only slight mention was made of the court hearing, the person added.
The Orioles, who do not intend to form a replacement team, tried to have the vote on replacements tabled until Saturday, but the motion was defeated. Then the vote on their use was taken, and the outcome was 25-3.
Steinbrenner, in voting no, said he wanted to be on record that it was a tragic mistake in the long run to go ahead with the plan. He said, however, that if it were adopted, he would make every effort to make it work.
Toward the end of the call, which lasted about an hour, Steinbrenner said to Selig that if it would benefit him to have the vote unanimous, he would be happy to change his vote. But the Blue Jays and the Orioles stuck to their positions. Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, was not on the call but was represented by club officials.
Steinbrenner then told Selig to do what he wanted with his vote. Selig responded that Steinbrenner would have to make that call, and the Yankees' owner said, "O.K., I'll go with you."

HEADLINE: No Japan Move; Stocks Off

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, March 31

 BODY:
Despite widespread anticipation that it would follow the lead of Germany's central bank, the Bank of Japan chose not to cut its official discount rate today, saying instead that it would nudge short-term money market rates lower. The decision caused prices to fall sharply on the Tokyo stock market, where traders had been expecting the discount rate to be cut.
The central bank said in a statement that partly because of the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar, the gradual recovery of Japan's weak economy now "appears to have somewhat slowed down." 
 Analysts said this negative sentiment was paving the way for an eventual cut in the discount rate, which is already at a record low of 1.75 percent.
"The currency market move has darkened the economic prospects rather seriously," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers here. "When there is evidence to show that conclusively, then the B.O.J. will move."
Stocks in Tokyo initially surged in reaction to the German rate cut and on anticipation that the Bank of Japan might follow suit. But stocks soon reversed course, with the Nikkei average of 225 issues falling sharply in the afternoon and closing at at 16,139.95, down 372.27 points, or 2.25 percent.
The currency markets did not react as strongly. In Tokyo this afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 89.09 yen, down from 89.55 in New York late Thursday.
The Bank of Japan has consistently said its monetary policy is guided by concern for Japan's economy and is not conducted to influence currency exchange rates. Thus, today's move dampened speculation that the United States, Germany and Japan would make coordinated interest rate moves to help bolster the dollar.
Today's announcement will affect the overnight call rate at which banks make loans to one another. The overnight rate fell today to 1.75 percent, the same as the discount rate, compared with about 2.20 percent in the last few days.
By guiding those rates lower, the central bank is telling the market that it is monitoring the situation but not yet ready to lower the discount rate. Tod Wood, economist at Baring Securities here, said the change in the overnight call rates was "not a large enough change to affect the yen or the economy."

SUNBEAM-OSTER STOCK FALLS ON EARNINGS UNEASE

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The stock of the Sunbeam-Oster Company fell yesterday after the company, which makes blenders and other consumer goods, said it expected first-quarter earnings to fall below analysts' estimates of 39 cents a share. The stock closed down $1, to $23, on the New York Stock Exchange. Sunbeam-Oster, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said it expected first-quarter net income of 35 cents to 37 cents a share, up from 34 cents a year earlier. Revenue is expected to increase by 6 percent to 8 percent. The company did not specifically say why results would fall below expectations, but said Mexican sales will be lower this quarter than a year ago because of poor economic conditions.

HEADLINE: Budget Brinkmanship in Albany

 BODY:
It was no mystery why Gov. George Pataki went on television last night to try to rally support for his sweeping budget cutbacks. Opinion polls show that New Yorkers are alarmed by the pain his budget would inflict. Led by the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, Democrats would rather delay passage of a budget than accede to one that does so much damage. If Mr. Pataki wants a timely budget, he will have to compromise.
It is an old Albany axiom that the party that cares less about getting a rapid agreement ends up getting more out of the eventual deal. Mr. Pataki needs a budget agreement right now to establish his credentials as an effective Governor. An impasse does not redound to his credit. 
 The Governor has already compromised by wisely retreating from his earlier threat to close down the state government tomorrow if the Legislature fails to enact a budget by then. He apparently recognized that he would have taken the blame for punishing innocent state workers, creating legal and logistical chaos throughout the state and wrecking the atmosphere for negotiations on the budget. The same concern for the well-being of the state that led him to that compromise can guide him again now.
In his television address, Mr. Pataki effectively stated the broad conservative themes that helped get him elected last fall. He is right to insist that the cost of government be controlled and that the state needs long-term tax relief to help restore its economy. But the speech failed to allay concerns that his budget tries to do too much too quickly. The $5 billion in budget cuts introduced in January illustrate the political perils of moving from the campaign slogans repeated last night about painlessly reducing the size of government to programmatic specifics. Even the Senate Republicans with whom he is allied favor relief for hospitals threatened with being shut down and college students faced with steep tuition hikes.
Mr. Silver, responding to the Governor's speech with an appeal of his own, argued that the Governor's budget is an assault on the poor and middle class, and that the proposed tax cuts would help the rich. He embraces the restorations accepted in the State Senate and would go further, restoring cuts in Medicaid, welfare, mental health and programs for children. The Governor is understandably frustrated that Speaker Silver has avoided specifying exactly what he wants restored and where he would get the money to pay for it. The most obvious place to look for the revenues is in a scaled-back or deferred tax cut for next year.
After only three months in office, Mr. Pataki can already claim credit for changing the terms of debate in New York politics. He has forced everyone to discuss not whether but how much to cut spending. Few doubt that his extremely harsh cutbacks were intended as an opening proposal and that compromise will come sooner or later. Mr. Pataki can therefore compromise while still claiming a victory of principle and then turn to the job of privatizing state services and finding other ways to cut costs.
The fiscal year ends at midnight tonight, and the state cannot possibly enact a budget by then. Hopes are gone for approving the first budget on time in more than a decade. But there is still time for everyone to reach a broad agreement on principles signaling that the state is prepared to live within its means and still protect the sick, the elderly and the young.
